sn1.20:8.3	“Yes, good sir,” Venerable Samiddhi replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then he added:	sn1.20	8	3	sn	1.20	 With Samiddhi

sn1.41:4.1	What’s given has happiness as its fruit,	sn1.41	4	1	sn	1.41	 On Fire

sn2.16:2.1	“Like they’re struck by a sword,	sn2.16	2	1	sn	2.16	 With Vāsudatta

sn2.18:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāketa in the deer park at the Añjana Wood.	sn2.18	1	2	sn	2.18	 With Kakudha 
sn2.18:1.3	Then, late at night, the glorious god Kakudha, lighting up the entire Añjana Wood, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	sn2.18	1	3	sn	2.18	 With Kakudha 
sn2.18:1.4	“Do you delight, ascetic?”	sn2.18	1	4	sn	2.18	 With Kakudha

sn2.18:2.3	I hope that discontent doesn’t	sn2.18	2	3	sn	2.18	 With Kakudha

sn2.19:1.1	At Rājagaha.	sn2.19	1	1	sn	2.19	 With Uttara 
sn2.19:1.2	Standing to one side, the god Uttara recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence:	sn2.19	1	2	sn	2.19	 With Uttara 
sn2.19:2.1	“This life, so very short, is led onward.	sn2.19	2	1	sn	2.19	 With Uttara

sn2.19:3.3	Seeing this peril in death,	sn2.19	3	3	sn	2.19	 With Uttara 
sn2.19:3.4	a seeker of peace would drop the world’s bait.”	sn2.19	3	4	sn	2.19	 With Uttara 
sn2.20:1.1	Standing to one side, the god Anāthapiṇḍika recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence:	sn2.20	1	1	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:2.1	“This is indeed that Jeta’s Grove,	sn2.20	2	1	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:2.2	frequented by the Saṅgha of hermits,	sn2.20	2	2	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:2.3	where the King of Dhamma stayed:	sn2.20	2	3	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:2.4	it brings me joy!	sn2.20	2	4	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:3.1	Deeds, knowledge, and principle;	sn2.20	3	1	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:3.2	ethical conduct, an excellent livelihood;	sn2.20	3	2	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:3.3	by these are mortals purified,	sn2.20	3	3	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:3.4	not by clan or wealth.	sn2.20	3	4	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:4.1	That’s why an astute person,	sn2.20	4	1	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:4.2	seeing what’s good for themselves,	sn2.20	4	2	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:4.3	would examine the teaching rationally,	sn2.20	4	3	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:4.4	and thus be purified in it.	sn2.20	4	4	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:5.1	Sāriputta has true wisdom,	sn2.20	5	1	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:5.2	ethics, and also peace.	sn2.20	5	2	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:5.3	Any mendicant who has gone beyond	sn2.20	5	3	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:5.4	can at best equal him.”	sn2.20	5	4	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:6.1	This is what the god Anāthapiṇḍika said.	sn2.20	6	1	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:6.2	Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there.	sn2.20	6	2	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:7.1	Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:	sn2.20	7	1	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:7.2	“Mendicants, tonight, a certain glorious god, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, came to me, bowed, stood to one side,	sn2.20	7	2	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:7.3	and recited these verses in my presence.” The Buddha then repeated the verses in full.	sn2.20	7	3	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:13.1	When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,	sn2.20	13	1	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:13.2	“Sir, that god must surely have been Anāthapiṇḍika.	sn2.20	13	2	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:13.3	For the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was devoted to Venerable Sāriputta.”	sn2.20	13	3	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:13.4	“Good, good, Ānanda. You’ve reached the logical conclusion, as far as logic goes.	sn2.20	13	4	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.20:13.5	For that was indeed the god Anāthapiṇḍika.”	sn2.20	13	5	sn	2.20	 With Anāthapiṇḍika 
sn2.21:1.1	So I have heard.	sn2.21	1	1	sn	2.21	 With Shiva 
sn2.21:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	sn2.21	1	2	sn	2.21	 With Shiva 
sn2.21:1.3	Then, late at night, the glorious god Shiva, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side,	sn2.21	1	3	sn	2.21	 With Shiva 
sn2.21:1.4	and recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence:	sn2.21	1	4	sn	2.21	 With Shiva

sn2.23:8.2	I gave gifts at the four gates to ascetics and brahmins, to paupers, vagrants, travelers, and beggars.	sn2.23	8	2	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:8.3	Then the ladies of my harem approached me and said,	sn2.23	8	3	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:8.4	‘Your Majesty gives gifts, but we don’t.	sn2.23	8	4	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:8.5	Your Majesty, please support us to give gifts and make merit.’	sn2.23	8	5	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:8.6	Then it occurred to me,	sn2.23	8	6	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:8.7	‘I’m a giver, a donor, who praises giving.	sn2.23	8	7	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:8.8	When they say, “We would give gifts”, what am I to say?’	sn2.23	8	8	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:8.9	And so I gave the first gate to the ladies of my harem.	sn2.23	8	9	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:8.10	There they gave gifts, while my own giving dwindled.	sn2.23	8	10	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:9.1	Then my aristocrat vassals approached me and said,	sn2.23	9	1	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:9.2	‘Your Majesty gives gifts, the ladies of your harem give gifts, but we don’t.	sn2.23	9	2	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:9.3	Your Majesty, please support us to give gifts and make merit.’	sn2.23	9	3	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:9.4	Then it occurred to me,	sn2.23	9	4	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:9.5	‘I’m a giver, a donor, who praises giving.	sn2.23	9	5	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:9.6	When they say, “We would give gifts”, what am I to say?’	sn2.23	9	6	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:9.7	And so I gave the second gate to my aristocrat vassals.	sn2.23	9	7	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:9.8	There they gave gifts, while my own giving dwindled.	sn2.23	9	8	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:10.1	Then my troops approached me and said,	sn2.23	10	1	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:10.2	‘Your Majesty gives gifts, the ladies of your harem give gifts, your aristocrat vassals give gifts, but we don’t.	sn2.23	10	2	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:10.3	Your Majesty, please support us to give gifts and make merit.’	sn2.23	10	3	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:10.4	Then it occurred to me,	sn2.23	10	4	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:10.5	‘I’m a giver, a donor, who praises giving.	sn2.23	10	5	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:10.6	When they say, “We would give gifts”, what am I to say?’	sn2.23	10	6	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:10.7	And so I gave the third gate to my troops.	sn2.23	10	7	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:10.8	There they gave gifts, while my own giving dwindled.	sn2.23	10	8	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:11.1	Then my brahmins and householders approached me and said,	sn2.23	11	1	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:11.2	‘Your Majesty gives gifts, the ladies of your harem give gifts, your aristocrat vassals give gifts, your troops give gifts, but we don’t.	sn2.23	11	2	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:11.3	Your Majesty, please support us to give gifts and make merit.’	sn2.23	11	3	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:11.4	Then it occurred to me,	sn2.23	11	4	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:11.5	‘I’m a giver, a donor, who praises giving.	sn2.23	11	5	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:11.6	When they say, “We would give gifts”, what am I to say?’	sn2.23	11	6	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:11.7	And so I gave the fourth gate to my brahmins and householders.	sn2.23	11	7	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:11.8	There they gave gifts, while my own giving dwindled.	sn2.23	11	8	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:12.1	Then my men approached me and said,	sn2.23	12	1	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:12.2	‘Now Your Majesty is not giving gifts at all!’	sn2.23	12	2	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:12.3	When they said this, I said to those men,	sn2.23	12	3	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:12.4	‘So then, my men, send half of the revenue from the outer districts to the royal compound. Then give half right there to ascetics and brahmins, to paupers, vagrants, travelers, and beggars.’	sn2.23	12	4	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:12.5	Sir, for a long time I made so much merit and did so many skillful deeds. I never reached any limit so as to say	sn2.23	12	5	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:12.6	‘there’s this much merit’ or ‘there’s this much result of merit’ or ‘for so long I’ll remain in heaven’.	sn2.23	12	6	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:12.7	It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing,	sn2.23	12	7	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:12.8	how well said this was by Master Gotama:	sn2.23	12	8	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:13.1	‘Those who give with faith	sn2.23	13	1	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:13.2	and a clear and confident heart,	sn2.23	13	2	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:13.3	partake of food	sn2.23	13	3	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:13.4	in this world and the next.	sn2.23	13	4	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:14.1	So you should dispel stinginess,	sn2.23	14	1	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:14.2	overcoming that stain, and give a gift.	sn2.23	14	2	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:14.3	The good deeds of sentient beings	sn2.23	14	3	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.23:14.4	support them in the next world.’”	sn2.23	14	4	sn	2.23	 With Serī 
sn2.24:1.1	Standing to one side, the god Ghaṭikāra recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence:	sn2.24	1	1	sn	2.24	 With Ghaṭikāra 
sn2.24:2.1	“Seven mendicants reborn in Aviha	sn2.24	2	1	sn	2.24	 With Ghaṭikāra

sn2.24:3.3	Who, after leaving behind the human body,	sn2.24	3	3	sn	2.24	 With Ghaṭikāra

sn2.24:14.1	“That’s how it was	sn2.24	14	1	sn	2.24	 With Ghaṭikāra 
sn2.24:14.2	when those friends of old met again.	sn2.24	14	2	sn	2.24	 With Ghaṭikāra 
sn2.24:14.3	Both of them have developed themselves,	sn2.24	14	3	sn	2.24	 With Ghaṭikāra 
sn2.24:14.4	and bear their final body.”	sn2.24	14	4	sn	2.24	 With Ghaṭikāra 
sn2.25:1.1	So I have heard.	sn2.25	1	1	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.25:1.2	At one time several mendicants were staying in the Kosalan lands, in a wilderness hut on the slopes of the Himalayas. They were restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties.	sn2.25	1	2	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.25:2.1	Then on the fifteenth day sabbath the god Jantu went up to those mendicants and addressed them in verse:	sn2.25	2	1	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.25:3.1	“The mendicants used to live happily,	sn2.25	3	1	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.25:3.2	as disciples of Gotama.	sn2.25	3	2	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.25:3.3	Desireless they sought alms;	sn2.25	3	3	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.25:3.4	desireless they used their lodgings.	sn2.25	3	4	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.25:3.5	Knowing that the world was impermanent	sn2.25	3	5	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.25:3.6	they made an end of suffering.	sn2.25	3	6	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.25:4.1	But now they’ve made themselves hard to look after,	sn2.25	4	1	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.25:4.2	like chiefs in a village.	sn2.25	4	2	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.25:4.3	They eat and eat and then lie down,	sn2.25	4	3	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.25:4.4	unconscious in the homes of others.	sn2.25	4	4	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.25:5.1	Having raised my joined palms to the Saṅgha,	sn2.25	5	1	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.25:5.2	I speak here only about certain people.	sn2.25	5	2	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.25:5.3	They’re rejects, with no protector,	sn2.25	5	3	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.25:5.4	just like those who have passed away.	sn2.25	5	4	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.25:6.1	I’m speaking about	sn2.25	6	1	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.25:6.2	those who live negligently.	sn2.25	6	2	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.25:6.3	To those who live diligently	sn2.25	6	3	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.25:6.4	I pay homage.”	sn2.25	6	4	sn	2.25	 With Jantu 
sn2.26:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	sn2.26	1	1	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:1.2	Standing to one side, the god Rohitassa said to the Buddha:	sn2.26	1	2	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:1.3	“Sir, is it possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn?”	sn2.26	1	3	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:1.4	“Reverend, I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.”	sn2.26	1	4	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:2.1	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing,	sn2.26	2	1	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:2.2	how well said this was by Master Gotama.	sn2.26	2	2	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:3.1	Once upon a time, I was a hermit called Rohitassa, son of Bhoja. I was a sky-walker with psychic power.	sn2.26	3	1	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:3.2	I was as fast as a light arrow easily shot across the shadow of a palm tree by a well-trained expert archer with a strong bow.	sn2.26	3	2	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:3.3	My stride was such that it could span from the eastern ocean to the western ocean.	sn2.26	3	3	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:3.4	This wish came to me:	sn2.26	3	4	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:3.5	‘I will reach the end of the world by traveling.’	sn2.26	3	5	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:3.6	Having such speed and stride, I traveled for my whole lifespan of a hundred years—pausing only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness—and I passed away along the way, never reaching the end of the world.	sn2.26	3	6	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:4.1	It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing,	sn2.26	4	1	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:4.2	how well said this was by Master Gotama:	sn2.26	4	2	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:4.3	‘Reverend, I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.’”	sn2.26	4	3	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:5.1	“But Reverend, I also say there’s no making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world.	sn2.26	5	1	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:5.2	For it is in this fathom-long carcass with its perception and mind that I describe the world, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.	sn2.26	5	2	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:6.1	The end of the world can never	sn2.26	6	1	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:6.2	be reached by traveling.	sn2.26	6	2	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:6.3	But without reaching the end of the world,	sn2.26	6	3	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:6.4	there’s no release from suffering.	sn2.26	6	4	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:7.1	So a clever person, understanding the world,	sn2.26	7	1	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:7.2	has completed the spiritual journey, and gone to the end of the world.	sn2.26	7	2	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:7.3	A peaceful one, knowing the end of the world,	sn2.26	7	3	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.26:7.4	does not hope for this world or the next.”	sn2.26	7	4	sn	2.26	 With Rohitassa 
sn2.27:1.1	Standing to one side, the god Nanda recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence:	sn2.27	1	1	sn	2.27	 With Nanda 
sn2.27:2.1	“Time flies, nights pass by,	sn2.27	2	1	sn	2.27	 With Nanda 
sn2.27:2.2	the stages of life leave us one by one.	sn2.27	2	2	sn	2.27	 With Nanda 
sn2.27:2.3	Seeing this peril in death,	sn2.27	2	3	sn	2.27	 With Nanda 
sn2.27:2.4	you should do good deeds that bring happiness.”	sn2.27	2	4	sn	2.27	 With Nanda 
sn2.27:3.1	“Time flies, nights pass by,	sn2.27	3	1	sn	2.27	 With Nanda 
sn2.27:3.2	the stages of life leave us one by one.	sn2.27	3	2	sn	2.27	 With Nanda 
sn2.27:3.3	Seeing this peril in death,	sn2.27	3	3	sn	2.27	 With Nanda 
sn2.27:3.4	one looking for peace would drop the world’s bait.”	sn2.27	3	4	sn	2.27	 With Nanda 
sn2.28:1.1	Standing to one side, the god Nandivisāla addressed the Buddha in verse:	sn2.28	1	1	sn	2.28	 With Nandivisāla 
sn2.28:2.1	“Four are its wheels, and nine its doors;	sn2.28	2	1	sn	2.28	 With Nandivisāla 
sn2.28:2.2	it’s filled with greed and tied up;	sn2.28	2	2	sn	2.28	 With Nandivisāla 
sn2.28:2.3	and it’s born from a bog. Great hero,	sn2.28	2	3	sn	2.28	 With Nandivisāla 
sn2.28:2.4	how am I supposed to live like this?”	sn2.28	2	4	sn	2.28	 With Nandivisāla 
sn2.28:3.1	“Having cut the strap and harness—	sn2.28	3	1	sn	2.28	 With Nandivisāla 
sn2.28:3.2	wicked desire and greed—	sn2.28	3	2	sn	2.28	 With Nandivisāla 
sn2.28:3.3	and having plucked out craving, root and all:	sn2.28	3	3	sn	2.28	 With Nandivisāla

sn2.29:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	sn2.29	1	1	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:1.2	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	sn2.29	1	2	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:1.3	“Ānanda, do you like Sāriputta?”	sn2.29	1	3	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:2.1	“Sir, who on earth would not like Venerable Sāriputta unless they’re a fool, a hater, delusional, or mentally deranged?	sn2.29	2	1	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:2.2	Venerable Sāriputta is astute,	sn2.29	2	2	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:2.3	he has great wisdom,	sn2.29	2	3	sn	2.29	 With Susīma

sn2.29:2.8	and penetrating wisdom.	sn2.29	2	8	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:2.9	He has few wishes,	sn2.29	2	9	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:2.10	he’s content,	sn2.29	2	10	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:2.11	secluded,	sn2.29	2	11	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:2.12	aloof,	sn2.29	2	12	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:2.13	and energetic.	sn2.29	2	13	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:2.14	He gives advice	sn2.29	2	14	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:2.15	and accepts advice;	sn2.29	2	15	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:2.16	he accuses	sn2.29	2	16	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:2.17	and criticizes wickedness.	sn2.29	2	17	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:2.18	Who on earth would not like Venerable Sāriputta unless they’re a fool, a hater, delusional, or mentally deranged?”	sn2.29	2	18	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:3.1	“That’s so true, Ānanda! That’s so true!	sn2.29	3	1	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:3.2	Who on earth would not like Venerable Sāriputta unless they’re a fool, a hater, delusional, or mentally deranged?”	sn2.29	3	2	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:3.3	And the Buddha repeated all of Ānanda’s terms of praise.	sn2.29	3	3	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:4.1	While this praise of Sāriputta was being spoken, the god Susīma approached the Buddha, escorted by a large assembly of gods. He bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:	sn2.29	4	1	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:5.1	“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!	sn2.29	5	1	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:5.2	Who on earth would not like Venerable Sāriputta unless they’re a fool, a hater, delusional, or mentally deranged?”	sn2.29	5	2	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:5.3	And he too repeated all the terms of praise of Sāriputta, adding,	sn2.29	5	3	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:6.1	“For I too, sir, whenever I go to an assembly of gods, frequently hear the same terms of praise.”	sn2.29	6	1	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:7.1	While this praise of Sāriputta was being spoken, the gods of Susīma’s assembly—uplifted and overjoyed, full of rapture and happiness—generated a rainbow of bright colors.	sn2.29	7	1	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:8.1	Suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked. When placed on a cream rug it would shine and glow and radiate.	sn2.29	8	1	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:8.2	In the same way, the gods of Susīma’s assembly generated a rainbow of bright colors.	sn2.29	8	2	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:9.1	Suppose there was a pendant of river gold, fashioned by an expert smith, well wrought in the forge. When placed on a cream rug it would shine and glow and radiate.	sn2.29	9	1	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:9.2	In the same way, the gods of Susīma’s assembly generated a rainbow of bright colors.	sn2.29	9	2	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:10.1	Suppose that after the rainy season the sky was clear and cloudless. At the crack of dawn, the Morning Star shines and glows and radiates.	sn2.29	10	1	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:10.2	In the same way, the gods of Susīma’s assembly generated a rainbow of bright colors.	sn2.29	10	2	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:11.1	Suppose that after the rainy season the sky was clear and cloudless. As the sun rises, it would dispel all the darkness from the sky as it shines and glows and radiates.	sn2.29	11	1	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:11.2	In the same way, the gods of Susīma’s assembly generated a rainbow of bright colors.	sn2.29	11	2	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:12.1	Then the god Susīma recited this verse about Venerable Sāriputta in the Buddha’s presence:	sn2.29	12	1	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:13.1	“He’s considered astute,	sn2.29	13	1	sn	2.29	 With Susīma

sn2.29:13.4	the hermit shines in the Teacher’s praise!”	sn2.29	13	4	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:14.1	Then the Buddha replied to Susīma with this verse about Venerable Sāriputta:	sn2.29	14	1	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:15.1	“He’s considered astute,	sn2.29	15	1	sn	2.29	 With Susīma

sn2.29:15.3	Few in wishes, sweet, tamed;	sn2.29	15	3	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.29:15.4	developed and well-tamed, he bides his time.”	sn2.29	15	4	sn	2.29	 With Susīma 
sn2.30:1.1	So I have heard.	sn2.30	1	1	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	sn2.30	1	2	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:1.3	Then, late at night, several glorious gods lit up the entire Bamboo Grove. They were Asama, Sahalī, Niṅka, Ākoṭaka, Vetambarī, and Māṇavagāmiya, and all of them were disciples of various sectarian teachers. They went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side.	sn2.30	1	3	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:1.4	Standing to one side, the god Asama recited this verse about Pūraṇa Kassapa in the Buddha’s presence:	sn2.30	1	4	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:2.1	“In injuring and killing here,	sn2.30	2	1	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:2.2	in beating and extortion,	sn2.30	2	2	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:2.3	Kassapa saw no evil,	sn2.30	2	3	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:2.4	nor any merit for oneself.	sn2.30	2	4	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:2.5	What he taught should truly be trusted,	sn2.30	2	5	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:2.6	he’s worthy of esteem as Teacher.”	sn2.30	2	6	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:3.1	Then the god Sahalī recited this verse about Makkhali Gosala in the Buddha’s presence:	sn2.30	3	1	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:4.1	“Through mortification in disgust of sin he became well restrained.	sn2.30	4	1	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:4.2	He gave up arguing with people.	sn2.30	4	2	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:4.3	Refraining from false speech, he spoke the truth.	sn2.30	4	3	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:4.4	Surely such a man does no wrong!”	sn2.30	4	4	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:5.1	Then the god Niṅka recited this verse about Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta in the Buddha’s presence:	sn2.30	5	1	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:6.1	“Disgusted at sin, an alert mendicant,	sn2.30	6	1	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:6.2	well restrained in the four controls;	sn2.30	6	2	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:6.3	explaining what is seen and heard:	sn2.30	6	3	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:6.4	surely he can be no sinner!”	sn2.30	6	4	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:7.1	Then the god Ākoṭaka recited this verse about various sectarian teachers in the Buddha’s presence:	sn2.30	7	1	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:8.1	“Pakudhaka, Kātiyāna, and Nigaṇṭha,	sn2.30	8	1	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:8.2	as well as this Makkhali and Pūraṇa:	sn2.30	8	2	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:8.3	Teachers of communities, attained ascetics,	sn2.30	8	3	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:8.4	surely they weren’t far from truly good men!”	sn2.30	8	4	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:9.1	Then the god Vetambarī replied to the god Ākoṭaka in verse:	sn2.30	9	1	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:10.1	“Though the wretched jackal howls along,	sn2.30	10	1	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:10.2	it never equals the lion.	sn2.30	10	2	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:10.3	A naked liar with suspicious conduct,	sn2.30	10	3	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:10.4	though they teach a community, doesn’t resemble the good.”	sn2.30	10	4	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:11.1	Then Māra the Wicked took possession of the god Vetambarī and recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence:	sn2.30	11	1	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:12.1	“Those dedicated to mortification in disgust of sin,	sn2.30	12	1	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:12.2	safeguarding their seclusion,	sn2.30	12	2	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:12.3	attached to form,	sn2.30	12	3	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:12.4	they rejoice in the heavenly realm.	sn2.30	12	4	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:12.5	Indeed, those mortals give correct instructions	sn2.30	12	5	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:12.6	regarding the next world.”	sn2.30	12	6	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:13.1	Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse:	sn2.30	13	1	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:14.1	“Whatever forms there are in this world or the world beyond,	sn2.30	14	1	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:14.2	and those of shining beauty in the sky,	sn2.30	14	2	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:14.3	all of these you praise, Namuci,	sn2.30	14	3	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:14.4	like bait tossed out for catching fish.”	sn2.30	14	4	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:15.1	Then the god Māṇavagāmiya recited this verse about the Buddha in his presence:	sn2.30	15	1	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:16.1	“Of all the mountains of Rājagaha,	sn2.30	16	1	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:16.2	Vipula’s said to be the best.	sn2.30	16	2	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:16.3	Seta is the best of the Himalayan peaks,	sn2.30	16	3	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians

sn2.30:17.2	and the moon, of lights that shine at night.	sn2.30	17	2	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:17.3	But in all the world with its gods,	sn2.30	17	3	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:17.4	the Buddha is declared foremost.”	sn2.30	17	4	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn2.30:18.5	The Linked Discourses on Gods are complete.	sn2.30	18	5	sn	2.30	 The Disciples of Various Sectarians 
sn3.1:1.1	So I have heard.	sn3.1	1	1	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	sn3.1	1	2	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:1.3	Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	sn3.1	1	3	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,	sn3.1	1	4	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:1.5	“Does Master Gotama claim to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening?”	sn3.1	1	5	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:1.6	“If anyone should rightly be said to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening, it’s me.	sn3.1	1	6	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:1.7	For, great king, I have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening.”	sn3.1	1	7	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:2.1	“Well, there are those ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community, and teach a community. They’re well-known and famous religious founders, regarded as holy by many people. That is,	sn3.1	2	1	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:2.2	Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, Pakudha Kaccāyana, and Ajita Kesakambala.	sn3.1	2	2	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:2.3	I also asked them whether they claimed to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening, but they made no such claim.	sn3.1	2	3	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:2.4	So why do you, given that you’re so young in age and newly gone forth?”	sn3.1	2	4	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:3.1	“Great king, these four things should not be looked down upon or disparaged because they are young.	sn3.1	3	1	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:3.2	What four?	sn3.1	3	2	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:3.3	An aristocrat,	sn3.1	3	3	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:3.4	a snake,	sn3.1	3	4	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:3.5	a fire,	sn3.1	3	5	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:3.6	and a mendicant.	sn3.1	3	6	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:3.7	These four things should not be looked down upon or disparaged because they are young.”	sn3.1	3	7	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:4.1	That is what the Buddha said.	sn3.1	4	1	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:4.2	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	sn3.1	4	2	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:5.1	“A man should not despise	sn3.1	5	1	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:5.2	an aristocrat of impeccable lineage,	sn3.1	5	2	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:5.3	high-born and famous,	sn3.1	5	3	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:5.4	just because they’re young.	sn3.1	5	4	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:6.1	For it’s possible that that lord of men,	sn3.1	6	1	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:6.2	as aristocrat, will gain the throne.	sn3.1	6	2	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:6.3	And in his anger he’ll execute a royal punishment,	sn3.1	6	3	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:6.4	and have you violently beaten.	sn3.1	6	4	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:6.5	Hence you should avoid him	sn3.1	6	5	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:6.6	for the sake of your own life.	sn3.1	6	6	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:7.1	Whether in village or wilderness,	sn3.1	7	1	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:7.2	wherever a serpent is seen,	sn3.1	7	2	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:7.3	a man should not look down on it	sn3.1	7	3	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:7.4	or despise it for its youth.	sn3.1	7	4	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:8.1	With its rainbow of colors,	sn3.1	8	1	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:8.2	the snake of fiery breath glides along.	sn3.1	8	2	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:8.3	It lashes out and bites the fool,	sn3.1	8	3	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:8.4	both men and women alike.	sn3.1	8	4	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:8.5	Hence you should avoid it	sn3.1	8	5	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:8.6	for the sake of your own life.	sn3.1	8	6	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:9.1	A fire devours a huge amount,	sn3.1	9	1	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:9.2	a conflagration with a blackened trail.	sn3.1	9	2	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:9.3	A man should not look down on it	sn3.1	9	3	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:9.4	just because it’s young.	sn3.1	9	4	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:10.1	For once it gets fuel	sn3.1	10	1	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:10.2	it’ll become a huge conflagration.	sn3.1	10	2	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:10.3	It’ll lash out and burn the fool,	sn3.1	10	3	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:10.4	both men and women alike.	sn3.1	10	4	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:10.5	Hence you should avoid it	sn3.1	10	5	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:10.6	for the sake of your own life.	sn3.1	10	6	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:11.1	When a forest is burned by fire,	sn3.1	11	1	sn	3.1	 Young

sn3.1:11.3	the shoots will spring up there again,	sn3.1	11	3	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:11.4	with the passing of the days and nights.	sn3.1	11	4	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:12.1	But if a mendicant endowed with ethics	sn3.1	12	1	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:12.2	burns you with their power,	sn3.1	12	2	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:12.3	you’ll have no sons or cattle,	sn3.1	12	3	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:12.4	nor will your heirs find wealth.	sn3.1	12	4	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:12.5	Childless and heirless you become,	sn3.1	12	5	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:12.6	like a palm-tree stump.	sn3.1	12	6	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:13.1	That’s why an astute person,	sn3.1	13	1	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:13.2	seeing what’s good for themselves,	sn3.1	13	2	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:13.3	would always treat these properly:	sn3.1	13	3	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:13.4	a snake, a conflagration,	sn3.1	13	4	sn	3.1	 Young

sn3.1:13.6	and a mendicant endowed with ethics.”	sn3.1	13	6	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:14.1	When this was said, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Buddha,	sn3.1	14	1	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:14.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent!	sn3.1	14	2	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:14.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.	sn3.1	14	3	sn	3.1	 Young 
sn3.1:14.4	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	sn3.1	14	4	sn	3.1	 Young

sn3.11:5.4	You can get to know a person’s wisdom by discussion. But only after a long time, not casually; only when paying attention, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless.”	sn3.11	5	4	sn	3.11	 Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics 
sn3.11:6.1	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing,	sn3.11	6	1	sn	3.11	 Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics 
sn3.11:6.2	how well said this was by the Buddha. …	sn3.11	6	2	sn	3.11	 Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics 
sn3.11:7.1	Sir, these are my spies, my undercover agents returning after spying on the country.	sn3.11	7	1	sn	3.11	 Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics

sn3.11:7.3	And now—when they have washed off the dust and dirt, and are nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed, and dressed in white—they will amuse themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.”	sn3.11	7	3	sn	3.11	 Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics 
sn3.11:8.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha recited these verses:	sn3.11	8	1	sn	3.11	 Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics 
sn3.11:9.1	“It’s not easy to know a man by his appearance.	sn3.11	9	1	sn	3.11	 Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics

sn3.12:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	sn3.12	1	1	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:1.2	Now at that time five kings headed by Pasenadi were amusing themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, and this discussion came up among them:	sn3.12	1	2	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:1.3	“What’s the best of sensual pleasures?”	sn3.12	1	3	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:1.4	Some of them said,	sn3.12	1	4	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:1.5	“Sights are the best of sensual pleasures!”	sn3.12	1	5	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:1.6	Others said,	sn3.12	1	6	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:1.7	“Sounds are best!”	sn3.12	1	7	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:1.8	Others said,	sn3.12	1	8	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:1.9	“Smells are best!”	sn3.12	1	9	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:1.10	Others said,	sn3.12	1	10	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:1.11	“Tastes are best!”	sn3.12	1	11	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:1.12	Others said,	sn3.12	1	12	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:1.13	“Touches are best!”	sn3.12	1	13	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:1.14	Since those kings were unable to persuade each other,	sn3.12	1	14	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:2.1	King Pasenadi said to them,	sn3.12	2	1	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:2.2	“Come, good sirs, let’s go to the Buddha and ask him about this.	sn3.12	2	2	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:2.3	As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”	sn3.12	2	3	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:2.4	“Yes, dear sir,” replied those kings.	sn3.12	2	4	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:3.1	Then those five kings headed by Pasenadi went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. King Pasenadi reported their conversation to the Buddha, and said,	sn3.12	3	1	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:3.14	“Sir, what’s the best of sensual pleasures?”	sn3.12	3	14	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:4.1	“Great king, which kind of sensual stimulation is best is defined by which is most agreeable, I say.	sn3.12	4	1	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:4.2	The very same sights that are agreeable to some are disagreeable to others.	sn3.12	4	2	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:4.3	When you’re happy with certain sights, as you’ve got all you wished for, you don’t want any other sight that’s better or finer.	sn3.12	4	3	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:4.4	For you, those sights are perfect	sn3.12	4	4	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:4.5	and supreme.	sn3.12	4	5	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:5.1	The very same sounds …	sn3.12	5	1	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:6.1	smells …	sn3.12	6	1	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:7.1	tastes …	sn3.12	7	1	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:8.1	touches that are agreeable to some are disagreeable to others.	sn3.12	8	1	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:8.2	When you’re happy with certain touches, as you’ve got all you wished for, you don’t want any other touch that’s better or finer.	sn3.12	8	2	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:8.3	For you, those touches are perfect	sn3.12	8	3	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:8.4	and supreme.”	sn3.12	8	4	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:9.1	Now at that time the lay follower Candanaṅgalika was sitting in that assembly.	sn3.12	9	1	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:9.2	Then he got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,	sn3.12	9	2	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:9.3	“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!”	sn3.12	9	3	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:9.4	“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha.	sn3.12	9	4	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:10.1	Then the lay follower Candanaṅgalika extolled the Buddha in his presence with an appropriate verse:	sn3.12	10	1	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:11.1	“Like a fragrant pink lotus	sn3.12	11	1	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:11.2	that blooms in the morning, its fragrance unfaded—	sn3.12	11	2	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:11.3	see Aṅgīrasa shine,	sn3.12	11	3	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:11.4	bright as the sun in the sky!”	sn3.12	11	4	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:12.1	Then those five kings clothed Candanaṅgalika with five upper robes.	sn3.12	12	1	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.12:12.2	And Candanaṅgalika in turn endowed the Buddha with those robes.	sn3.12	12	2	sn	3.12	 Five Kings 
sn3.13:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	sn3.13	1	1	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.13:1.2	Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala used to eat rice by the bucket.	sn3.13	1	2	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.13:1.3	Then after eating King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, huffing and puffing. He bowed and sat down to one side.	sn3.13	1	3	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.13:2.1	Then, knowing that King Pasenadi was huffing and puffing after eating, on that occasion the Buddha recited this verse:	sn3.13	2	1	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.13:3.1	“When a man is always mindful,	sn3.13	3	1	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.13:3.2	knowing moderation in eating,	sn3.13	3	2	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.13:3.3	his discomfort diminishes,	sn3.13	3	3	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.13:3.4	and he ages slowly, taking care of his life.”	sn3.13	3	4	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.13:4.1	Now at that time the brahmin student Sudassana was standing behind the king.	sn3.13	4	1	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.13:4.2	Then King Pasenadi addressed him,	sn3.13	4	2	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.13:4.3	“Please, dear Sudassana, memorize this verse in the Buddha’s presence and recite it to me whenever I am presented with a meal.	sn3.13	4	3	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.13:4.4	I’ll set up a regular daily allowance of a hundred dollars for you.”	sn3.13	4	4	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.13:4.5	“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Sudassana. He memorized that verse in the Buddha’s presence, and then whenever the king was presented with a meal he would repeat it:	sn3.13	4	5	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.13:5.1	“When a man is always mindful,	sn3.13	5	1	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.13:5.2	knowing moderation in eating,	sn3.13	5	2	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.13:5.3	his discomfort diminishes,	sn3.13	5	3	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.13:5.4	and he ages slowly, taking care of his life.”	sn3.13	5	4	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.13:6.1	Then the king gradually got used to having no more than a pint of rice.	sn3.13	6	1	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.13:6.2	After some time King Pasenadi’s body slimmed right down. Stroking his limbs with his hands, at that time he expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	sn3.13	6	2	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.13:6.3	“In both ways the Buddha has compassion for me:	sn3.13	6	3	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.13:6.4	in the good of the present life and the good of the next.”	sn3.13	6	4	sn	3.13	 A Bucket of Rice 
sn3.14:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	sn3.14	1	1	sn	3.14	 Battle (1st) 
sn3.14:1.2	Then King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to Kāsi to attack King Pasenadi of Kosala.	sn3.14	1	2	sn	3.14	 Battle (1st) 
sn3.14:1.3	When King Pasenadi heard of this,	sn3.14	1	3	sn	3.14	 Battle (1st) 
sn3.14:1.5	he mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to Kāsi to defend it against Ajātasattu.	sn3.14	1	5	sn	3.14	 Battle (1st) 
sn3.14:1.6	Then the two kings met in battle.	sn3.14	1	6	sn	3.14	 Battle (1st) 
sn3.14:1.7	And in that battle Ajātasattu defeated Pasenadi,	sn3.14	1	7	sn	3.14	 Battle (1st) 
sn3.14:1.8	who withdrew to his own capital at Sāvatthī.	sn3.14	1	8	sn	3.14	 Battle (1st) 
sn3.14:2.1	Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	sn3.14	2	1	sn	3.14	 Battle (1st) 
sn3.14:2.2	Then, after the meal, when they returned from alms-round, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then the Buddha said:	sn3.14	2	2	sn	3.14	 Battle (1st) 
sn3.14:4.1	“Mendicants, King Ajātasattu has bad friends, companions, and associates.	sn3.14	4	1	sn	3.14	 Battle (1st) 
sn3.14:4.2	But King Pasenadi has good friends, companions, and associates.	sn3.14	4	2	sn	3.14	 Battle (1st) 
sn3.14:4.3	Yet on this day King Pasenadi will have a bad night’s sleep as one defeated.”	sn3.14	4	3	sn	3.14	 Battle (1st) 
sn3.14:4.4	That is what the Buddha said. …	sn3.14	4	4	sn	3.14	 Battle (1st) 
sn3.14:5.1	“Victory breeds enmity;	sn3.14	5	1	sn	3.14	 Battle (1st) 
sn3.14:5.2	the defeated sleep badly.	sn3.14	5	2	sn	3.14	 Battle (1st) 
sn3.14:5.3	The peaceful sleep at ease,	sn3.14	5	3	sn	3.14	 Battle (1st) 
sn3.14:5.4	having left victory and defeat behind.”	sn3.14	5	4	sn	3.14	 Battle (1st) 
sn3.15:1.1	Then King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to Kāsi to attack King Pasenadi of Kosala.	sn3.15	1	1	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:1.2	When King Pasenadi heard of this,	sn3.15	1	2	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:1.4	he mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to Kāsi to defend it against Ajātasattu.	sn3.15	1	4	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:1.5	Then the two kings met in battle.	sn3.15	1	5	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:1.6	And in that battle Pasenadi defeated Ajātasattu and captured him alive.	sn3.15	1	6	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:1.7	Then King Pasenadi thought,	sn3.15	1	7	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:1.8	“Even though I’ve never betrayed this King Ajātasattu, he betrayed me. Still, he is my nephew.	sn3.15	1	8	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:1.9	Now that I’ve vanquished all of Ajātasattu’s elephant troops, cavalry, chariots, and infantry, why don’t I let him loose with just his life?”	sn3.15	1	9	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:2.1	And that’s what he did.	sn3.15	2	1	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:3.1	Then several mendicants …	sn3.15	3	1	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:3.2	told the Buddha what had happened.	sn3.15	3	2	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:6.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha recited these verses:	sn3.15	6	1	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:7.1	“A man goes on plundering	sn3.15	7	1	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:7.2	as long as it serves his ends.	sn3.15	7	2	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:7.3	But as soon as others plunder him,	sn3.15	7	3	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:7.4	the plunderer is plundered.	sn3.15	7	4	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd)

sn3.15:8.2	so long as their wickedness has not ripened.	sn3.15	8	2	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:8.3	But as soon as that wickedness ripens,	sn3.15	8	3	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:8.4	they fall into suffering.	sn3.15	8	4	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:9.1	A killer creates a killer;	sn3.15	9	1	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd)

sn3.15:9.3	an abuser creates abuse,	sn3.15	9	3	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:9.4	and a bully creates a bully.	sn3.15	9	4	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:9.5	And so as deeds unfold	sn3.15	9	5	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.15:9.6	the plunderer is plundered.”	sn3.15	9	6	sn	3.15	 Battle (2nd) 
sn3.16:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	sn3.16	1	1	sn	3.16	 A Daughter 
sn3.16:1.2	Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.	sn3.16	1	2	sn	3.16	 A Daughter 
sn3.16:1.3	Then a man went up to the king and whispered in his ear,	sn3.16	1	3	sn	3.16	 A Daughter 
sn3.16:1.4	“Your Majesty, Queen Mallikā has given birth to a daughter.”	sn3.16	1	4	sn	3.16	 A Daughter 
sn3.16:1.5	When this was said, King Pasenadi was disappointed.	sn3.16	1	5	sn	3.16	 A Daughter 
sn3.16:2.1	Then, knowing that King Pasenadi was disappointed, on that occasion the Buddha recited these verses:	sn3.16	2	1	sn	3.16	 A Daughter 
sn3.16:3.1	“Well, some women are better than men,	sn3.16	3	1	sn	3.16	 A Daughter

sn3.18:4.4	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path.	sn3.18	4	4	sn	3.18	 Good Friends 
sn3.18:5.1	And how does a mendicant with good friends develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path?	sn3.18	5	1	sn	3.18	 Good Friends 
sn3.18:5.2	It’s when a mendicant develops right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.	sn3.18	5	2	sn	3.18	 Good Friends

sn3.18:5.4	And here’s another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life.	sn3.18	5	4	sn	3.18	 Good Friends 
sn3.18:6.1	For, by relying on me as a good friend, sentient beings who are liable to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are freed from all these things.	sn3.18	6	1	sn	3.18	 Good Friends

sn4.18:2.2	Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and said to him,	sn4.18	2	2	sn	4.18	 Alms Food 
sn4.18:2.3	“Well, ascetic, did you get any alms?”	sn4.18	2	3	sn	4.18	 Alms Food 
sn4.18:2.4	“Wicked One, did you make sure I didn’t get any alms?”	sn4.18	2	4	sn	4.18	 Alms Food 
sn4.18:2.5	“Well then, sir, let the Buddha enter Pañcasālā a second time for alms.	sn4.18	2	5	sn	4.18	 Alms Food 
sn4.18:2.6	I’ll make sure you get alms.”	sn4.18	2	6	sn	4.18	 Alms Food 
sn4.18:3.1	“Māra’s made bad karma	sn4.18	3	1	sn	4.18	 Alms Food

sn4.18:3.3	Wicked One, do you imagine that	sn4.18	3	3	sn	4.18	 Alms Food 
sn4.18:3.4	your wickedness won’t bear fruit?	sn4.18	3	4	sn	4.18	 Alms Food 
sn4.18:4.1	Let us live so very happily,	sn4.18	4	1	sn	4.18	 Alms Food 
sn4.18:4.2	we who have nothing.	sn4.18	4	2	sn	4.18	 Alms Food 
sn4.18:4.3	We shall feed on rapture,	sn4.18	4	3	sn	4.18	 Alms Food 
sn4.18:4.4	like the gods of streaming radiance.”	sn4.18	4	4	sn	4.18	 Alms Food 
sn4.18:5.1	Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there.	sn4.18	5	1	sn	4.18	 Alms Food 
sn4.19:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	sn4.19	1	1	sn	4.19	 A Farmer 
sn4.19:1.2	Now at that time the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about extinguishment.	sn4.19	1	2	sn	4.19	 A Farmer 
sn4.19:1.3	And those mendicants were paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear.	sn4.19	1	3	sn	4.19	 A Farmer 
sn4.19:2.1	Then Māra thought,	sn4.19	2	1	sn	4.19	 A Farmer 
sn4.19:2.2	“The ascetic Gotama is giving a Dhamma talk about extinguishment … and the mendicants are listening well.	sn4.19	2	2	sn	4.19	 A Farmer 
sn4.19:2.3	Why don’t I go and pull the wool over their eyes?”	sn4.19	2	3	sn	4.19	 A Farmer 
sn4.19:2.4	Then Māra the Wicked manifested in the form of a farmer carrying a large plough on his shoulder. He held a long goad, his hair was messy, he was clad in sunn hemp, and his feet were muddy. He went up to the Buddha and said to him,	sn4.19	2	4	sn	4.19	 A Farmer 
sn4.19:2.5	“So, ascetic, did you happen to see any oxen?”	sn4.19	2	5	sn	4.19	 A Farmer 
sn4.19:2.6	“But what have you to do with oxen, Wicked One?”	sn4.19	2	6	sn	4.19	 A Farmer 
sn4.19:2.7	“Mine alone, ascetic, is the eye, mine are sights, mine is the field of eye contact consciousness.	sn4.19	2	7	sn	4.19	 A Farmer

sn4.19:5.4	you won’t even see the path I take.”	sn4.19	5	4	sn	4.19	 A Farmer 
sn4.19:6.1	Then Māra … vanished right there.	sn4.19	6	1	sn	4.19	 A Farmer 
sn4.20:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans, in a wilderness hut on the slopes of the Himalayas.	sn4.20	1	1	sn	4.20	 Ruling 
sn4.20:1.2	Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	sn4.20	1	2	sn	4.20	 Ruling 
sn4.20:1.3	“I wonder if it’s possible to rule legitimately, without killing or having someone kill for you; without conquering or having someone conquer for you; without sorrowing or causing sorrow?”	sn4.20	1	3	sn	4.20	 Ruling 
sn4.20:2.1	And then Māra the Wicked, knowing what the Buddha was thinking, went up to him and said,	sn4.20	2	1	sn	4.20	 Ruling 
sn4.20:2.2	“Rule, Blessed One! Rule, Holy One! Rule legitimately, without killing or having someone kill for you; without conquering or having someone conquer for you; without sorrowing or causing sorrow!”	sn4.20	2	2	sn	4.20	 Ruling 
sn4.20:2.3	“But what do you see, Wicked One, that you say this to me?”	sn4.20	2	3	sn	4.20	 Ruling 
sn4.20:2.5	“The Blessed One, sir, has developed and cultivated the four bases for psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them.	sn4.20	2	5	sn	4.20	 Ruling 
sn4.20:2.6	If he wished, the Blessed One need only determine that the Himalaya, king of mountains, was gold, and it would turn into gold.”	sn4.20	2	6	sn	4.20	 Ruling 
sn4.20:3.1	“Take a golden mountain,	sn4.20	3	1	sn	4.20	 Ruling

sn4.20:3.3	it’s still not enough for one!	sn4.20	3	3	sn	4.20	 Ruling 
sn4.20:3.4	Knowing this, live a moral life.	sn4.20	3	4	sn	4.20	 Ruling 
sn4.20:4.1	When a person has seen where suffering comes from	sn4.20	4	1	sn	4.20	 Ruling

sn4.20:5.1	Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there.	sn4.20	5	1	sn	4.20	 Ruling 
sn4.21:1.1	So I have heard.	sn4.21	1	1	sn	4.21	 Several 
sn4.21:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Silāvatī.	sn4.21	1	2	sn	4.21	 Several 
sn4.21:1.3	Now at that time several mendicants were meditating not far from the Buddha, diligent, keen, and resolute.	sn4.21	1	3	sn	4.21	 Several 
sn4.21:1.4	Then Māra the Wicked manifested in the form of a brahmin with a large matted dreadlock, wearing an antelope hide. He was old, bent double, wheezing, and held a staff made of cluster fig tree wood. He went up to those mendicants and said,	sn4.21	1	4	sn	4.21	 Several 
sn4.21:1.5	“You’ve gone forth while young, reverends. You’re black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life, and you’ve never flirted with sensual pleasures.	sn4.21	1	5	sn	4.21	 Several 
sn4.21:1.6	Enjoy human sensual pleasures.	sn4.21	1	6	sn	4.21	 Several 
sn4.21:1.7	Don’t give up what is visible in the present to chase after what takes effect over time.”	sn4.21	1	7	sn	4.21	 Several 
sn4.21:1.8	“Brahmin, that’s not what we’re doing.	sn4.21	1	8	sn	4.21	 Several 
sn4.21:1.9	We’re giving up what takes effect over time to chase after what is visible in the present.	sn4.21	1	9	sn	4.21	 Several 
sn4.21:1.10	For the Buddha says that sensual pleasures take effect over time; they give much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.	sn4.21	1	10	sn	4.21	 Several 
sn4.21:1.11	But this teaching is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.”	sn4.21	1	11	sn	4.21	 Several 
sn4.21:1.12	When they had spoken, Māra the Wicked shook his head, waggled his tongue, raised his eyebrows until his brow puckered in three furrows, and departed leaning on his staff.	sn4.21	1	12	sn	4.21	 Several 
sn4.21:2.1	Then those senior mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said,	sn4.21	2	1	sn	4.21	 Several 
sn4.21:3.1	“Mendicants, that was no brahmin.	sn4.21	3	1	sn	4.21	 Several 
sn4.21:3.2	That was Māra the Wicked who came to pull the wool over your eyes!”	sn4.21	3	2	sn	4.21	 Several 
sn4.21:3.3	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha recited this verse:	sn4.21	3	3	sn	4.21	 Several 
sn4.21:4.1	“When a person has seen where suffering comes from	sn4.21	4	1	sn	4.21	 Several 
sn4.21:4.2	how could they incline towards sensual pleasures?	sn4.21	4	2	sn	4.21	 Several 
sn4.21:4.3	Realizing that attachment is a chain in the world,	sn4.21	4	3	sn	4.21	 Several 
sn4.21:4.4	a person would train to remove it.”	sn4.21	4	4	sn	4.21	 Several 
sn4.22:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Silāvatī.	sn4.22	1	1	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Samiddhi was meditating not far from the Buddha, diligent, keen, and resolute.	sn4.22	1	2	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:1.3	Then as Venerable Samiddhi was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	sn4.22	1	3	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:1.4	“I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate,	sn4.22	1	4	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:1.5	to have a teacher who is a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha!	sn4.22	1	5	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:1.6	I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate,	sn4.22	1	6	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:1.7	to have gone forth in a teaching and training so well explained!	sn4.22	1	7	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:1.8	I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate,	sn4.22	1	8	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:1.9	to have spiritual companions who are ethical and of good character.”	sn4.22	1	9	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:1.10	And then Māra the Wicked, knowing what Samiddhi was thinking, went up to him and made a terrifyingly loud noise close by him. It seemed as if the earth was shattering.	sn4.22	1	10	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:2.1	Then Samiddhi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said,	sn4.22	2	1	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:3.1	“Samiddhi, that’s not the earth shattering.	sn4.22	3	1	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:3.2	That’s Māra the Wicked come to pull the wool over your eyes!	sn4.22	3	2	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:3.3	Go back to that same place, Samiddhi, and meditate, diligent, keen, and resolute.”	sn4.22	3	3	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:3.4	“Yes, sir,” replied Samiddhi. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	sn4.22	3	4	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:3.5	And for a second time Samiddhi was meditating in that same place, diligent, ardent, and resolute.	sn4.22	3	5	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:3.6	And for a second time he had the same thought …	sn4.22	3	6	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:3.7	and Māra made an earth-shattering noise.	sn4.22	3	7	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:3.9	Then Samiddhi addressed Māra the Wicked One in verse:	sn4.22	3	9	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:4.1	“I went forth out of faith	sn4.22	4	1	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:4.2	from the lay life to homelessness.	sn4.22	4	2	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:4.3	My mindfulness and wisdom are mature,	sn4.22	4	3	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:4.4	my mind is serene in immersion.	sn4.22	4	4	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:4.5	Make whatever illusions you want,	sn4.22	4	5	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:4.6	it won’t bother me.”	sn4.22	4	6	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:5.1	Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The mendicant Samiddhi knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there.	sn4.22	5	1	sn	4.22	 With Samiddhi 
sn4.23:1.1	So I have heard.	sn4.23	1	1	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	sn4.23	1	2	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Godhika was staying on the slopes of Isigili at the Black Rock.	sn4.23	1	3	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:1.4	Then Venerable Godhika, meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, experienced temporary freedom of heart.	sn4.23	1	4	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:1.5	But then he fell away from that temporary freedom of heart.	sn4.23	1	5	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:1.6	For a second …	sn4.23	1	6	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:1.8	third …	sn4.23	1	8	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:1.10	fourth …	sn4.23	1	10	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:1.12	fifth …	sn4.23	1	12	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:1.14	sixth time Godhika experienced temporary freedom of heart.	sn4.23	1	14	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:1.15	But for a sixth time he fell away from it.	sn4.23	1	15	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:1.16	For a seventh time Godhika, meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, experienced temporary freedom of heart.	sn4.23	1	16	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:2.1	Then he thought,	sn4.23	2	1	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:2.2	“I’ve fallen away from this temporary freedom of heart no less than six times.	sn4.23	2	2	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:2.3	Why don’t I slit my wrists?”	sn4.23	2	3	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:2.4	And then Māra the Wicked, knowing what Godhika was thinking, went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse:	sn4.23	2	4	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:3.1	“O great hero, O greatly wise!	sn4.23	3	1	sn	4.23	 With Godhika

sn4.23:3.3	You’ve gone beyond all threats and perils,	sn4.23	3	3	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:3.4	I bow to your feet, O seer!	sn4.23	3	4	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:4.1	Great hero, master of death,	sn4.23	4	1	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:4.2	your disciple longs for death,	sn4.23	4	2	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:4.3	he’s planning for it.	sn4.23	4	3	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:4.4	Stop him, O light-bringer!	sn4.23	4	4	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:5.1	For how, Blessed One, can a disciple of yours,	sn4.23	5	1	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:5.2	one who loves your teaching,	sn4.23	5	2	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:5.3	a trainee who hasn’t achieved their heart’s desire,	sn4.23	5	3	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:5.4	take his own life, O renowned one?”	sn4.23	5	4	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:6.1	Now at that time Venerable Godhika had already slit his wrists.	sn4.23	6	1	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:6.2	Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, addressed him in verse:	sn4.23	6	2	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:7.1	“This is how the wise act,	sn4.23	7	1	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:7.2	for they don’t long for life.	sn4.23	7	2	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:7.3	Having plucked out craving, root and all,	sn4.23	7	3	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:7.4	Godhika is extinguished.”	sn4.23	7	4	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:8.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,	sn4.23	8	1	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:8.2	“Come, mendicants, let’s go to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili where Godhika, who came from a good family, slit his wrists.”	sn4.23	8	2	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:8.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	sn4.23	8	3	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:9.1	Then the Buddha together with several mendicants went to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili.	sn4.23	9	1	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:9.2	The Buddha saw Godhika off in the distance lying on his cot, having cast off the aggregates.	sn4.23	9	2	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:9.3	Now at that time a cloud of black smoke was moving east, west, north, south, above, below, and in-between.	sn4.23	9	3	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:10.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,	sn4.23	10	1	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:10.2	“Mendicants, do you see that cloud of black smoke moving east, west, north, south, above, below, and in-between?”	sn4.23	10	2	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:10.3	“Yes, sir.”	sn4.23	10	3	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:10.4	“That’s Māra the Wicked searching for Godhika’s consciousness, wondering:	sn4.23	10	4	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:10.5	‘Where is Godhika’s consciousness established?’	sn4.23	10	5	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:10.6	But since his consciousness is not established, Godhika is extinguished.”	sn4.23	10	6	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:10.7	Then Māra, carrying his harp of yellow wood apple, went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse:	sn4.23	10	7	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:11.1	“Above, below, and all around,	sn4.23	11	1	sn	4.23	 With Godhika

sn4.23:11.3	I’ve been searching without success:	sn4.23	11	3	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:11.4	where has that Godhika got to?”	sn4.23	11	4	sn	4.23	 With Godhika

sn4.23:13.3	Having plucked out craving, root and all	sn4.23	13	3	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:13.4	Godhika is extinguished.”	sn4.23	13	4	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:14.1	So stricken with sorrow	sn4.23	14	1	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:14.2	that his harp dropped from his armpit,	sn4.23	14	2	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:14.3	that spirit, downcast,	sn4.23	14	3	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.23:14.4	vanished right there.	sn4.23	14	4	sn	4.23	 With Godhika 
sn4.24:1.1	So I have heard.	sn4.24	1	1	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.	sn4.24	1	2	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:1.3	Now at that time Māra the Wicked had been following the Buddha for seven years hoping to find a vulnerability without success.	sn4.24	1	3	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:1.4	Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse:	sn4.24	1	4	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:2.1	“Are you swamped by sorrow that you meditate in the forest?	sn4.24	2	1	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:2.2	Have you lost a fortune, or do you long for one?	sn4.24	2	2	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:2.3	Or perhaps you’ve committed some crime in the village?	sn4.24	2	3	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:2.4	Why don’t you get too close to people?	sn4.24	2	4	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:2.5	And why does no-one get close to you?”	sn4.24	2	5	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:3.1	“I’ve dug out the root of sorrow completely.	sn4.24	3	1	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:3.2	I practice absorption free of guilt or sorrow.	sn4.24	3	2	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:3.3	I’ve cut off all greed and hunger for future lives.	sn4.24	3	3	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:3.4	Undefiled, I practice absorption, O kinsman of the negligent!”	sn4.24	3	4	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:4.1	“The things they call ‘mine’,	sn4.24	4	1	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:4.2	and those who say ‘it’s mine’:	sn4.24	4	2	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:4.3	if your mind remains there,	sn4.24	4	3	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:4.4	you won’t escape me, ascetic!”	sn4.24	4	4	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:5.1	“The things they speak of aren’t mine;	sn4.24	5	1	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:5.2	I’m not someone who speaks like that.	sn4.24	5	2	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:5.3	So know this, Wicked One:	sn4.24	5	3	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:5.4	you won’t even see the path I take.”	sn4.24	5	4	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:6.1	“If you’ve discovered the path	sn4.24	6	1	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:6.2	that’s safe, and leads to the deathless,	sn4.24	6	2	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:6.3	go and walk that path alone—	sn4.24	6	3	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:6.4	why teach it to anyone else?”	sn4.24	6	4	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:7.1	“Those crossing to the far shore	sn4.24	7	1	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:7.2	ask what’s beyond the domain of Death.	sn4.24	7	2	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:7.3	When I’m asked, I explain to them	sn4.24	7	3	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:7.4	the truth without attachments.”	sn4.24	7	4	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:8.1	“Sir, suppose there was a lotus pond not far from a town or village,	sn4.24	8	1	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:8.2	and a crab lived there.	sn4.24	8	2	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:8.3	Then several boys or girls would leave the town or village and go to the pond, where they’d pull out the crab and put it on dry land.	sn4.24	8	3	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:8.4	Whenever that crab extended a claw, those boys or girls would snap, crack, and break it off with a stick or a stone.	sn4.24	8	4	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:8.5	And when that crab’s claws had all been snapped, cracked, and broken off it wouldn’t be able to return down into that lotus pond.	sn4.24	8	5	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:8.6	In the same way, sir, the Buddha has snapped, cracked, and broken off all my tricks, dodges, and evasions.	sn4.24	8	6	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:8.7	Now I’m not able to approach the Buddha again in hopes of finding a vulnerability.”	sn4.24	8	7	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:8.8	Then Māra the Wicked recited these verses of disappointment in the Buddha’s presence:	sn4.24	8	8	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:9.1	“A crow once circled a stone	sn4.24	9	1	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:9.2	that looked like a lump of fat.	sn4.24	9	2	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:9.3	‘Perhaps I’ll find something tender,’ it thought,	sn4.24	9	3	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:9.4	‘perhaps there’s something tasty.’	sn4.24	9	4	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:10.1	But finding nothing tasty,	sn4.24	10	1	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:10.2	the crow left that place.	sn4.24	10	2	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:10.3	Like the crow that pecked the stone,	sn4.24	10	3	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:10.4	I leave Gotama disappointed.”	sn4.24	10	4	sn	4.24	 Seven Years of Following 
sn4.25:1.1	And then Māra the Wicked, after reciting these verses of disillusionment in the Buddha’s presence, left that place. He sat cross-legged on the ground not far from the Buddha, silent, embarrassed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say, scratching the ground with a stick.	sn4.25	1	1	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:1.2	Then Māra’s daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to Māra the Wicked, and addressed him in verse:	sn4.25	1	2	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:2.1	“Why so downhearted, dad?	sn4.25	2	1	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:2.2	What man are you upset about?	sn4.25	2	2	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:2.3	We’ll catch him with the snare of lust,	sn4.25	2	3	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:2.4	like an elephant in the wild.	sn4.25	2	4	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:2.5	We’ll tie him up and bring him back—	sn4.25	2	5	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:2.6	he’ll fall under your sway!”	sn4.25	2	6	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:3.1	“In this world he is the perfected one, the Holy One.	sn4.25	3	1	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:3.2	He’s not easily seduced by lust.	sn4.25	3	2	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:3.3	He has slipped free of Māra’s sway;	sn4.25	3	3	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:3.4	that’s why I’m so upset.”	sn4.25	3	4	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:4.1	Then Māra’s daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to the Buddha, and said to him,	sn4.25	4	1	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:4.2	“We serve at your feet, ascetic.”	sn4.25	4	2	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:4.3	But the Buddha ignored them, since he was freed with the supreme ending of attachments.	sn4.25	4	3	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:5.1	Then Craving, Delight, and Lust withdrew to one side to think up a plan.	sn4.25	5	1	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:5.2	“Men have a diverse spectrum of tastes.	sn4.25	5	2	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:5.3	Why don’t we each manifest in the form of a hundred young maidens?”	sn4.25	5	3	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:5.4	So that’s what they did. Then they went up to the Buddha and said to him,	sn4.25	5	4	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:5.5	“We serve at your feet, ascetic.”	sn4.25	5	5	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:5.6	But the Buddha still ignored them, since he was freed with the supreme ending of attachments.	sn4.25	5	6	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:6.1	Then Craving, Delight, and Lust withdrew to one side to think up a plan.	sn4.25	6	1	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:6.2	“Men have a diverse spectrum of tastes.	sn4.25	6	2	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters

sn4.25:6.4	So that’s what they did. Then they went up to the Buddha and said to him,	sn4.25	6	4	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:6.5	“We serve at your feet, ascetic.”	sn4.25	6	5	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters

sn4.25:7.1	Then Craving, Delight, and Lust …	sn4.25	7	1	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:7.4	each manifested in the form of a hundred women who have given birth once …	sn4.25	7	4	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters

sn4.25:11.2	He’d dry up, wither away, and shrivel up like a green reed that was mowed down.”	sn4.25	11	2	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:12.1	Then Māra’s daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to the Buddha, and stood to one side.	sn4.25	12	1	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:12.2	Māra’s daughter Craving addressed the Buddha in verse:	sn4.25	12	2	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters

sn4.25:14.3	alone, practicing absorption, I awakened to bliss.	sn4.25	14	3	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters

sn4.25:15.1	Then Māra’s daughter Delight addressed the Buddha in verse:	sn4.25	15	1	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:16.1	“How does a mendicant who has crossed five floods	sn4.25	16	1	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters

sn4.25:16.3	How do they usually practice absorption so that sensual perceptions	sn4.25	16	3	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters

sn4.25:24.3	After attacking a stump with your breast, as it were,	sn4.25	24	3	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters

sn4.25:25.3	But the Teacher brushed them off right there,	sn4.25	25	3	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters

sn4.25:26.5	The Linked Discourses with Māra are complete.	sn4.25	26	5	sn	4.25	 Māra’s Daughters 
sn5.1:1.1	So I have heard.	sn5.1	1	1	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā 
sn5.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	sn5.1	1	2	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā 
sn5.1:1.3	Then the nun Āḷavikā robed up in the morning and, taking her bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	sn5.1	1	3	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā 
sn5.1:1.4	She wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on her return from alms-round, she went to the Dark Forest seeking seclusion.	sn5.1	1	4	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā 
sn5.1:1.5	Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the nun Āḷavikā feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make her fall away from seclusion, went up to her and addressed her in verse:	sn5.1	1	5	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā 
sn5.1:2.1	“There’s no escape in the world,	sn5.1	2	1	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā 
sn5.1:2.2	so what will seclusion do for you?	sn5.1	2	2	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā 
sn5.1:2.3	Enjoy the delights of sensual pleasure;	sn5.1	2	3	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā 
sn5.1:2.4	don’t regret it later.”	sn5.1	2	4	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā 
sn5.1:3.1	Then the nun Āḷavikā thought,	sn5.1	3	1	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā 
sn5.1:3.2	“Who’s speaking this verse, a human or a non-human?”	sn5.1	3	2	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā 
sn5.1:3.3	Then she thought,	sn5.1	3	3	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā 
sn5.1:3.4	“This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from seclusion!”	sn5.1	3	4	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā 
sn5.1:3.5	Then Āḷavikā, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse:	sn5.1	3	5	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā 
sn5.1:4.1	“There is an escape in the world,	sn5.1	4	1	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā 
sn5.1:4.2	and I’ve personally experienced it with wisdom.	sn5.1	4	2	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā 
sn5.1:4.3	O Wicked One, kinsman of the negligent,	sn5.1	4	3	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā 
sn5.1:4.4	you don’t know that place.	sn5.1	4	4	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā 
sn5.1:5.1	Sensual pleasures are like swords and stakes;	sn5.1	5	1	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā 
sn5.1:5.2	the aggregates are their chopping block.	sn5.1	5	2	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā 
sn5.1:5.3	What you call sensual delight	sn5.1	5	3	sn	5.1	 With Āḷavikā

sn5.9:3.1	Then the nun Selā thought,	sn5.9	3	1	sn	5.9	 With Selā 
sn5.9:3.2	“Who’s speaking this verse, a human or a non-human?”	sn5.9	3	2	sn	5.9	 With Selā 
sn5.9:3.3	Then she thought,	sn5.9	3	3	sn	5.9	 With Selā 
sn5.9:3.4	“This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from immersion!”	sn5.9	3	4	sn	5.9	 With Selā 
sn5.9:3.5	Then Selā, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse:	sn5.9	3	5	sn	5.9	 With Selā 
sn5.9:4.1	“This puppet isn’t self-made,	sn5.9	4	1	sn	5.9	 With Selā 
sn5.9:4.2	nor is this misery made by another.	sn5.9	4	2	sn	5.9	 With Selā 
sn5.9:4.3	It comes to be because of a cause,	sn5.9	4	3	sn	5.9	 With Selā 
sn5.9:4.4	and ceases when the cause breaks up.	sn5.9	4	4	sn	5.9	 With Selā 
sn5.9:5.1	It’s like a seed that’s sown	sn5.9	5	1	sn	5.9	 With Selā 
sn5.9:5.2	in a field; it grows	sn5.9	5	2	sn	5.9	 With Selā 
sn5.9:5.3	relying on both the soil’s nutrients	sn5.9	5	3	sn	5.9	 With Selā 
sn5.9:5.4	as well as moisture.	sn5.9	5	4	sn	5.9	 With Selā 
sn5.9:6.1	In the same way the aggregates and elements	sn5.9	6	1	sn	5.9	 With Selā 
sn5.9:6.2	and these six sense fields	sn5.9	6	2	sn	5.9	 With Selā 
sn5.9:6.3	come to be because of a cause,	sn5.9	6	3	sn	5.9	 With Selā 
sn5.9:6.4	and cease when the cause breaks up.”	sn5.9	6	4	sn	5.9	 With Selā 
sn5.9:7.1	Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The nun Selā knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there.	sn5.9	7	1	sn	5.9	 With Selā 
sn5.10:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	sn5.10	1	1	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:1.2	Then the nun Vajirā robed up in the morning and, taking her bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	sn5.10	1	2	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:1.3	She wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on her return from alms-round, she went to the Dark Forest,	sn5.10	1	3	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:1.4	plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation.	sn5.10	1	4	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:1.5	Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the nun Vajirā feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make her fall away from immersion, went up to her and addressed her in verse:	sn5.10	1	5	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:2.1	“Who created this sentient being?	sn5.10	2	1	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:2.2	Where is its maker?	sn5.10	2	2	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:2.3	Where has the being arisen?	sn5.10	2	3	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:2.4	And where does it cease?”	sn5.10	2	4	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:3.1	Then the nun Vajirā thought,	sn5.10	3	1	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:3.2	“Who’s speaking this verse, a human or a non-human?”	sn5.10	3	2	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:3.3	Then she thought,	sn5.10	3	3	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:3.4	“This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from immersion!”	sn5.10	3	4	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:3.5	Then Vajirā, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse:	sn5.10	3	5	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:4.1	“Why do you believe there’s such a thing as a ‘sentient being’?	sn5.10	4	1	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:4.2	Māra, is this your theory?	sn5.10	4	2	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:4.3	This is just a pile of conditions,	sn5.10	4	3	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:4.4	you won’t find a sentient being here.	sn5.10	4	4	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:5.1	When the parts are assembled	sn5.10	5	1	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:5.2	we use the word ‘chariot’.	sn5.10	5	2	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:5.3	So too, when the aggregates are present	sn5.10	5	3	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:5.4	‘sentient being’ is the convention we use.	sn5.10	5	4	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:6.1	But it’s only suffering that comes to be,	sn5.10	6	1	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:6.2	lasts a while, then disappears.	sn5.10	6	2	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:6.3	Naught but suffering comes to be,	sn5.10	6	3	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:6.4	naught but suffering ceases.”	sn5.10	6	4	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:7.1	Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The nun Vajirā knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there.	sn5.10	7	1	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn5.10:8.6	The Linked Discourses on Nuns are completed.	sn5.10	8	6	sn	5.10	 With Vajirā 
sn6.1:1.1	So I have heard.	sn6.1	1	1	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:1.2	At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.	sn6.1	1	2	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:1.3	Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	sn6.1	1	3	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:1.4	“This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute.	sn6.1	1	4	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:1.5	But people like attachment, they love it and enjoy it.	sn6.1	1	5	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:1.6	It’s hard for them to see this thing; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination.	sn6.1	1	6	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:1.7	It’s also hard for them to see this thing; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.	sn6.1	1	7	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:1.8	And if I were to teach this principle, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.”	sn6.1	1	8	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:1.9	And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to the Buddha:	sn6.1	1	9	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:2.1	“I’ve struggled hard to realize this,	sn6.1	2	1	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:2.2	enough with trying to explain it!	sn6.1	2	2	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:2.3	This principle is not easily understood	sn6.1	2	3	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:2.4	by those mired in greed and hate.	sn6.1	2	4	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:3.1	Those caught up in greed can’t see	sn6.1	3	1	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:3.2	what’s subtle, going against the stream,	sn6.1	3	2	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:3.3	deep, hard to see, and very fine,	sn6.1	3	3	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:3.4	for they’re shrouded in a mass of darkness.”	sn6.1	3	4	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:4.1	And as the Buddha reflected like this, his mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.	sn6.1	4	1	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:5.1	Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what the Buddha was thinking, thought,	sn6.1	5	1	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:5.2	“Oh my goodness! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.”	sn6.1	5	2	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:5.3	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha.	sn6.1	5	3	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:5.4	He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:	sn6.1	5	4	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:5.5	“Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma!	sn6.1	5	5	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:5.6	There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching.	sn6.1	5	6	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:5.7	There will be those who understand the teaching!”	sn6.1	5	7	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:5.8	This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he went on to say:	sn6.1	5	8	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:6.1	“Among the Magadhans there appeared in the past	sn6.1	6	1	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:6.2	an impure teaching thought up by those still stained.	sn6.1	6	2	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:6.3	Fling open the door to the deathless!	sn6.1	6	3	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:6.4	Let them hear the teaching the immaculate one discovered.	sn6.1	6	4	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:7.1	Standing high on a rocky mountain,	sn6.1	7	1	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:7.2	you can see the people all around.	sn6.1	7	2	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:7.3	In just the same way, all-seer, wise one,	sn6.1	7	3	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:7.4	having ascended the Temple of Truth,	sn6.1	7	4	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:7.5	rid of sorrow, look upon the people	sn6.1	7	5	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:7.6	swamped with sorrow, oppressed by rebirth and old age.	sn6.1	7	6	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:8.1	Rise, hero! Victor in battle, leader of the caravan,	sn6.1	8	1	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:8.2	wander the world without obligation.	sn6.1	8	2	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:8.3	Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma!	sn6.1	8	3	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:8.4	There will be those who understand!”	sn6.1	8	4	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:9.1	Then the Buddha, understanding Brahmā’s invitation, surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, because of his compassion for sentient beings.	sn6.1	9	1	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:9.2	And the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not.	sn6.1	9	2	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:9.3	It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them.	sn6.1	9	3	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:9.4	In the same way, the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not.	sn6.1	9	4	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:9.5	When he had seen this he replied in verse to Brahmā Sahampati:	sn6.1	9	5	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:10.1	“Flung open are the doors to the deathless!	sn6.1	10	1	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:10.2	Let those with ears to hear decide their faith.	sn6.1	10	2	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:10.3	Thinking it would be troublesome, Brahmā, I did not teach	sn6.1	10	3	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:10.4	the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among humans.”	sn6.1	10	4	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:11.1	Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing that his request for the Buddha to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.	sn6.1	11	1	sn	6.1	 The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.2:1.1	So I have heard.	sn6.2	1	1	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:1.2	At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.	sn6.2	1	2	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:1.3	Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	sn6.2	1	3	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:1.4	“It’s unpleasant to live without respect and reverence. What ascetic or brahmin should I honor and respect and rely on?”	sn6.2	1	4	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:2.1	Then it occurred to him:	sn6.2	2	1	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:2.2	“I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of ethics, if it were incomplete.	sn6.2	2	2	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:2.3	But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in ethics, who I should honor and respect and rely on.	sn6.2	2	3	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:3.1	I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of immersion, if it were incomplete.	sn6.2	3	1	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:3.2	But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in immersion …	sn6.2	3	2	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:4.1	I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of wisdom, if it were incomplete.	sn6.2	4	1	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:4.2	But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in wisdom …	sn6.2	4	2	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:5.1	I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of freedom, if it were incomplete.	sn6.2	5	1	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:5.2	But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in freedom …	sn6.2	5	2	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:6.1	I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of the knowledge and vision of freedom, if it were incomplete.	sn6.2	6	1	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:6.2	But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in the knowledge and vision of freedom, who I should honor and respect and rely on.	sn6.2	6	2	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:6.3	Why don’t I honor and respect and rely on the same Dhamma to which I was awakened?”	sn6.2	6	3	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:7.1	Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha.	sn6.2	7	1	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:7.2	He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:	sn6.2	7	2	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:7.3	“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!	sn6.2	7	3	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:7.4	All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past honored and respected and relied on this same teaching.	sn6.2	7	4	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:7.5	All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future will honor and respect and rely on this same teaching.	sn6.2	7	5	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:7.6	May the Blessed One, who is the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present, also honor and respect and rely on this same teaching.”	sn6.2	7	6	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:7.7	This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he went on to say:	sn6.2	7	7	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:8.1	“All Buddhas in the past,	sn6.2	8	1	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:8.2	the Buddhas of the future,	sn6.2	8	2	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:8.3	and the Buddha at present—	sn6.2	8	3	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:8.4	destroyer of the sorrows of many—	sn6.2	8	4	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:9.1	respecting the true teaching	sn6.2	9	1	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:9.2	they did live, they do live,	sn6.2	9	2	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:9.3	and they also will live.	sn6.2	9	3	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:9.4	This is the nature of the Buddhas.	sn6.2	9	4	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:10.1	Therefore someone who cares for their own welfare,	sn6.2	10	1	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:10.2	and wants to become the very best they can be,	sn6.2	10	2	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:10.3	should respect the true teaching,	sn6.2	10	3	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.2:10.4	remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.”	sn6.2	10	4	sn	6.2	 Respect 
sn6.3:1.1	So I have heard.	sn6.3	1	1	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	sn6.3	1	2	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:1.3	Now at that time a certain brahmin lady had a son called Brahmadeva, who had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the Buddha.	sn6.3	1	3	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:2.1	Then Venerable Brahmadeva, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	sn6.3	2	1	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:2.2	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”	sn6.3	2	2	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:2.3	And Venerable Brahmadeva became one of the perfected.	sn6.3	2	3	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:3.1	Then Brahmadeva robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	sn6.3	3	1	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:3.2	Wandering indiscriminately for alms-food in Sāvatthī, he approached his own mother’s home.	sn6.3	3	2	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:3.3	Now at that time Brahmadeva’s mother, the brahmin lady, was offering up a regular oblation to Brahmā.	sn6.3	3	3	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:3.4	Then Brahmā Sahampati thought,	sn6.3	3	4	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:3.5	“This Venerable Brahmadeva’s mother, the brahmin lady, offers up a regular oblation to Brahmā.	sn6.3	3	5	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:3.6	Why don’t I go and stir up a sense of urgency in her?”	sn6.3	3	6	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:3.7	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in the home of Brahmadeva’s mother.	sn6.3	3	7	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:3.8	Then Brahmā Sahampati, while standing in the air, addressed Brahmadeva’s mother in verse:	sn6.3	3	8	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:4.1	“Far from here is the Brahmā realm, madam,	sn6.3	4	1	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:4.2	to which you offer a regular oblation.	sn6.3	4	2	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:4.3	But Brahmā doesn’t eat that kind of food.	sn6.3	4	3	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:4.4	Why make invocations, when you don’t know the path to Brahmā?	sn6.3	4	4	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:5.1	This Brahmadeva, madam,	sn6.3	5	1	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:5.2	free of attachments, has surpassed the gods.	sn6.3	5	2	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:5.3	Owning nothing, providing for no other, a mendicant	sn6.3	5	3	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:5.4	has entered your house for alms.	sn6.3	5	4	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:6.1	He’s worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, a knowledge master, self-developed.	sn6.3	6	1	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:6.2	He’s worthy of a religious donation from gods and men.	sn6.3	6	2	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:6.3	Having shunned all evils, he’s unsullied.	sn6.3	6	3	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:6.4	Cool at heart, he wanders looking for food.	sn6.3	6	4	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:7.1	He has no before and after,	sn6.3	7	1	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:7.2	peaceful, unclouded, untroubled, with no need for hope,	sn6.3	7	2	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva

sn6.3:8.1	With peaceful mind, he has left the crowd,	sn6.3	8	1	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:8.2	he wanders like a tamed elephant, unperturbed.	sn6.3	8	2	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:8.3	He’s a mendicant fair in ethics, with heart well freed.	sn6.3	8	3	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva

sn6.3:10.1	With unwavering confidence in him,	sn6.3	10	1	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:10.2	she presented her religious donation to one who is worthy of it.	sn6.3	10	2	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:10.3	After seeing the sage who had crossed over, the brahmin lady	sn6.3	10	3	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:10.4	made merit for the sake of future happiness.	sn6.3	10	4	sn	6.3	 With Brahmadeva 
sn6.4:1.1	So I have heard.	sn6.4	1	1	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	sn6.4	1	2	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:1.3	Now at that time Baka the Brahmā had the following harmful misconception:	sn6.4	1	3	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:1.4	“This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is whole, this is imperishable. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.”	sn6.4	1	4	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:2.1	Then the Buddha knew what Baka the Brahmā was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm.	sn6.4	2	1	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:2.2	Baka the Brahmā saw the Buddha coming off in the distance	sn6.4	2	2	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:2.3	and said to him,	sn6.4	2	3	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:2.4	“Come, good sir! Welcome, good sir!	sn6.4	2	4	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:2.5	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.	sn6.4	2	5	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:2.6	For this is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is complete, this is imperishable. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.”	sn6.4	2	6	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:3.1	When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,	sn6.4	3	1	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:3.2	“Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance! Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance!	sn6.4	3	2	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:3.3	Because what is actually impermanent, not lasting, transient, incomplete, and perishable, he says is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable.	sn6.4	3	3	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:3.4	And where there is being born, growing old, dying, passing away, and being reborn, he says that	sn6.4	3	4	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:3.5	there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.	sn6.4	3	5	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:3.6	And although there is another escape beyond this, he says that there’s no other escape beyond this.”	sn6.4	3	6	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:4.1	“Gotama, we seventy-two merit-makers are now wielders of power,	sn6.4	4	1	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:4.2	having passed beyond rebirth and old age.	sn6.4	4	2	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:4.3	This is our last rebirth as Brahmā, knowledge-master.	sn6.4	4	3	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:4.4	And now many people pray to us.”	sn6.4	4	4	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:5.1	“But, Baka, the life span here is short, not long,	sn6.4	5	1	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:5.2	though you think it’s long.	sn6.4	5	2	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:5.3	I know that your life span	sn6.4	5	3	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā

sn6.4:7.4	I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep.	sn6.4	7	4	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:8.1	When people at Deer River Bank were seized,	sn6.4	8	1	sn	6.4	 With Baka the Brahmā

sn6.5:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	sn6.5	1	1	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:1.2	Now at that time a certain Brahmā had the following harmful misconception:	sn6.5	1	2	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:1.3	“No ascetic or brahmin can come here!”	sn6.5	1	3	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:1.4	Then the Buddha knew what that Brahmā was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm.	sn6.5	1	4	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:1.5	Then the Buddha sat cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element.	sn6.5	1	5	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:2.1	Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought,	sn6.5	2	1	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:2.2	“Where is the Buddha staying at present?”	sn6.5	2	2	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:2.3	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, he saw the Buddha seated cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element.	sn6.5	2	3	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:2.4	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm.	sn6.5	2	4	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:2.5	Then Mahāmoggallāna—positioning himself in the east, below the Buddha—sat cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element.	sn6.5	2	5	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:3.1	Then Venerable Mahākassapa …	sn6.5	3	1	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā

sn6.5:6.1	Then Mahāmoggallāna addressed that Brahmā in verse:	sn6.5	6	1	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:7.1	“Sir, do you still have the same view	sn6.5	7	1	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:7.2	that you had in the past?	sn6.5	7	2	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:7.3	Or do you see the radiance	sn6.5	7	3	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā

sn6.5:8.3	I see the radiance	sn6.5	8	3	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:8.4	transcending the Brahmā realm.	sn6.5	8	4	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:8.5	So how could I say today	sn6.5	8	5	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:8.6	that I am permanent and eternal?”	sn6.5	8	6	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:9.1	Having inspired a sense of awe in the Brahmā, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, the Buddha vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in Jeta’s Grove.	sn6.5	9	1	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:9.2	Then that Brahmā addressed a member of his retinue,	sn6.5	9	2	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:9.3	“Please, good sir, go up to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and say to him:	sn6.5	9	3	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:9.4	‘Moggallāna my good sir, are there any other disciples of the Buddha who have power and might	sn6.5	9	4	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā

sn6.5:11.1	Then that member of Brahmā’s retinue, having approved and agreed with what Mahāmoggallāna said, went to that Brahmā and said to him,	sn6.5	11	1	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:11.2	“Good sir, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:	sn6.5	11	2	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā

sn6.5:13.1	That’s what that member of Brahmā’s retinue said.	sn6.5	13	1	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:13.2	Satisfied, that Brahmā was happy with what the member of his retinue said.	sn6.5	13	2	sn	6.5	 A Certain Brahmā

sn6.6:1.2	Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day’s meditation.	sn6.6	1	2	sn	6.6	 The Negligent Brahmā 
sn6.6:1.3	Then the independent brahmās Subrahmā and Suddhāvāsa went to the Buddha and stationed themselves one by each door-post. But Subrahmā said to Suddhāvāsa,	sn6.6	1	3	sn	6.6	 The Negligent Brahmā 
sn6.6:1.4	“Good sir, it’s the wrong time to pay homage to the Buddha.	sn6.6	1	4	sn	6.6	 The Negligent Brahmā 
sn6.6:1.5	He has gone into retreat for the day’s meditation.	sn6.6	1	5	sn	6.6	 The Negligent Brahmā 
sn6.6:1.6	But such and such Brahmā realm is successful and prosperous, while the Brahmā living there is negligent.	sn6.6	1	6	sn	6.6	 The Negligent Brahmā

sn6.6:1.8	“Yes, good sir,” replied Suddhāvāsa.	sn6.6	1	8	sn	6.6	 The Negligent Brahmā 
sn6.6:2.1	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from in front of the Buddha and appeared in that Brahmā realm.	sn6.6	2	1	sn	6.6	 The Negligent Brahmā 
sn6.6:2.2	That Brahmā saw those Brahmās coming off in the distance and said to them,	sn6.6	2	2	sn	6.6	 The Negligent Brahmā 
sn6.6:2.3	“Well now, good sirs, where have you come from?”	sn6.6	2	3	sn	6.6	 The Negligent Brahmā

sn6.6:2.5	Shouldn’t you go to attend on that Blessed One?”	sn6.6	2	5	sn	6.6	 The Negligent Brahmā 
sn6.6:3.1	When they had spoken, that Brahmā refused to accept their advice. He multiplied himself a thousand times and said to Subrahmā,	sn6.6	3	1	sn	6.6	 The Negligent Brahmā 
sn6.6:3.2	“Good sir, can’t you see that I have such psychic power?”	sn6.6	3	2	sn	6.6	 The Negligent Brahmā 
sn6.6:3.3	“I see that, good sir.”	sn6.6	3	3	sn	6.6	 The Negligent Brahmā 
sn6.6:3.4	“Since I have such psychic power and might, what other ascetic or brahmin should I go to and attend upon?”	sn6.6	3	4	sn	6.6	 The Negligent Brahmā 
sn6.6:4.1	Then Subrahmā multiplied himself two thousand times and said to that Brahmā,	sn6.6	4	1	sn	6.6	 The Negligent Brahmā 
sn6.6:4.2	“Good sir, can’t you see that I have such psychic power?”	sn6.6	4	2	sn	6.6	 The Negligent Brahmā

sn6.6:4.5	Shouldn’t you go to attend on that Blessed One?”	sn6.6	4	5	sn	6.6	 The Negligent Brahmā

sn6.10:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	sn6.10	1	1	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:1.2	Then the mendicant Kokālika went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	sn6.10	1	2	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:1.3	“Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.”	sn6.10	1	3	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:1.4	When this was said, the Buddha said to Kokālika,	sn6.10	1	4	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:1.5	“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika!	sn6.10	1	5	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika

sn6.10:1.7	For a second time Kokālika said to the Buddha,	sn6.10	1	7	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:1.8	“Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.”	sn6.10	1	8	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:1.9	For a second time, the Buddha said to Kokālika,	sn6.10	1	9	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:1.10	“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika!	sn6.10	1	10	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika

sn6.10:2.1	Then Kokālika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	sn6.10	2	1	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:2.2	Not long after he left his body erupted with boils the size of mustard seeds.	sn6.10	2	2	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:2.3	The boils grew to the size of mung beans, then chickpeas, then jujube seeds, then jujubes, then myrobalans, then unripe wood apples, then ripe wood apples. Finally they burst open, and pus and blood oozed out.	sn6.10	2	3	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:2.4	Then the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness.	sn6.10	2	4	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:2.5	He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.	sn6.10	2	5	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:3.1	Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	sn6.10	3	1	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:3.2	“Sir, the mendicant Kokālika has passed away.	sn6.10	3	2	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika

sn6.10:3.4	That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said.	sn6.10	3	4	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:3.5	Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there.	sn6.10	3	5	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:4.1	Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened.	sn6.10	4	1	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:5.1	When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha,	sn6.10	5	1	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:5.2	“Sir, how long is the life span in the Pink Lotus hell?”	sn6.10	5	2	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:5.3	“It’s long, mendicant.	sn6.10	5	3	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:5.4	It’s not easy to calculate	sn6.10	5	4	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:5.5	how many years, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts.”	sn6.10	5	5	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:5.6	“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?”	sn6.10	5	6	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:5.7	“It’s possible,” said the Buddha.	sn6.10	5	7	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:6.1	“Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed. And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it.	sn6.10	6	1	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:6.2	By this means the Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell.	sn6.10	6	2	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:6.3	Now, twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Nirabbuda hell.	sn6.10	6	3	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:6.4	Twenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Ababa hell.	sn6.10	6	4	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:6.5	Twenty lifetimes in the Ababa hell equal one lifetime in the Aṭaṭa hell.	sn6.10	6	5	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:6.6	Twenty lifetimes in the Aṭaṭa hell equal one lifetime in the Ahaha hell.	sn6.10	6	6	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:6.7	Twenty lifetimes in the Ahaha hell equal one lifetime in the Yellow Lotus hell.	sn6.10	6	7	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:6.8	Twenty lifetimes in the Yellow Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Sweet-Smelling hell.	sn6.10	6	8	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:6.9	Twenty lifetimes in the Sweet-Smelling hell equal one lifetime in the Blue Water Lily hell.	sn6.10	6	9	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:6.10	Twenty lifetimes in the Blue Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the White Lotus hell.	sn6.10	6	10	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika

sn6.10:6.13	That is what the Buddha said.	sn6.10	6	13	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika 
sn6.10:6.14	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	sn6.10	6	14	sn	6.10	 With Kokālika

sn6.14:1.1	So I have heard.	sn6.14	1	1	sn	6.14	 About Aruṇavatī 
sn6.14:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī.	sn6.14	1	2	sn	6.14	 About Aruṇavatī

sn6.14:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	sn6.14	1	5	sn	6.14	 About Aruṇavatī 
sn6.14:1.6	The Buddha said this:	sn6.14	1	6	sn	6.14	 About Aruṇavatī 
sn6.14:2.1	“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a king named Aruṇavā.	sn6.14	2	1	sn	6.14	 About Aruṇavatī

sn6.14:3.1	Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū,	sn6.14	3	1	sn	6.14	 About Aruṇavatī

sn6.14:3.4	But the Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue complained, grumbled, and objected,	sn6.14	3	4	sn	6.14	 About Aruṇavatī

sn7.1:1.3	Now at that time a certain brahmin lady of the Bhāradvāja clan named Dhanañjānī was devoted to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.	sn7.1	1	3	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:1.4	Once, while she was bringing her husband his meal she tripped and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times:	sn7.1	1	4	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:2.1	“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	sn7.1	2	1	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:3.1	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	sn7.1	3	1	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:4.1	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!”	sn7.1	4	1	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī

sn7.1:5.2	“That’d be right. For the slightest thing this lowlife woman spouts out praise for that bald ascetic.	sn7.1	5	2	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:5.3	Right now, lowlife woman, I’m going to refute your teacher’s doctrine!”	sn7.1	5	3	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:5.4	“Brahmin, I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who can refute the doctrine of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	sn7.1	5	4	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:5.5	But anyway, you should go. When you’ve gone you’ll understand.”	sn7.1	5	5	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:6.1	Then the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan, angry and upset, went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	sn7.1	6	1	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:6.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,	sn7.1	6	2	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:6.3	and addressed the Buddha in verse:	sn7.1	6	3	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī

sn7.1:8.1	“When anger’s incinerated you sleep at ease.	sn7.1	8	1	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:8.2	When anger’s incinerated there is no sorrow.	sn7.1	8	2	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:8.3	O brahmin, anger has a poisoned root	sn7.1	8	3	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:8.4	and a honey tip.	sn7.1	8	4	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:8.5	The noble ones praise its killing,	sn7.1	8	5	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:8.6	for when it’s incinerated there is no sorrow.”	sn7.1	8	6	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī

sn7.1:9.2	“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!	sn7.1	9	2	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:9.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	sn7.1	9	3	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:9.4	I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	sn7.1	9	4	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:9.5	Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”	sn7.1	9	5	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:10.1	And the brahmin received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	sn7.1	10	1	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:10.2	Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	sn7.1	10	2	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī 
sn7.1:10.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”	sn7.1	10	3	sn	7.1	 With Dhanañjānī

sn7.10:16.2	“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! …	sn7.10	16	2	sn	7.10	 Many Daughters 
sn7.10:16.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	sn7.10	16	3	sn	7.10	 Many Daughters

sn7.10:17.2	Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life.

sn7.10:17.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”	sn7.10	17	3	sn	7.10	 Many Daughters 
sn7.10:17.4	And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected.	sn7.10	17	4	sn	7.10	 Many Daughters 
sn7.11:1.1	So I have heard.	sn7.11	1	1	sn	7.11	 With Bhāradvāja the Farmer

sn7.11:1.4	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to where Bhāradvāja the Farmer was working.	sn7.11	1	4	sn	7.11	 With Bhāradvāja the Farmer 
sn7.11:2.1	Now at that time Bhāradvāja the Farmer was distributing food.	sn7.11	2	1	sn	7.11	 With Bhāradvāja the Farmer 
sn7.11:2.2	Then the Buddha went to where the distribution was taking place and stood to one side.	sn7.11	2	2	sn	7.11	 With Bhāradvāja the Farmer 
sn7.11:2.3	Bhāradvāja the Farmer saw him standing for alms	sn7.11	2	3	sn	7.11	 With Bhāradvāja the Farmer 
sn7.11:2.4	and said to him,	sn7.11	2	4	sn	7.11	 With Bhāradvāja the Farmer 
sn7.11:2.5	“I plough and sow, ascetic, and then I eat.	sn7.11	2	5	sn	7.11	 With Bhāradvāja the Farmer 
sn7.11:2.6	You too should plough and sow, then you may eat.”	sn7.11	2	6	sn	7.11	 With Bhāradvāja the Farmer

sn7.11:2.9	‘I too plough and sow, brahmin, and then I eat.’”	sn7.11	2	9	sn	7.11	 With Bhāradvāja the Farmer 
sn7.11:2.10	Then Bhāradvāja the Farmer addressed the Buddha in verse:	sn7.11	2	10	sn	7.11	 With Bhāradvāja the Farmer

sn7.11:5.1	Guarded in body and speech,	sn7.11	5	1	sn	7.11	 With Bhāradvāja the Farmer 
sn7.11:5.2	I restrict my intake of food.	sn7.11	5	2	sn	7.11	 With Bhāradvāja the Farmer 
sn7.11:5.3	I use truth as my scythe,	sn7.11	5	3	sn	7.11	 With Bhāradvāja the Farmer

sn7.11:6.3	It goes without turning back	sn7.11	6	3	sn	7.11	 With Bhāradvāja the Farmer

sn7.11:7.3	When you finish this farming	sn7.11	7	3	sn	7.11	 With Bhāradvāja the Farmer

sn7.11:9.3	The Buddhas reject things enchanted with spells.	sn7.11	9	3	sn	7.11	 With Bhāradvāja the Farmer

sn7.13:6.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,	sn7.13	6	2	sn	7.13	 With Devahita

sn7.14:13.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:	sn7.14	13	3	sn	7.14	 A well-to-do brahmin

sn7.15:1.4	Now, at that time the Buddha was teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly.	sn7.15	1	4	sn	7.15	 Stuck-Up

sn7.15:1.11	But the Buddha didn’t speak to him.	sn7.15	1	11	sn	7.15	 Stuck-Up

sn7.15:1.13	“This ascetic Gotama knows nothing!” And he wanted to go back from there right away.	sn7.15	1	13	sn	7.15	 Stuck-Up 
sn7.15:1.14	Then the Buddha, knowing what Stuck-Up was thinking, addressed him in verse:	sn7.15	1	14	sn	7.15	 Stuck-Up 
sn7.15:2.1	“It’s not good to foster conceit	sn7.15	2	1	sn	7.15	 Stuck-Up

sn7.15:3.1	Then Stuck-Up thought,	sn7.15	3	1	sn	7.15	 Stuck-Up 
sn7.15:3.2	“The ascetic Gotama knows my mind!” He bowed with his head to the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name:	sn7.15	3	2	sn	7.15	 Stuck-Up 
sn7.15:3.3	“Master Gotama, I am Stuck-Up! I am Stuck-Up!”	sn7.15	3	3	sn	7.15	 Stuck-Up

sn7.15:3.7	Yet he shows such utmost devotion to the ascetic Gotama!”	sn7.15	3	7	sn	7.15	 Stuck-Up

sn7.21:2.7	“It’s because, Master Gotama, whatever bad deeds I’ve done during the day I wash off by bathing at dusk; and whatever bad deeds I’ve done during the night, I wash off by bathing at dawn.	sn7.21	2	7	sn	7.21	 With Saṅgārava

sn7.22:1.5	Then the Buddha approached that council.	sn7.22	1	5	sn	7.22	 At Khomadussa 
sn7.22:1.6	The brahmins and householders saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,	sn7.22	1	6	sn	7.22	 At Khomadussa 
sn7.22:1.7	and said,	sn7.22	1	7	sn	7.22	 At Khomadussa 
sn7.22:1.8	“Who are these shavelings, these fake ascetics? Don’t they understand the council rules?”	sn7.22	1	8	sn	7.22	 At Khomadussa 
sn7.22:1.9	Then the Buddha addressed the brahmins and householders of Khomadussa in verse:	sn7.22	1	9	sn	7.22	 At Khomadussa 
sn7.22:2.1	“If good people are not present it is no true council;	sn7.22	2	1	sn	7.22	 At Khomadussa

sn7.22:3.2	“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!	sn7.22	3	2	sn	7.22	 At Khomadussa 
sn7.22:3.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	sn7.22	3	3	sn	7.22	 At Khomadussa 
sn7.22:3.4	We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	sn7.22	3	4	sn	7.22	 At Khomadussa

sn8.1:1.1	So I have heard.	sn8.1	1	1	sn	8.1	 Renounced 
sn8.1:1.2	At one time Venerable Vaṅgīsa was staying near Āḷavī, at the Aggāḷava Tree-shrine, together with his mentor, Venerable Nigrodhakappa.	sn8.1	1	2	sn	8.1	 Renounced

sn8.1:1.5	When Vaṅgīsa saw them he became dissatisfied, with lust infecting his mind.	sn8.1	1	5	sn	8.1	 Renounced

sn11.3:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	sn11.3	1	1	sn	11.3	 The Banner’s Crest

sn11.3:1.3	“Mendicants!”	sn11.3	1	3	sn	11.3	 The Banner’s Crest 
sn11.3:1.4	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	sn11.3	1	4	sn	11.3	 The Banner’s Crest 
sn11.3:1.5	The Buddha said this:	sn11.3	1	5	sn	11.3	 The Banner’s Crest 
sn11.3:2.1	“Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons.	sn11.3	2	1	sn	11.3	 The Banner’s Crest 
sn11.3:2.2	Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three:	sn11.3	2	2	sn	11.3	 The Banner’s Crest 
sn11.3:3.1	‘Good sirs, when the gods are fighting, if you get scared or terrified, just look up at my banner’s crest.	sn11.3	3	1	sn	11.3	 The Banner’s Crest

sn11.3:6.2	Then your fear and terror will go away.’	sn11.3	6	2	sn	11.3	 The Banner’s Crest 
sn11.3:7.1	However, when they look up at those banner’s crests their fear and terror might go away or it might not.	sn11.3	7	1	sn	11.3	 The Banner’s Crest 
sn11.3:8.1	Why is that?	sn11.3	8	1	sn	11.3	 The Banner’s Crest 
sn11.3:8.2	Because Sakka is not free of greed, hate, and delusion. He is fearful, scared, nervous, quick to flee.	sn11.3	8	2	sn	11.3	 The Banner’s Crest 
sn11.3:9.1	But, mendicants, I say this:	sn11.3	9	1	sn	11.3	 The Banner’s Crest 
sn11.3:9.2	If you’ve gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut and you get scared or terrified, just recollect me:	sn11.3	9	2	sn	11.3	 The Banner’s Crest 
sn11.3:9.3	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	sn11.3	9	3	sn	11.3	 The Banner’s Crest

sn11.3:11.1	If you can’t recollect the teaching, then recollect the Saṅgha:	sn11.3	11	1	sn	11.3	 The Banner’s Crest 
sn11.3:11.2	‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals.

sn11.3:11.3	Then your fear and terror will go away.	sn11.3	11	3	sn	11.3	 The Banner’s Crest 
sn11.3:12.1	Why is that?	sn11.3	12	1	sn	11.3	 The Banner’s Crest

sn11.3:12.3	That is what the Buddha said.	sn11.3	12	3	sn	11.3	 The Banner’s Crest

sn16.11:8.3	Since I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness, I don’t recall acknowledging any other teacher apart from the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	sn16.11	8	3	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:8.4	Formerly when I was still a layman, I thought:	sn16.11	8	4	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:8.5	‘Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open.	sn16.11	8	5	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:8.6	It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	sn16.11	8	6	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:8.7	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	sn16.11	8	7	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:8.8	After some time I made an outer robe of patches and, in the name of the perfected ones in the world, I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.	sn16.11	8	8	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:9.1	When I had gone forth, I traveled along the road between Rājagaha and Nālanda, where I saw the Buddha sitting at the Bahuputta Shrine.	sn16.11	9	1	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:9.2	Seeing him, I thought:	sn16.11	9	2	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:9.3	‘If I’m ever to see a Teacher, it would be this Blessed One!	sn16.11	9	3	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:9.4	If I’m ever to see a Holy One, it would be this Blessed One!	sn16.11	9	4	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:9.5	If I’m ever to see a fully awakened Buddha, it would be this Blessed One!’	sn16.11	9	5	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:9.7	Then I bowed with my head at the Buddha’s feet and said:	sn16.11	9	7	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:9.8	‘Sir, the Buddha is my Teacher, I am his disciple!	sn16.11	9	8	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:9.9	The Buddha is my Teacher, I am his disciple!’	sn16.11	9	9	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:9.10	The Buddha said to me,	sn16.11	9	10	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:9.11	‘Kassapa, if anyone was to say to such a wholehearted disciple that they know when they don’t know, or that they see when they don’t see, their head would explode.	sn16.11	9	11	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:9.12	But Kassapa, when I say that I know and see I really do know and see.	sn16.11	9	12	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:10.1	So you should train like this:	sn16.11	10	1	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:10.2	“I will set up a keen sense of conscience and prudence for seniors, juniors, and those in the middle.”	sn16.11	10	2	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:10.3	That’s how you should train.	sn16.11	10	3	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:11.1	And you should train like this:	sn16.11	11	1	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:11.2	“Whenever I hear a teaching connected with what’s skillful, I will pay heed, pay attention, engage wholeheartedly, and lend an ear to that teaching.”	sn16.11	11	2	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:11.3	That’s how you should train.	sn16.11	11	3	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:12.1	And you should train like this:	sn16.11	12	1	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:12.2	“I will never neglect mindfulness of the body that is full of pleasure.”	sn16.11	12	2	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:12.3	That’s how you should train.’	sn16.11	12	3	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:13.1	And when the Buddha had given me this advice he got up from his seat and left.	sn16.11	13	1	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:13.2	For seven days I ate the nation’s almsfood as a debtor. On the eighth day I was enlightened.	sn16.11	13	2	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:14.1	And then the Buddha left the road and went to the root of a certain tree.	sn16.11	14	1	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:14.2	So I spread out my outer robe of patches folded in four and said to him,	sn16.11	14	2	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:14.3	‘Sir, sit here. That would be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’	sn16.11	14	3	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:14.4	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out	sn16.11	14	4	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:14.5	and said to me,	sn16.11	14	5	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:14.6	‘Kassapa, this outer robe of patches is soft.’	sn16.11	14	6	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:14.7	‘Sir, please accept my outer robe of patches out of compassion.’	sn16.11	14	7	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:14.8	‘In that case, Kassapa, will you wear my worn-out hempen rag robe?’	sn16.11	14	8	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:14.9	‘I will wear it, sir.’	sn16.11	14	9	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:14.10	And so I presented my outer robe of patches to the Buddha,	sn16.11	14	10	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:14.11	and the Buddha presented me with his worn-out hempen rag robe.	sn16.11	14	11	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:15.1	For if anyone should be rightly called	sn16.11	15	1	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:15.2	the Buddha’s true-born child, born from his mouth, born of the teaching, created by the teaching, heir to the teaching, and receiver of his worn-out hempen rag robes, it’s me.	sn16.11	15	2	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:16.1	Whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. …	sn16.11	16	1	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:16.3	(The nine progressive meditations and the five insights should be treated in full.)	sn16.11	16	3	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:17.1	I have realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And I live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.	sn16.11	17	1	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:17.2	Reverend, you might as well think to hide a bull elephant that’s three or three and a half meters tall behind a palm leaf as to hide my six insights.”	sn16.11	17	2	sn	16.11	 Robes 
sn16.11:18.1	But the nun Thullanandā fell from the spiritual life.	sn16.11	18	1	sn	16.11	 Robes

sn16.12:1.18	That’s why it has not been declared by the Buddha.”	sn16.12	1	18	sn	16.12	 The Realized One After Death

sn21.3:2.6	“With the Buddha.”	sn21.3	2	6	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:2.7	“But Reverend, the Buddha is far away. He’s staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	sn21.3	2	7	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:2.8	Did you go to him with your psychic power,	sn21.3	2	8	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt

sn21.3:2.10	“No reverend, I didn’t go to him with my psychic power,	sn21.3	2	10	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:2.11	nor did he come to me.	sn21.3	2	11	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:2.12	Rather, the Buddha cleared his clairvoyance and clairaudience towards me,	sn21.3	2	12	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:2.13	and I cleared my clairvoyance and clairaudience towards him.”	sn21.3	2	13	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:2.14	“But what manner of Dhamma talk did you have together?”	sn21.3	2	14	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:3.1	“Well, reverend, I said to the Buddha,	sn21.3	3	1	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:3.2	‘Sir, they speak of one who is energetic.	sn21.3	3	2	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:3.3	How is an energetic person defined?’	sn21.3	3	3	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:3.4	When I said this, the Buddha said,	sn21.3	3	4	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:3.5	‘Moggallāna, it’s when a mendicant lives with energy roused up:	sn21.3	3	5	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:3.6	“Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.”	sn21.3	3	6	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:3.7	That’s how a person is energetic.’	sn21.3	3	7	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:3.8	That’s the Dhamma talk I had together with the Buddha.”	sn21.3	3	8	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:4.1	“Reverend, next to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna I’m like a few pieces of gravel next to the Himalayas, the king of mountains.	sn21.3	4	1	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:4.3	Venerable Mahāmoggallāna is so mighty and powerful he could, if he wished, live on for the eon.”	sn21.3	4	3	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:5.1	“Reverend, next to Venerable Sāriputta I’m like a few grains of salt next to a mound of salt.	sn21.3	5	1	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:5.3	Venerable Sāriputta has been commended, complimented, and praised by the Buddha:	sn21.3	5	3	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:6.1	‘In wisdom,	sn21.3	6	1	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt

sn21.3:6.3	any mendicant who has crossed over	sn21.3	6	3	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:6.4	can at best equal Sāriputta.’”	sn21.3	6	4	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.3:7.1	And so these two spiritual giants agreed with each others’ fine words.	sn21.3	7	1	sn	21.3	 A Mound of Salt 
sn21.4:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	sn21.4	1	1	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant 
sn21.4:1.2	Now at that time a certain junior monk, after his meal, on his return from alms-round, entered his dwelling, where he adhered to passivity and silence. And he didn’t help the mendicants out when it was time to sew robes.	sn21.4	1	2	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant 
sn21.4:1.3	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	sn21.4	1	3	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant 
sn21.4:2.1	So the Buddha addressed a certain monk,	sn21.4	2	1	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant 
sn21.4:2.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell that monk that the Teacher summons him.”	sn21.4	2	2	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant 
sn21.4:2.3	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to that monk and said to him,	sn21.4	2	3	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant 
sn21.4:2.4	“Reverend, the teacher summons you.”	sn21.4	2	4	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant 
sn21.4:2.5	“Yes, reverend,” that monk replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:	sn21.4	2	5	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant 
sn21.4:2.6	“Is it really true, monk, that after your meal, on your return from alms-round, you entered your dwelling, where you adhered to passivity and silence, and you didn’t help the mendicants out when it was time to sew robes?”	sn21.4	2	6	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant 
sn21.4:2.7	“Sir, I am doing my own work.”	sn21.4	2	7	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant 
sn21.4:3.1	Then the Buddha, knowing what that monk was thinking, addressed the mendicants:	sn21.4	3	1	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant 
sn21.4:3.2	“Mendicants, don’t complain about this monk.	sn21.4	3	2	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant 
sn21.4:3.3	This monk gets the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when he wants, without trouble or difficulty. He has realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life, and lives having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.”	sn21.4	3	3	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant 
sn21.4:4.1	That is what the Buddha said.	sn21.4	4	1	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant 
sn21.4:4.2	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	sn21.4	4	2	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant 
sn21.4:5.1	“Not by being slack,	sn21.4	5	1	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant 
sn21.4:5.2	or with little strength	sn21.4	5	2	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant 
sn21.4:5.3	is extinguishment realized,	sn21.4	5	3	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant 
sn21.4:5.4	the freedom from all suffering.	sn21.4	5	4	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant 
sn21.4:6.1	This young monk,	sn21.4	6	1	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant 
sn21.4:6.2	this best of men,	sn21.4	6	2	sn	21.4	 A Junior Mendicant

sn21.5:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	sn21.5	1	1	sn	21.5	 With Sujāta 
sn21.5:1.2	Then Venerable Sujāta went to see the Buddha.	sn21.5	1	2	sn	21.5	 With Sujāta 
sn21.5:1.3	The Buddha saw him coming off in the distance,	sn21.5	1	3	sn	21.5	 With Sujāta 
sn21.5:1.4	and addressed the mendicants:	sn21.5	1	4	sn	21.5	 With Sujāta 
sn21.5:1.5	“This gentleman is beautiful in both ways.	sn21.5	1	5	sn	21.5	 With Sujāta 
sn21.5:1.6	He’s attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. And he has realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lives having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.”	sn21.5	1	6	sn	21.5	 With Sujāta 
sn21.5:1.7	That is what the Buddha said.	sn21.5	1	7	sn	21.5	 With Sujāta 
sn21.5:1.8	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	sn21.5	1	8	sn	21.5	 With Sujāta 
sn21.5:2.1	“This mendicant is truly beautiful.	sn21.5	2	1	sn	21.5	 With Sujāta 
sn21.5:2.2	His heart is upright,	sn21.5	2	2	sn	21.5	 With Sujāta 
sn21.5:2.3	he’s unfettered, detached,	sn21.5	2	3	sn	21.5	 With Sujāta

sn21.6:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	sn21.6	1	1	sn	21.6	 With Bhaddiya the Dwarf
sn21.6:1.2	Then Venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf went to see the Buddha.	sn21.6	1	2	sn	21.6	 With Bhaddiya the Dwarf
sn21.6:1.3	The Buddha saw him coming off in the distance,	sn21.6	1	3	sn	21.6	 With Bhaddiya the Dwarf
sn21.6:1.4	and addressed the mendicants:	sn21.6	1	4	sn	21.6	 With Bhaddiya the Dwarf
sn21.6:1.5	“Mendicants, do you you see this monk coming—ugly, unsightly, deformed, and despised by the mendicants?”	sn21.6	1	5	sn	21.6	 With Bhaddiya the Dwarf
sn21.6:1.6	“Yes, sir.”	sn21.6	1	6	sn	21.6	 With Bhaddiya the Dwarf
sn21.6:1.7	“That mendicant is very mighty and powerful. It’s not easy to find an attainment that he has not already attained.	sn21.6	1	7	sn	21.6	 With Bhaddiya the Dwarf
sn21.6:1.8	And he has realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lives having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.”	sn21.6	1	8	sn	21.6	 With Bhaddiya the Dwarf
sn21.6:1.9	That is what the Buddha said.	sn21.6	1	9	sn	21.6	 With Bhaddiya the Dwarf
sn21.6:1.10	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	sn21.6	1	10	sn	21.6	 With Bhaddiya the Dwarf
sn21.6:2.1	“Geese, herons, and peacocks,	sn21.6	2	1	sn	21.6	 With Bhaddiya the Dwarf

sn21.6:2.3	though their bodies are not equal,	sn21.6	2	3	sn	21.6	 With Bhaddiya the Dwarf
sn21.6:2.4	they all fear the lion.	sn21.6	2	4	sn	21.6	 With Bhaddiya the Dwarf
sn21.6:3.1	So it is for humans—	sn21.6	3	1	sn	21.6	 With Bhaddiya the Dwarf
sn21.6:3.2	if a little person is wise,	sn21.6	3	2	sn	21.6	 With Bhaddiya the Dwarf
sn21.6:3.3	they’re the truly great one,	sn21.6	3	3	sn	21.6	 With Bhaddiya the Dwarf
sn21.6:3.4	not the fool with a good body.”	sn21.6	3	4	sn	21.6	 With Bhaddiya the Dwarf
sn21.7:1.1	So I have heard.	sn21.7	1	1	sn	21.7	 With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son 
sn21.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	sn21.7	1	2	sn	21.7	 With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son 
sn21.7:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Visākha, Pañcāli’s son, was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk. His words were polished, clear, articulate, expressing the meaning, comprehensive, and independent.	sn21.7	1	3	sn	21.7	 With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son 
sn21.7:2.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall. He sat down on the seat spread out,	sn21.7	2	1	sn	21.7	 With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son 
sn21.7:2.2	and addressed the mendicants:	sn21.7	2	2	sn	21.7	 With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son 
sn21.7:2.3	“Mendicants, who was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk?”	sn21.7	2	3	sn	21.7	 With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son 
sn21.7:2.4	“Sir, it was Venerable Visākha, Pañcāli’s son.”	sn21.7	2	4	sn	21.7	 With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son 
sn21.7:3.1	Then the Buddha said to Visākha:	sn21.7	3	1	sn	21.7	 With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son 
sn21.7:3.2	“Good, good, Visākha!	sn21.7	3	2	sn	21.7	 With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son 
sn21.7:3.3	It’s good that you educate, encourage, fire up, and inspire the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk, with words that are polished, clear, articulate, expressing the meaning, comprehensive, and independent.”	sn21.7	3	3	sn	21.7	 With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son 
sn21.7:4.1	That is what the Buddha said.	sn21.7	4	1	sn	21.7	 With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son 
sn21.7:4.2	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	sn21.7	4	2	sn	21.7	 With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son 
sn21.7:5.1	“Though an astute person is mixed up with fools,	sn21.7	5	1	sn	21.7	 With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son 
sn21.7:5.2	they don’t know unless he speaks.	sn21.7	5	2	sn	21.7	 With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son 
sn21.7:5.3	But when he speaks they know,	sn21.7	5	3	sn	21.7	 With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son 
sn21.7:5.4	he’s teaching the deathless state.	sn21.7	5	4	sn	21.7	 With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son 
sn21.7:6.1	He should speak and illustrate the teaching,	sn21.7	6	1	sn	21.7	 With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son 
sn21.7:6.2	holding up the banner of the hermits.	sn21.7	6	2	sn	21.7	 With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son 
sn21.7:6.3	Words well spoken are the hermits’ banner,	sn21.7	6	3	sn	21.7	 With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son 
sn21.7:6.4	for the teaching is the banner of the hermits.”	sn21.7	6	4	sn	21.7	 With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son 
sn21.8:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	sn21.8	1	1	sn	21.8	 With Nanda 
sn21.8:1.2	Then Venerable Nanda—the Buddha’s cousin on his mother’s side—dressed in nicely pressed and ironed robes, applied eyeshadow, and took a polished black bowl. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:	sn21.8	1	2	sn	21.8	 With Nanda 
sn21.8:1.3	“Nanda, as a gentleman who has gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness, it’s not appropriate for you to dress in nicely pressed and ironed robes, apply eyeshadow, and carry a polished black bowl.	sn21.8	1	3	sn	21.8	 With Nanda 
sn21.8:1.4	It’s appropriate for you to stay in the wilderness, eat only alms-food, wear rag robes, and live without concern for sensual pleasures.”	sn21.8	1	4	sn	21.8	 With Nanda 
sn21.8:1.5	That is what the Buddha said.	sn21.8	1	5	sn	21.8	 With Nanda 
sn21.8:1.6	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	sn21.8	1	6	sn	21.8	 With Nanda 
sn21.8:2.1	“When will I see Nanda	sn21.8	2	1	sn	21.8	 With Nanda 
sn21.8:2.2	in the wilderness, wearing rag robes,	sn21.8	2	2	sn	21.8	 With Nanda 
sn21.8:2.3	feeding on scraps offered by strangers,	sn21.8	2	3	sn	21.8	 With Nanda 
sn21.8:2.4	unconcerned for sensual pleasures?”	sn21.8	2	4	sn	21.8	 With Nanda 
sn21.8:3.1	Then some time later Venerable Nanda stayed in the wilderness, ate only alms-food, wore rag robes, and lived without concern for sensual pleasures.	sn21.8	3	1	sn	21.8	 With Nanda 
sn21.9:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	sn21.9	1	1	sn	21.9	 With Tissa 
sn21.9:1.2	Then Venerable Tissa—the Buddha’s cousin on his father’s side—went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. He was miserable and sad, with tears flowing. Then the Buddha said to him:	sn21.9	1	2	sn	21.9	 With Tissa 
sn21.9:1.3	“Tissa, why are you sitting there so miserable and sad, with tears flowing?”	sn21.9	1	3	sn	21.9	 With Tissa 
sn21.9:1.4	“Sir, it’s because the mendicants on all sides provoke me with barbed words.”	sn21.9	1	4	sn	21.9	 With Tissa 
sn21.9:1.5	“That’s because you admonish others, but don’t accept admonition yourself.	sn21.9	1	5	sn	21.9	 With Tissa 
sn21.9:1.6	As a gentleman who has gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness, it’s not appropriate for you to admonish others without accepting admonition yourself.	sn21.9	1	6	sn	21.9	 With Tissa 
sn21.9:1.7	It’s appropriate for you to	sn21.9	1	7	sn	21.9	 With Tissa 
sn21.9:1.8	admonish others and accept admonition yourself.”	sn21.9	1	8	sn	21.9	 With Tissa 
sn21.9:2.1	That is what the Buddha said.	sn21.9	2	1	sn	21.9	 With Tissa 
sn21.9:2.2	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	sn21.9	2	2	sn	21.9	 With Tissa 
sn21.9:3.1	“Why are you angry? Don’t be angry!	sn21.9	3	1	sn	21.9	 With Tissa 
sn21.9:3.2	It’s better to not be angry, Tissa.	sn21.9	3	2	sn	21.9	 With Tissa 
sn21.9:3.3	For this spiritual life is lived	sn21.9	3	3	sn	21.9	 With Tissa 
sn21.9:3.4	in order to remove anger, conceit, and denigration.”	sn21.9	3	4	sn	21.9	 With Tissa 
sn21.10:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	sn21.10	1	1	sn	21.10	 A Mendicant Named Senior 
sn21.10:1.2	Now at that time there was a certain mendicant named Senior. He lived alone and praised living alone.	sn21.10	1	2	sn	21.10	 A Mendicant Named Senior 
sn21.10:1.3	He entered the village for alms alone, returned alone, sat in private alone, and concentrated on walking mindfully alone.	sn21.10	1	3	sn	21.10	 A Mendicant Named Senior 
sn21.10:1.4	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	sn21.10	1	4	sn	21.10	 A Mendicant Named Senior 
sn21.10:1.5	“Sir, there’s a certain mendicant named Senior who lives alone and praises living alone.”	sn21.10	1	5	sn	21.10	 A Mendicant Named Senior 
sn21.10:2.1	So the Buddha addressed a certain monk,	sn21.10	2	1	sn	21.10	 A Mendicant Named Senior 
sn21.10:2.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Senior that	sn21.10	2	2	sn	21.10	 A Mendicant Named Senior

sn21.10:2.4	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Venerable Senior and said to him,	sn21.10	2	4	sn	21.10	 A Mendicant Named Senior

sn21.10:2.10	“Well, sir, I enter the village for alms alone, return alone, sit in private alone, and concentrate on walking mindfully alone.	sn21.10	2	10	sn	21.10	 A Mendicant Named Senior 
sn21.10:2.11	That’s how I live alone and praise living alone.”	sn21.10	2	11	sn	21.10	 A Mendicant Named Senior 
sn21.10:3.1	“That is a kind of living alone, I don’t deny it.	sn21.10	3	1	sn	21.10	 A Mendicant Named Senior 
sn21.10:3.2	But as to how living alone is fulfilled in detail,	sn21.10	3	2	sn	21.10	 A Mendicant Named Senior

sn21.10:3.7	That’s how living alone is fulfilled in detail.”	sn21.10	3	7	sn	21.10	 A Mendicant Named Senior 
sn21.10:4.1	That is what the Buddha said.	sn21.10	4	1	sn	21.10	 A Mendicant Named Senior

sn22.1:1.1	So I have heard.	sn22.1	1	1	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.	sn22.1	1	2	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:1.3	Then the householder Nakula’s father went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:	sn22.1	1	3	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:2.1	“Sir, I’m an old man, elderly and senior. I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life. My body is ailing and I’m constantly unwell.	sn22.1	2	1	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:2.2	I hardly ever get to see the esteemed mendicants.	sn22.1	2	2	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:2.3	May the Buddha please advise me	sn22.1	2	3	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:2.4	and instruct me.	sn22.1	2	4	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:2.5	It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”	sn22.1	2	5	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:3.1	“That’s so true, householder! That’s so true, householder!	sn22.1	3	1	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:3.2	For this body is ailing, trapped in its shell.	sn22.1	3	2	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:3.3	If anyone dragging around this body claimed to be healthy even for a minute, what’s that but foolishness?	sn22.1	3	3	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:3.4	So you should train like this:	sn22.1	3	4	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:3.5	‘Though my body is ailing, my mind will be healthy.’	sn22.1	3	5	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:3.6	That’s how you should train.”	sn22.1	3	6	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:4.1	And then the householder Nakula’s father approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went up to Venerable Sāriputta, bowed, and sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to him:	sn22.1	4	1	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:4.2	“Householder, your faculties are so very clear,	sn22.1	4	2	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:4.3	and your complexion is pure and bright.	sn22.1	4	3	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:4.4	Did you get to hear a Dhamma talk in the Buddha’s presence today?”	sn22.1	4	4	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:5.1	“What else, sir, could it possibly be?	sn22.1	5	1	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father

sn22.1:5.3	“But what kind of ambrosial Dhamma talk has the Buddha anointed you with?”	sn22.1	5	3	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:5.4	So Nakula’s father told Sāriputta all that had happened, and said,	sn22.1	5	4	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:6.8	“That’s the ambrosial Dhamma talk that the Buddha anointed me with.”	sn22.1	6	8	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father

sn22.1:8.2	“Yes, sir,” replied Nakula’s father.	sn22.1	8	2	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:8.3	Sāriputta said this:	sn22.1	8	3	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:9.1	“And how is a person ailing in body and ailing in mind?	sn22.1	9	1	sn	22.1	 Nakula’s Father

sn22.2:4.4	‘But what does the venerables’ Teacher teach? What does he explain?’ I trust the venerables have properly heard, learned, attended, and remembered the teachings, and penetrated them with wisdom.

sn22.80:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.	sn22.80	1	1	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:1.2	Then the Buddha, having dismissed the mendicant Saṅgha for some reason, robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kapilavatthu for alms.	sn22.80	1	2	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:1.3	He wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Great Wood,	sn22.80	1	3	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:1.4	plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a young wood apple tree for the day’s meditation.	sn22.80	1	4	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:2.1	Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	sn22.80	2	1	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:2.2	“I’ve sent the mendicant Saṅgha away.	sn22.80	2	2	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:2.3	But there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training.	sn22.80	2	3	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:2.4	Not seeing me they may change and fall apart.	sn22.80	2	4	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:2.5	If a young calf doesn’t see its mother it may change and fall apart. …	sn22.80	2	5	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:2.7	Or if young seedlings don’t get water they may change and fall apart.	sn22.80	2	7	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:2.8	In the same way, there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training.	sn22.80	2	8	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:2.9	Not seeing me they may change and fall apart.	sn22.80	2	9	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:2.10	Why don’t I support the mendicant Saṅgha now as I did in the past?”	sn22.80	2	10	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:3.1	Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha.	sn22.80	3	1	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:3.2	He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:	sn22.80	3	2	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:3.3	“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!	sn22.80	3	3	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:3.4	The Buddha has sent the mendicant Saṅgha away.	sn22.80	3	4	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:3.5	But there are mendicants who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. …	sn22.80	3	5	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:3.11	May the Buddha be happy with the mendicant Saṅgha!	sn22.80	3	11	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:3.12	May the Buddha welcome the mendicant Saṅgha!	sn22.80	3	12	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:3.13	May the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past!”	sn22.80	3	13	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:4.1	The Buddha consented in silence.	sn22.80	4	1	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:4.2	Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing that the Buddha had consented, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.	sn22.80	4	2	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:5.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the Banyan Tree Monastery, where he sat on the seat spread out.	sn22.80	5	1	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:5.2	Then he used his psychic power to will that the mendicants would come to him timidly, alone or in pairs.	sn22.80	5	2	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:5.3	Those mendicants approached the Buddha timidly, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them:	sn22.80	5	3	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:6.1	“Mendicants, this relying on alms is an extreme lifestyle.	sn22.80	6	1	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:6.2	The world curses you: ‘You beggar, walking bowl in hand!’	sn22.80	6	2	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:6.3	Yet earnest gentlemen take it up for a good reason.	sn22.80	6	3	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:6.4	Not because they’ve been forced to by kings or bandits, or because they’re in debt or threatened, or to earn a living.	sn22.80	6	4	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:6.5	But because they’re swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They’re swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.	sn22.80	6	5	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:6.6	And they think, ‘Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’	sn22.80	6	6	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:7.1	That’s how this gentleman has gone forth.	sn22.80	7	1	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:7.2	Yet they covet sensual pleasures; they’re infatuated, full of ill will and malicious intent. They are unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying mind and undisciplined faculties.	sn22.80	7	2	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:7.3	Suppose there was a firebrand for lighting a funeral pyre, burning at both ends, and smeared with dung in the middle. It couldn’t be used as timber either in the village or the wilderness.	sn22.80	7	3	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:7.4	I say that person is just like this. They’ve missed out on the pleasures of the lay life, and haven’t fulfilled the goal of the ascetic life.	sn22.80	7	4	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:8.1	There are these three unskillful thoughts.	sn22.80	8	1	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:8.2	Sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts.	sn22.80	8	2	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:8.3	And where do these three unskillful thoughts cease without anything left over?	sn22.80	8	3	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:8.4	In those who meditate with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation; or who develop signless immersion.	sn22.80	8	4	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:8.5	Just this much is quite enough motivation to develop signless immersion.	sn22.80	8	5	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:8.6	When signless immersion is developed and cultivated it is very fruitful and beneficial.	sn22.80	8	6	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:9.1	There are these two views.	sn22.80	9	1	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:9.2	Views favoring continued existence and views favoring ending existence.	sn22.80	9	2	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:9.3	A noble disciple reflects on this:	sn22.80	9	3	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:9.4	‘Is there anything in the world that I could grasp without fault?’	sn22.80	9	4	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:9.5	They understand:	sn22.80	9	5	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:9.6	‘There’s nothing in the world that I could grasp without fault.	sn22.80	9	6	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:9.7	For in grasping I would grasp only at form, feeling,	sn22.80	9	7	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:9.8	perception,	sn22.80	9	8	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:9.9	choices, or consciousness.	sn22.80	9	9	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:9.10	That grasping of mine would be a condition for continued existence.	sn22.80	9	10	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:9.11	Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.	sn22.80	9	11	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:9.12	Rebirth is a condition that gives rise to old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.	sn22.80	9	12	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:9.13	That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.	sn22.80	9	13	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:10.1	What do you think, mendicants?	sn22.80	10	1	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:10.2	Is form permanent or impermanent?”	sn22.80	10	2	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:10.3	“Impermanent, sir.”	sn22.80	10	3	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:10.4	“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”	sn22.80	10	4	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:10.5	“Suffering, sir.”	sn22.80	10	5	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:10.6	“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:	sn22.80	10	6	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:10.7	‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”	sn22.80	10	7	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:10.8	“No, sir.”	sn22.80	10	8	sn	22.80	 Beggars

sn22.80:10.14	Seeing this …	sn22.80	10	14	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.80:10.15	They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’”	sn22.80	10	15	sn	22.80	 Beggars 
sn22.81:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery.	sn22.81	1	1	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:1.2	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kosambi for alms.	sn22.81	1	2	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:1.3	After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he set his lodgings in order himself. Taking his bowl and robe, without informing his attendants or taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha, he set out to go wandering alone, with no companion.	sn22.81	1	3	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:2.1	Then, not long after the Buddha had left, one of the mendicants went to Venerable Ānanda and told him what had happened.	sn22.81	2	1	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:2.3	Ānanda said, “Reverend, when the Buddha leaves like this it means he wants to stay alone.	sn22.81	2	3	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:2.4	At this time no-one should follow him.”	sn22.81	2	4	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:3.1	Then the Buddha, traveling stage by stage, arrived at Pārileyya,	sn22.81	3	1	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:3.2	where he stayed at the root of a sacred sal tree.	sn22.81	3	2	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:3.3	Then several mendicants went up to Venerable Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him.	sn22.81	3	3	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:3.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him,	sn22.81	3	4	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:3.5	“Reverend, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.	sn22.81	3	5	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:3.6	We wish to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.”	sn22.81	3	6	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:4.1	Then Venerable Ānanda together with those mendicants went to Pārileyya to see the Buddha. They bowed and sat down to one side,	sn22.81	4	1	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:4.2	and the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk.	sn22.81	4	2	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:4.3	Now at that time one of the monks had the thought,	sn22.81	4	3	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:4.4	“How do you know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life?”	sn22.81	4	4	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:4.5	Then the Buddha, knowing what that monk was thinking, addressed the mendicants:	sn22.81	4	5	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:4.6	“Mendicants, I’ve taught the Dhamma analytically.	sn22.81	4	6	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:4.7	I’ve analytically taught the four kinds of mindfulness meditation,	sn22.81	4	7	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:4.8	the four right efforts,	sn22.81	4	8	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:4.9	the four bases of psychic power,	sn22.81	4	9	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:4.10	the five faculties,	sn22.81	4	10	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:4.11	the five powers,	sn22.81	4	11	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:4.12	the seven awakening factors,	sn22.81	4	12	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:4.13	and the noble eightfold path.	sn22.81	4	13	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:4.14	That’s how I’ve taught the Dhamma analytically.	sn22.81	4	14	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:4.15	Though I’ve taught the Dhamma analytically, still a certain mendicant present here has this thought:	sn22.81	4	15	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:4.16	‘How do you know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life?’	sn22.81	4	16	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:5.1	And how, mendicants, do you know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life?	sn22.81	5	1	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:5.2	Take an uneducated ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons.	sn22.81	5	2	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:5.3	They regard form as self.	sn22.81	5	3	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:5.4	But that regarding is just a conditioned phenomenon.	sn22.81	5	4	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:5.5	And what’s the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of that conditioned phenomenon?	sn22.81	5	5	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:5.6	When an uneducated ordinary person is struck by feelings born of contact with ignorance, craving arises.	sn22.81	5	6	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya 
sn22.81:5.7	That conditioned phenomenon is born from that.	sn22.81	5	7	sn	22.81	 At Pārileyya

sn22.82:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	sn22.82	1	1	sn	22.82	 A Full Moon Night 
sn22.82:1.2	Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.	sn22.82	1	2	sn	22.82	 A Full Moon Night 
sn22.82:2.1	Then one of the mendicants got up from their seat, arranged their robe over one shoulder, raised their joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:	sn22.82	2	1	sn	22.82	 A Full Moon Night 
sn22.82:2.2	“Sir, I’d like to ask the Buddha about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”	sn22.82	2	2	sn	22.82	 A Full Moon Night

sn22.82:2.4	“Yes, sir,” replied that mendicant. He took his seat and said to the Buddha:	sn22.82	2	4	sn	22.82	 A Full Moon Night 
sn22.82:2.5	“Sir, are these the five grasping aggregates, that is:	sn22.82	2	5	sn	22.82	 A Full Moon Night

sn22.82:4.1	“But sir, what is the root of these five grasping aggregates?”	sn22.82	4	1	sn	22.82	 A Full Moon Night

sn22.82:4.4	“Neither. Rather, the desire and greed for them is the grasping there.”	sn22.82	4	4	sn	22.82	 A Full Moon Night 
sn22.82:4.5	Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question:	sn22.82	4	5	sn	22.82	 A Full Moon Night 
sn22.82:5.1	“But sir, can there be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates?”	sn22.82	5	1	sn	22.82	 A Full Moon Night 
sn22.82:5.2	“There can,” said the Buddha.	sn22.82	5	2	sn	22.82	 A Full Moon Night

sn22.82:8.1	“Sir, how does identity view come about?”	sn22.82	8	1	sn	22.82	 A Full Moon Night

sn22.82:11.1	“Sir, how does one know and see so that there’s no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli?”	sn22.82	11	1	sn	22.82	 A Full Moon Night 
sn22.82:11.2	“One truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	sn22.82	11	2	sn	22.82	 A Full Moon Night

sn22.82:12.1	Now at that time one of the mendicants had the thought:	sn22.82	12	1	sn	22.82	 A Full Moon Night 
sn22.82:12.2	“So it seems, good sir, that form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self.	sn22.82	12	2	sn	22.82	 A Full Moon Night 
sn22.82:12.3	Then what self will the deeds done by not-self affect?”	sn22.82	12	3	sn	22.82	 A Full Moon Night 
sn22.82:12.4	Then the Buddha, knowing what that monk was thinking, addressed the mendicants:	sn22.82	12	4	sn	22.82	 A Full Moon Night 
sn22.82:13.1	“It’s possible that some foolish person here—unknowing and ignorant, their mind dominated by craving—thinks they can overstep the teacher’s instructions. They think:	sn22.82	13	1	sn	22.82	 A Full Moon Night

sn22.84:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	sn22.84	1	1	sn	22.84	 With Tissa 
sn22.84:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Tissa, the Buddha’s paternal cousin, informed several mendicants:	sn22.84	1	2	sn	22.84	 With Tissa 
sn22.84:1.3	“Reverends, my body feels like it’s drugged. I’m disorientated, the teachings don’t inspire me, and dullness and drowsiness fill my mind. I lead the spiritual life dissatisfied, and have doubts about the teachings.”	sn22.84	1	3	sn	22.84	 With Tissa 
sn22.84:2.1	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	sn22.84	2	1	sn	22.84	 With Tissa 
sn22.84:3.1	So the Buddha addressed a certain monk,	sn22.84	3	1	sn	22.84	 With Tissa

sn22.84:11.2	Satisfied, Venerable Tissa was happy with what the Buddha said.	sn22.84	11	2	sn	22.84	 With Tissa 
sn22.85:1.1	At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	sn22.85	1	1	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:1.2	Now at that time a mendicant called Yamaka had the following harmful misconception:	sn22.85	1	2	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:1.3	“As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death.”	sn22.85	1	3	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:2.1	Several mendicants heard about this.	sn22.85	2	1	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:2.3	They went to Yamaka and exchanged greetings with him.	sn22.85	2	3	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:2.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him,	sn22.85	2	4	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:3.1	“Is it really true, Reverend Yamaka, that you have such a harmful misconception:	sn22.85	3	1	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:3.2	‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death.’”	sn22.85	3	2	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:3.3	“Yes, reverends, that’s how I understand the Buddha’s teaching.”	sn22.85	3	3	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:4.1	“Don’t say that, Yamaka! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that.”	sn22.85	4	1	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:4.3	But even though admonished by those mendicants, Yamaka obstinately stuck to that misconception and insisted on stating it.	sn22.85	4	3	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:5.1	When those mendicants were unable to dissuade Yamaka from that misconception, they got up from their seats and went to see Venerable Sāriputta. They told him what had happened, and said,	sn22.85	5	1	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:5.4	“May Venerable Sāriputta please go to the mendicant Yamaka out of compassion.”	sn22.85	5	4	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:5.5	Sāriputta consented in silence.	sn22.85	5	5	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:5.6	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Yamaka and exchanged greetings with him. Seated to one side he said to Yamaka:	sn22.85	5	6	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka

sn22.85:14.1	“Good, good, Reverend Yamaka!	sn22.85	14	1	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:14.2	Well then, I shall give you a simile to make the meaning even clearer.	sn22.85	14	2	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:14.3	Suppose there was a householder or householder’s son who was rich, with a lot of money and great wealth,	sn22.85	14	3	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:14.4	and a bodyguard for protection.	sn22.85	14	4	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:14.5	Then along comes a person who wants to harm, injure, and threaten him, and take his life.	sn22.85	14	5	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:14.6	They’d think:	sn22.85	14	6	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:14.7	‘This householder or householder’s son is rich, with a lot of money and great wealth,	sn22.85	14	7	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka

sn22.85:14.12	‘Sir, I would serve you.’	sn22.85	14	12	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:14.13	Then they would serve that householder or householder’s son.	sn22.85	14	13	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:14.14	They’d get up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely.	sn22.85	14	14	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka 
sn22.85:14.15	The householder or householder’s son would consider them as a friend	sn22.85	14	15	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka

sn22.85:15.1	What do you think, Yamaka?	sn22.85	15	1	sn	22.85	 With Yamaka

sn22.87:1.12	The Buddha consented in silence.	sn22.87	1	12	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali

sn22.87:2.2	Venerable Vakkali saw the Buddha coming off in the distance and tried to rise on his cot.	sn22.87	2	2	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali

sn22.87:4.4	“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”	sn22.87	4	4	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali 
sn22.87:4.5	“Suffering, sir.”	sn22.87	4	5	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali

sn22.87:5.1	And then, after giving Venerable Vakkali this advice, the Buddha got up from his seat and went to the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.	sn22.87	5	1	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali 
sn22.87:5.2	Then Venerable Vakkali addressed his carers,	sn22.87	5	2	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali 
sn22.87:5.3	“Come on, reverends, lift my cot and take me to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili.	sn22.87	5	3	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali 
sn22.87:5.4	It’s unthinkable for one like me to die in an inhabited area!”	sn22.87	5	4	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali 
sn22.87:5.5	“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants, and did as he asked.	sn22.87	5	5	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali 
sn22.87:5.6	Meanwhile, the Buddha spent the rest of that night and day on Vulture’s Peak Mountain.	sn22.87	5	6	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali 
sn22.87:5.7	Then, late at night, two glorious deities, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side.	sn22.87	5	7	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali 
sn22.87:5.8	One deity said to him,	sn22.87	5	8	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali 
sn22.87:5.9	“Sir, the mendicant Vakkali is intent on liberation!”	sn22.87	5	9	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali 
sn22.87:5.10	And another deity said to him,	sn22.87	5	10	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali 
sn22.87:5.11	“He’ll definitely be well-freed!”	sn22.87	5	11	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali 
sn22.87:5.12	This is what those deities said.	sn22.87	5	12	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali 
sn22.87:5.13	Then they bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right side, before vanishing right there.	sn22.87	5	13	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali 
sn22.87:6.1	Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:	sn22.87	6	1	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali 
sn22.87:6.2	“Come, mendicants, go to the mendicant Vakkali and tell him:	sn22.87	6	2	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali

sn22.87:7.2	Late last night, two glorious deities, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side.	sn22.87	7	2	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali 
sn22.87:7.3	One deity said to him,	sn22.87	7	3	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali 
sn22.87:7.4	“Sir, the mendicant Vakkali is intent on liberation!”	sn22.87	7	4	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali

sn22.87:7.6	“He’ll definitely be well-freed!”	sn22.87	7	6	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali

sn22.87:7.11	“Yes, sir,” those monks replied. They went to Vakkali and said to him:	sn22.87	7	11	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali

sn22.87:8.1	Then Vakkali addressed his carers,	sn22.87	8	1	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali 
sn22.87:8.2	“Please, reverends, help me off my cot.	sn22.87	8	2	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali

sn22.87:8.4	“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants, and helped him off his cot.	sn22.87	8	4	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali 
sn22.87:8.5	They repeated what the Buddha had said.	sn22.87	8	5	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali

sn22.87:9.1	Then those senior mendicants went up to the Buddha and told him Vakkali’s message.	sn22.87	9	1	sn	22.87	 With Vakkali

sn22.90:3.2	“I too think in this way. …	sn22.90	3	2	sn	22.90	 With Channa 
sn22.90:3.12	And yet my mind isn’t eager, confident, settled, and decided about the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.	sn22.90	3	12	sn	22.90	 With Channa 
sn22.90:3.13	Anxiety and grasping arise.	sn22.90	3	13	sn	22.90	 With Channa 
sn22.90:3.14	And the mind reverts to thinking:	sn22.90	3	14	sn	22.90	 With Channa 
sn22.90:3.15	‘So then who exactly is my self?’	sn22.90	3	15	sn	22.90	 With Channa 
sn22.90:3.16	But that doesn’t happen for someone who sees the teaching.	sn22.90	3	16	sn	22.90	 With Channa 
sn22.90:3.17	Who can teach me the Dhamma so that I can see the teaching?”	sn22.90	3	17	sn	22.90	 With Channa 
sn22.90:4.1	Then Venerable Channa thought,	sn22.90	4	1	sn	22.90	 With Channa 
sn22.90:4.2	“The Venerable Ānanda is staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. He’s praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions. He’s quite capable of teaching me the Dhamma so that I can see the teaching.	sn22.90	4	2	sn	22.90	 With Channa 
sn22.90:4.3	Since I have so much trust in Venerable Ānanda,	sn22.90	4	3	sn	22.90	 With Channa 
sn22.90:4.4	why don’t I go to see him?”	sn22.90	4	4	sn	22.90	 With Channa 
sn22.90:4.5	Then Channa set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Kosambi. He went to see Ānanda in Ghosita’s Monastery, exchanged greetings with him, and told him what had happened. Then he said,	sn22.90	4	5	sn	22.90	 With Channa 
sn22.90:7.5	“May Venerable Ānanda advise me and instruct me! May he give me a Dhamma talk so that I can see the teaching!”	sn22.90	7	5	sn	22.90	 With Channa 
sn22.90:8.1	“I’m already delighted with Venerable Channa. Hopefully you’ve opened yourself up and cut through your emotional barrenness.	sn22.90	8	1	sn	22.90	 With Channa 
sn22.90:8.2	Listen well, Channa.	sn22.90	8	2	sn	22.90	 With Channa

sn22.90:9.1	“Reverend Channa, I heard and learned in the presence of the Buddha his advice to the mendicant Kaccānagotta:	sn22.90	9	1	sn	22.90	 With Channa 
sn22.90:9.2	‘Kaccāna, this world mostly relies on the dual notions of existence and non-existence.	sn22.90	9	2	sn	22.90	 With Channa

sn22.90:9.4	And when you truly see the cessation of the world with right understanding, you won’t have the notion of existence regarding the world.	sn22.90	9	4	sn	22.90	 With Channa 
sn22.90:9.5	The world is for the most part shackled by attraction, grasping, and insisting.	sn22.90	9	5	sn	22.90	 With Channa 
sn22.90:9.6	But if—when it comes to this attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendency—you don’t get attracted, grasp, and commit to the notion “my self”,	sn22.90	9	6	sn	22.90	 With Channa 
sn22.90:9.7	you’ll have no doubt or uncertainty that what arises is just suffering arising, and what ceases is just suffering ceasing.	sn22.90	9	7	sn	22.90	 With Channa 
sn22.90:9.8	Your knowledge about this is independent of others.	sn22.90	9	8	sn	22.90	 With Channa

sn22.90:9.12	Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way:	sn22.90	9	12	sn	22.90	 With Channa 
sn22.90:9.13	“Ignorance is a condition for choices.	sn22.90	9	13	sn	22.90	 With Channa

sn22.90:9.15	That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.	sn22.90	9	15	sn	22.90	 With Channa

sn41.1:1.1	At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove.	sn41.1	1	1	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:1.2	Now at that time, after the meal, on return from alms-round, several senior mendicants sat together in the pavilion and this discussion came up among them:	sn41.1	1	2	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:1.3	“Reverends, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’: do these things differ in both meaning and phrasing? Or do they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing?”	sn41.1	1	3	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:1.4	Some senior mendicants answered like this:	sn41.1	1	4	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:1.5	“Reverends, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’: these things differ in both meaning and phrasing.”	sn41.1	1	5	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:1.6	But some senior mendicants answered like this:	sn41.1	1	6	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:1.7	“Reverends, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’ mean the same thing; they differ only in the phrasing.”	sn41.1	1	7	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:2.1	Now at that time the householder Citta had arrived at Migapathaka on some business.	sn41.1	2	1	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:2.2	He heard about what those senior mendicants were discussing.	sn41.1	2	2	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:3.1	So he went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to them,	sn41.1	3	1	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:3.2	“Sirs, I heard that you were discussing whether the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’ differ in both meaning and phrasing, or whether they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing.”	sn41.1	3	2	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:3.7	“That’s right, householder.”	sn41.1	3	7	sn	41.1	 The Fetter

sn41.1:4.2	Well then, sirs, I shall give you a simile.	sn41.1	4	2	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:4.3	For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.	sn41.1	4	3	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:4.4	Suppose there was a black ox and a white ox yoked by a single harness or yoke.	sn41.1	4	4	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:4.5	Would it be right to say that	sn41.1	4	5	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:4.6	the black ox is the yoke of the white ox, or the white ox is the yoke of the black ox?”	sn41.1	4	6	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:4.7	“No, householder.	sn41.1	4	7	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:4.8	The black ox is not the yoke of the white ox, nor is the white ox the yoke of the black ox.	sn41.1	4	8	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:4.9	The yoke there is the single harness or yoke that they’re yoked by.”	sn41.1	4	9	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:4.10	“In the same way, the eye is not the fetter of sights, nor are sights the fetter of the eye.	sn41.1	4	10	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:4.11	The fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them.	sn41.1	4	11	sn	41.1	 The Fetter

sn41.1:4.18	The fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them.”	sn41.1	4	18	sn	41.1	 The Fetter 
sn41.1:4.19	“You’re fortunate, householder, so very fortunate,	sn41.1	4	19	sn	41.1	 The Fetter

sn41.2:1.2	Then Citta the householder went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to them,	sn41.2	1	2	sn	41.2	 Isidatta (1st) 
sn41.2:1.3	“Sirs, may the senior mendicants please accept my offering of tomorrow’s meal.”	sn41.2	1	3	sn	41.2	 Isidatta (1st) 
sn41.2:1.4	They consented in silence.	sn41.2	1	4	sn	41.2	 Isidatta (1st) 
sn41.2:1.5	Knowing that the senior mendicants had consented, Citta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled them, keeping them on his right, before leaving.	sn41.2	1	5	sn	41.2	 Isidatta (1st) 
sn41.2:1.6	Then when the night had passed, the senior mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, went to Citta’s home, and sat down on the seats spread out.	sn41.2	1	6	sn	41.2	 Isidatta (1st) 
sn41.2:2.1	Then Citta went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and asked the senior venerable,	sn41.2	2	1	sn	41.2	 Isidatta (1st) 
sn41.2:2.2	“Sir, they speak of ‘the diversity of elements’.	sn41.2	2	2	sn	41.2	 Isidatta (1st) 
sn41.2:2.3	In what way did the Buddha speak of the diversity of elements?”	sn41.2	2	3	sn	41.2	 Isidatta (1st) 
sn41.2:2.4	When he said this, the senior venerable kept silent.	sn41.2	2	4	sn	41.2	 Isidatta (1st) 
sn41.2:2.5	For a second time …	sn41.2	2	5	sn	41.2	 Isidatta (1st)

sn41.2:3.1	Now at that time Venerable Isidatta was the most junior mendicant in that Saṅgha.	sn41.2	3	1	sn	41.2	 Isidatta (1st) 
sn41.2:3.2	He said to the senior venerable,	sn41.2	3	2	sn	41.2	 Isidatta (1st) 
sn41.2:3.3	“Sir, may I answer Citta’s question?”	sn41.2	3	3	sn	41.2	 Isidatta (1st) 
sn41.2:3.4	“Answer it, Reverend Isidatta.”	sn41.2	3	4	sn	41.2	 Isidatta (1st)

sn41.2:4.4	“Isidatta, it’s good that you felt inspired to answer that question, because I didn’t.	sn41.2	4	4	sn	41.2	 Isidatta (1st)

sn41.3:8.3	Then the senior venerable said to Venerable Isidatta,	sn41.3	8	3	sn	41.3	 With Isidatta (2nd) 
sn41.3:8.4	“Isidatta, it’s good that you felt inspired to answer that question, because I didn’t.	sn41.3	8	4	sn	41.3	 With Isidatta (2nd) 
sn41.3:8.6	So when a similar question comes up, you should also answer it as you feel inspired.”	sn41.3	8	6	sn	41.3	 With Isidatta (2nd) 
sn41.3:8.7	But Isidatta set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, left Macchikasaṇḍa,	sn41.3	8	7	sn	41.3	 With Isidatta (2nd) 
sn41.3:8.8	never to return.	sn41.3	8	8	sn	41.3	 With Isidatta (2nd) 
sn41.4:1.1	At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove.	sn41.4	1	1	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:1.2	Then Citta the householder went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to them,	sn41.4	1	2	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:1.3	“Sirs, may the senior mendicants please accept my offering of tomorrow’s meal in my barn.”	sn41.4	1	3	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:1.4	They consented in silence.	sn41.4	1	4	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:1.5	Then, knowing that the senior mendicants had consented, Citta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled them, keeping them on his right, before leaving.	sn41.4	1	5	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:1.6	Then when the night had passed, the senior mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, went to Citta’s barn, and sat down on the seats spread out.	sn41.4	1	6	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:2.1	Then Citta served and satisfied the senior mendicants with his own hands with delicious milk-rice made with ghee.	sn41.4	2	1	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:2.2	When the senior mendicants had eaten and washed their hands and bowls, they got up from their seats and left.	sn41.4	2	2	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:2.3	Citta instructed that the remainder of the food be distributed, then followed behind the senior mendicants.	sn41.4	2	3	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:2.4	Now at that time the heat was sweltering.	sn41.4	2	4	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:2.5	And those senior mendicants walked along as if their bodies were melting, as happens after a meal.	sn41.4	2	5	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:3.1	Now at that time Venerable Mahaka was the most junior mendicant in that Saṅgha.	sn41.4	3	1	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:3.2	Then Venerable Mahaka said to the senior venerable,	sn41.4	3	2	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:3.3	“Wouldn’t it be nice, sir, if a cool wind blew, a cloud canopy formed, and a gentle rain drizzled down?”	sn41.4	3	3	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:4.1	“It would indeed be nice, Reverend Mahaka.”	sn41.4	4	1	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:4.2	Then Mahaka used his psychic power to will that a cool wind would blow, a cloud canopy would form, and a gentle rain would drizzle down.	sn41.4	4	2	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:4.3	Then Citta thought,	sn41.4	4	3	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:4.4	“The most junior mendicant in this Saṅgha has such psychic power!”	sn41.4	4	4	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:4.5	When they reached the monastery, Mahaka said to the senior venerable,	sn41.4	4	5	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:4.6	“Sir, is that sufficient?”	sn41.4	4	6	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:4.7	“That’s sufficient, Reverend Mahaka,	sn41.4	4	7	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:4.8	you’ve done enough	sn41.4	4	8	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:4.9	and offered enough.”	sn41.4	4	9	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:4.10	Then the senior mendicants entered their dwellings,	sn41.4	4	10	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:4.11	and Mahaka entered his own dwelling.	sn41.4	4	11	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:5.1	Then Citta went up to Mahaka, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	sn41.4	5	1	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:5.2	“Sir, please show me a superhuman demonstration of psychic power.”	sn41.4	5	2	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:5.3	“Well, then, householder, place your upper robe on the porch and spread a handful of grass on it.”	sn41.4	5	3	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:5.4	“Yes, sir,” replied Citta, and did as he was asked.	sn41.4	5	4	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:5.5	Mahaka entered his dwelling and latched the door. Then he used his psychic power to will that a flame shoot out through the keyhole and the chink in the door, and it burned up the grass but not the upper robe.	sn41.4	5	5	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:5.6	Then Citta shook out his upper robe and stood to one side, shocked and awestruck.	sn41.4	5	6	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:5.7	Mahaka left his dwelling and said to Citta,	sn41.4	5	7	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:5.8	“Is that sufficient, householder?”	sn41.4	5	8	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:6.1	“That’s sufficient, sir,	sn41.4	6	1	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:6.2	you’ve done enough	sn41.4	6	2	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:6.3	and offered enough.	sn41.4	6	3	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:6.4	I hope Venerable Mahaka is happy here in Macchikāsaṇḍa,	sn41.4	6	4	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:6.5	for the Wild Mango Grove is lovely.	sn41.4	6	5	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:6.6	I’ll make sure that Venerable Mahaka is provided with robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.”	sn41.4	6	6	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:6.7	“That’s nice of you to say, householder.”	sn41.4	6	7	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:6.8	But Mahaka set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, left Macchikasaṇḍa,	sn41.4	6	8	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:6.9	never to return.	sn41.4	6	9	sn	41.4	 Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.5:1.1	At one time Venerable Kāmabhū was staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove.	sn41.5	1	1	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:1.2	Then Citta the householder went up to Venerable Kāmabhū, bowed, and sat down to one side. Kāmabhū said to him,	sn41.5	1	2	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:2.1	“Householder, there is this saying:	sn41.5	2	1	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:3.1	‘With flawless wheel and white canopy,	sn41.5	3	1	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:3.2	the one-spoke chariot rolls on.	sn41.5	3	2	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:3.3	See it come, untroubled,	sn41.5	3	3	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:3.4	with stream cut, unbound.’	sn41.5	3	4	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:4.1	How should we see the detailed meaning of this brief statement?”	sn41.5	4	1	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:4.2	“Sir, was this spoken by the Buddha?”	sn41.5	4	2	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:4.3	“Yes, householder.”	sn41.5	4	3	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:4.4	“Well then, sir, please wait a moment while I consider the meaning of this.”	sn41.5	4	4	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:4.5	Then after a short silence Citta said to Kāmabhū:	sn41.5	4	5	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:5.1	“Sir, ‘flawless wheel’ is a term for ethics.	sn41.5	5	1	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:5.2	‘White canopy’ is a term for freedom.	sn41.5	5	2	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:5.3	‘One spoke’ is a term for mindfulness.	sn41.5	5	3	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:5.4	‘Rolls on’ is a term for going forward and coming back.	sn41.5	5	4	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:5.5	‘Chariot’ is a term for this body made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction.	sn41.5	5	5	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:5.6	Greed, hate, and delusion are troubles.	sn41.5	5	6	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:5.7	A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they are unable to arise in the future.	sn41.5	5	7	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:5.8	That’s why a mendicant who has ended the defilements is called ‘untroubled’.	sn41.5	5	8	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:5.9	‘The one who comes’ is a term for the perfected one.	sn41.5	5	9	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:5.10	‘Stream’ is a term for craving.	sn41.5	5	10	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:5.11	A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given this up, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, and obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future.	sn41.5	5	11	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:5.12	That’s why a mendicant who has ended the defilements is said to have ‘cut the stream’.	sn41.5	5	12	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:5.13	Greed, hate, and delusion are bonds.	sn41.5	5	13	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:5.14	A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they are unable to arise in the future.	sn41.5	5	14	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:5.15	That’s why a mendicant who has ended the defilements is called ‘unbound’.	sn41.5	5	15	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:5.16	So, sir, that’s how I understand the detailed meaning of what the Buddha said in brief:	sn41.5	5	16	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:6.1	‘With flawless wheel and white canopy,	sn41.5	6	1	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:6.2	the one-spoke chariot rolls on.	sn41.5	6	2	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:6.3	See it come, untroubled,	sn41.5	6	3	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:6.4	with stream cut, unbound.’”	sn41.5	6	4	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:7.2	“You’re fortunate, householder, so very fortunate,	sn41.5	7	2	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.5:7.3	to traverse the Buddha’s deep teachings with the eye of wisdom.”	sn41.5	7	3	sn	41.5	 With Kāmabhū (1st) 
sn41.6:1.1	At one time Venerable Kāmabhū was staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove.	sn41.6	1	1	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:1.2	Then Citta the householder went up to Venerable Kāmabhū, sat down to one side, and said to him:	sn41.6	1	2	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:1.3	“Sir, how many processes are there?”	sn41.6	1	3	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:1.4	“Householder, there are three processes.	sn41.6	1	4	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:1.5	Physical, verbal, and mental processes.”	sn41.6	1	5	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:1.6	Saying “Good, sir,” Citta approved and agreed with what Kāmabhū said. Then he asked another question:	sn41.6	1	6	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:1.7	“But sir, what is the physical process? What’s the verbal process? What’s the mental process?”	sn41.6	1	7	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:1.8	“Breathing is a physical process. Placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes. Perception and feeling are mental processes.”	sn41.6	1	8	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:2.1	Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question:	sn41.6	2	1	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:2.2	“But sir, why is breathing a physical process? Why are placing the mind and keeping it connected verbal processes? Why are perception and feeling mental processes?”	sn41.6	2	2	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:2.3	“Breathing is physical. It’s tied up with the body, that’s why breathing is a physical process.	sn41.6	2	3	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:2.4	First you place the mind and keep it connected, then you break into speech. That’s why placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes.	sn41.6	2	4	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:2.5	Perception and feeling are mental. They’re tied up with the mind, that’s why perception and feeling are mental processes.”	sn41.6	2	5	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:3.1	Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question:	sn41.6	3	1	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:3.2	“But sir, how does someone attain the cessation of perception and feeling?”	sn41.6	3	2	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:3.3	“A mendicant who is entering such an attainment does not think:	sn41.6	3	3	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:3.4	‘I will enter the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I am entering the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I have entered the cessation of perception and feeling.’	sn41.6	3	4	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:3.5	Rather, their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state.”	sn41.6	3	5	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:4.1	Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question:	sn41.6	4	1	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:4.2	“But sir, which cease first for a mendicant who is entering the cessation of perception and feeling: physical, verbal, or mental processes?”	sn41.6	4	2	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:4.3	“Verbal processes cease first, then physical, then mental.”	sn41.6	4	3	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:5.1	Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question:	sn41.6	5	1	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:5.2	“What’s the difference between someone who has passed away and a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling?”	sn41.6	5	2	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:5.3	“When someone dies, their physical, verbal, and mental processes have ceased and stilled; their vitality is spent; their warmth is dissipated; and their faculties have disintegrated.	sn41.6	5	3	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:5.4	When a mendicant has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, their physical, verbal, and mental processes have ceased and stilled. But their vitality is not spent; their warmth is not dissipated; and their faculties are very clear.	sn41.6	5	4	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:5.5	That’s the difference between someone who has passed away and a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling.”	sn41.6	5	5	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:6.1	Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question:	sn41.6	6	1	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:6.2	“But sir, how does someone emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling?”	sn41.6	6	2	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:6.3	“A mendicant who is emerging from such an attainment does not think:	sn41.6	6	3	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:6.4	‘I will emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I am emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I have emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling.’	sn41.6	6	4	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd)

sn41.6:7.1	Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question:	sn41.6	7	1	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:7.2	“But sir, which arise first for a mendicant who is emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling: physical, verbal, or mental processes?”	sn41.6	7	2	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:7.3	“Mental processes arise first, then physical, then verbal.”	sn41.6	7	3	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:8.1	Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question:	sn41.6	8	1	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:8.2	“But sir, when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, how many kinds of contact do they experience?”	sn41.6	8	2	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:8.3	“They experience three kinds of contact:	sn41.6	8	3	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:8.4	emptiness, signless, and undirected contacts.”	sn41.6	8	4	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:9.1	Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question:	sn41.6	9	1	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:9.2	“But sir, when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, what does their mind slant, slope, and incline to?”	sn41.6	9	2	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:9.3	“Their mind slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion.”	sn41.6	9	3	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:10.1	Saying “Good, sir,” Citta approved and agreed with what Kāmabhū said. Then he asked another question:	sn41.6	10	1	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:10.2	“But sir, how many things are helpful for attaining the cessation of perception and feeling?”	sn41.6	10	2	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:10.3	“Well, householder, you’ve finally asked what you should have asked first!	sn41.6	10	3	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:10.4	Nevertheless, I will answer you.	sn41.6	10	4	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:10.5	Two things are helpful for attaining the cessation of perception and feeling:	sn41.6	10	5	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.6:10.6	serenity and discernment.”	sn41.6	10	6	sn	41.6	 With Kāmabhū (2nd) 
sn41.7:1.1	At one time Venerable Godatta was staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove.	sn41.7	1	1	sn	41.7	 With Godatta 
sn41.7:1.2	Then Citta the householder went up to Venerable Godatta, bowed, and sat down to one side. Godatta said to him:	sn41.7	1	2	sn	41.7	 With Godatta 
sn41.7:1.3	“Householder, the limitless release of the heart, and the release of the heart through nothingness, and the release of the heart through emptiness, and the signless release of the heart: do these things differ in both meaning and phrasing? Or do they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing?”	sn41.7	1	3	sn	41.7	 With Godatta 
sn41.7:1.4	“Sir, there is a way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing.	sn41.7	1	4	sn	41.7	 With Godatta 
sn41.7:1.5	But there’s also a way in which they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing.	sn41.7	1	5	sn	41.7	 With Godatta 
sn41.7:2.1	And what’s the way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing?	sn41.7	2	1	sn	41.7	 With Godatta 
sn41.7:2.2	It’s when a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	sn41.7	2	2	sn	41.7	 With Godatta 
sn41.7:2.3	They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion …	sn41.7	2	3	sn	41.7	 With Godatta 
sn41.7:2.4	They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing …	sn41.7	2	4	sn	41.7	 With Godatta 
sn41.7:2.5	They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth.

sn41.7:3.2	It’s when a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.	sn41.7	3	2	sn	41.7	 With Godatta 
sn41.7:3.3	This is called the release of the heart through nothingness.	sn41.7	3	3	sn	41.7	 With Godatta 
sn41.7:4.1	And what is the release of the heart through emptiness?	sn41.7	4	1	sn	41.7	 With Godatta 
sn41.7:4.2	It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this:	sn41.7	4	2	sn	41.7	 With Godatta 
sn41.7:4.3	‘This is empty of a self or what belongs to a self.’	sn41.7	4	3	sn	41.7	 With Godatta 
sn41.7:4.4	This is called the release of the heart through emptiness.	sn41.7	4	4	sn	41.7	 With Godatta 
sn41.7:5.1	And what is the signless heart’s release?	sn41.7	5	1	sn	41.7	 With Godatta 
sn41.7:5.2	It’s when a mendicant, not focusing on any signs, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart.	sn41.7	5	2	sn	41.7	 With Godatta 
sn41.7:5.3	This is called the signless release of the heart.	sn41.7	5	3	sn	41.7	 With Godatta 
sn41.7:5.4	This is the way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing.	sn41.7	5	4	sn	41.7	 With Godatta

sn41.7:6.5	That unshakable release of the heart is empty of greed, hate, and delusion.	sn41.7	6	5	sn	41.7	 With Godatta

sn41.8:1.1	Now at that time Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta had arrived at Macchikāsaṇḍa together with a large assembly of Jain ascetics.	sn41.8	1	1	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:1.2	Citta the householder heard that they had arrived.	sn41.8	1	2	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:1.3	Together with several lay followers, he went up to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and exchanged greetings with him.	sn41.8	1	3	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said to him,	sn41.8	1	4	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:1.5	“Householder, do you have faith in the ascetic Gotama’s claim that	sn41.8	1	5	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:1.6	there is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected; that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connected?”	sn41.8	1	6	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:2.1	“Sir, in this case I don’t rely on faith in the Buddha’s claim that	sn41.8	2	1	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:2.2	there is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected; that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connected.”	sn41.8	2	2	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:2.3	When he said this, Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta looked up at his assembly and said,	sn41.8	2	3	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:2.4	“See, good sirs, how straightforward this householder Citta is! He’s not devious or deceitful at all. To imagine that you can stop placing the mind and keeping it connected would be like imagining that you can catch the wind in a net, or dam the Ganges river with your own hand.”	sn41.8	2	4	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:3.1	“What do you think, sir?	sn41.8	3	1	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:3.2	Which is better—knowledge or faith?”	sn41.8	3	2	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:3.3	“Knowledge is definitely better than faith, householder.”	sn41.8	3	3	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:3.4	“Well sir, whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	sn41.8	3	4	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:3.5	And whenever I want, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled … I enter and remain in the second absorption.	sn41.8	3	5	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:3.6	And whenever I want, with the fading away of rapture … I enter and remain in the third absorption.	sn41.8	3	6	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:3.7	And whenever I want, giving up pleasure and pain … I enter and remain in the fourth absorption.	sn41.8	3	7	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:3.8	And so, sir, since I know and see like this, why should I rely on faith in another ascetic or brahmin who claims that	sn41.8	3	8	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:3.9	there is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected; that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connected?”	sn41.8	3	9	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:4.1	When he said this, Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta looked askance at his own assembly and said,	sn41.8	4	1	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:4.2	“See, good sirs, how crooked this householder Citta is! He’s so devious and deceitful!”	sn41.8	4	2	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:5.1	“Sir, just now I understood you to say:	sn41.8	5	1	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:5.2	‘See, good sirs, how straightforward this householder Citta is! He’s not devious or deceitful at all.’	sn41.8	5	2	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:5.3	But then I understood you to say:	sn41.8	5	3	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:5.4	‘See, good sirs, how crooked this householder Citta is! He’s so devious and deceitful!’	sn41.8	5	4	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:5.5	If your first statement is true, the second is wrong.	sn41.8	5	5	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:5.6	If your first statement is wrong, the second is true.	sn41.8	5	6	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:5.7	And also, sir, these ten legitimate questions are relevant.	sn41.8	5	7	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:5.8	When you understand what they mean, then, together with your assembly of Jain ascetics, you can rebut me.	sn41.8	5	8	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:5.9	‘One thing: question, summary, and answer. Two … three … four … five … six … seven … eight … nine … ten things: question, summary, and answer.’”	sn41.8	5	9	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.8:5.19	Then Citta got up from his seat and left without asking Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta these ten legitimate questions.	sn41.8	5	19	sn	41.8	 Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta 
sn41.9:1.1	Now at that time the naked ascetic Kassapa, who in lay life was an old friend of Citta, had arrived at Macchikāsaṇḍa.	sn41.9	1	1	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:1.2	Citta the householder heard that he had arrived.	sn41.9	1	2	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:1.3	So he went up to him, and they exchanged greetings.	sn41.9	1	3	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the naked ascetic Kassapa,	sn41.9	1	4	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:1.5	“Sir, Kassapa, how long has it been since you went forth?”	sn41.9	1	5	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:1.6	“It’s been thirty years, householder.”	sn41.9	1	6	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:1.7	“But sir, in these thirty years have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease?”	sn41.9	1	7	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:1.8	“I have no such achievement, householder, only nakedness, baldness, and pokes in the buttocks.”	sn41.9	1	8	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:1.9	Citta said to him,	sn41.9	1	9	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:1.10	“It’s incredible, it’s amazing,	sn41.9	1	10	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:1.11	how well explained the teaching is. For in thirty years you have achieved no superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, no meditation at ease, only nakedness, baldness, and pokes in the buttocks.”	sn41.9	1	11	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:2.1	“But householder, how long have you been a lay follower?”	sn41.9	2	1	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:2.2	“It’s been thirty years, sir.”	sn41.9	2	2	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:2.3	“But householder, in these thirty years have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease?”	sn41.9	2	3	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:2.4	“How, sir, could I not?	sn41.9	2	4	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:2.5	For whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	sn41.9	2	5	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:2.6	And whenever I want, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled … I enter and remain in the second absorption.	sn41.9	2	6	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:2.7	And whenever I want, with the fading away of rapture … I enter and remain in the third absorption.	sn41.9	2	7	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:2.8	And whenever I want, giving up pleasure and pain … I enter and remain in the fourth absorption.	sn41.9	2	8	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:2.9	If I pass away before the Buddha, it wouldn’t be surprising if the Buddha declares of me:	sn41.9	2	9	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:2.10	‘The householder Citta is bound by no fetter that might return him to this world.’”	sn41.9	2	10	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:2.11	When this was said, Kassapa said to Citta,	sn41.9	2	11	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:2.12	“It’s incredible, it’s amazing,	sn41.9	2	12	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:2.13	how well explained the teaching is. For a white-clothed layperson can achieve such a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease.	sn41.9	2	13	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:2.14	Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”	sn41.9	2	14	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:3.1	Then Citta the householder took the naked ascetic Kassapa to see the senior mendicants, and said to them:	sn41.9	3	1	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:3.2	“Sirs, this is the naked ascetic Kassapa, who in lay life was an old friend of mine.	sn41.9	3	2	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:3.3	May the senior monks give him the going forth, the ordination.	sn41.9	3	3	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:3.4	I’ll make sure that he’s provided with robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.”	sn41.9	3	4	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:3.5	And the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training.	sn41.9	3	5	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:3.6	Not long after his ordination, Venerable Kassapa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	sn41.9	3	6	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:3.7	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”	sn41.9	3	7	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.9:3.8	And Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfected.	sn41.9	3	8	sn	41.9	 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic 
sn41.10:1.1	Now at that time the householder Citta was sick, suffering, gravely ill.	sn41.10	1	1	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:1.2	Then several deities of the parks, forests, trees, and those who haunt the herbs, grass, and big trees came together and said to Citta,	sn41.10	1	2	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:1.3	“Householder, make a wish to become a wheel-turning monarch in the future!”	sn41.10	1	3	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:2.1	When they said this, Citta said to them,	sn41.10	2	1	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:2.2	“That too is impermanent! That too will pass! That too will be left behind!”	sn41.10	2	2	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:2.3	When he said this, his friends and colleagues, relatives and family members said,	sn41.10	2	3	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:2.4	“Be mindful, master! Don’t babble.”	sn41.10	2	4	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:2.5	“What have I said that makes you say that?”	sn41.10	2	5	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:2.7	“It’s because you said:	sn41.10	2	7	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:2.8	‘That too is impermanent! That too will pass! That too will be left behind!’”	sn41.10	2	8	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:2.9	“Oh, well, that’s because the deities of the parks, forests, trees, and those who haunt the herbs, grass, and big trees said to me:	sn41.10	2	9	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:2.10	‘Householder, make a wish to become a wheel-turning monarch in the future!’	sn41.10	2	10	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:2.11	So I said to them:	sn41.10	2	11	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:2.12	‘That too is impermanent! That too will pass! That too will be left behind!’”	sn41.10	2	12	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:2.13	“But what reason do they see for saying that to you?”	sn41.10	2	13	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:2.15	“They think:	sn41.10	2	15	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:2.16	‘This householder Citta is ethical, of good character.	sn41.10	2	16	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:2.17	If he makes a wish to	sn41.10	2	17	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:2.18	become a wheel-turning monarch in the future, his heart’s wish will succeed because of the purity of his ethics. And then as a proper, principled king he will provide proper spirit-offerings.’	sn41.10	2	18	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:2.19	That’s the reason they see for saying to me:	sn41.10	2	19	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:2.20	‘Householder, make a wish to become a wheel-turning monarch in the future!’	sn41.10	2	20	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:2.21	So I said to them:	sn41.10	2	21	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:2.22	‘That too is impermanent! That too will pass! That too will be left behind!’”	sn41.10	2	22	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:3.1	“Then, master, advise us!”	sn41.10	3	1	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:3.2	“So you should train like this:	sn41.10	3	2	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:3.3	We will have experiential confidence in the Buddha:	sn41.10	3	3	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:3.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	sn41.10	3	4	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:3.5	We will have experiential confidence in the teaching:	sn41.10	3	5	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:3.6	‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’	sn41.10	3	6	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:3.7	We will have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha:	sn41.10	3	7	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:3.8	‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’	sn41.10	3	8	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:3.9	And we will share without reservation all the gifts available to give in our family with those who are ethical and of good character.”	sn41.10	3	9	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:3.10	Then, after Citta had encouraged his friends and colleagues, relatives and family members in the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, and generosity, he passed away.	sn41.10	3	10	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn41.10:4.5	The Linked Discourses on Citta the Householder are complete.	sn41.10	4	5	sn	41.10	 Seeing the Sick 
sn42.1:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	sn42.1	1	1	sn	42.1	 Vicious 
sn42.1:1.2	Then the chief named Fury went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	sn42.1	1	2	sn	42.1	 Vicious

sn42.10:2.13	“Answering this way, I trust that I repeat what the Buddha has said, and don’t misrepresent him with an untruth. I trust my explanation is in line with the teaching, and that there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism.”	sn42.10	2	13	sn	42.10	 With Maṇicūḷaka 
sn42.10:3.1	“Indeed, in answering this way you repeat what I’ve said, and don’t misrepresent me with an untruth. Your explanation is in line with the teaching, and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism.	sn42.10	3	1	sn	42.10	 With Maṇicūḷaka 
sn42.10:3.2	Gold and money are not proper for Sakyan ascetics. They neither accept nor receive gold and money. They have set aside gems and gold, and rejected gold and money.	sn42.10	3	2	sn	42.10	 With Maṇicūḷaka 
sn42.10:3.3	If gold and money were proper for them, then the five kinds of sensual stimulation would also be proper.	sn42.10	3	3	sn	42.10	 With Maṇicūḷaka 
sn42.10:3.4	And if the five kinds of sensual stimulation are proper for them, you should definitely regard them as not having the qualities of an ascetic or a follower of the Sakyan.	sn42.10	3	4	sn	42.10	 With Maṇicūḷaka 
sn42.10:3.5	Rather, chief, I say this:	sn42.10	3	5	sn	42.10	 With Maṇicūḷaka 
sn42.10:3.6	Straw may be looked for by one needing straw; wood may be looked for by one needing wood; a cart may be looked for by one needing a cart; a workman may be looked for by one needing a workman.	sn42.10	3	6	sn	42.10	 With Maṇicūḷaka 
sn42.10:3.7	But I say that there is no way they can accept or look for gold and money.”	sn42.10	3	7	sn	42.10	 With Maṇicūḷaka 
sn42.11:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Mallas, near the Mallian town called Uruvelakappa.	sn42.11	1	1	sn	42.11	 With Bhadraka 
sn42.11:1.2	Then Bhadraka the village chief went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	sn42.11	1	2	sn	42.11	 With Bhadraka 
sn42.11:1.3	“Please, sir, teach me the origin and cessation of suffering.”	sn42.11	1	3	sn	42.11	 With Bhadraka 
sn42.11:1.4	“Chief, if I were to teach you about the origin and ending of suffering in the past, saying	sn42.11	1	4	sn	42.11	 With Bhadraka 
sn42.11:1.5	‘this is how it was in the past,’ you might have doubts or uncertainties about that.	sn42.11	1	5	sn	42.11	 With Bhadraka 
sn42.11:1.6	If I were to teach you about the origin and ending of suffering in the future, saying	sn42.11	1	6	sn	42.11	 With Bhadraka 
sn42.11:1.7	‘this is how it will be in the future,’ you might have doubts or uncertainties about that.	sn42.11	1	7	sn	42.11	 With Bhadraka 
sn42.11:1.8	Rather, chief, I will teach you about the origin and ending of suffering as I am sitting right here and you are sitting right there.	sn42.11	1	8	sn	42.11	 With Bhadraka 
sn42.11:1.9	Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”	sn42.11	1	9	sn	42.11	 With Bhadraka 
sn42.11:1.10	“Yes, sir,” Bhadraka replied.	sn42.11	1	10	sn	42.11	 With Bhadraka 
sn42.11:1.11	The Buddha said this:	sn42.11	1	11	sn	42.11	 With Bhadraka 
sn42.11:2.1	“What do you think, chief?	sn42.11	2	1	sn	42.11	 With Bhadraka 
sn42.11:2.2	Are there any people here in Uruvelakappa who, if they were executed, imprisoned, fined, or condemned, it would cause you sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?”	sn42.11	2	2	sn	42.11	 With Bhadraka 
sn42.11:2.3	“There are, sir.”	sn42.11	2	3	sn	42.11	 With Bhadraka

sn42.11:2.5	“There are, sir.”	sn42.11	2	5	sn	42.11	 With Bhadraka 
sn42.11:2.6	“What’s the cause, chief, what’s the reason why, if this was to happen to some people it could cause you sorrow, while if it happens to others it does not?”	sn42.11	2	6	sn	42.11	 With Bhadraka 
sn42.11:2.7	“The people regarding whom this would give rise to sorrow are those I desire and love.	sn42.11	2	7	sn	42.11	 With Bhadraka 
sn42.11:2.8	The people regarding whom this would not give rise to sorrow are those I don’t desire and love.”	sn42.11	2	8	sn	42.11	 With Bhadraka 
sn42.11:2.9	“With this present phenomenon that is seen, known, immediate, attained, and fathomed, you may infer to the past and future:	sn42.11	2	9	sn	42.11	 With Bhadraka

sn42.12:1.1	Then Rāsiya the chief went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	sn42.12	1	1	sn	42.12	 With Rāsiya 
sn42.12:1.2	“Sir, I have heard this: ‘The ascetic Gotama criticizes all forms of mortification. He categorically condemns and denounces those self-mortifiers who live rough.’	sn42.12	1	2	sn	42.12	 With Rāsiya 
sn42.12:1.3	Do those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?”	sn42.12	1	3	sn	42.12	 With Rāsiya 
sn42.12:1.4	“Chief, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false, hollow, and untrue.	sn42.12	1	4	sn	42.12	 With Rāsiya 
sn42.12:2.1	These two extremes should not be cultivated by one who has gone forth.	sn42.12	2	1	sn	42.12	 With Rāsiya 
sn42.12:2.2	Indulgence in sensual pleasures, which is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And indulgence in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless.	sn42.12	2	2	sn	42.12	 With Rāsiya 
sn42.12:2.3	Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One woke up by understanding the middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment.	sn42.12	2	3	sn	42.12	 With Rāsiya 
sn42.12:2.4	And what is that middle way of practice?	sn42.12	2	4	sn	42.12	 With Rāsiya 
sn42.12:2.5	It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:	sn42.12	2	5	sn	42.12	 With Rāsiya 
sn42.12:2.6	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.	sn42.12	2	6	sn	42.12	 With Rāsiya 
sn42.12:2.7	This, chief, is the middle way of practice, woken up to by the Realized One, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment.	sn42.12	2	7	sn	42.12	 With Rāsiya

sn44.1:2.2	But he saw that the nun Khemā was staying there,	sn44.1	2	2	sn	44.1	 With Khemā

sn44.1:3.3	She has a good reputation as being	sn44.1	3	3	sn	44.1	 With Khemā

sn44.1:10.1	Then on a later occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. He asked the Buddha exactly the same questions he had asked the nun Khemā, and received the same answers.	sn44.1	10	1	sn	44.1	 With Khemā

sn44.2:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	sn44.2	1	1	sn	44.2	 With Anurādha 
sn44.2:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Anurādha was staying not far from the Buddha in a wilderness hut.	sn44.2	1	2	sn	44.2	 With Anurādha 
sn44.2:1.3	Then several wanderers who follow other paths went up to Venerable Anurādha and exchanged greetings with him.	sn44.2	1	3	sn	44.2	 With Anurādha 
sn44.2:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him:	sn44.2	1	4	sn	44.2	 With Anurādha 
sn44.2:1.5	“Reverend Anurādha, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them in these four ways:	sn44.2	1	5	sn	44.2	 With Anurādha 
sn44.2:1.6	After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.”	sn44.2	1	6	sn	44.2	 With Anurādha 
sn44.2:1.7	“Reverends, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them other than these four ways:	sn44.2	1	7	sn	44.2	 With Anurādha

sn44.2:1.9	When he said this, the wanderers said to him,	sn44.2	1	9	sn	44.2	 With Anurādha 
sn44.2:1.10	“This mendicant must be junior, recently gone forth, or else a foolish, incompetent senior mendicant.”	sn44.2	1	10	sn	44.2	 With Anurādha 
sn44.2:1.11	Then, after rebuking Venerable Anurādha by calling him “junior” and “foolish”, the wanderers got up from their seat and left.	sn44.2	1	11	sn	44.2	 With Anurādha 
sn44.2:2.1	Soon after they had left, Anurādha thought,	sn44.2	2	1	sn	44.2	 With Anurādha 
sn44.2:2.2	“If those wanderers were to inquire further,	sn44.2	2	2	sn	44.2	 With Anurādha 
sn44.2:2.3	how should I answer them so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should I explain in line with his teaching, so that there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?”	sn44.2	2	3	sn	44.2	 With Anurādha 
sn44.2:2.4	Then Venerable Anurādha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	sn44.2	2	4	sn	44.2	 With Anurādha

sn47.9:1.7	while the Buddha commenced the rainy season residence right there in the little village of Beluva.	sn47.9	1	7	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:2.1	After the Buddha had commenced the rainy season residence, he fell severely ill, struck by dreadful pains, close to death.	sn47.9	2	1	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:2.2	But he endured unperturbed, with mindfulness and situational awareness.	sn47.9	2	2	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:2.3	Then it occurred to the Buddha:	sn47.9	2	3	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:2.4	“It would not be appropriate for me to become fully extinguished before informing my attendants and taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha.	sn47.9	2	4	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:2.5	Why don’t I forcefully suppress this illness, stabilize the life force, and live on?”	sn47.9	2	5	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:2.6	So that is what he did.	sn47.9	2	6	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:2.7	Then the Buddha’s illness died down.	sn47.9	2	7	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:3.1	Soon after the Buddha had recovered from that sickness, he left his dwelling and sat in the shade of the porch on the seat spread out.	sn47.9	3	1	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:3.2	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	sn47.9	3	2	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:3.3	“Sir, it’s fantastic that the Buddha is comfortable,	sn47.9	3	3	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:3.4	that he’s well,	sn47.9	3	4	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:3.5	and that he’s alright.	sn47.9	3	5	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:3.6	Because when the Buddha was sick, my body felt like it was drugged. I was disorientated, and the teachings didn’t spring to mind.	sn47.9	3	6	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:3.7	Still, at least I was consoled by the thought that	sn47.9	3	7	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:3.8	the Buddha won’t become fully extinguished without making some statement regarding the Saṅgha of mendicants.”	sn47.9	3	8	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:4.1	“But what could the mendicant Saṅgha expect from me now, Ānanda?	sn47.9	4	1	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:4.2	I’ve taught the Dhamma without making any distinction between secret and public teachings.	sn47.9	4	2	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:4.3	The Realized One doesn’t have the closed fist of a teacher when it comes to the teachings.	sn47.9	4	3	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:4.4	If there’s anyone who thinks:	sn47.9	4	4	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:4.5	‘I’ll take charge of the Saṅgha of mendicants,’ or ‘the Saṅgha of mendicants is meant for me,’ let them make a statement regarding the Saṅgha.	sn47.9	4	5	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:4.6	But the Realized One doesn’t think like this,	sn47.9	4	6	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:4.8	so why should he make some statement regarding the Saṅgha?	sn47.9	4	8	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:4.9	Now I am old, elderly and senior. I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life.	sn47.9	4	9	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:4.10	I’m currently eighty years old.	sn47.9	4	10	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:4.11	Just as a decrepit cart keeps going by relying on straps,	sn47.9	4	11	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:4.12	in the same way, the Realized One’s body keeps going by relying on straps, or so you’d think.	sn47.9	4	12	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:5.1	Sometimes the Realized One, not focusing on any signs, and with the cessation of certain feelings, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart. Only then does the Realized One’s body become more comfortable.	sn47.9	5	1	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:5.2	So Ānanda, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge.	sn47.9	5	2	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:6.1	And how does a mendicant do this?	sn47.9	6	1	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:6.2	It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.	sn47.9	6	2	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:6.3	They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …	sn47.9	6	3	sn	47.9	 Sick

sn47.9:6.5	principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.	sn47.9	6	5	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:6.6	That’s how a mendicant lives as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how the teaching is their island and their refuge, with no other refuge.	sn47.9	6	6	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.9:6.7	Whether now or after I have passed, any who shall live as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the teaching as their island and their refuge, with no other refuge—those mendicants of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the best.”	sn47.9	6	7	sn	47.9	 Sick 
sn47.10:1.1	Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the nuns’ quarters, and sat down on the seat spread out.	sn47.10	1	1	sn	47.10	 The Nuns’ Quarters 
sn47.10:1.2	Then several nuns went up to Venerable Ānanda bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	sn47.10	1	2	sn	47.10	 The Nuns’ Quarters 
sn47.10:2.1	“Sir, Ānanda, several nuns meditate with their minds firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They have realized a higher distinction than they had before.”	sn47.10	2	1	sn	47.10	 The Nuns’ Quarters

sn47.10:3.1	Then Ānanda educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired those nuns with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.	sn47.10	3	1	sn	47.10	 The Nuns’ Quarters 
sn47.10:3.2	Then Ānanda wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	sn47.10	3	2	sn	47.10	 The Nuns’ Quarters

sn47.13:1.2	At that time Venerable Sāriputta was staying in the Magadhan lands near the little village of Nālaka, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill.	sn47.13	1	2	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:1.3	And the novice Cunda was his carer.	sn47.13	1	3	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:2.1	Then Venerable Sāriputta became fully extinguished because of that sickness.	sn47.13	2	1	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:2.2	Then Cunda took Sāriputta’s bowl and robes and set out for Sāvatthī. He went to see Venerable Ānanda at Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	sn47.13	2	2	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:2.3	“Sir, Venerable Sāriputta has become fully extinguished.	sn47.13	2	3	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:2.4	This is his bowl and robe.”	sn47.13	2	4	sn	47.13	 With Cunda

sn47.13:3.2	Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this.”	sn47.13	3	2	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:3.3	“Yes, sir,” replied Cunda.	sn47.13	3	3	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:4.1	Then Ānanda and Cunda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	sn47.13	4	1	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:4.2	“Sir, this novice Cunda says that	sn47.13	4	2	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:4.3	Venerable Sāriputta has become fully extinguished.	sn47.13	4	3	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:4.4	This is his bowl and robe.	sn47.13	4	4	sn	47.13	 With Cunda

sn47.13:5.1	“Well, Ānanda, when Sāriputta became fully extinguished, did he take away your entire spectrum of ethical conduct, of immersion, of wisdom, of freedom, or of the knowledge and vision of freedom?”	sn47.13	5	1	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:5.2	“No, sir, he did not.	sn47.13	5	2	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:5.6	But Venerable Sāriputta was my adviser and counselor. He educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired me. He never tired of teaching the Dhamma, and he supported his spiritual companions.	sn47.13	5	6	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:5.7	I remember the nectar of the teaching, the riches of the teaching, the support of the teaching given by Venerable Sāriputta.”	sn47.13	5	7	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:6.1	“Ānanda, did I not prepare for this when I explained that	sn47.13	6	1	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:6.2	we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved?	sn47.13	6	2	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:6.3	How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to fall apart should not fall apart?	sn47.13	6	3	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:6.4	That is not possible.	sn47.13	6	4	sn	47.13	 With Cunda

sn47.13:6.8	That is not possible.	sn47.13	6	8	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:6.9	So Ānanda, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge.	sn47.13	6	9	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:7.1	And how does a mendicant do this?	sn47.13	7	1	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:7.2	It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.	sn47.13	7	2	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:7.3	They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …	sn47.13	7	3	sn	47.13	 With Cunda

sn47.13:7.6	That’s how a mendicant lives as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how the teaching is their island and their refuge, with no other refuge.	sn47.13	7	6	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.13:7.7	Whether now or after I have passed, any who shall live as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the teaching as their island and their refuge, with no other refuge—those mendicants of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the best.”	sn47.13	7	7	sn	47.13	 With Cunda 
sn47.14:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Vajjīs near Ukkacelā on the bank of the Ganges river, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. It was not long after Sāriputta and Moggallāna had become fully extinguished.	sn47.14	1	1	sn	47.14	 At Ukkacelā 
sn47.14:1.2	Now, at that time the Buddha was sitting in the open, surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.	sn47.14	1	2	sn	47.14	 At Ukkacelā 
sn47.14:2.1	Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were silent. He addressed them:	sn47.14	2	1	sn	47.14	 At Ukkacelā 
sn47.14:2.2	“Mendicants, this assembly seems empty to me now that Sāriputta and Moggallāna have become fully extinguished.	sn47.14	2	2	sn	47.14	 At Ukkacelā 
sn47.14:2.3	When Sāriputta and Moggallāna were alive, my assembly was never empty; I had no concern for any region where they stayed.	sn47.14	2	3	sn	47.14	 At Ukkacelā

sn47.14:2.7	It’s an incredible and amazing quality of such disciples	sn47.14	2	7	sn	47.14	 At Ukkacelā 
sn47.14:2.8	that they fulfill the Teacher’s instructions and follow his advice. And they’re liked and approved, respected and admired by the four assemblies.	sn47.14	2	8	sn	47.14	 At Ukkacelā 
sn47.14:2.9	And it’s an incredible and amazing quality of the Realized One	sn47.14	2	9	sn	47.14	 At Ukkacelā 
sn47.14:2.10	that when such a pair of disciples becomes fully extinguished he does not sorrow or lament.	sn47.14	2	10	sn	47.14	 At Ukkacelā

sn51.10:2.1	Then the Buddha went up to the Cāpāla shrine, and sat down on the seat spread out.	sn51.10	2	1	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:2.2	Ānanda bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.	sn51.10	2	2	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:2.3	The Buddha said to him:	sn51.10	2	3	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:3.1	“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla shrines are all lovely.	sn51.10	3	1	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:3.2	Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.	sn51.10	3	2	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:3.3	The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.”	sn51.10	3	3	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:4.1	But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign.	sn51.10	4	1	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:4.2	He didn’t beg the Buddha,	sn51.10	4	2	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:4.3	“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra.	sn51.10	4	3	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:5.1	For a second time …	sn51.10	5	1	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:5.2	and for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda:	sn51.10	5	2	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:5.3	“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla shrines are all lovely.	sn51.10	5	3	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine

sn51.10:7.1	Then the Buddha said to him,	sn51.10	7	1	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:7.2	“Go now, Ānanda,	sn51.10	7	2	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine

sn51.10:7.4	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He rose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before sitting at the root of a tree close by.	sn51.10	7	4	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:8.1	And then, not long after Ānanda had left, Māra the Wicked went up to the the Buddha and said to him:	sn51.10	8	1	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:9.1	“Sir, may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.	sn51.10	9	1	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:9.2	Sir, you once made this statement:	sn51.10	9	2	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:9.3	‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and practice in line with the teachings. Not until they practice properly, living in line with the teaching. Not until they’ve learned their teacher’s doctrine, and explain, teach, assert, establish, disclose, analyze, and make it clear. Not until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis.’	sn51.10	9	3	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:10.1	Today you do have such monk disciples.	sn51.10	10	1	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine

sn51.10:15.1	Sir, you once made this statement:	sn51.10	15	1	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:15.2	‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until my spiritual life is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.’	sn51.10	15	2	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:15.3	Today your spiritual life is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.	sn51.10	15	3	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:15.4	May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.”	sn51.10	15	4	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:16.1	When this was said, the Buddha said to Māra,	sn51.10	16	1	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:16.2	“Relax, Wicked One. The final extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon.	sn51.10	16	2	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:16.3	Three months from now the Realized One will finally be extinguished.”	sn51.10	16	3	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:17.1	So at the Cāpāla tree shrine the Buddha, mindful and aware, surrendered the life force.	sn51.10	17	1	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:17.2	When he did so there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky.	sn51.10	17	2	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:17.3	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	sn51.10	17	3	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine 
sn51.10:18.1	“Weighing up the incomparable against an extension of life,	sn51.10	18	1	sn	51.10	 At the Cāpāla Shrine

sn51.14:1.3	Now at that time several mendicants were staying beneath the longhouse. They were restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties.	sn51.14	1	3	sn	51.14	 With Moggallāna 
sn51.14:2.1	Then the Buddha addressed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna,	sn51.14	2	1	sn	51.14	 With Moggallāna

sn54.9:4.1	Then after a fortnight had passed, the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed Ānanda,	sn54.9	4	1	sn	54.9	 At Vesālī 
sn54.9:4.2	“Ānanda, why does the mendicant Saṅgha seem so diminished?”	sn54.9	4	2	sn	54.9	 At Vesālī 
sn54.9:4.3	Ānanda told the Buddha all that had happened, and said,	sn54.9	4	3	sn	54.9	 At Vesālī

sn54.9:6.3	“Mendicants, when this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s peaceful and sublime, a deliciously pleasant meditation. And it disperses and settles unskillful qualities on the spot whenever they arise.	sn54.9	6	3	sn	54.9	 At Vesālī

sn54.10:4.5	It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establishes mindfulness right there.	sn54.10	4	5	sn	54.10	 With Kimbila

sn54.10:5.1	When a mendicant is breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’	sn54.10	5	1	sn	54.10	 With Kimbila

sn54.10:5.6	Why is that?	sn54.10	5	6	sn	54.10	 With Kimbila 
sn54.10:5.7	Because the breath is a certain aspect of the body, I say.	sn54.10	5	7	sn	54.10	 With Kimbila

sn54.10:6.6	Why is that?	sn54.10	6	6	sn	54.10	 With Kimbila

sn54.10:7.6	Why is that?	sn54.10	7	6	sn	54.10	 With Kimbila

sn54.13:5.5	Why is that?	sn54.13	5	5	sn	54.13	 With Ānanda (1st)

sn55.6:17.2	It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha …	sn55.6	17	2	sn	55.6	 The Chamberlains

sn55.6:17.6	They live at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.	sn55.6	17	6	sn	55.6	 The Chamberlains 
sn55.6:17.7	A noble disciple who has these four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.	sn55.6	17	7	sn	55.6	 The Chamberlains 
sn55.6:18.1	And you have experiential confidence in the Buddha …	sn55.6	18	1	sn	55.6	 The Chamberlains

sn55.6:18.5	And whatever there is in your family that’s available to give, you share it all with those who are ethical, of good character.	sn55.6	18	5	sn	55.6	 The Chamberlains 
sn55.6:18.6	What do you think, chamberlains?	sn55.6	18	6	sn	55.6	 The Chamberlains 
sn55.6:18.7	How many people among the Kosalans are your equal	sn55.6	18	7	sn	55.6	 The Chamberlains

sn55.6:18.9	“We’re fortunate, sir, so very fortunate,	sn55.6	18	9	sn	55.6	 The Chamberlains 
sn55.6:18.10	in that the Buddha understands us like this.”	sn55.6	18	10	sn	55.6	 The Chamberlains 
sn55.7:1.1	So I have heard.	sn55.7	1	1	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Bamboo Gate.	sn55.7	1	2	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:1.3	The brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate heard:	sn55.7	1	3	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:1.4	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Bamboo Gate, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	sn55.7	1	4	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:1.5	He has this good reputation:	sn55.7	1	5	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:1.6	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	sn55.7	1	6	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:1.7	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	sn55.7	1	7	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:1.8	He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	sn55.7	1	8	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:1.9	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	sn55.7	1	9	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:2.1	Then the brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Seated to one side they said to the Buddha:	sn55.7	2	1	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:2.2	“Master Gotama, these are our wishes, desires, and hopes.	sn55.7	2	2	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:2.3	We wish to live at home with our children; to use sandalwood imported from Kāsi; to wear garlands, perfumes, and makeup; and to accept gold and money. And when our body breaks up, after death, we wish to be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	sn55.7	2	3	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:2.4	Given that we have such wishes, may the Buddha teach us the Dhamma so that we may achieve them.”	sn55.7	2	4	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:3.1	“Householders, I will teach you an explanation of the Dhamma that’s relevant to oneself.	sn55.7	3	1	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:3.2	Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”	sn55.7	3	2	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:3.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	sn55.7	3	3	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:3.4	The Buddha said this:	sn55.7	3	4	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:4.1	“And what is the explanation of the Dhamma that’s relevant to oneself?	sn55.7	4	1	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:4.2	It’s when a noble disciple reflects:	sn55.7	4	2	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:4.3	‘I want to live and don’t want to die; I want to be happy and recoil from pain.	sn55.7	4	3	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:4.4	Since this is so, if someone were to take my life, I wouldn’t like that.	sn55.7	4	4	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:4.5	But others also want to live and don’t want to die; they want to be happy and recoil from pain. So if I were to take the life of someone else, they wouldn’t like that either.	sn55.7	4	5	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:4.6	The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others.	sn55.7	4	6	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:4.7	Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on someone else?’	sn55.7	4	7	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:4.8	Reflecting in this way, they give up killing living creatures themselves. And they encourage others to give up killing living creatures, praising the giving up of killing living creatures.	sn55.7	4	8	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:4.9	So their bodily behavior is purified in three points.	sn55.7	4	9	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:5.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:	sn55.7	5	1	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:5.2	‘If someone were to steal from me, I wouldn’t like that.	sn55.7	5	2	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate

sn55.7:5.7	So their bodily behavior is purified in three points.	sn55.7	5	7	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:6.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:	sn55.7	6	1	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:6.2	‘If someone were to have sexual relations with my wives, I wouldn’t like it.	sn55.7	6	2	sn	55.7	 The People of Bamboo Gate

sn55.8:1.1	So I have heard.	sn55.8	1	1	sn	55.8	 In the Brick Hall (1st) 
sn55.8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house.	sn55.8	1	2	sn	55.8	 In the Brick Hall (1st) 
sn55.8:1.3	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	sn55.8	1	3	sn	55.8	 In the Brick Hall (1st) 
sn55.8:2.1	“Sir, the monk named Sāḷha has passed away.	sn55.8	2	1	sn	55.8	 In the Brick Hall (1st) 
sn55.8:2.2	Where has he been reborn in his next life?	sn55.8	2	2	sn	55.8	 In the Brick Hall (1st) 
sn55.8:2.3	The nun named Nandā,	sn55.8	2	3	sn	55.8	 In the Brick Hall (1st) 
sn55.8:2.5	the layman named Sudatta,	sn55.8	2	5	sn	55.8	 In the Brick Hall (1st)

sn55.8:2.8	Where have they been reborn in the next life?”	sn55.8	2	8	sn	55.8	 In the Brick Hall (1st) 
sn55.8:3.1	“Ānanda, the monk Sāḷha passed away having realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.	sn55.8	3	1	sn	55.8	 In the Brick Hall (1st) 
sn55.8:3.2	The nun Nandā passed away having ended the five lower fetters. She’s been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.	sn55.8	3	2	sn	55.8	 In the Brick Hall (1st) 
sn55.8:3.3	The layman Sudatta passed away having ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. He’s a once-returner; he will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.	sn55.8	3	3	sn	55.8	 In the Brick Hall (1st) 
sn55.8:3.4	The laywoman Sujātā passed away having ended three fetters. She’s a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.	sn55.8	3	4	sn	55.8	 In the Brick Hall (1st) 
sn55.8:4.1	It’s hardly surprising that a human being should pass away.	sn55.8	4	1	sn	55.8	 In the Brick Hall (1st) 
sn55.8:4.2	But if you should come and ask me about it each and every time someone dies that would be a bother for me.	sn55.8	4	2	sn	55.8	 In the Brick Hall (1st) 
sn55.8:4.3	So Ānanda, I will teach you the explanation of the Dhamma called ‘the mirror of the teaching’. A noble disciple who has this may declare of themselves:	sn55.8	4	3	sn	55.8	 In the Brick Hall (1st) 
sn55.8:4.4	‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’	sn55.8	4	4	sn	55.8	 In the Brick Hall (1st) 
sn55.8:5.1	And what is that mirror of the teaching?	sn55.8	5	1	sn	55.8	 In the Brick Hall (1st) 
sn55.8:6.1	It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha …	sn55.8	6	1	sn	55.8	 In the Brick Hall (1st)

sn55.8:6.5	This is that mirror of the teaching.	sn55.8	6	5	sn	55.8	 In the Brick Hall (1st) 
sn55.8:6.6	A noble disciple who has this may declare of themselves:	sn55.8	6	6	sn	55.8	 In the Brick Hall (1st)

sn55.21:1.1	So I have heard.	sn55.21	1	1	sn	55.21	 With Mahānāma (1st) 
sn55.21:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.	sn55.21	1	2	sn	55.21	 With Mahānāma (1st) 
sn55.21:1.3	Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	sn55.21	1	3	sn	55.21	 With Mahānāma (1st) 
sn55.21:1.4	“Sir, this Kapilavatthu is successful and prosperous and full of people, with cramped cul-de-sacs.	sn55.21	1	4	sn	55.21	 With Mahānāma (1st)

sn55.21:1.6	I encounter a stray elephant,	sn55.21	1	6	sn	55.21	 With Mahānāma (1st)

sn55.21:1.12	I think:	sn55.21	1	12	sn	55.21	 With Mahānāma (1st)

sn56.11:3.1	And what is that middle way of practice?	sn56.11	3	1	sn	56.11	 Rolling Forth the Wheel of Dhamma

sn56.11:12.2	“Near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.”	sn56.11	12	2	sn	56.11	 Rolling Forth the Wheel of Dhamma
