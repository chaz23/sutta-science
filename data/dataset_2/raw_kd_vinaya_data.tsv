pli-tv-kd10:0.1	Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law 
pli-tv-kd10:0.2	The Long Division 
pli-tv-kd10:0.3	The chapter on those from Kosambī 
pli-tv-kd10:0.4	1. The account of the dispute at Kosambī 
pli-tv-kd10:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.1.2	At this time a certain monk had committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.1.3	He regarded that offense as an offense, 
pli-tv-kd10:1.1.4	but there were other monks who did not. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.1.5	Some time later he no longer regarded it as an offense, 
pli-tv-kd10:1.1.6	but there were other monks who did. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.1.7	They said to him, 
pli-tv-kd10:1.1.8	“You have committed an offense. Do you recognize it?” 
pli-tv-kd10:1.1.9	“I haven’t committed any offense that I should recognize.” 
pli-tv-kd10:1.1.10	Soon afterwards the monks achieved unanimity and they ejected that monk for not recognizing the offense. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.2.1	But that monk was learned and a master of the tradition; he was an expert on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; he was knowledgeable and competent, had a sense of conscience, and was afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.2.2	He went to his friends and said, 
pli-tv-kd10:1.2.3	“This isn’t an offense 
pli-tv-kd10:1.2.4	and so I haven’t committed one. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.2.5	I haven’t been ejected, 
pli-tv-kd10:1.2.6	since the legal procedure was illegitimate, reversible, and unfit to stand. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.2.7	Please side with me, Venerables, in accordance with the Teaching and the Monastic Law.” 
pli-tv-kd10:1.2.8	And he was able to form a faction. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.2.9	He then sent the same message to his friends in the country 
pli-tv-kd10:1.2.15	and again he was able to form a faction. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.3.1	The monks who sided with him went to the monks who had ejected him and said, 
pli-tv-kd10:1.3.2	“This isn’t an offense 
pli-tv-kd10:1.3.3	and so this monk hasn’t committed one. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.3.4	He hasn’t been ejected, 
pli-tv-kd10:1.3.5	since the legal procedure was illegitimate, reversible, and unfit to stand.” 
pli-tv-kd10:1.3.6	They replied, 
pli-tv-kd10:1.3.7	“This is an offense 
pli-tv-kd10:1.3.8	and so this monk has committed one. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.3.9	He’s been ejected, 
pli-tv-kd10:1.3.10	since the legal procedure of ejection was legitimate, irreversible, and fit to stand. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.3.11	Venerables, don’t side with this monk who has been ejected.” 
pli-tv-kd10:1.3.12	But they still sided with that monk. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.4.1	Soon afterwards a certain monk went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd10:1.4.2	and told him all that had happened. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.5.1	Realizing that the Sangha of monks was divided, the Buddha 
pli-tv-kd10:1.5.2	got up from his seat, went to those monks who had done the ejecting, and sat down on the prepared seat. He then said to those monks: 
pli-tv-kd10:1.5.3	“Don’t always eject a monk just because it seems clear to you that he’s committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.6.1	It may be that a monk has committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.6.2	He doesn’t regard it as an offense, but there are other monks who do. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.6.3	If those monks know, ‘This monk is learned and a master of the tradition; he is an expert on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; he is knowledgeable and competent, has a sense of conscience, and is afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.6.4	If we eject this monk for not recognizing an offense, we won’t do the observance-day procedure with him. Because of this there will be arguments and disputes in the Sangha; there will be schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha,’ and if they understand the gravity of schism, they should not eject that monk for not recognizing an offense. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.7.1	It may be that a monk has committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.7.2	He doesn’t regard it as an offense, but there are other monks who do. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.7.3	If those monks know, ‘This monk is learned and a master of the tradition; he is an expert on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; he is knowledgeable and competent, has a sense of conscience, and is afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.7.4	If we eject this monk for not recognizing an offense, we won’t do the invitation procedure with him; 
pli-tv-kd10:1.7.5	we won’t do the legal procedures of the Sangha with him; 
pli-tv-kd10:1.7.6	we won’t share a seat with him; 
pli-tv-kd10:1.7.7	we won’t drink rice porridge with him; 
pli-tv-kd10:1.7.8	we won’t sit in the dining hall with him; 
pli-tv-kd10:1.7.9	we won’t stay in the same room with him; 
pli-tv-kd10:1.7.10	we won’t bow down, stand up, raise our joined palms, and do acts of respect for one another according to seniority—
pli-tv-kd10:1.7.11	because of this there will be arguments and disputes in the Sangha; there will be schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha,’ and if they understand the gravity of schism, they should not eject that monk for not recognizing an offense.” 
pli-tv-kd10:1.8.1	The Buddha got up from his seat, went to those monks who were siding with the ejected monk, and sat down on the prepared seat. He then said to those monks: 
pli-tv-kd10:1.8.2	“If you have committed an offense, don’t refuse to make amends for it just because you think that you haven’t committed it. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.8.3	It may be that a monk has committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.8.4	He doesn’t regard it as an offense, but there are other monks who do. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.8.5	If that monk knows, ‘These monks are learned and masters of the tradition; they are experts on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; they are knowledgeable and competent, have a sense of conscience, and are afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. They are unlikely, because of me or anyone else, to act wrongly out of favoritism, ill will, confusion, or fear. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.8.6	Moreover, if these monks eject me for not recognizing an offense, they won’t do the observance-day procedure with me. Because of this there will be arguments and disputes in the Sangha; there will be schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha,’ and if he understands the gravity of schism, he should confess the offense even out of confidence in the others. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.8.7	It may be that a monk has committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.8.8	He doesn’t regard it as an offense, but there are other monks who do. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.8.9	If that monk knows, ‘These monks are learned and masters of the tradition; they are experts on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; they are knowledgeable and competent, have a sense of conscience, and are afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. They are unlikely, because of me or anyone else, to act wrongly out of favoritism, ill will, confusion, or fear. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.8.10	Moreover, if these monks eject me for not recognizing an offense, they won’t do the invitation procedure with me; 
pli-tv-kd10:1.8.11	they won’t do the legal procedures of the Sangha with me; 
pli-tv-kd10:1.8.12	they won’t share a seat with me; 
pli-tv-kd10:1.8.13	they won’t drink rice porridge with me; 
pli-tv-kd10:1.8.14	they won’t sit in the dining hall with me; 
pli-tv-kd10:1.8.15	they won’t stay in the same room with me; 
pli-tv-kd10:1.8.16	we won’t bow down, stand up, raise our joined palms, and do acts of respect for one another according to seniority—because of this there will be arguments and disputes in the Sangha; there will be schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha,’ and if he understands the gravity of schism, he should confess the offense even out of confidence in the others.” 
pli-tv-kd10:1.8.17	The Buddha then got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.9.1	Soon those monks who sided with the ejected monk did the observance-day procedure and the legal procedures of the Sangha right there within the monastic boundary. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.9.2	But the monks who had ejected him went outside the boundary and did the observance-day procedure and the procedures of the Sangha there. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.9.3	One of the monks who had done the ejecting went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd10:1.9.4	and told him what was happening. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.9.7	The Buddha replied: “If those monks who side with the ejected monk do the observance-day procedure and the legal procedures of the Sangha right there within the monastic boundary, and it’s in accordance with the motion and announcements as I have laid them down, then those procedures are legitimate, irreversible, and fit to stand. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.9.8	And if you, the monks who did the ejecting, do the observance-day procedure and the legal procedures of the Sangha right there within the monastic boundary, and it’s in accordance with the motion and announcements as I have laid them down, then those procedures too are legitimate, irreversible, and fit to stand. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.10.1	This is so because you belong to a different Buddhist sect. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.10.2	There are these two grounds for belonging to a different Buddhist sect. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.10.3	Either one makes oneself belong to a different Buddhist sect, or a unanimous assembly ejects one for not recognizing an offense, for not making amends for an offense, or for not giving up a bad view. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.10.5	And there are these two grounds for belonging to the same Buddhist sect. 
pli-tv-kd10:1.10.6	Either one makes oneself belong to the same Buddhist sect, or a unanimous assembly re-admits one who had been ejected for not recognizing an offense, for not making amends for an offense, or for not giving up a bad view.” 
pli-tv-kd10:2.1.1	At this time the monks were arguing and disputing in the dining halls in inhabited areas, displaying improper physical and verbal behavior, such as grabbing one another with their hands. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.1.2	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.1.3	“How can the Sakyan monastics act like this?” 
pli-tv-kd10:2.1.4	The monks heard the complaints of those people, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.1.5	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.1.6	“How can monks act like this?” 
pli-tv-kd10:2.1.7	They told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd10:2.1.8	“Is it true, monks, that monks are acting like this?” 
pli-tv-kd10:2.1.9	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd10:2.1.10	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-kd10:2.1.11	and after criticizing them he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd10:2.1.12	“When the Sangha is divided and the monks are behaving contrary to the Teaching and are not on friendly terms, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.1.13	they should sit down and reflect, ‘We won’t display improper physical and verbal behavior, such as grabbing one another with our hands.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.1.14	When the Sangha is divided, but the monks are behaving in accordance with the Teaching and are on friendly terms, they should sit down one seat apart.” 
pli-tv-kd10:2.2.1	The monks were also arguing and disputing in the midst of the Sangha, attacking one another verbally, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.2.2	and they were unable to resolve that legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.2.3	A certain monk went to the Buddha, bowed, and told him what was happening, adding, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.2.6	“Venerable Sir, it would be good if you went to those monks out of compassion.” 
pli-tv-kd10:2.2.7	The Buddha consented by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.2.8	The Buddha then went to those monks, sat down on the prepared seat, and said, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.2.9	“Enough, monks, don’t quarrel and dispute.” 
pli-tv-kd10:2.2.10	A certain monk who spoke contrary to the Teaching replied, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.2.11	“Wait, Sir. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.2.12	You are the Lord of the Teaching and there is no need for you to be concerned. Just enjoy the happiness of the present life. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.2.13	We’ll face the consequences of this quarrelling and disputing.” 
pli-tv-kd10:2.2.14	The Buddha repeated his appeal to those monks, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.2.16	but got the same reply. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.3.0	2. The story of Dīghāvu 
pli-tv-kd10:2.3.1	The Buddha then said, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.3.2	“At one time in Benares, monks, there was a king of Kāsī called Brahmadatta. He was rich and powerful, had many vehicles and transport animals, and possessed a large kingdom and much wealth. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.3.3	Then there was Dīghīti, the King of Kosala, who was poor and had little power, who had few vehicles and transport animals, and who possessed only a small kingdom and little wealth. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.3.4	At one time King Brahmadatta, armed with his fourfold army, marched out to attack King Dīghīti. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.3.5	When King Dīghīti heard about this, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.3.6	he reflected on King Brahmadatta’s superior wealth and power and concluded, ‘I’m incapable of repelling even a single strike from Brahmadatta. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.3.7	Let me flee the town before he arrives.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.3.8	And he fled the town together with his queen. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.3.9	King Brahmadatta then conquered and seized the army, the vehicles and transport animals, and the country and wealth of King Dīghīti. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.3.10	King Dīghīti and his wife set out for Benares. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.3.11	When they eventually arrived, they stayed in the house of a potter on the edge of the town, disguised as wanderers. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.4.1	Soon the queen became pregnant. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.4.2	She craved to see the fully armed fourfold army standing on even ground at sunrise and to drink water from the washing of swords. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.4.3	She told the King, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.4.4	and he replied, ‘How are we going to achieve that when we’re in such a difficult situation?’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.4.5	‘If I don’t get it, I’ll die.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.5.1	At that time King Brahmadatta had a brahmin counselor who was a friend of King Dīghīti. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.5.2	King Dīghīti went to his friend and told him about his wife’s pregnancy 
pli-tv-kd10:2.5.3	and craving. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.5.4	The brahmin replied, ‘Well then, let me see the queen.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.5.5	The queen then went to that brahmin. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.5.6	When he saw her coming, he got up from his seat, put his upper robe over one shoulder, raise his joined palms, and exclaimed an inspired utterance three times: 
pli-tv-kd10:2.5.7	‘You have the King of Kosala in your womb!’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.5.8	And he added, ‘Be pleased, lady. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.5.9	You’ll get to see the fully armed fourfold army standing on even ground at sunrise and to drink water from the washing of swords.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.6.1	The brahmin counselor then went to King Brahmadatta and said, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.6.2	‘The omens are such, Sir, that tomorrow you should have the fully armed fourfold army stand on even ground at sunrise and have the swords washed.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.6.3	The king told his people to act accordingly. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.6.4	And as a consequence, the queen was able to satisfy her craving. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.6.5	When the pregnancy matured, the queen gave birth to a son. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.6.6	They called him Dīghāvu. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.6.7	Soon enough Prince Dīghāvu became self-reliant. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.7.1	King Dīghīti thought, ‘This King Brahmadatta has caused us much misfortune; he’s taken our army, our vehicles and transport animals, and our country and wealth. If he finds out about us, he will kill all three of us. Let me take Prince Dīghāvu to live out-of-town.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.7.2	And he did just that. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.7.3	As he was living outside of town, Prince Dīghāvu was soon training in all branches of knowledge. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.8.1	At this time King Dīghīti’s old barber was living under King Brahmadatta. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.8.2	On one occasion he saw King Dīghīti and his wife staying in that potter’s house, disguised as wanderers. He then went to King Brahmadatta and told him. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.9.1	The King ordered his people to get King Dīghīti and his wife. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.9.2	When they had done so, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.9.3	he said, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.9.4	‘Bind their arms behind their backs with a strong rope. Shave their heads and parade them from street to street, from intersection to intersection, to the beat of a harsh drum. Then take them out of town through the southern gate, cut them into four pieces, and place the pieces at the four directions.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.9.5	Saying, ‘Yes, Sir,’ they bound and shaved King Dīghīti and his wife as instructed, and paraded them from street to street, from intersection to intersection, to the beat of a harsh drum. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.10.1	Just then Prince Dīghāvu thought, ‘I haven’t seen my parents for a long time. Let me pay them a visit.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.10.2	When he entered Benares, he saw what was happening to his parents. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.10.3	As he went up to them, King Dīghīti said to him, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.10.4	‘My dear Dīghāvu, see neither long nor short. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.10.5	For hatred never ends through hatred; 
pli-tv-kd10:2.10.6	hatred only ends through love.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.11.1	The people there said to King Dīghīti, ‘You’re insane, King Dīghīti, you’re babbling. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.11.2	Who is Dīghāvu? 
pli-tv-kd10:2.11.3	And who is he saying this to?’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.11.6	‘I’m not insane; I’m not babbling. Those who are wise will understand.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.11.7	King Dīghīti repeated what he had said to the Prince a second 
pli-tv-kd10:2.11.8	and a third time, and events unfolded as before. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.11.20	Then, when the parading was finished, the people took King Dīghīti and his wife through the southern gate and cut them into four pieces. They placed the pieces at the four directions, set up guard, and departed. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.12.1	Prince Dīghāvu entered Benares, brought back some alcohol, and gave it to the guards. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.12.2	When they were lying drunken on the ground, he collected sticks, made a funeral pile, and placed his parents’ bodies on top. He then lit the pile, and with joined palms raised, he circumambulated it with his right side toward it. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.12.3	Just then King Brahmadatta was up in his best stilt house 
pli-tv-kd10:2.12.4	and he saw Prince Dīghāvu circumambulating the funeral pile with joined palms raised. He thought, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.12.5	‘No doubt this is a relative of King Dīghīti. This is surely a sign of trouble for me, in as much as nobody has told me.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.13.1	The Prince then went into the wilderness and cried his heart out. Wiping away his tears, he entered Benares and went to the elephant stables next to the royal compound. He said to the elephant trainer, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.13.2	‘Teacher, I wish to learn the profession.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.13.3	‘Well then, young brahmin, learn it.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.13.4	Soon the Prince got up early in the morning. He sang sweetly and played the lute in the elephant stables. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.13.5	King Brahmadatta, too, got up early in the morning, and he heard Prince Dīghāvu singing. He asked his people 
pli-tv-kd10:2.14.1	who it was, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.14.2	and they replied, ‘Sir, it’s a young brahmin who is an apprentice of such-and-such an elephant trainer.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.14.3	‘Well then, bring him here.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.14.4	They brought the Prince, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.14.5	and the King asked him whether he was the one who had been singing and playing the lute. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.14.6	When the Prince confirmed that it was he, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.14.7	the King said, ‘Well then, sing and play right here.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.14.8	Dīghāvu consented and did his best to please the King. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.14.9	The King said, ‘Young brahmin, please attend on me,’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.14.10	and the Prince agreed. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.14.11	The Prince then got up before King and went to bed after him. He willingly performed any services and was pleasant in his conduct and speech. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.14.12	Soon the King put the Prince in an intimate position of trust. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.15.1	On one occasion the King said to the Prince, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.15.2	‘Please harness a chariot and let’s go hunting.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.15.3	He did as asked and said to the King, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.15.4	‘Sir, the chariot is harnessed. Please go at your convenience.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.15.5	The King then mounted the chariot 
pli-tv-kd10:2.15.6	and the Prince drove it. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.15.7	But he drove it away from the army. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.15.8	When they had gone a long way, the King said to the Prince, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.15.9	‘Unharness the chariot. I’m tired and I want to lie down.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.15.10	He did as asked and then sat down cross-legged on the ground. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.15.11	The King lay down, resting his head on the Prince’s lap. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.15.12	And because he was tired, he quickly fell asleep. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.1	The Prince thought, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.2	‘This King has caused us much misfortune. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.3	He took our army, our vehicles and transport animals, and our country and wealth. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.4	He killed my mother and father. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.5	This is a good opportunity for me to take revenge.’ And he drew his sword from its sheath. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.6	He then thought, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.7	‘At the time of his death, my father said to me, “My dear Dīghāvu, see neither long nor short. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.8	For hatred never ends through hatred; 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.9	hatred only ends through love.” 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.10	It would not be proper of me not to follow my father’s advice.’ And he returned the sword to its sheath. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.11	A second 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.18	and a third time he had the same thoughts, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.19	‘This King has caused us much misfortune. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.20	He took our army, our vehicles and transport animals, and our country and wealth. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.21	He killed my mother and father. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.22	This is a good opportunity for me to take revenge.’ And he drew his sword from its sheath. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.23	and a third time he had the same thoughts, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.24	‘At the time of his death, my father said to me, “My dear Dīghāvu, see neither long nor short. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.25	For hatred never ends through hatred; 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.26	hatred only ends through love.” 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.27	and each time he ended up returning the sword to its sheath. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.28	Then King Brahmadatta suddenly got up, frightened and alarmed. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.29	The Prince asked what was the matter, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.16.30	and the King said, ‘Just now, I dreamed that Prince Dīghāvu, the son of Dīghīti the King of Kosala, attacked me with a sword.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.17.1	Seizing the King’s head with his left hand and drawing his sword with his right hand, the Prince said to the King, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.17.2	‘Sir, I’m that Prince Dīghāvu, the son of Dīghīti the King of Kosala. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.17.3	You have caused us much misfortune. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.17.4	You took our army, our vehicles and transport animals, and our country and wealth. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.17.5	You killed my mother and father. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.17.6	This is a good opportunity for me to take revenge.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.17.7	The King bowed down with his head at the Prince’s feet and said, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.17.8	‘Dear Dīghāvu, please spare my life.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.17.9	‘Who am I to spare your life? 
pli-tv-kd10:2.17.10	Sir, it’s you who should spare mine.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.17.11	‘Well then, Dīghāvu, if you spare my life, I’ll spare yours.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.17.12	And the King and Dīghāvu spared each other’s lives. They shook hands and made a vow not to harm each other. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.17.13	The King said to the Prince, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.17.14	‘Well then, Dīghāvu, harness the chariot and let’s go.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.17.15	He did as asked and said to the King, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.17.16	‘The chariot is harnessed. Please go at your own convenience.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.17.17	The King mounted the chariot 
pli-tv-kd10:2.17.18	and the Prince drove it. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.17.19	And he drove it so that it soon rejoined the army. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.18.1	When he was back in Benares, the King gathered his court and said, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.18.2	‘If you saw Prince Dīghāvu, the son of Dīghīti the King of Kosala, what would you do to him?’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.18.3	They variously replied, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.18.4	‘Sir, we would cut off his hands;’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.18.5	‘we would cut off his feet;’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.18.6	‘we would cut off his hands and feet;’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.18.7	‘we would cut off his ears;’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.18.8	‘we would cut off his nose;’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.18.9	‘we would cut off his ears and nose;’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.18.10	‘we would cut off his head.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.18.11	‘This is Prince Dīghāvu, the son of Dīghīti the King of Kosala. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.18.12	You shouldn’t do anything to harm him. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.18.13	I’ve spared his life and he’s spared mine.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.19.1	Soon afterwards the King said to Dīghāvu, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.19.2	‘Dīghāvu, what’s the meaning of that which your father told you at the time of his death?’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.19.5	‘When he said, “Not long,” he meant, “Don’t harbor hate for a long time.” 
pli-tv-kd10:2.19.7	When he said, “Not short,” he meant, “Don’t hastily break with your friends.” 
pli-tv-kd10:2.19.9	And when he said, “For hatred never ends through hatred; hatred only ends through love,” he was referring to your killing of my mother and father. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.19.10	For if I had killed you, those who wish you well would have killed me, and those who wish me well would in turn have killed them. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.19.11	In this way the hatred would never end through hatred. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.19.12	But now you have spared my life and I’ve spared yours. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.19.13	In this way hatred ends through love.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:2.20.1	The King thought, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.20.2	‘It’s amazing 
pli-tv-kd10:2.20.3	how wise Dīghāvu is, in that he’s able to fully understand the meaning of his father’s brief statement.’ And he gave him back his father’s army, his vehicles and transport animals, and his country and wealth, and he also gave him his own daughter. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.20.4	In this way, monks, those kings who had the authority to punish were actually patient and gentle. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.20.5	But you who have gone forth on this well-proclaimed spiritual path, you shine when you are patient and gentle.” 
pli-tv-kd10:2.20.6	A third time the Buddha said to those monks 
pli-tv-kd10:2.20.7	“Enough, monks, don’t quarrel and dispute.” 
pli-tv-kd10:2.20.8	And for third time that monk who spoke contrary to the Teaching replied, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.20.9	“Wait, Sir. You are the Lord of the Teaching 
pli-tv-kd10:2.20.10	and there is no need for you to be concerned. Just enjoy the happiness of the present life. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.20.11	We’ll face the consequences of this quarreling and disputing.” 
pli-tv-kd10:2.20.12	The Buddha thought, 
pli-tv-kd10:2.20.13	“These foolish men are overpowered by emotions. It’s not easy to persuade them,” 
pli-tv-kd10:2.20.14	and he got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-kd10:2.20.15	The first section for recitation on Dīghāvu is finished. 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.1	After robing up in the morning, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and entered Kosambī for alms. 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.2	He walked for alms and had his meal, and after returning from almsround, he put his dwelling in order. He then took his bowl and robe, and while standing in the midst of the Sangha, he spoke these verses: 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.3	“When many voices shout at once, 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.4	No-one thinks they are a fool. 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.5	Even as the Sangha splits, 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.6	They do not think it through. 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.7	Forgetting to speak wisely, 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.8	They are obsessed by speech; 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.9	Saying whatever they like, 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.10	They don’t know what leads them on. 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.11	‘They abused me, they hit me, 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.12	They defeated me, they robbed me.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.13	For those who carry on like this, 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.14	Hatred cannot end. 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.15	‘They abused me, they hit me, 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.16	They defeated me, they robbed me.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.17	For those who do not carry on like this, 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.18	Hatred has an end. 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.19	For never is hatred 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.20	Stopped by hatred; 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.21	Only by love does it stop—
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.22	This is an ancient law. 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.23	Others do not know 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.24	That here we need restraint. 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.25	But for those who know, 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.26	The quarrels have an end. 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.27	Those breaking bones and killing, 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.28	Those taking cows, horses, and wealth, 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.29	Those plundering the country, 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.30	Even they can stay together—
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.31	Why then cannot you? 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.32	If you get a discerning friend, 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.33	A steadfast companion, good to live with, 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.34	Then overcome all problems, 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.35	And go with them, glad and mindful. 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.36	If you do not get a discerning friend, 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.37	A steadfast companion, good to live with, 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.38	Then like a king giving up his kingdom, 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.39	Wander alone like a bull elephant in the forest. 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.40	It’s better to wander alone, 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.41	For there is no friendship with fools. 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.42	Wander alone and do no bad, 
pli-tv-kd10:3.1.43	Unconcerned, like a bull elephant in the forest.” 
pli-tv-kd10:4.1.0	3. The account of going to Bālakaloṇaka 
pli-tv-kd10:4.1.1	After speaking these verses while standing in the midst of the Sangha, the Buddha went to the village of Bālakaloṇaka. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.1.2	At that time Venerable Bhagu was staying near that village. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.1.3	When Bhagu saw the Buddha coming, he prepared a seat and set out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, and water for washing the feet. He then went out to meet the Buddha, receiving his bowl and robe. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.1.4	The Buddha sat down on the prepared seat and washed his feet. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.1.5	When Bhagu had bowed and sat down, 
pli-tv-kd10:4.1.6	the Buddha said to him, 
pli-tv-kd10:4.1.7	“I hope you are keeping well, monk, 
pli-tv-kd10:4.1.8	I hope you’re getting by. I hope you’re not having any trouble getting almsfood?” 
pli-tv-kd10:4.1.9	“I’m keeping well, Venerable Sir, I’m getting by. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.1.10	I’m having no trouble getting almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd10:4.1.11	The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened Bhagu with a teaching. He then got up from his seat and went to the Eastern Bamboo Park. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.2.0	4. The account of going to the Eastern Bamboo Park 
pli-tv-kd10:4.2.1	At this time Venerable Anuruddha, Venerable Nandiya, and Venerable Kimila were staying at the Eastern Bamboo Park. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.2.2	The park keeper saw the Buddha coming and said to him, 
pli-tv-kd10:4.2.3	“Ascetic, don’t enter this park. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.2.4	There are three monastics from good families staying here, seeking their own benefit. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.2.5	Don’t disturb them.” 
pli-tv-kd10:4.2.6	When Anuruddha heard the park keeper advising the Buddha, he said, 
pli-tv-kd10:4.2.7	“Please don’t block the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.2.8	It’s our teacher who has arrived.” 
pli-tv-kd10:4.2.9	Anuruddha then went to Nandiya and Kimila and said, 
pli-tv-kd10:4.2.10	“Come out, Venerables, our teacher has arrived.” 
pli-tv-kd10:4.3.1	The three of them went out to meet the Buddha. One received his bowl and robe, one prepared a seat, and one put out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, and water for washing the feet. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.3.2	The Buddha sat down on the prepared seat and washed his feet. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.3.3	When they had bowed and sat down, 
pli-tv-kd10:4.3.4	the Buddha said to them, 
pli-tv-kd10:4.3.5	“I hope you are all keeping well, Anuruddha, I hope you’re getting by. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.3.6	I hope you’re not having any trouble getting almsfood?” 
pli-tv-kd10:4.3.7	“We are keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re getting by. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.3.8	We’re not having any trouble getting almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd10:4.3.9	“I hope you’re living together in harmony, without dispute, blending like milk and water, and that you regard one another with affection?” 
pli-tv-kd10:4.3.10	“Yes, we are living together in harmony, without dispute, blending like milk and water, and we regard one another with affection.” 
pli-tv-kd10:4.3.11	“And how do you do this?” 
pli-tv-kd10:4.4.1	“I think like this, 
pli-tv-kd10:4.4.2	‘How fortunate I am to be living with such fellow monastics!’ 
pli-tv-kd10:4.4.3	And I do acts of kindness toward them, by body, 
pli-tv-kd10:4.4.4	speech, 
pli-tv-kd10:4.4.5	and mind, both in public and in private. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.4.6	I think, 
pli-tv-kd10:4.4.7	‘Why don’t I set aside what I wish to do and instead do what these venerables wish?’ 
pli-tv-kd10:4.4.8	And that’s what I do. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.4.9	We are separate in body, but it’s as if we’re one in mind.” 
pli-tv-kd10:4.4.10	Nandiya and Kimila then repeated what Anuruddha had said. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.5.1	“I hope, Anuruddha, that you’re heedful and energetic?” 
pli-tv-kd10:4.5.2	“Yes we are, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd10:4.5.3	“And how is it that you’re heedful and energetic?” 
pli-tv-kd10:4.5.4	“Whoever returns first from almsround in the village, he prepares the seats and sets out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, and water for washing the feet. He washes and sets out the bowl for leftovers, and puts out water for drinking and water for washing. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.5.5	Whoever returns last from almsround may eat the leftovers, or he discards them where there are no cultivated plants 
pli-tv-kd10:4.5.6	or in water without life. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.5.7	He puts away the seats and also the foot-stool, the foot scraper, and the water for washing the feet. He cleans the bowl for leftovers and puts it away, puts away the water for drinking and the water for washing, and sweeps the dining hall. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.5.8	Whoever sees that the pot for drinking water, the pot for washing water, or the waterpot in the restroom is empty fills it. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.5.9	If he can’t do it by himself, he calls someone over by hand signal and they move it together. We don’t speak because of that. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.5.10	And every five days we sit together the whole night and talk about the Teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd10:4.6.0	5. The account of going to Pālileyyaka 
pli-tv-kd10:4.6.1	The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened Venerable Anuruddha, Venerable Nandiya, and Venerable Kimila with a teaching. He then got up from his seat and set out wandering toward Pālileyyaka. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.6.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd10:4.6.3	he stayed in a protected forest grove, at the foot of an auspicious sal tree. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.6.4	While he was staying by himself, the Buddha thought, 
pli-tv-kd10:4.6.5	“When I was previously surrounded by people, I was not at ease because of those monks at Kosambī who were quarreling, arguing, and creating legal issues in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.6.6	But now that I’m alone, without a companion, I’m happy and at ease because I’m apart from those monks at Kosambī.” 
pli-tv-kd10:4.6.7	At that time there was a large bull elephant who was surrounded by a crowd of male and female elephants, by young elephants and baby elephants. He ate grass with broken tips, and other elephants ate the branches that he had folded together. He drank muddied water, and when he was immersed in a pool, the female elephants came rubbing their bodies against his. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.6.8	He considered this and thought, 
pli-tv-kd10:4.6.10	“Why don’t I leave the herd and stay by myself?” 
pli-tv-kd10:4.7.1	He then left the herd and went to Pālileyyaka, to the Buddha at the foot of the auspicious sal tree, in the protected forest grove. And he attended on the Buddha, using his trunk to set out water for drinking and water for washing and to clear the vegetation. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.7.2	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd10:4.7.3	“When I was previously surrounded by elephants, I was not at ease because of the other elephants. 
pli-tv-kd10:4.7.4	But now that I’m alone, without a companion, I’m happy and at ease because I’m apart from those elephants.” 
pli-tv-kd10:4.7.5	After considering his own seclusion and reading the mind of the elephant, the Buddha exclaimed this inspired utterance: 
pli-tv-kd10:4.7.6	“The mind of this large elephant, 
pli-tv-kd10:4.7.7	With tusks like chariot poles, 
pli-tv-kd10:4.7.8	Agrees with the mind of the sage, 
pli-tv-kd10:4.7.9	Since they each delight in the forest solitude.” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Pālileyyaka for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.1.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.1.3	he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.1.4	Soon the lay followers in Kosambī considered, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.1.5	“These venerable monks at Kosambī have caused us much misfortune. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.1.6	The Buddha himself left because he was troubled by them. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.1.7	Well then, let’s not bow down, rise up, raise our joined palms, or do acts of respect for them. And let’s not honor, respect, esteem, or associate with them, nor give them almsfood. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.1.8	Because of this, they will either leave, disrobe, or reconcile with the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.2.1	And that is what they did. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.2.2	Soon the monks at Kosambī said, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.2.3	“Well then, let’s go to Sāvatthī and resolve this legal issue in the presence of the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.2.4.0	6. The account of the eighteen bases 
pli-tv-kd10:5.2.4.1	The monks at Kosambī put their dwellings in order, took their bowls and robes, and went to Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.3.1	When Venerable Sāriputta heard 
pli-tv-kd10:5.3.2	that they were coming, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.3.3	he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.3.4	and told him, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.3.6	adding, “Venerable Sir, how should I act toward these monks?” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.3.7	“Take your stand in accordance with the Teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.3.8	“And how do I know what accords with and what is contrary to the Teaching?” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.4.1	“There are eighteen bases for knowing that someone is speaking contrary to the Teaching: 
pli-tv-kd10:5.4.2	A monk proclaims what is contrary to the Teaching as the Teaching, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.4.3	and what is the Teaching as contrary to the Teaching. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.4.4	He proclaims what is contrary to the Monastic Law as the Monastic Law, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.4.5	and what is the Monastic Law as contrary to the Monastic Law. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.4.6	He proclaims what hasn’t been spoken by the Buddha as spoken by the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.4.7	and what has been spoken by the Buddha as not spoken by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.4.8	He proclaims what was not practiced by the Buddha as practiced by the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.4.9	and what was practiced by the Buddha as not practiced by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.4.10	He proclaims what was not laid down by the Buddha as laid down by the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.4.11	and what was laid down by the Buddha as not laid down by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.4.12	He proclaims a non-offense as an offense, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.4.13	and an offense as a non-offense. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.4.14	He proclaims a light offense as heavy, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.4.15	and a heavy offense as light. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.4.16	He proclaims a curable offense as incurable, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.4.17	and an incurable offense as curable. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.4.18	He proclaims a grave offense as minor, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.4.19	and a minor offense as grave. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.5.1	And there are eighteen bases for knowing that someone is speaking in accordance with the Teaching: 
pli-tv-kd10:5.5.2	A monk proclaims what is contrary to the Teaching as contrary to the Teaching, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.5.3	and what is the Teaching as the Teaching. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.5.4	He proclaims what is contrary to the Monastic Law as contrary to the Monastic Law, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.5.5	and what is the Monastic Law as the Monastic Law. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.5.6	He proclaims what hasn’t been spoken by the Buddha as not spoken by the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.5.7	and what has been spoken by the Buddha as spoken by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.5.8	He proclaims what was not practiced by the Buddha as not practiced by the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.5.9	and what was practiced by the Buddha as practiced by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.5.10	He proclaims what was not laid down by the Buddha as not laid down by the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.5.11	and what was laid down by the Buddha as laid down by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.5.12	He proclaims a non-offense as a non-offense, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.5.13	and an offense as an offense. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.5.14	He proclaims a light offense as light, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.5.15	and a heavy offense as heavy. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.5.16	He proclaims a curable offense as curable, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.5.17	and an incurable offense as incurable. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.5.18	He proclaims a grave offense as grave, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.5.19	and a minor offense as minor.”

pli-tv-kd10:5.6.14	and told him, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.6.16	adding, “Venerable Sir, how should I act toward these monks?” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.6.17	“Take your stand in accordance with the Teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.6.18	“And how do I know what accords with and what is contrary to the Teaching?” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.6.19	The Buddha told him, too, about the eighteen bases for knowing that someone is speaking contrary to the Teaching 
pli-tv-kd10:5.6.30	and the eighteen bases for knowing that someone is speaking in accordance with the Teaching. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.7.1	When Mahāpajāpati Gotamī heard 
pli-tv-kd10:5.7.2	that they were coming, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.7.3	she too went to the Buddha, bowed, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.7.4	and told him, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.7.6	adding, “Venerable Sir, how should I act toward these monks?” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.7.7	“Well, Gotamī, listen to the teaching from both sides, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.7.8	and then approve of the views, beliefs, and persuasion of those who speak in accordance with the Teaching. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.7.9	And whatever support the Sangha of nuns expects from the Sangha of monks, they should get all of it from those who speak in accordance with the Teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.8.1	When Anāthapiṇḍiko heard 
pli-tv-kd10:5.8.2	that they were coming, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.8.3	he too went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.8.4	and told him, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.8.6	adding, “Venerable Sir, how should I act toward these monks?” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.8.7	“Well, householder, make offerings to both sides 
pli-tv-kd10:5.8.8	and listen to their teachings. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.8.9	Then approve of the views, beliefs, and persuasion of those who speak in accordance with the Teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.9.1	When Visākhā Migāramātā heard 
pli-tv-kd10:5.9.2	that they were coming, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.9.3	she too went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.9.4	and told him, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.9.6	adding, “Venerable Sir, how should I act toward these monks?” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.9.7	“Well, Visākhā, make offerings to both sides 
pli-tv-kd10:5.9.8	and listen to their teachings. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.9.9	Then approve of the views, beliefs, and persuasion of those who speak in accordance with the Teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.10.1	Eventually those monks from Kosambī arrived at Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.10.2	Venerable Sāriputta went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.10.3	and told him, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.10.5	adding, “How should we prepare dwellings for these monks?” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.10.6	“Give them dwellings in a separate place.” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.10.7	“But what should we do if there are no dwellings in a separate place?” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.10.8	“Separate the dwellings and then give them out. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.10.9	Under no circumstances, Sāriputta, should a dwelling be reserved for a more senior monk. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.10.10	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.10.11	“And what should we do regarding food and requisites?” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.10.12	“Food and requisites should be shared out equally to everyone.” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.11.0	7. The instruction to re-admit 
pli-tv-kd10:5.11.1	Then that ejected monk reflected on the Teaching and the Monastic Law, and he concluded, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.11.2	“This is an offense 
pli-tv-kd10:5.11.3	and I’ve committed it. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.11.4	I’ve been ejected, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.11.5	since the legal procedure was legitimate, irreversible, and fit to stand.” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.11.6	He went to those who were siding with him and told them 
pli-tv-kd10:5.11.7	what he had been thinking, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.11.12	adding, “Venerables, please re-admit me.” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.12.1	They then took that monk to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.12.2	and told him 
pli-tv-kd10:5.12.3	what had happened, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.12.10	adding, “Sir, what should we do now?” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.12.11	“This is an offense, monks, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.12.13	and this monk has committed it. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.12.14	He’s been ejected, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.12.15	since the legal procedure was legitimate, irreversible, and fit to stand. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.12.16	But since he recognizes this, he should be re-admitted.” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.13.0	8. Discussion of unity in the Sangha 
pli-tv-kd10:5.13.1	Soon afterwards the monks who were siding with the ejected monk re-admitted him. They then went to the monks who had ejected him and said, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.13.2	“Because this monk has recognized that he had committed an offense, and because he’s been ejected and now re-admitted, the basis for the arguments and disputes in the Sangha, for the schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha, have been removed. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.13.3	To resolve this matter, let’s create unity in the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.13.4	The monks who had done the ejecting went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.13.5	and told him 
pli-tv-kd10:5.13.6	what had happened, 
pli-tv-kd10:5.13.9	adding, “How should we proceed with this?” 
pli-tv-kd10:5.14.1	“Since this is the case, you should create unity in the Sangha so as to resolve this matter. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.14.2	And it should be done like this. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.14.3	Everyone should gather in one place, including those who are sick. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.14.4	No-one should give their consent. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.14.5	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd10:5.14.6	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.14.7	Because this monk has recognized that he had committed an offense, and because he’s been ejected and now re-admitted, the basis for the arguments and disputes in the Sangha, for the schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha, have been removed. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.14.8	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, let us create unity in the Sangha so as to resolve this matter. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.14.9	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.14.10	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.14.11	Because this monk has recognized that he had committed an offense, and because he’s been ejected and now re-admitted, the basis for the arguments and disputes in the Sangha, for the schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha, have been removed. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.14.12	The Sangha is creating unity in the Sangha so as to resolve this matter. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.14.13	Any monk who approves of creating unity in the Sangha so as to resolve this matter should remain silent. Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.14.14	The Sangha has created unity in the Sangha so as to resolve this matter. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.14.15	The schism in the Sangha has come to an end. The fracture in the Sangha has come to an end. The separation in the Sangha has come to an end. 
pli-tv-kd10:5.14.16	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:5.14.17	The observance-day procedure, the recitation of the Monastic Code, should be done straightaway.” 
pli-tv-kd10:6.1.0	9. Upāli’s questions about unity in the Sangha 
pli-tv-kd10:6.1.1	Soon afterwards Venerable Upāli went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd10:6.1.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd10:6.1.3	“Venerable Sir, if the basis for the arguments and disputes in the Sangha, for the schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha, haven’t been investigated by the Sangha, haven’t been resolved by the Sangha, yet the Sangha creates unity in the Sangha—is that unity in the Sangha legitimate?” 
pli-tv-kd10:6.1.4	“That unity in the Sangha is illegitimate.” 
pli-tv-kd10:6.1.5	“If the basis for the arguments and disputes in the Sangha, for the schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha, have been investigated by the Sangha, have been resolved by the Sangha, and the Sangha then creates unity in the Sangha—is that unity in the Sangha legitimate?” 
pli-tv-kd10:6.1.6	“That unity in the Sangha is legitimate.” 
pli-tv-kd10:6.2.1	“Sir, how many kinds of unity in the Sangha are there?” 
pli-tv-kd10:6.2.2	“There are two kinds of unity in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd10:6.2.3	There is the unity in the Sangha where the wording is fulfilled, but not the purpose. 
pli-tv-kd10:6.2.4	And there is the unity in the Sangha where both the wording and the purpose are fulfilled. 
pli-tv-kd10:6.2.6	If the basis for the arguments and disputes in the Sangha, for the schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha, haven’t been investigated by the Sangha, haven’t been resolved by the Sangha, yet the Sangha creates unity in the Sangha, this is called unity in the Sangha where the wording is fulfilled, but not the purpose. 
pli-tv-kd10:6.2.8	If the basis for the arguments and disputes in the Sangha, for the schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha, have been investigated by the Sangha, have been resolved by the Sangha, and the Sangha then creates unity in the Sangha, this is called unity in the Sangha where both the wording and the purpose are fulfilled.” 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.1	Upāli then got up from his seat, put his upper robe over one shoulder, raise his joined palms, and spoke in verse to the Buddha: 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.2	“In regard to the business and discussions of the Sangha, 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.3	In regard to the business that arises and the deliberations—
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.4	The person who is very beneficial, how does he handle these? 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.5	How is a monk fit to deal with these?” 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.6	“Blameless in the basic morality, 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.7	Watching over his own behavior, with senses well-restrained—
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.8	His enemies cannot legitimately criticize him; 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.9	There is nothing for them to correct in him. 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.10	Having such purity of conduct, 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.11	Enabled, he speaks confidently; 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.12	Without fear, he trembles not in a gathering; 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.13	He does not mangle the meaning, but speaks to the point. 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.14	If asked a question in a gathering, 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.15	He is neither diffident nor timid. 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.16	His words are timely and pertinent; 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.17	He skilfully satisfies a discerning gathering. 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.18	Respectful of more senior monks, 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.19	Confident about the Teachings, 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.20	Able to investigate, clever in discussion, 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.21	Skilled in defeating his opponents. 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.22	He refutes his opponents, 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.23	And the crowd is convinced. 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.24	He does not abandon a position, 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.25	And answers questions without hurting anyone. 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.26	He is able to take on the job of messenger, 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.27	And about the business of the Sangha, they speak to him. 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.28	When speaking, when sent out by the community, 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.29	He doesn’t think, ‘I’m doing it.’ 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.30	As far as the bases for committing offenses, 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.31	And how they are cleared, 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.32	Both these analyses he has learnt well. 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.33	He is skilled in the ways of clearing offenses. 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.34	If one is sent away for one’s conduct, 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.35	But once sent away one acts rightly, 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.36	There is re-admittance for one who lives thus. 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.37	This too he knows, the one skilled in analysis. 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.38	Respectful of more senior monks, 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.39	Whether junior, senior, or of middle standing, 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.40	The wise practice for the benefit of the many—
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.41	Such a monk is fit to deal with these.” 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.42	The tenth chapter on those from Kosambī is finished. 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.64	The chapter on those from Kosambī is finished. 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.65	The Long Division is finished. 
pli-tv-kd10:6.3.66	The canonical text of the Long Division is finished.
pli-tv-kd11:0.1	Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law 
pli-tv-kd11:0.2	The Short Division 
pli-tv-kd11:0.3	The chapter on legal procedures 
pli-tv-kd11:1.0.1	1. The legal procedure of condemnation 
pli-tv-kd11:1.1.1	Homage to the Buddha, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One 
pli-tv-kd11:1.1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.1.3	At that time the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka were quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Sangha. They went to other monks who were also quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Sangha, and said to them, 
pli-tv-kd11:1.1.4	“Don’t let him beat you. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.1.5	Argue back forcefully. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.1.6	You’re wiser, more competent, more learned, and more capable than he. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.1.7	Don’t be afraid of him. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.1.8	We’ll take your side.” 
pli-tv-kd11:1.1.9	Because of that, new quarrels started and existing quarrels became worse. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.2.1	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd11:1.2.2	“How can the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka act like this?” 
pli-tv-kd11:1.2.9	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.2.10	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd11:1.2.11	“Is it true that the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka are acting like this?” 
pli-tv-kd11:1.2.18	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd11:1.2.19	The Buddha criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd11:1.2.20	“It’s not suitable for those foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.2.21	How can they act like this, 
pli-tv-kd11:1.2.29	causing that new quarrels to start and existing quarrels to become worse? 
pli-tv-kd11:1.2.30	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence, 
pli-tv-kd11:1.2.31	but will hinder it and cause some to change their minds.” 
pli-tv-kd11:1.3.1	The Buddha then spoke in many ways in dispraise of being difficult to support and maintain, in dispraise of great desires, discontent, socializing, and laziness; but he spoke in many ways in praise of being easy to support and maintain, of fewness of wishes, contentment, self-elimination, ascetic practices, serenity, reduction in things, and of being energetic. After giving a teaching on what is right and proper, he addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd11:1.3.2	“Well then, monks, the Sangha should do a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.1	And this is how it should be done. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.2	First you should accuse the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka. They should then be reminded of what they have done, before they are charged with an offense. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.4	These monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka are quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Sangha. They go to other monks who are also quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Sangha, and they say to them, 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.5	“Don’t let him beat you. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.6	Argue back forcefully. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.7	You’re wiser, more competent, more learned, and more capable than he. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.8	Don’t be afraid of him. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.9	We’ll take your side.” 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.10	Because of this, new quarrels start and existing quarrels become worse. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.11	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.12	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.13	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.14	These monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka are quarrelsome, argumentative, 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.15	and creators of legal issues in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.16	They go to other monks who are also quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Sangha, and they say to them, 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.17	“Don’t let him beat you. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.18	Argue back forcefully. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.19	You’re wiser, more competent, more learned, and more capable than he. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.20	Don’t be afraid of him. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.21	We’ll take your side.” 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.22	Because of this, new quarrels start and existing quarrels become worse. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.23	The Sangha does a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.24	Any monk who approves of doing a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.25	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.26	For the second time I speak on this matter. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.27	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.28	These monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka are quarrelsome, argumentative, 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.29	and creators of legal issues in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.30	They go to other monks who are also quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Sangha, and they say to them, 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.31	“Don’t let him beat you. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.32	Argue back forcefully. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.33	You’re wiser, more competent, more learned, and more capable than he. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.34	Don’t be afraid of him. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.35	We’ll take your side.” 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.36	Because of this, new quarrels start and existing quarrels become worse. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.37	The Sangha does a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.38	Any monk who approves of doing a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.39	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.40	For the third time I speak on this matter. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.41	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.42	These monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka are quarrelsome, argumentative, 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.43	and creators of legal issues in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.44	They go to other monks who are also quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Sangha, and they say to them, 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.45	Don’t let him beat you. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.46	Argue back forcefully. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.47	You’re wiser, more competent, more learned, and more capable than he. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.48	Don’t be afraid of him. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.49	We’ll take your side.” 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.50	Because of this, new quarrels start and existing quarrels become worse. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.51	The Sangha does a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.52	Any monk who approves of doing a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.53	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.54	The Sangha has done a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka. 
pli-tv-kd11:1.4.55	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’ 
pli-tv-kd11:2.1.0	1.1 The group of twelve on illegitimate legal procedures 
pli-tv-kd11:2.1.1	“Monks, when a legal procedure of condemnation has three qualities, it is illegitimate, contrary to the Monastic Law, and not properly resolved:

pli-tv-kd11:10.1.98.1	“A monk who has had a legal procedure of demotion done against himself should conduct himself properly. 
pli-tv-kd11:10.1.99	This is the proper conduct: 
pli-tv-kd11:10.1.100	He should not give the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd11:10.1.101	He should not give formal support. 
pli-tv-kd11:10.1.102	He should not have a novice monk attend on him. 
pli-tv-kd11:10.1.103	He should not accept being appointed as an instructor of the nuns. 
pli-tv-kd11:10.1.104	Even if appointed, he should not instruct the nuns. 
pli-tv-kd11:10.1.105	He should not commit the same offense as the offense for which the Sangha did the procedure of demotion against him. 
pli-tv-kd11:10.1.106	He should not commit an offense similar to the offense for which the Sangha did the procedure of demotion against him. 
pli-tv-kd11:10.1.107	He should not commit an offense worse than the offense for which the Sangha did the procedure of demotion against him. 
pli-tv-kd11:10.1.108	He should not criticize the procedure. 
pli-tv-kd11:10.1.109	He should not criticize those who did the procedure. 
pli-tv-kd11:10.1.110	He should not cancel the observance-day procedure of a regular monk. 
pli-tv-kd11:10.1.111	He should not cancel the invitation procedure of a regular monk. 
pli-tv-kd11:10.1.112	He should not speak to a regular monk to initiate a legal process against him. 
pli-tv-kd11:10.1.113	He should not make accusations against a regular monk. 
pli-tv-kd11:10.1.114	He should not ask a regular monk for permission to accuse him of an offense. 
pli-tv-kd11:10.1.115	He should not accuse a regular monk of an offense. 
pli-tv-kd11:10.1.116	He should not remind a regular monk of an offense. 
pli-tv-kd11:10.1.117	He should not associate inappropriately with other monks.” 
pli-tv-kd11:10.1.118	The eighteen kinds of conduct in regard to the legal procedure of demotion are finished. 
pli-tv-kd11:11.1.1	Soon the Sangha did a legal procedure of demotion against the monk Seyyasaka, 
pli-tv-kd11:11.1.2	instructing him to live with formal support. 
pli-tv-kd11:11.1.3	Then, by associating with good friends, by having them recite, and by questioning them, he became learned and a master of the tradition; he became an expert on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; he became knowledgeable and competent, had a sense of conscience, and was afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. 
pli-tv-kd11:11.1.4	And he conducted himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released. He then went to the monks 
pli-tv-kd11:11.1.5	and told them about this, 
pli-tv-kd11:11.1.6	adding, “What should I do now?” 
pli-tv-kd11:11.1.7	The monks told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd11:11.1.8	He had the monks gathered and said, 
pli-tv-kd11:11.1.9	“Well then, lift that legal procedure of demotion against the monk Seyyasaka.

pli-tv-kd11:11.2.8	When a monk has eight qualities, a legal procedure of demotion against him should not be lifted:

pli-tv-kd11:11.2.15	When a monk has another five qualities, a procedure of demotion against him should be lifted:

pli-tv-kd11:11.2.19	When a monk has eight qualities, a procedure of demotion against him should be lifted:

pli-tv-kd11:11.2.22	The group of eighteen on to be lifted is finished. 
pli-tv-kd11:12.1.1	“And this is how it should be lifted. 
pli-tv-kd11:12.1.2	After approaching the Sangha, the monk Seyyasaka should put his upper robes over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-kd11:12.1.3	‘Venerables, the Sangha has done a legal procedure of demotion against me, but I have conducted myself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released. I ask for the legal procedure of demotion to be lifted.’ 
pli-tv-kd11:12.1.4	And he should ask a second 
pli-tv-kd11:12.1.5	and a third time. 
pli-tv-kd11:12.2.1	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd11:12.2.2	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd11:12.2.3	The Sangha has done a legal procedure of demotion against the monk Seyyasaka. He has conducted himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released, and now asks for the legal procedure of demotion to be lifted. 
pli-tv-kd11:12.2.4	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should lift the legal procedure of demotion against the monk Seyyasaka. 
pli-tv-kd11:12.2.5	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd11:12.2.6	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd11:12.2.7	The Sangha has done a legal procedure of demotion against the monk Seyyasaka. He has conducted himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released, and now asks for the legal procedure of demotion to be lifted. 
pli-tv-kd11:12.2.8	The Sangha lifts the legal procedure of demotion against the monk Seyyasaka. 
pli-tv-kd11:12.2.9	Any monk who approves of lifting the legal procedure of demotion against the monk Seyyasaka should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd11:12.2.10	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd11:12.2.11	For the second time I speak on this matter. 
pli-tv-kd11:12.2.12	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd11:12.2.13	The Sangha has done a legal procedure of demotion against the monk Seyyasaka. He has conducted himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released, and now asks for the legal procedure of demotion to be lifted.

pli-tv-kd11:12.2.24	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd11:12.2.25	The second section on the legal procedure of demotion is finished. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.1.0	3. The legal procedure of banishment 
pli-tv-kd11:13.1.1	At one time Assaji and Punabbasuka were the resident monks at Kīṭāgiri. They were bad and shameless, 
pli-tv-kd11:13.1.2	and were misbehaving in many ways. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.1.3	They planted flowering trees, watered and plucked them, and then tied the flowers together. They made the flowers into garlands, garlands with stalks on one side and garlands with stalks on both sides. They made flower arrangements, wreaths, ornaments for the head, ornaments for the ears, and ornaments for the chest. And they had others do the same. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.1.4	They then took these things, or sent them, to the women, the daughters, the girls, the daughters-in-law, and the female slaves of good families. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.1.5	They ate from the same plates as these women and drank from the same vessels. They sat on the same seats as them, and they lay down on the same beds, on the same sheets, under the same covers, both on the same sheets and under the same covers. They ate at the wrong time, drank alcohol, and wore garlands, perfumes, and cosmetics. They danced, sang, played instruments, and performed. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.1.6	While the women were dancing, singing, playing instruments, and performing, so would they. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.2.1	They played various games: eight-row checkers, ten-row checkers, imaginary checkers, hopscotch, spillikins, dice, tip-cat, painting with the hand, ball games, leaf flutes, toy plows, somersaults, toy windmills, toy measures, toy carriages, toy bows, letter guessing, thought guessing, mimicking deformities. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.2.2	They trained in elephant riding, in horsemanship, in carriage riding, in archery, in swordsmanship. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.2.3	And they ran in front of elephants, in front of horses, and in front of carriages, and they ran backwards and forwards. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.2.4	They whistled, clapped their hands, wrestled, and boxed. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.2.5	They spread their outer robe on a stage and said to the dancing girls, 
pli-tv-kd11:13.2.6	“Dance here, Sister,” 
pli-tv-kd11:13.2.7	and they made gestures of approval. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.2.8	And they misbehaved in a variety of ways. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.3.1	Just then a monk who had completed the rains residence in Kāsī was on his way to visit the Buddha at Sāvatthī when he arrived at Kīṭāgiri. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.3.2	In the morning he robed up, took his bowl and robe, and entered Kīṭāgiri to collect almsfood. He was pleasing in his conduct: in going out and coming back, in looking ahead and looking aside, in bending and stretching his arms. His eyes were lowered, and he was perfect in deportment. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.3.3	When people saw him, they said, 
pli-tv-kd11:13.3.4	“Whoʼs this, acting like a moron and always frowning? 
pli-tv-kd11:13.3.5	Who will give almsfood to him? 
pli-tv-kd11:13.3.6	Almsfood should instead be given to our Venerables Assaji and Punabbasuka, for they are gentle, congenial, pleasant to speak with, greeting one with a smile, welcoming, friendly, open, the first to speak.” 
pli-tv-kd11:13.3.8	A certain lay follower saw that monk walking for alms in Kīṭāgiri. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.3.9	He approached him, bowed, and said, 
pli-tv-kd11:13.3.10	“Venerable, have you received any almsfood?” 
pli-tv-kd11:13.3.11	“No, I haven’t.” 
pli-tv-kd11:13.3.12	“Come, let’s go to my house.” 
pli-tv-kd11:13.4.1	He took that monk to his house and gave him a meal. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.4.2	He then said, “Where are you going, Venerable?” 
pli-tv-kd11:13.4.3	“I’m going to Sāvatthī to see the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd11:13.4.4	“Well then, would you please pay respect at the feet of the Buddha in my name and say, 
pli-tv-kd11:13.4.5	‘Venerable Sir, the monastery in Kīṭāgiri has been corrupted. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.4.6	Assaji and Punabbasuka are the resident monks there. They are bad and shameless, 
pli-tv-kd11:13.4.7	and are misbehaving in many ways. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.4.8	They plant flowering trees, water them … 
pli-tv-kd11:13.4.21	And they misbehave in a variety of ways. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.4.22	Those who previously had faith and confidence have now lost it, 
pli-tv-kd11:13.4.23	and thereʼs no longer any support for the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.4.24	The good monks have left and the bad monks are staying on. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.4.25	Sir, please send monks to stay at the monastery in Kīṭāgiri.’” 
pli-tv-kd11:13.5.1	The monk consented, got up, and set out for Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.5.2	When he eventually arrived, he went to the Buddha in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. He bowed to the Buddha and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.5.3	Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, 
pli-tv-kd11:13.5.4	the Buddha said to him, 
pli-tv-kd11:13.5.5	“I hope you are keeping well, monk, I hope you’re getting by. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.5.6	I hope you’re not tired from traveling. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.5.7	And where have you come from?” 
pli-tv-kd11:13.5.8	“I’m keeping well, Venerable Sir, I’m getting by. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.5.9	I’m not tired from traveling.” 
pli-tv-kd11:13.5.10	He then told the Buddha all that had happened at Kīṭāgiri, 
pli-tv-kd11:13.5.30	adding, “That’s where I’ve come from, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd11:13.6.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd11:13.6.2	“Is it true, monks, that the bad and shameless monks Assaji and Punabbasuka are misbehaving in this way? 
pli-tv-kd11:13.6.6	And is it true that those people who previously had faith and confidence have now lost it, 
pli-tv-kd11:13.6.7	that there’s no longer any support for the Sangha, 
pli-tv-kd11:13.6.8	and that the good monks have left and the bad monks are staying on?” 
pli-tv-kd11:13.6.9	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd11:13.6.10	The Buddha criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd11:13.6.11	“It’s not suitable … 
pli-tv-kd11:13.6.12	How can those foolish men misbehave in this way? 
pli-tv-kd11:13.6.28	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd11:13.6.29	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd11:13.6.30	he gave a teaching and addressed Sāriputta and Moggallāna: 
pli-tv-kd11:13.6.31	“Sāriputta, the two of you should go and do a legal procedure of banishing the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from Kīṭāgiri. They are your students.” 
pli-tv-kd11:13.6.32	“Sir, how can we do a procedure of banishing these monks from Kīṭāgiri? They are temperamental and harsh.” 
pli-tv-kd11:13.6.33	“Well, take many monks.” 
pli-tv-kd11:13.6.34	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.1	“And this is how it should be done. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.2	First you should accuse the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka. They should then be reminded of what they have done, before they are charged with an offense. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.4	These monks, Assaji and Punabbasuka, are corrupters of families and badly behaved. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.5	Their bad behavior is seen and heard about, 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.6	and the families corrupted by them are seen and heard about. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.7	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do a legal procedure of banishing them, 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.8	prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at Kīṭāgiri. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.9	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.10	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.11	These monks, Assaji and Punabbasuka, are corrupters of families and badly behaved. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.12	Their bad behavior is seen and heard about, 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.13	and the families corrupted by them are seen and heard about. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.14	The Sangha is doing a legal procedure of banishing them, 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.15	prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at Kīṭāgiri. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.16	Any monk who approves of doing a legal procedure of banishing them, prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at Kīṭāgiri, should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.17	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.18	For the second time I speak on this matter … 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.19	For the third time I speak on this matter. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.20	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.21	These monks, Assaji and Punabbasuka, are corrupters of families and badly behaved. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.22	Their bad behavior is seen and heard about, 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.23	and the families corrupted by them are seen and heard about. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.24	The Sangha is doing a legal procedure of banishing them, 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.25	prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at Kīṭāgiri. 
pli-tv-kd11:13.7.26	Any monk who approves of doing a legal procedure of banishing them, prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at Kīṭāgiri, should remain silent.

pli-tv-kd11:16.1.12	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd11:16.1.13	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:

pli-tv-kd11:16.1.18	“It’s true, Sir.”

pli-tv-kd11:17.1.2	After approaching the Sangha, the monk who has had a legal procedure of banishment done against himself should put his upper robes over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say,

pli-tv-kd11:17.1.5	and a third time.

pli-tv-kd11:17.2.19	The second section on the legal procedure of banishment is finished. 
pli-tv-kd11:18.1.0	4. The legal procedure of reconciliation 
pli-tv-kd11:18.1.1	At one time Venerable Sudhamma was the resident monk at the householder Citta’s monastery at Macchikāsaṇḍa. He was in charge of the building work and received a regular supply of food. 
pli-tv-kd11:18.1.2	When Citta wanted to invite the Sangha, a group of monks, or an individual monk, he would not do so without getting permission from Sudhamma. 
pli-tv-kd11:18.1.3	On one occasion a number of senior monks—Venerable Sāriputta, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, Venerable Mahākaccāna, Venerable Mahākoṭṭhika, Venerable Mahākappina, Venerable Mahācunda, Venerable Anuruddha, Venerable Revata, Venerable Upāli, Venerable Ānanda, Venerable Rāhula—were wandering in Kāsī, when they arrived at Macchikāsaṇḍa. 
pli-tv-kd11:18.1.4	When Citta heard that they had arrived, 
pli-tv-kd11:18.1.5	he went to them, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd11:18.1.6	After Sāriputta had instructed, inspired, and gladdened Citta with a teaching, 
pli-tv-kd11:18.1.7	Citta said, 
pli-tv-kd11:18.1.8	“Venerables, please accept a meal for new arrivals from me tomorrow.” 
pli-tv-kd11:18.1.9	And they accepted by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-kd11:18.2.1	When he knew that they had accepted, Citta got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated them with his right side toward them, and went to Sudhamma. He bowed to him 
pli-tv-kd11:18.2.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd11:18.2.3	“Venerable, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the senior monks.” 
pli-tv-kd11:18.2.4	Sudhamma thought, 
pli-tv-kd11:18.2.5	“Previously when Citta wanted to invite the Sangha, a group of monks, or an individual monk, he would not do so without getting permission from me. 
pli-tv-kd11:18.2.6	But now he has invited the senior monks without my permission. 
pli-tv-kd11:18.2.7	He’s been corrupted, this Citta. He’s uninterested and has no affection for me.” He said to Citta, 
pli-tv-kd11:18.2.8	“There’s no need; I won’t accept.” 
pli-tv-kd11:18.2.9	Citta asked him a second 
pli-tv-kd11:18.2.10	and a third time, 
pli-tv-kd11:18.2.12	but got the same reply. 
pli-tv-kd11:18.2.13	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd11:18.2.14	“What difference does it make to me whether Sudhamma accepts or not?” He then bowed down, circumambulated Sudhamma with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd11:18.3.1	The following morning Citta prepared various kinds of fine food for the senior monks. 
pli-tv-kd11:18.3.2	Sudhamma thought, 
pli-tv-kd11:18.3.3	“Let me go and see what Citta has prepared for the senior monks.” He then robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to Citta’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-kd11:18.3.4	Citta approached Sudhamma, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd11:18.3.5	And Sudhamma said to him, 
pli-tv-kd11:18.3.6	“You have prepared many kinds of food. 
pli-tv-kd11:18.3.7	But there’s one that’s missing: sesame cookies.” 
pli-tv-kd11:18.3.8	“When there are so many jewels in the word of the Buddha, Sir, you speak of sesame cookies. 
pli-tv-kd11:18.3.9	In the past there were some traders from the south who went to an eastern country to trade. 
pli-tv-kd11:18.3.10	From there they brought back a hen. 
pli-tv-kd11:18.3.11	That hen mated with a crow 
pli-tv-kd11:18.3.12	and because of that she had a chick. 
pli-tv-kd11:18.3.13	When that chick wanted to caw like a crow, it cried, ‘caw-ca-doodle-doo.’ 
pli-tv-kd11:18.3.14	And when that chick wanted to crow like a rooster, it cried, ‘cock-a-doodle-caw.’ 
pli-tv-kd11:18.3.15	In the same way, when there are so many jewels in the word of the Buddha, you speak of sesame cookies.”

pli-tv-kd11:31.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd11:31.1.2	At this time Venerable Channa had committed an offense, but refused to make amends for it. 
pli-tv-kd11:31.1.3	The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd11:31.1.4	“How can Venerable Channa commit an offense, but then refuse to make amends for it?” 
pli-tv-kd11:31.1.5	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd11:31.1.6	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd11:31.1.7	“Is it true, monks, that Channa is acting like this?” 
pli-tv-kd11:31.1.8	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd11:31.1.9	The Buddha criticized him,

pli-tv-kd11:31.1.13	and after criticizing him … 
pli-tv-kd11:31.1.14	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd11:31.1.15	“Well then, the Sangha should do a legal procedure of ejecting the monk Channa for not making amends for an offense, 
pli-tv-kd11:31.1.16	prohibiting him from living with the Sangha.

pli-tv-kd11:31.1.18	First you should accuse the monk Channa. He should then be reminded of what he has done, before he is charged with an offense. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:

pli-tv-kd11:31.1.158	He then conducted himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released. He went to the monks

pli-tv-kd11:32.1.0	7. The legal procedure of ejection for not giving up a bad view 
pli-tv-kd11:32.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd11:32.1.2	At that time the monk Ariṭṭha, the ex-vulture-killer, had the following bad and erroneous view: 
pli-tv-kd11:32.1.3	“As I understand the Teaching of the Buddha, the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in them.” 
pli-tv-kd11:32.1.4	A number of monks heard that Ariṭṭha had that view. 
pli-tv-kd11:32.1.6	They went to him 
pli-tv-kd11:32.1.7	and asked, 
pli-tv-kd11:32.1.8	“Is it true, Ariṭṭha, that you have such a view?” 
pli-tv-kd11:32.1.10	“Yes, indeed. As I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in them.” 
pli-tv-kd11:32.2.1	“No, Ariṭṭha, 
pli-tv-kd11:32.2.2	don’t misrepresent the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd11:32.2.3	for it’s not good to misrepresent him. 
pli-tv-kd11:32.2.4	The Buddha would never say such a thing. 
pli-tv-kd11:32.2.5	The Buddha has given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive 
pli-tv-kd11:32.2.6	and how they obstruct one who indulges in them. 
pli-tv-kd11:32.2.7	The Buddha has said that there is little enjoyment in worldly pleasures, but much suffering and much trouble, and that the danger in them is greater. 
pli-tv-kd11:32.2.8	The Buddha has said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton, 
pli-tv-kd11:32.2.9	similar to a piece of meat, 
pli-tv-kd11:32.2.10	similar to a grass torch, 
pli-tv-kd11:32.2.11	similar to a pit of coals, 
pli-tv-kd11:32.2.12	similar to a dream, 
pli-tv-kd11:32.2.13	similar to borrowed goods, 
pli-tv-kd11:32.2.14	similar to fruits on a tree, 
pli-tv-kd11:32.2.15	similar to a knife and chopping block, 
pli-tv-kd11:32.2.16	similar to swords and stakes, 
pli-tv-kd11:32.2.17	and similar to a snake’s head; they are much suffering and much trouble, and the danger in them is greater.” 
pli-tv-kd11:32.2.18	But even though the monks corrected Ariṭṭha in this way, he stubbornly held on to that bad and erroneous view, and continued to insist on it. 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.1	And since they were not able to make him give up that view, they went to the Buddha and told him what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.2	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Ariṭṭha: 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.3	“Is it true, Ariṭṭha, that you have a bad and erroneous view such as this: 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.4	‘As I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in them’?” 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.5	“Yes indeed, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.6	“Foolish man, who do you think I have taught like this? 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.7	Haven’t I given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.8	and how they obstruct one who indulges in them? 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.9	I have said that there is little enjoyment in worldly pleasures, but much suffering and much trouble, and that the danger in them is greater. 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.10	I have said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton … 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.11	similar to a piece of meat … 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.12	similar to a grass torch … 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.13	similar to a pit of coals … 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.14	similar to a dream … 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.15	similar to borrowed goods … 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.16	similar to fruits on a tree … 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.17	similar to a knife and chopping block … 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.18	similar to swords and stakes … 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.19	similar to a snake’s head; they are much suffering and much trouble, and the danger in them is greater. 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.20	And yet by misunderstanding, you have misrepresented me, hurt yourself, and made much demerit. 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.21	This will be for your long-lasting harm and suffering. 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.22	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.23	and after rebuking him … 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.24	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.25	“Well then, the Sangha should do a legal procedure of ejecting Ariṭṭha for not giving up a bad view, 
pli-tv-kd11:32.3.26	prohibiting him from living with the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd11:32.4.1	And this is how it should be done. 
pli-tv-kd11:32.4.2	First you should accuse the monk Ariṭṭha. He should then be reminded of what he has done, before he is charged with an offense. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd11:32.4.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd11:32.4.4	The monk Ariṭṭha, the ex-vulture-killer, has the following bad and erroneous view: 
pli-tv-kd11:32.4.5	“As I understand the Teaching of the Buddha, the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in them.” 
pli-tv-kd11:32.4.6	He is not giving up that view.

pli-tv-kd11:32.4.13	He is not giving up that view. 
pli-tv-kd11:32.4.14	The Sangha is doing a legal procedure of ejecting Ariṭṭha for not giving up a bad view,

pli-tv-kd12:0.4	1. The proper conduct of those on probation 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.2	At that time monks on probation consented to regular monks bowing down to them, standing up for them, raising their joined palms to them, doing acts of respect toward them, offering them a seat, offering them a bed, offering them water for washing their feet and a foot-stool, offering them a foot-scraper, receiving their bowl and robe, and massaging their backs when bathing. 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.3	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.4	“How can monks on probation consent to these things?” 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.5	The monks told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.6	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.7	“Is it true, monks, that monks on probation consent to these things?” 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.8	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.9	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.10	“It’s not suitable … 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.11	How can monks on probation consent to these things? 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.12	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.13	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.14	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.15	“A monk on probation should not consent to: 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.16	Regular monks bowing down to him; 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.17	Regular monks standing up for him; 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.18	Regular monks raising their joined palms to him;

pli-tv-kd12:1.1.23	Regular monks offering him a foot-scraper; 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.24	Regular monks receiving his bowl and robe; 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.25	Regular monks massaging his back when he is bathing. 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.26	If he consents to any of these, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.27	Monks on probation should bow down to one another according to seniority, and likewise stand up, raise their joined palms, do acts of respect, offer a seat, offer a bed, offer water for washing the feet and a foot-stool, offer a foot-scraper, receive bowl and robe, and massage one another’s backs according to seniority when bathing. 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.28	Monks on probation should do five things with regular monks according to seniority: 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.29	the observance-day procedure, the invitation procedure, the sharing out of rainy-season robes, meal invitations, and meals. 
pli-tv-kd12:1.1.30	And I will lay down the proper conduct for a monk on probation. 
pli-tv-kd12:1.2.2	This is the proper conduct: 
pli-tv-kd12:1.2.3	He should not give the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd12:1.2.4	He should not give formal support. 
pli-tv-kd12:1.2.5	He should not have a novice monk attend on him.

pli-tv-kd12:1.2.7	Even if appointed, he should not instruct the nuns. 
pli-tv-kd12:1.2.8	He should not commit the same offense as the offense for which the Sangha gave him probation, nor one that is similar or worse.

pli-tv-kd12:1.2.19	He should not walk in front of a regular monk. 
pli-tv-kd12:1.2.20	He should not sit in front of a regular monk. 
pli-tv-kd12:1.2.21	He should be given the last seat, the last bed, and the last dwelling of the Sangha and should consent to that. 
pli-tv-kd12:1.2.22	He should not attend on a regular monk when going to families. 
pli-tv-kd12:1.2.23	He should not be attended on by a regular monk when going to families. 
pli-tv-kd12:1.2.24	He should not undertake the practice of staying in the wilderness. 
pli-tv-kd12:1.2.25	He should not undertake the practice of eating only almsfood. 
pli-tv-kd12:1.2.26	He should not have someone bring back almsfood for him because he doesn’t want others to know about his status. 
pli-tv-kd12:1.2.27	He should inform about his status when he is newly arrived in a monastery. 
pli-tv-kd12:1.2.28	He should inform new arrivals of his status.

pli-tv-kd12:2.1.3	and said, 
pli-tv-kd12:2.1.4	“How many things are there, Venerable Sir, that stop a monk on probation from counting a particular day toward his probationary period?” 
pli-tv-kd12:2.1.5	“There are three such things, Upāli: 
pli-tv-kd12:2.1.6	he stays in the same room as a regular monk; he stays apart from other monks; he doesn’t inform other monks of his status.” 
pli-tv-kd12:3.1.1	On one occasion a large sangha of monks had gathered at Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd12:3.1.2	The monks on probation were not able to fulfill their probationary duties.

pli-tv-kd12:3.2.1	Soon afterwards the monks at Sāvatthī left in various directions. 
pli-tv-kd12:3.2.2	The monks on probation were again able to fulfill their probationary duties. 
pli-tv-kd12:3.2.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd12:3.2.4	“I allow you to take up the probation. 
pli-tv-kd12:3.2.5	And it should be done like this. 
pli-tv-kd12:3.2.6	The monk on probation should approach a monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-kd12:3.2.7	‘I take up the probation,’ 
pli-tv-kd12:3.2.9	or ‘I take up the proper conduct.’” 
pli-tv-kd12:3.2.11	The proper conduct of those on probation is finished. 
pli-tv-kd12:4.1.0	2. The proper conduct of those deserving to be sent back to the beginning 
pli-tv-kd12:4.1.1	At this time monks deserving to be sent back to the beginning consented to regular monks bowing down to them, standing up for them, raising their joined palms to them, doing acts of respect toward them, offering them a seat, offering them a bed, offering them water for washing their feet and a foot-stool, offering them a foot-scraper, receiving their bowl and robe, and massaging their backs when bathing. 
pli-tv-kd12:4.1.2	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd12:4.1.3	“How can monks deserving to be sent back to the beginning consent to these things?” 
pli-tv-kd12:4.1.4	The monks told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd12:4.1.5	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd12:4.1.6	“Is it true, monks, that monks deserving to be sent back to the beginning consent to these things?” 
pli-tv-kd12:4.1.7	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd12:4.1.8	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-kd12:4.1.9	“It’s not suitable … 
pli-tv-kd12:4.1.10	How can monks deserving to be sent back to the beginning consent to these things? 
pli-tv-kd12:4.1.11	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd12:4.1.12	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd12:4.1.13	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

pli-tv-kd12:4.1.23	Regular monks receiving his bowl and robe; 
pli-tv-kd12:4.1.24	Regular monks massaging his back when he is bathing. 
pli-tv-kd12:4.1.25	If he consents to any of these, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd12:4.1.26	Monks deserving to be sent back to the beginning should bow down to one another according to seniority, and likewise stand up, raise their joined palms, do acts of respect, offer a seat, offer a bed, offer water for washing the feet and a foot-stool, offer a foot-scraper, receive bowl and robe, and massage one another’s backs according to seniority when bathing. 
pli-tv-kd12:4.1.27	Monks deserving to be sent back to the beginning should do five things with regular monks according to seniority: 
pli-tv-kd12:4.1.28	the observance-day procedure, the invitation procedure, sharing out of rainy-season robes, meal invitations, and meals. 
pli-tv-kd12:4.1.29	And I will lay down the proper conduct for a monk deserving to be sent back to the beginning.

pli-tv-kd12:6.1.114	sends back to the beginning, 
pli-tv-kd12:6.1.115	or gives the trial period, 
pli-tv-kd12:6.1.116	or as the twentieth member of a group, he rehabilitates, it is invalid and not to be done.” 
pli-tv-kd12:7.1.1	Soon afterwards Venerable Upāli went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd12:7.1.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd12:7.1.3	“How many things are there, Venerable Sir, that stop a monk undertaking the trial period from counting a particular day toward his trial period?” 
pli-tv-kd12:7.1.4	“There are four such things, Upāli: 
pli-tv-kd12:7.1.5	he stays in the same room as a regular monk; he stays apart from other monks; he doesn’t inform other monks of his status; he travels without a group.” 
pli-tv-kd12:8.1.1	On one occasion a large sangha of monks had gathered at Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd12:8.1.2	The monks undertaking the trial period were not able to fulfill their duties. 
pli-tv-kd12:8.1.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd12:8.1.4	“I allow you to set aside the trial period. 
pli-tv-kd12:8.1.5	And it should be done like this. 
pli-tv-kd12:8.1.6	The monk undertaking the trial period should approach a monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-kd12:8.1.7	‘I set aside the trial period,’ 
pli-tv-kd12:8.1.9	or ‘I set aside the proper conduct.’” 
pli-tv-kd12:8.1.11	Soon afterwards the monks at Sāvatthī left in various directions. 
pli-tv-kd12:8.1.12	The monks undertaking the trial period were again able to fulfill their duties. 
pli-tv-kd12:8.1.13	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd12:8.1.14	“I allow you to take up the trial period. 
pli-tv-kd12:8.1.15	And it should be done like this. 
pli-tv-kd12:8.1.16	The monk undertaking the trial period should approach a monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-kd12:8.1.17	‘I take up the trial period,’ 
pli-tv-kd12:8.1.19	or ‘I take up the proper conduct.’” 
pli-tv-kd12:8.1.21	The proper conduct of those undertaking the trial period is finished. 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.0	5. The proper conduct of those deserving rehabilitation. 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.1	At this time monks deserving rehabilitation consented to regular monks bowing down to them, standing up for them, raising their joined palms to them, doing acts of respect for them, offering them a seat, offering them a bed, offering them water for washing their feet and a foot-stool, offering them a foot-scraper, receiving their bowl and robe, 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.2	and massaging their backs when bathing. 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.3	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.4	“How can monks deserving rehabilitation consent to these things?” 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.5	The monks told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.6	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.7	“Is it true, monks, that monks deserving rehabilitation consent to these things?” 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.8	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.9	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.10	“It’s not suitable … 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.11	How can monks deserving rehabilitation consent to these things? 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.12	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.13	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.14	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.15	“A monk deserving rehabilitation should not consent to: 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.16	Regular monks bowing down to him; 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.17.1	Regular monks standing up for him; 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.17.2	Regular monks putting the palms of their hands together for him; 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.17.3	Regular monks doing acts of respect for him;

pli-tv-kd12:9.1.17.6	Regular monks offering him water for washing his feet and a foot-stool; 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.17.7	Regular monks offering him a foot-scraper; 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.17.8	Regular monks receiving his bowl and robe; 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.18	Regular monks massaging his back when he is bathing. 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.19	If he consents to any of these, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.20	Monks deserving rehabilitation should bow down to one another according to seniority, and likewise stand up, raise their joined palms, do acts of respect, offer a seat, offer a bed, offer water for washing the feet and a foot-stool, offer a foot-scraper, receive bowl and robe, and massage one another’s backs according to seniority when bathing. 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.21	Monks deserving rehabilitation should do five things with regular monks according to seniority: 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.22	the observance-day procedure, the invitation procedure, sharing out of rainy-season robes, meal invitations, and meals. 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.23	And I will lay down the proper conduct for a monk deserving rehabilitation. 
pli-tv-kd12:9.1.25	This is the proper conduct:

pli-tv-kd13:0.2	The Short Division 
pli-tv-kd13:0.3	The chapter containing the collection of processes for the clearing of offenses entailing suspension 
pli-tv-kd13:0.4	1. Emission of semen 
pli-tv-kd13:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd13:1.1.2	At that time Venerable Udāyī had committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. 
pli-tv-kd13:1.1.3	He told the monks about this, 
pli-tv-kd13:1.1.5	adding, “What should I do now?” 
pli-tv-kd13:1.1.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd13:1.1.7	“Well then, the Sangha should give the monk Udāyī the trial period of six days for one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. 
pli-tv-kd13:1.2.1	And it should be given like this: 
pli-tv-kd13:1.2.2.0	1.1 Trial periods for those with unconcealed offenses 
pli-tv-kd13:1.2.2.1	“The monk Udāyī should approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: 
pli-tv-kd13:1.2.3	‘Venerables, I have committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. 
pli-tv-kd13:1.2.4	I ask the Sangha for the trial period of six days for that offense.

pli-tv-kd13:1.2.8	For the third time I ask the Sangha for the trial period of six days for that offense.’ 
pli-tv-kd13:1.3.1	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd13:1.3.2	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd13:1.3.3	The monk Udāyī has committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. 
pli-tv-kd13:1.3.4	He is asking the Sangha for the trial period of six days for that offense. 
pli-tv-kd13:1.3.5	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give him the trial period of six days for that offense.

pli-tv-kd13:1.3.14	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd13:1.3.15	The monk Udāyī has committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen.

pli-tv-kd13:1.3.19	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd13:1.3.20	For the third time I speak on this matter. 
pli-tv-kd13:1.3.21	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd13:1.3.22	The monk Udāyī has committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen.

pli-tv-kd13:1.3.27	The Sangha has given the monk Udāyī the trial period of six days for one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. 
pli-tv-kd13:1.3.28	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd13:2.1.0	1.2 Rehabilitation for those with unconcealed offenses 
pli-tv-kd13:2.1.1	When he had completed the trial period, he told the monks, 
pli-tv-kd13:2.1.2	“I had committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. 
pli-tv-kd13:2.1.3	I asked the Sangha for the trial period of six days for that offense. 
pli-tv-kd13:2.1.4	The Sangha gave me the trial period, 
pli-tv-kd13:2.1.5	and I have now completed it. 
pli-tv-kd13:2.1.6	What should I do now?” 
pli-tv-kd13:2.1.7	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd13:2.1.8	“Well then, the Sangha should rehabilitate the monk Udāyī. 
pli-tv-kd13:2.2.1	And it should be done like this: 
pli-tv-kd13:2.2.2	The monk Udāyī should approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: 
pli-tv-kd13:2.2.3	‘Venerables, I had committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. I asked the Sangha for the trial period of six days for that offense, 
pli-tv-kd13:2.2.4	and the Sangha gave me the trial period.

pli-tv-kd13:2.2.6	I had committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. 
pli-tv-kd13:2.2.7	I asked the Sangha for the trial period of six days for that offense, 
pli-tv-kd13:2.2.8	and the Sangha gave me the trial period. 
pli-tv-kd13:2.2.9	I have now completed the trial period and for the second time I ask the Sangha for rehabilitation. 
pli-tv-kd13:2.2.10	I had committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. 
pli-tv-kd13:2.2.11	I asked the Sangha for the trial period of six days for that offense, 
pli-tv-kd13:2.2.12	and the Sangha gave me the trial period. 
pli-tv-kd13:2.2.13	I have now completed the trial period and for the third time I ask the Sangha for rehabilitation.’ 
pli-tv-kd13:2.3.1	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd13:2.3.2	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd13:2.3.3	The monk Udāyī had committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen.

pli-tv-kd13:2.3.6	He’s now completed the trial period and is asking the Sangha for rehabilitation. 
pli-tv-kd13:2.3.7	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should rehabilitate him. 
pli-tv-kd13:2.3.8	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd13:2.3.9	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd13:2.3.10	The monk Udāyī had committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen.

pli-tv-kd13:2.3.14	The Sangha rehabilitates him. 
pli-tv-kd13:2.3.15	Any monk who approves of rehabilitating him should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd13:2.3.16	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd13:2.3.17	For the second time I speak on this matter.

pli-tv-kd13:26.1.11	adding, “What should I do now?” 
pli-tv-kd13:26.1.12	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd13:26.1.13	“Well then, the Sangha should give that monk a purifying probation for those offenses. 
pli-tv-kd13:26.2.1	And it should be given like this:

pli-tv-kd13:26.2.10	and a third time. 
pli-tv-kd13:26.2.11	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:

pli-tv-kd14:3.1.22	A sangha that speaks in accordance with the Teaching persuades several people who speak contrary to the Teaching—convinces them, makes them see, makes them consider, shows them, teaches them: 
pli-tv-kd14:3.1.23	‘This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction; learn this, accept this.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:3.1.24	If a legal issue is resolved like this, it is resolved legitimately by resolution face-to-face. 
pli-tv-kd14:3.1.25	A sangha that speaks in accordance with the Teaching persuades a sangha that speaks contrary to the Teaching—convinces it, makes it see, makes it consider, shows it, teaches it: 
pli-tv-kd14:3.1.26	‘This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction; learn this, accept this.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:3.1.27	If a legal issue is resolved like this, it is resolved legitimately by resolution face-to-face.” 
pli-tv-kd14:3.1.28	The group of nine on the bright side is finished. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.1.0	2. Resolution through recollection 
pli-tv-kd14:4.1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.1.2	Venerable Dabba the Mallian realized perfection at the age of seven. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.1.3	He had achieved all there is to achieve by a disciple 
pli-tv-kd14:4.1.4	and had nothing further to do. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.1.5	While he was in seclusion he reflected on this, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.1.9	and he thought, “How can I be of service to the Sangha? 
pli-tv-kd14:4.1.11	Why donʼt I assign the dwellings and designate the meals?” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.2.1	In the evening Dabba came out of seclusion and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.2.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.2.3	“Venerable Sir, while I was in seclusion I reflected that 
pli-tv-kd14:4.2.4	I’ve achieved all there is to achieve by a disciple, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.2.7	and I was wondering how I could be of service to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.2.8	I thought, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.2.9	ʻWhy don’t I assign the dwellings and designate the meals?ʼ” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.2.11	“Good, good, Dabba, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.2.12	please do so.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.2.13	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.3.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd14:4.3.2	“Monks, the Sangha should appoint Dabba the Mallian as the assigner of dwellings and the designator of meals. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.3.3	And he should be appointed like this. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.3.4	First Dabba should be asked. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.3.5	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd14:4.3.6	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.3.7	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should appoint Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.3.8	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.3.9	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.3.10	The Sangha appoints Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.3.11	Any monk who approves of appointing Venerable Dabba as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.3.12	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.3.13	The Sangha has appointed Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.3.14	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.1	Dabba assigned dwellings to the monks according to their character. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.2	He assigned dwellings in the same place to those monks who were experts on the discourse, thinking, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.3	“They’ll recite the discourses together.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.4	And he did likewise for the experts on Monastic Law, thinking, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.5	“They’ll deliberate on the Monastic Law;” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.6	for the expounders of the Teaching, thinking, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.7	“They’ll discuss the Teaching;” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.8	for the meditators, thinking, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.9	“They won’t disturb one another;” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.10	and for the gossips and the body-builders, thinking, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.11	“In this way even these venerables will be happy.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.12	When monks arrived at night, he entered the fire element and assigned dwellings with the help of that light. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.13	Monks even arrived late on purpose, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.14	hoping to see the marvel of Dabba’s supernormal powers. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.15	They would approach Dabba and say, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.16	“Venerable Dabba, please assign us a dwelling.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.18	“Where would you like to stay?” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.19	They would intentionally suggest somewhere far away: 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.20	“On the Vulture Peak,” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.21	“At Robbers’ Cliff,” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.22	“On Black Rock on the slope of Mount Isigili,” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.23	“In the Sattapaṇṇi Cave on the slope of Mount Vebhāra,” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.24	“In Cool Grove on the hill at the Snake’s Pool,” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.25	“At Gotamaka Gorge,” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.26	“At Tinduka Gorge,” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.27	“At Tapoda Gorge,” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.28	“In Tapoda Park,” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.29	“In Jīvaka’s Mango Grove,” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.30	“In the deer park at Maddakucchi.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.31	Dabba then entered the fire element, and with his finger glowing, he walked in front of those monks. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.32	They followed behind him with the help of that light. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.33	And he would assign them dwellings: 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.34	“This is the bed, this the bench, this the mattress, this the pillow, this the place for defecating, this the place for urinating, this the water for drinking, this the water for washing, this the walking stick; these are the Sangha’s agreements concerning the right time to enter and the right time to leave.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.4.35	Dabba then returned to the Bamboo Grove. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.5.1	At that time the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka were only newly ordained. They had little merit, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.5.2	getting inferior dwellings and meals. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.5.3	The people of Rājagaha were keen to give specially prepared almsfood to the senior monks—
pli-tv-kd14:4.5.4	ghee, oil, and special curries—
pli-tv-kd14:4.5.5	but to the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka they gave ordinary food of 
pli-tv-kd14:4.5.6	porridge and broken rice. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.5.7	After the meal, when they had returned from almsround, they asked the senior monks, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.5.8	“What did you get at the dining hall?” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.5.9	Some said, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.5.10	“We got ghee, oil, and special curries.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.5.11	But the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.5.12	“We didn’t get anything 
pli-tv-kd14:4.5.13	except ordinary food of porridge and broken rice.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.6.1	At that time there was a householder who gave a regular meal of fine food to four monks. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.6.2	He made his offering in the dining hall together with his wives and children. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.6.3	Some of them offered rice, some bean curry, some oil, and some special curries. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.6.4	On one occasion the meal to be given by this householder on the following day had been designated to the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.6.5	Just then that householder went to the monastery on some business. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.6.6	He approached Dabba, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.6.7	And Dabba instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.6.8	After the talk, he asked Dabba, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.6.9	“Sir, who has been designated to receive tomorrow’s meal in our house?” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.6.10	“Mettiya and Bhūmajaka.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.6.11	He was disappointed, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.6.12	and thought, “Why should bad monks eat in our house?” After returning to his house, he told a female slave, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.6.13	“For those who are coming for tomorrow’s meal, prepare seats at the gateway and serve them broken rice and porridge.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.6.14	“Yes, sir.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.1	The monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said to each other, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.2	“Yesterday we were designated a meal from the householder who offers fine food. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.3	Tomorrow he’ll serve us together with his wives and children. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.4	Some of them will offer us rice, some bean curry, some oil, and some special curries.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.5	And because they were excited, they did not sleep properly that night. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.6	The following morning they robed up, took their bowls and robes, and went to the house of that householder. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.7	When the female slave saw them coming, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.8	she prepared seats at the gateway and said to them, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.9	“Please sit, Venerables.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.10	They thought, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.11	“The meal can’t be ready, since we’re given seats at the gateway.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.12	She then brought them broken rice and porridge, and said, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.13	“Eat, Sirs.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.14	“But, Sister, we’ve come for the regular meal.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.15	“I know. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.16	But yesterday I was told by the head of our household 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.17	to serve you like this. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.18	Please eat.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.19	They said to each other, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.20	“Yesterday this householder came to the monastery and spoke with Dabba. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.21	Dabba must be responsible for this split between the householder and us.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.22	And because they were dejected, they did not eat as much as they had intended. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.7.23	After the meal they returned to the monastery, put their bowls and robes away, and sat outside the monastery gateway, using their upper robe as a back-and-knee strap. They were silent and humiliated, their shoulders drooping and their heads down, glum and speechless. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.1	Just then the nun Mettiyā came to them and said, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.2	“My respectful greetings to you, Venerables.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.3	But they did not respond. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.4	A second time and 
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.5	a third time she said the same thing, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.7	but they still did not respond. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.8	“Have I done something wrong? 
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.9	Why don’t you respond?” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.10	“It’s because we’ve been badly treated by Dabba the Mallian, and you’re not taking an interest.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.11	“But what can I do?” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.12	“If you like, you could make the Buddha expel Dabba.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.13	
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.14	“And how can I do that?” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.15	“Go to the Buddha and say, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.16	‘Venerable Sir, this is not proper or appropriate. There’s fear, distress, and oppression in this district, where none of these should exist. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.17	From where one would expect security, there’s insecurity. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.18	It’s as if water is burning. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.19	Venerable Dabba the Mallian has raped me.’” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.20	Saying, “Alright, Venerables,” she went to the Buddha, bowed, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.21	and repeated 
pli-tv-kd14:4.8.22	what she had been told to say. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Dabba: 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.2	“Dabba, do you remember doing as the nun Mettiyā says?” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.3	“Venerable Sir, you know what I’m like.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.4	A second 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.7	and a third time the Buddha asked 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.8	the same question 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.9	and got the same response. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.10	He then said, “Dabba, the Dabbas don’t give such evasive answers. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.11	If it was done by you, say so; 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.12	if it wasn’t, then say that.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.13	“Since I was born, Sir, I don’t recall having sexual intercourse even in a dream, let alone when awake.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.14	The Buddha addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.15	“Well then, monks, expel the nun Mettiyā, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.16	and call these monks to account.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.17	The Buddha then got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.18	When the monks had expelled the nun Mettiyā, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.19	the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said to them, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.20	“Don’t expel the nun Mettiyā; she’s done nothing wrong. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.21	She was urged on by us. We were angry and displeased, and trying to get Dabba to leave the monastic life.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.22	“But did you groundlessly charge Venerable Dabba with failure in morality?” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.23	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.24	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.25	“How could the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka groundlessly charge Venerable Dabba with failure in morality?” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.26	They rebuked those monks in many ways and then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned those monks: 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.27	“Is it true, monks, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.28	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.29	after rebuking them … 
pli-tv-kd14:4.9.30	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.1	“Well then, because of his great clarity of memory, grant resolution through recollection to Dabba the Mallian. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.2	And it should be granted like this: 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.3	Dabba should approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.4	‘Venerables, these monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging me with failure in morality. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.5	Because of my great clarity of memory, I ask the Sangha for resolution through recollection. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.6	Venerables, these monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging me with failure in morality. Because of my great clarity of memory, for the second time I ask the Sangha for resolution through recollection. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.8	Venerables, these monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging me with failure in morality. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.9	Because of my great clarity of memory, for the third time I ask the Sangha for resolution through recollection.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.10	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.11	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.12	These monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging Venerable Dabba the Mallian with failure in morality. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.13	Because of his great clarity of memory, Dabba is asking the Sangha for resolution through recollection. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.14	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should grant resolution through recollection to Dabba. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.15	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.16	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.17	These monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging Venerable Dabba the Mallian with failure in morality. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.18	Because of his great clarity of memory, Dabba is asking the Sangha for resolution through recollection. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.19	The Sangha grants resolution through recollection to Dabba. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.20	Any monk who approves of granting resolution through recollection to Dabba should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.21	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.22	For the second time I speak on this matter. … 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.23	For the third time I speak on this matter. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.24	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.25	These monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging Venerable Dabba the Mallian with failure in morality. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.26	Because of his great clarity of memory, Dabba is asking the Sangha for resolution through recollection. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.27	The Sangha grants resolution through recollection to Dabba. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.28	Any monk who approves of granting resolution through recollection to Dabba should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.29	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.30	Because of his great clarity of memory, the Sangha has granted resolution through recollection to Dabba the Mallian. 
pli-tv-kd14:4.10.31	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:4.11.1	“There are these five factors for the legitimate granting of resolution through recollection: 
pli-tv-kd14:4.11.2	the monk is pure and free of offenses; he’s been accused; he asks for resolution through recollection; the Sangha grants him resolution through recollection; the legal procedure is legitimate and done by a unanimous assembly.” 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.0	3. Resolution because of past insanity 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.1	At one time the monk Gagga was insane and suffering from psychosis. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.2	Because of that, he did and said many things unworthy of a monastic. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.3	Monks accused him of an offense, saying, 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.4	“Venerable, do you remember committing such-and-such an offense?” 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.6	“I was insane and suffering from psychosis. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.7	Because of that, I did and said many things unworthy of a monastic. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.8	I don’t remember it; 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.9	I did it because I was insane.” 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.10	But they still accused him 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.11	in the same way. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.12	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.13	“How can these monks keep on accusing Gagga 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.15	when he says 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.16	he was insane?” 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.22	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned them: 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.23	He said, “Is it true, monks, that these monks are doing this?” 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.24	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.25	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.26	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd14:5.1.27	“Well then, since he is no longer insane, grant resolution because of past insanity to the monk Gagga. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.1	And it should be granted like this: 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.2	The monk Gagga should approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.3	‘Venerables, I have been insane and suffering from psychosis. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.4	Because of that, I did and said many things unworthy of a monastic. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.5	Monks accused me of an offense, 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.6	“Venerable, do you remember committing such-and-such an offense?” 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.7	I replied, 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.8	“I was insane and suffering from psychosis. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.9	Because of that, I did and said many things unworthy of a monastic. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.10	I don’t remember it; 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.11	I did it because I was insane.” 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.12	But they still accused me 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.13	in the same way. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.14	Because I’m no longer insane, I ask the Sangha for resolution because of past insanity.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.15	And he should ask a second time, 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.16	and a third time: 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.17	‘Venerables, I have been insane and suffering from psychosis. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.18	Because of that, I did and said many things unworthy of a monastic. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.19	Monks accused me of an offense, 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.20	“Venerable, do you remember committing such-and-such an offense?” 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.21	I replied, 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.22	“I was insane and suffering from psychosis. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.23	Because of that, I did and said many things unworthy of a monastic. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.24	I don’t remember it; I did it because I was insane.” 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.25	But they still accused me 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.26	in the same way. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.27	Because I’m no longer insane, for the third time I ask the Sangha for resolution because of past insanity.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.28	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.29	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.30	The monk Gagga has been insane and suffering from psychosis. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.31	Because of that, he did and said many things unworthy of a monastic. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.32	Monks accused him of an offense,

pli-tv-kd14:5.2.36	Because of that, I did and said many things unworthy of a monastic. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.37	I don’t remember it; I did it because I was insane.” 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.38	But they still accused him 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.39	in the same way. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.40	Because he is no longer insane, he is asking the Sangha for resolution because of past insanity. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.41	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should grant resolution because of past insanity to Gagga. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.42	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.43	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.44	The monk Gagga has been insane and suffering from psychosis. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.45	Because of that, he did and said many things unworthy of a monastic. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.46	Monks accused him of an offense, 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.47	“Venerable, do you remember committing such-and-such an offense?” 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.48	He replied, 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.49	“I was insane and suffering from psychosis. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.50	Because of that, I did and said many things unworthy of a monastic. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.51	I don’t remember it; I did it because I was insane.”

pli-tv-kd14:5.2.54	Because he is no longer insane, he is asking the Sangha for resolution because of past insanity. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.55	The Sangha grants resolution because of past insanity to Gagga. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.56	Any monk who approves of granting resolution because of past insanity to Gagga should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.57	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.58	For the second time I speak on this matter. … 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.59	For the third time I speak on this matter. … 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.60	Since he is no longer insane, the Sangha has granted resolution because of past insanity to the monk Gagga. 
pli-tv-kd14:5.2.61	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:6.1.1	There are three illegitimate and three legitimate grantings of resolution because of past insanity. 
pli-tv-kd14:6.1.2	What are the three illegitimate grantings of resolution because of past insanity? 
pli-tv-kd14:6.1.3	It may be that a monk has committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd14:6.1.4	The Sangha, several monks, or a single monk accuses him, saying, 
pli-tv-kd14:6.1.5	‘Venerable, do you remember committing such-and-such an offense?’ 
pli-tv-kd14:6.1.6	Although he remembers, he says 
pli-tv-kd14:6.1.7	he doesn’t. 
pli-tv-kd14:6.1.8	If the Sangha grants him resolution because of past insanity, 
pli-tv-kd14:6.1.9	then that granting is illegitimate. 
pli-tv-kd14:6.1.10	It may be that a monk has committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd14:6.1.11	The Sangha, several monks, or a single monk accuses him, saying,

pli-tv-kd14:6.1.13	Although he remembers, he says, 
pli-tv-kd14:6.1.14	‘I remember as if in a dream.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:6.1.15	If the Sangha grants him resolution because of past insanity,

pli-tv-kd14:6.1.22	and so do you. 
pli-tv-kd14:6.1.23	This is allowable for me, 
pli-tv-kd14:6.1.24	and also for you.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:6.1.25	If the Sangha grants him resolution because of past insanity, 
pli-tv-kd14:6.1.26	then that granting is illegitimate. 
pli-tv-kd14:6.2.1	These are the three illegitimate grantings of resolution because of past insanity. 
pli-tv-kd14:6.2.2	What are the three legitimate grantings of resolution because of past insanity?

pli-tv-kd14:6.2.6	‘Venerable, do you remember committing such-and-such an offense?’ 
pli-tv-kd14:6.2.7	Not remembering, he says 
pli-tv-kd14:6.2.8	he doesn’t. 
pli-tv-kd14:6.2.9	If the Sangha grants him resolution because of past insanity,

pli-tv-kd14:7.1.0	4. Acting according to what has been admitted 
pli-tv-kd14:7.1.1	At one time the monks from the group of six did legal procedures—
pli-tv-kd14:7.1.2	condemnation, demotion, banishment, reconciliation, and ejection—against other monks without their admission. 
pli-tv-kd14:7.1.3	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd14:7.1.4	“How can the monks from the group of six do this?” 
pli-tv-kd14:7.1.6	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned them: 
pli-tv-kd14:7.1.7	“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are doing this?” 
pli-tv-kd14:7.1.8	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd14:7.1.9	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd14:7.1.10	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd14:7.1.11	“You should not do legal procedures—
pli-tv-kd14:7.1.12	condemnation, demotion, banishment, reconciliation, or ejection—against monks without their admission. 
pli-tv-kd14:7.1.13	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd14:8.1.2	“And how is acting according to what has been admitted illegitimate? 
pli-tv-kd14:8.1.3	It may be that a monk has committed an offense entailing expulsion. 
pli-tv-kd14:8.1.4	The Sangha, several monks, or a single monk accuses him, saying, 
pli-tv-kd14:8.1.5	‘Venerable, you have committed an offense entailing expulsion.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:8.1.6	He says, 
pli-tv-kd14:8.1.7	‘I haven’t committed an offense entailing expulsion, but one entailing suspension.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:8.1.8	If the Sangha makes him act according to an offense entailing suspension, 
pli-tv-kd14:8.1.9	then that acting according to what has been admitted is illegitimate. 
pli-tv-kd14:8.1.10	It may be that a monk has committed an offense entailing expulsion.

pli-tv-kd14:8.1.13	He says, 
pli-tv-kd14:8.1.14	‘I haven’t committed an offense entailing expulsion, but a serious offense … 
pli-tv-kd14:8.1.15	but an offense entailing confession … 
pli-tv-kd14:8.1.16	but an offense entailing acknowledgment … 
pli-tv-kd14:8.1.17	but an offense of wrong conduct … 
pli-tv-kd14:8.1.18	but an offense of wrong speech.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:8.1.19	If the Sangha makes him act according to an offense of wrong speech, 
pli-tv-kd14:8.1.20	then that acting according to what has been admitted is illegitimate. 
pli-tv-kd14:8.1.21	It may be that a monk has committed an offense entailing suspension …

pli-tv-kd14:8.1.42	If the Sangha makes him act according to an offense of wrong conduct, 
pli-tv-kd14:8.1.43	then that acting according to what has been admitted is illegitimate.

pli-tv-kd14:8.2.3	It may be that a monk has committed an offense entailing expulsion. 
pli-tv-kd14:8.2.4	The Sangha, several monks, or a single monk accuses him, saying 
pli-tv-kd14:8.2.5	‘Venerable, you have committed an offense entailing expulsion.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:8.2.6	He says, 
pli-tv-kd14:8.2.7	‘Yes, I have committed an offense entailing expulsion.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:8.2.8	If the Sangha makes him act according to an offense entailing expulsion, 
pli-tv-kd14:8.2.9	then that acting according to what has been admitted is legitimate. 
pli-tv-kd14:8.2.10	It may be that a monk has committed an offense entailing suspension … 
pli-tv-kd14:8.2.11	a serious offense …

pli-tv-kd14:8.2.19	‘Yes, I have committed an offense of wrong speech.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:8.2.20	If the Sangha makes him act according to an offense wrong speech, 
pli-tv-kd14:8.2.21	then that acting according to what has been admitted is legitimate.” 
pli-tv-kd14:9.1.0	5. Majority decision 
pli-tv-kd14:9.1.1	At one time the monks were arguing and disputing in the midst of the Sangha, attacking one another verbally, and they were unable to resolve that legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd14:9.1.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd14:9.1.3	“I allow you to resolve such legal issues by majority decision. 
pli-tv-kd14:9.1.4	You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the manager of the vote: 
pli-tv-kd14:9.1.5	one who isn’t swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and who knows who has and has not voted. 
pli-tv-kd14:9.1.6	And he should be appointed like this. 
pli-tv-kd14:9.1.7	First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd14:9.1.8	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:9.1.9	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint monk so-and-so as the manager of the vote. 
pli-tv-kd14:9.1.10	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd14:9.1.11	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:9.1.12	The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as the manager of the vote. 
pli-tv-kd14:9.1.13	Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as the manager of the vote should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd14:9.1.14	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd14:9.1.15	The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as the manager of the vote. 
pli-tv-kd14:9.1.16	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:10.1.1	“There are ten reasons why a vote is illegitimate: 
pli-tv-kd14:10.1.3	it is only a minor legal issue; the full process for settling it hasn’t run its course; they haven’t tried to remember offenses and remind about offenses; the manager knows that those who speak contrary to the Teaching are in the majority; the manager expects that those who speak contrary to the Teaching will be in the majority; the manager knows that the Sangha will split; the manager expects that the Sangha will be split; they vote illegitimately; they vote with an incomplete assembly; they don’t vote according to their own views. 
pli-tv-kd14:10.2.1	There are ten reasons why a vote is legitimate: 
pli-tv-kd14:10.2.2	it’s not a minor legal issue; the full process for settling it has run its course; they have tried to remember offenses and remind about offenses; the manager knows that those who speak in accordance with the Teaching are in the majority; the manager expects that those who speak in accordance with the Teaching will be in the majority; the manager knows that the Sangha will not split; the manager expects that the Sangha will not be split; they vote legitimately; they vote with a complete assembly; they vote according to their own views.” 
pli-tv-kd14:11.1.0	6. Further penalty 
pli-tv-kd14:11.1.1	On one occasion, while the monk Upavāḷa was being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an offense, he asserted things after denying them, denied things after asserting them, evaded the issue, and lied. 
pli-tv-kd14:11.1.2	The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd14:11.1.3	“How could the monk Upavāḷa act like this?” 
pli-tv-kd14:11.1.4	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned them: 
pli-tv-kd14:11.1.5	“Is it true, monks, that the monk Upavāḷa is acting like this?” 
pli-tv-kd14:11.1.6	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd14:11.1.7	after criticizing him … 
pli-tv-kd14:11.1.8	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd14:11.1.9	“Well then, the Sangha should do a legal procedure of further penalty against the monk Upavāḷa. 
pli-tv-kd14:11.2.1	And it should be done like this. 
pli-tv-kd14:11.2.2	First you should accuse the monk Upavāḷa. He should then be reminded of what he’s done, before he is charged with an offense. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd14:11.2.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:11.2.4	The monk Upavāḷa, while being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an offense, asserted things after denying them, denied things after asserting them, evaded the issue, and lied. 
pli-tv-kd14:11.2.5	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do a legal procedure of further penalty against him. 
pli-tv-kd14:11.2.6	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd14:11.2.7	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:11.2.8	The monk Upavāḷa, while being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an offense, asserted things after denying them, denied things after asserting them, evaded the issue, and lied. 
pli-tv-kd14:11.2.9	The Sangha should do a legal procedure of further penalty against him. 
pli-tv-kd14:11.2.10	Any monk who approves of doing a legal procedure of further penalty against him should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd14:11.2.11	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd14:11.2.12	For the second time I speak on this matter. … 
pli-tv-kd14:11.2.13	For the third time I speak on this matter. … 
pli-tv-kd14:11.2.14	The Sangha has done a legal procedure of further penalty against the monk Upavāḷa. 
pli-tv-kd14:11.2.15	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:12.1.1	There are these five factors of a legitimate legal procedure of further penalty: 
pli-tv-kd14:12.1.2	the subject of the procedure is impure; he is shameless; he’s been accused; the procedure is legitimate; the procedure is done by a unanimous assembly.

pli-tv-kd14:12.4.0	6.3 The group of six on wishing 
pli-tv-kd14:12.4.1	“When a monk has three qualities, the Sangha may, if it wishes, do a legal procedure of further penalty against him: 
pli-tv-kd14:12.4.2	he is quarrelsome, argumentative, and a creator of legal issues in the Sangha; 
pli-tv-kd14:12.4.3	he is ignorant, incompetent, often committing offenses, incapable of determining whether he’s committed an offense; 
pli-tv-kd14:12.4.4	he is constantly and improperly socializing with householders. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.4.6	When a monk has another three qualities, the Sangha may, if it wishes, do a procedure of further penalty against him: 
pli-tv-kd14:12.4.7	he has failed in the higher morality; he has failed in conduct; he has failed in view. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.4.9	When a monk has another three qualities, the Sangha may, if it wishes, do a procedure of further penalty against him: 
pli-tv-kd14:12.4.10	he disparages the Buddha; he disparages the Teaching; he disparages the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.4.12	The Sangha may, if it wishes, do a procedure of further penalty against three kinds of monks: 
pli-tv-kd14:12.4.13	those who are quarrelsome, argumentative, 
pli-tv-kd14:12.4.14	and creators of legal issues in the Sangha; 
pli-tv-kd14:12.4.15	those who are ignorant, incompetent, often committing offenses, incapable of determining whether they have committed an offense; 
pli-tv-kd14:12.4.16	those who are constantly and improperly socializing with householders. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.4.18	The Sangha may, if it wishes, do a procedure of further penalty against another three kinds of monks: 
pli-tv-kd14:12.4.19	those who have failed in the higher morality; those who have failed in the higher conduct; those who have failed in view. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.4.21	The Sangha may, if it wishes, do a procedure of further penalty against another three kinds of monks: 
pli-tv-kd14:12.4.22	those who disparage the Buddha; those who disparage the Teaching; those who disparage the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.0	6.4 The eighteen kinds of conduct 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.1	“A monk who has had a legal procedure of further penalty done against himself should conduct himself properly. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.2	This is the proper conduct: 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.3	He should not give the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.4	He should not give formal support. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.5	He should not have a novice monk attend on him. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.6	He should not accept being appointed as an instructor of the nuns. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.7.1	Even if appointed, he should not instruct the nuns. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.7.2	He should not commit the same offense as the offense for which the Sangha did the procedure of further penalty against him. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.7.3	He should not commit an offense similar to the offense for which the Sangha did the procedure of further penalty against him. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.7.4	He should not commit an offense worse than the offense for which the Sangha did the procedure of further penalty against him. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.7.5	He should not criticize the procedure. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.7.6	He should not criticize those who did the procedure. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.7.7	He should not cancel the observance-day procedure of a regular monk. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.7.8	He should not cancel the invitation of a regular monk. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.7.9	He should not speak to a regular monk to initiate a legal process against him. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.7.10	He should not criticize a regular monk. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.7.11	He should not ask a regular monk for permission to accuse him of an offense. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.7.12	He should not accuse a regular monk of an offense. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.7.13	He should not remind a regular monk of an offense. 
pli-tv-kd14:12.5.8	He should not associate inappropriately with other monks.” 
pli-tv-kd14:12.6.1	The Sangha then did a legal procedure of further penalty against the monk Upavāḷa. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.1.0	7. Covering over as if with grass 
pli-tv-kd14:13.1.1	At one time, while the monks were arguing and disputing, they did and said many things unworthy of a monastic. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.1.2	They considered this and thought, 
pli-tv-kd14:13.1.4	“If we deal with one another for these offenses, this legal issue might lead to harshness, nastiness, and schism. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.1.5	So what should we do now?” 
pli-tv-kd14:13.1.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd14:13.1.7	“It may be, monks, that monks who are arguing and disputing do and say many things unworthy of a monastic. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.1.8	If they consider this and think, 
pli-tv-kd14:13.1.10	‘If we deal with one another for these offenses, this legal issue might lead to harshness, nastiness, and schism,’ then I allow you to resolve this legal issue by covering over as if with grass. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.2.1	And it should be resolved like this. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.2.2	Everyone should gather in one place. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd14:13.2.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.2.4	While we were arguing and disputing, we did and said many things unworthy of a monastic. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.2.5	If we deal with one another for these offenses, this legal issue might lead to harshness, nastiness, and schism. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.2.6	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should resolve this legal issue by covering over as if with grass, except for heavy offenses and offenses connected with householders.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:13.2.7	The monks belonging to one side should be informed by a competent and capable monk belonging to their own side: 
pli-tv-kd14:13.2.8	‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.2.9	While we were arguing and disputing, we did and said many things unworthy of a monastic. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.2.10	If we deal with one another for these offenses, this legal issue might lead to harshness, nastiness, and schism. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.2.11	If it seems appropriate to the venerables, then for your benefit and for my own, I will confess in the midst of the Sangha both your and my own offenses by covering over as if with grass, except for heavy offenses and offenses connected with householders.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:13.2.12	The monks belonging to the other side should be informed by a competent and capable monk belonging to their own side: 
pli-tv-kd14:13.2.13	‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.2.14	While we were arguing and disputing, we did and said many things unworthy of a monastic. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.2.15	If we deal with one another for these offenses, this legal issue might lead to harshness, nastiness, and schism. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.2.16	If it seems appropriate to the venerables, then for your benefit and for my own, I will confess in the midst of the Sangha both your and my own offenses by covering over as if with grass, except for heavy offenses and offenses connected with householders.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:13.3.1	“A competent and capable monk belonging to one side should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd14:13.3.2	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.3.3	While we were arguing and disputing, we did and said many things unworthy of a monastic.

pli-tv-kd14:13.3.5	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, then for the benefit of these venerables and myself, I will confess in the midst of the Sangha both their and my own offenses by covering over as if with grass, except for heavy offenses and offenses connected with householders. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.3.6	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.3.7	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.3.8	While we were arguing and disputing, we did and said many things unworthy of a monastic. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.3.9	If we deal with one another for these offenses, this legal issue might lead to harshness, nastiness, and schism. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.3.10	For the benefit of these venerables and myself, I confess in the midst of the Sangha both their and my own offenses by covering over as if with grass, except for heavy offenses and offenses connected with householders. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.3.11	Any monk who approves of the confession in the midst of the Sangha of both their and my own offenses by covering over as if with grass, except for heavy offenses and offenses connected with householders should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.3.12	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.3.13	We have confessed these offenses in the midst of the Sangha by covering over as if with grass, except for heavy offenses and offenses connected with householders. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.3.14	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:13.3.15	“A competent and capable monk belonging to the other side should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd14:13.3.16	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:13.3.17	While we were arguing and disputing, we did and said many things unworthy of a monastic.

pli-tv-kd14:13.4.1	“In this way those monks are cleared of those offenses, except for heavy offenses and offenses connected with householders, and except for those monks who state their objection and those who are absent.” 
pli-tv-kd14:14.1.0	8. Legal issues 
pli-tv-kd14:14.1.1	On one occasion monks were disputing with monks, monks with nuns, and nuns with monks. Standing with the nuns, the monk Channa disputed with the monks, making others side with the nuns. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.1.2	The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.1.3	“How can the monk Channa act like this?” 
pli-tv-kd14:14.1.4	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned them: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.1.5	“Is it true, monks, that the monk Channa is acting like this?” 
pli-tv-kd14:14.1.6	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd14:14.1.7	after criticizing him … 
pli-tv-kd14:14.1.8	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.2.1	“Monks, there are four kinds of legal issues: legal issues arising from disputes; legal issues arising from accusations; legal issues arising from offenses; legal issues arising from business. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.2.2	(1a) What is a legal issue arising from a dispute? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.2.3	It may be that the monks are disputing, saying, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.2.4	‘This is the Teaching’, ‘This is contrary to the Teaching’, ‘This is the Monastic Law’, ‘This is contrary to the Monastic Law’, ‘This was spoken by the Buddha’, ‘This was not spoken by the Buddha’, ‘This was practiced by the Buddha’, ‘This was not practiced by the Buddha’, ‘This was laid down by the Buddha’, ‘This was not laid down by the Buddha’, ‘This is an offense’, ‘This is not an offense’, ‘This is a light offense’, ‘This is a heavy offense’, ‘This is a curable offense’, ‘This is an incurable offense’, ‘This is a grave offense’, or ‘This is a minor offense.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.2.5	In regard to this, whatever quarreling, arguing, conflict, disputing, variety in opinion, difference in opinion, heated speech, or strife there is—
pli-tv-kd14:14.2.6	this is called a legal issue arising from a dispute. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.2.7	(1b) What is a legal issue arising from an accusation? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.2.8	It may be that the monks accuse a monk of failure in morality, failure in conduct, failure in view, or failure in livelihood. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.2.9	In regard to this, whatever accusation, accusing, allegation, blame, taking sides because of friendship, taking part in the accusation, or supporting the accusation there is—
pli-tv-kd14:14.2.10	this is called a legal issue arising from an accusation. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.2.11	(1c) What is a legal issue arising from an offense? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.2.12	There are legal issues arising from offenses because of the five classes of offenses; there are legal issues arising from offenses because of the seven classes of offenses—
pli-tv-kd14:14.2.13	this is called a legal issue arising from an offense. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.2.14	(1d) What is a legal issue arising from business? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.2.15	Whatever is the duty or the business of the Sangha—a legal procedure consisting of getting permission, a legal procedure consisting of one motion, a legal procedure consisting of one motion and one announcement, a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements—
pli-tv-kd14:14.2.16	this is called a legal issue arising from business. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.1	(2a) What is the root of legal issues arising from disputes? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.2	There are six roots of disputes that in turn are the root of legal issues arising from disputes. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.3	There are also three unwholesome and three wholesome roots of legal issues arising from disputes. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.4	What are the six roots of disputes that in turn are the root of legal issues arising from disputes? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.5	It may be that a monk is angry and resentful. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.6	One who is angry and resentful is disrespectful and undeferential toward the Teacher, the Teaching, and the Sangha, and he doesn’t fulfill the training. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.7	Such a person 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.9	creates disputes in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.10	Disputes are unbeneficial and a cause of unhappiness for the general population; they are harmful, detrimental, and a cause of suffering for gods and humans. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.11	Monks, when you see such a root of disputes either in yourself or in others, you should make an effort to get rid of it. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.12	If you don’t see such a root either in yourself or in others, you should practice so that it doesn’t reappear in the future. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.13	In this way that bad root of disputes is abandoned. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.15	Or it may be that a monk is denigrating and controlling, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.16	envious and stingy, treacherous and deceitful, one who has bad desires and wrong views, or one who obstinately grasps his own views and only gives them up with difficulty. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.17	Any of these is disrespectful and undeferential toward the Teacher, the Teaching, and the Sangha, and he doesn’t fulfill the training. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.18	Such a person 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.20	creates disputes in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.21	Disputes are unbeneficial and a cause of unhappiness for the general population; they are harmful, detrimental, and a cause of suffering for gods and humans. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.22	Monks, when you see such a root of disputes either in yourself or in others, you should make an effort to get rid of it. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.23	If you don’t see such a root either in yourself or in others, you should practice so that it doesn’t reappear in the future. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.24	In this way that bad root of disputes is abandoned. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.3.25	In this way that bad root of disputes has no future effect. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.4.1	What are the three unwholesome roots of legal issues arising from disputes? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.4.2	It may be that monks dispute with a mind of greed, with a mind of ill will, with a mind of delusion, saying, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.4.3	‘This is the Teaching’, ‘This is contrary to the Teaching’, ‘This is the Monastic Law’, ‘This is contrary to the Monastic Law’, ‘This was spoken by the Buddha’, ‘This was not spoken by the Buddha’, ‘This was practiced by the Buddha’, ‘This was not practiced by the Buddha’, ‘This was laid down by the Buddha’, ‘This was not laid down by the Buddha’, ‘This is an offense’, ‘This is not an offense’, ‘This is a light offense’, ‘This is a heavy offense’, ‘This is a curable offense’, ‘This is an incurable offense’, ‘This is a grave offense’, or ‘This is a minor offense.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.4.5	What are the three wholesome roots of legal issues arising from disputes? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.4.6	It may be that monks dispute with a mind free from greed, free from ill will, free from delusion, saying, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.4.7	‘This is the Teaching’, ‘This is contrary to the Teaching’ … 
pli-tv-kd14:14.4.8	‘This is a grave offense’, or ‘This is a minor offense.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.1	(2b) What is the root of legal issues arising from accusations? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.2	There are six roots of accusations that in turn are the root of legal issues arising from accusations. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.3	There are also three unwholesome and three wholesome roots of legal issues arising from accusations. The body, too, is a root of legal issues arising from accusations, and so is speech. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.4	What are the six roots of accusations that in turn are the root of legal issues arising from accusations? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.5	It may be that a monk is angry and resentful. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.6	One who is angry and resentful is disrespectful and undeferential toward the Teacher, the Teaching, and the Sangha, and he doesn’t fulfill the training. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.7	Such a person 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.9	creates accusations in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.10	Accusations are unbeneficial and a cause of unhappiness for the general population; they are harmful, detrimental, and a cause of suffering for gods and humans. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.11	Monks, when you see such a root of accusations either in yourself or in others, you should make an effort to get rid of it. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.12	If you don’t see such a root either in yourself or in others, you should practice so that it doesn’t reappear in the future. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.15	Or it may be that a monk is denigrating and controlling, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.16	envious and stingy, treacherous and deceitful, one who has bad desires and wrong views, or one who obstinately grasps his own views and only gives them up with difficulty. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.17	Any of these is disrespectful and undeferential toward the Teacher, the Teaching, and the Sangha, and he doesn’t fulfill the training. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.18	Such a person 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.20	creates accusations in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.21	Accusations are unbeneficial and a cause of unhappiness for the general population; they are harmful, detrimental, and a cause of suffering for gods and humans. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.22	Monks, when you see such a root of accusations either in yourself or in others, you should make an effort to get rid of it. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.23	If you don’t see such a root either in yourself or in others, you should practice so that it doesn’t reappear in the future. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.27	What are the three unwholesome roots of accusations? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.28	It may be that monks, because of greed, because of ill will, because of delusion, accuse others of 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.29	failure in morality, failure in conduct, failure in view, or failure in livelihood. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.31	What are the three wholesome roots of accusations? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.32	It may be that monks, because of non-greed, because of non-ill will, because of non-delusion, accuse others of 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.33	failure in morality, failure in conduct, failure in view, or failure in livelihood. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.35	How is the body a root of legal issues arising from accusations? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.36	It may be that someone is ugly, unsightly, a dwarf, sickly, blind in one eye, crooked-limbed, lame, or paralyzed, and they blame him for that. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.38	How is speech a root of legal issues arising from accusations? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.5.39	It may be that someone is difficult to correct, or he stutters or dribbles while speaking, and they blame him for that. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.6.1	(2c) What is the root of legal issues arising from offenses? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.6.2	There are six origins of offenses that in turn are the root of legal issues arising from offenses. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.6.3	There are offenses that originate from the body, but not from speech or the mind. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.6.4	There are offenses that originate from speech, but not from the body or the mind. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.6.5	There are offenses that originate from the body and speech, but not from the mind. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.6.6	There are offenses that originate from the body and the mind, but not from speech. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.6.7	There are offenses that originate from speech and the mind, but not from the body. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.6.8	There are offenses that originate from the body, speech, and the mind. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.7.1	(2d) What is the root of legal issues arising from business? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.7.2	There is one root of legal issues arising from business: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.7.3	the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.8.1	(3a) Is a legal issue arising from a dispute wholesome, unwholesome, or indeterminate? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.8.2	A legal issue arising from a dispute may be wholesome, unwholesome, or indeterminate. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.8.3	What is a wholesome legal issue arising from a dispute? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.8.4	It may be that monks dispute with a wholesome mind, saying, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.8.5	‘This is the Teaching’, ‘This is contrary to the Teaching’ … 
pli-tv-kd14:14.8.6	‘This is a grave offense’, or ‘This is a minor offense.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.8.7	In regard to this, whatever quarreling, arguing, conflict, disputing, variety in opinion, difference in opinion, heated speech, or strife there is—

pli-tv-kd14:14.16.5	It can. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.16.6	How is that?

pli-tv-kd14:14.16.13	Face-to-face with the Sangha, face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.16.14	This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.16.15	the monks who should be present have arrived, consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and no one present objects to the decision. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.16.17	This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.16.18	the Teaching, the Monastic Law, the Teacher’s instruction—that by which that legal issue is resolved.

pli-tv-kd14:14.16.23	When a legal issue has been resolved like this, if any of the participants reopen it, they incur an offense entailing confession for the reopening.

pli-tv-kd14:14.17.4	It has been resolved face-to-face.

pli-tv-kd14:14.17.17	If anyone who gave their consent criticizes the resolution, they incur an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.1	If those monks are unable to resolve that legal issue while on their way, they should go to that other monastery and say to the resident monks, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.2	‘A legal issue has arisen in such-and-such a way. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.3	It would be good if you would resolve it according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction, so that this legal issue may be properly resolved.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.4	If the resident monks are senior to the visiting monks, the resident monks should say, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.5	‘Now, Venerables, please go to one side for a moment while we discuss this matter.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.6	If the visiting monks are senior to the resident monks, the resident monks should say, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.7	‘Well then, Venerables, please wait right here for a moment while we discuss this matter.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.8	If, while discussing that matter, the resident monks think, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.9	‘We’re unable to resolve this legal issue according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction,’ then they should not take on that legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.10	But if they think, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.11	‘We’re able to resolve this legal issue according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction,’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.12	then they should say to the visiting monks, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.13	‘If you will tell us how this legal issue arose, we’ll be able to resolve it properly according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.14	In this way we’ll take it on. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.15	If, however, you won’t tell us how this legal issue arose, we won’t be able to resolve it properly according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction. We won’t take it on.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.16	Dealing properly with the case in this way, the resident monks should take on that legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.17	The visiting monks should say this to the resident monks, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.18	‘We’ll tell you how this legal issue arose. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.19	If you’re able to resolve this legal issue properly by such and such a deadline—according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction—
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.20	then we’ll hand this legal issue over to you. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.21	If you’re unable to resolve this legal issue properly by such and such a deadline—according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction—then we won’t hand this legal issue over to you. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.22	We’ll take responsibility for this legal issue ourselves.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.23	Dealing properly with the case in this way, the visiting monks should hand that legal issue over to the resident monks. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.24	If those monks are able to resolve that legal issue, this is called the resolution of a legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.26	It has been resolved face-to-face. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.18.27	Face-to-face with what?

pli-tv-kd14:14.18.30	If anyone who gave their consent criticizes the resolution, they incur an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.19.0	9.2 Resolution by committee 
pli-tv-kd14:14.19.1	“If, while they are deliberating, there is endless talk, but not a single statement that is clear, then they should resolve that legal issue by means of a committee. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.19.2	A monk who has ten qualities may be appointed to that committee: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.19.3	One who is virtuous and restrained by the Monastic Code. His conduct is good, he associates with the right people, and he sees danger in minor faults. He undertakes and trains in the training rules. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.19.4	One who has learned much, and who retains and accumulates what he’s learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, that have a true goal and are well articulated, and that set out the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life—he’s learned many such teachings, retained them in mind, recited them verbally, mentally investigated them, and penetrated them well by view. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.19.5	One who has properly learned both Monastic Codes in detail; who has analyzed them well, thoroughly mastered them, and investigated them well, both in terms of the rules and their detailed exposition. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.19.6	One who is firmly committed to the Monastic Law. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.19.7	One who is capable of making both sides relax, of persuading them, of convincing them, of making them see, of reconciling them. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.19.8	One who is knowledgeable about the arising and resolution of legal issues. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.19.9	One who understands legal issues. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.19.10	One who understands the arising of legal issues. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.19.11	One who understands the ending of legal issues. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.19.12	One who understands the way to the ending of legal issues. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.20.1	And he should be appointed like this. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.20.2	First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.20.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.20.4	While we were deliberating, there was endless talk, but not a single statement that was clear. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.20.5	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to a committee to resolve this legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.20.6	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.20.7	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.20.8	While we were deliberating, there was endless talk, but not a single statement that was clear. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.20.9	The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to a committee to resolve this legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.20.10	Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to a committee should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.20.11	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.20.12	The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to a committee to resolve this legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.20.13	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.21.1	If those monks are able to resolve that legal issue by committee, this is called the resolution of a legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.21.3	It has been resolved face-to-face. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.21.4	Face-to-face with what? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.21.5	Face-to-face with the Sangha, face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Sangha: the monks who should be present have arrived, consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and no one present objects to the decision. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law: the Teaching, the Monastic Law, the Teacher’s instruction—that by which that legal issue is resolved. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the persons concerned: both sides—those who are disputing and those they are disputing with—are present. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.21.6	When a legal issue has been resolved like this, if any of the participants reopen it, they incur an offense entailing confession for the reopening. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.22.1	While those monks are deliberating on that legal issue, there may be a monk there who is an expounder of the Teaching. He doesn’t know the Monastic Code or its analysis. Not understanding the meaning, he blocks it out by covering it over with the wording. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:

pli-tv-kd14:14.22.3	The monk so-and-so is an expounder of the Teaching. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.22.4	He doesn’t know the Monastic Code or its analysis. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.22.5	Not understanding the meaning, he blocks it out by covering it over with the wording. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.22.6	If it seems appropriate to the venerables, we should ask monk so-and-so to leave, and the remainder of us should resolve this legal issue.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.22.7	If, after that monk has left, those monks are able to resolve that legal issue, this is called the resolution of a legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.22.9	It has been resolved face-to-face. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.22.10	Face-to-face with what?

pli-tv-kd14:14.23.1	While those monks are deliberating on that legal issue, there may be a monk there who is an expounder of the Teaching. He knows the Monastic Code, but not its analysis. Not understanding the meaning, he obstructs it by prioritizing the wording. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.23.2	‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.23.3	The monk so-and-so is an expounder of the Teaching.

pli-tv-kd14:14.24.0	9.3 Resolution by majority decision 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.1	“If those monks are unable to resolve that legal issue by committee, they should hand it over to the Sangha, saying, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.2	‘Venerables, we’re unable to resolve this legal issue by committee. May the Sangha resolve this legal issue.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.3	I allow such a legal issue to be resolved by majority decision. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.4	A monk who has five qualities should be appointed as the manager of the vote: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.5	one who isn’t swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and who knows who has and has not voted. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.6	And he should be appointed like this. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.7	First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.8	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.9	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint monk so-and-so as the manager of the vote. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.10	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.11	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.12	The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as the manager of the vote 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.13	Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as the manager of the vote should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.14	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.15	The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as the manager of the vote. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.16	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.17	That monk should then distribute the voting tickets. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.18	If the majority of monks vote in accordance with the Teaching, then that legal issue has been resolved. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.19	This is called the resolution of a legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.21	It has been resolved face-to-face and by majority decision. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.22	Face-to-face with what? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.23	Face-to-face with the Sangha, face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.24	This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.25	the monks who should be present have arrived, consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and no one present objects to the decision. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.27	This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.28	the Teaching, the Monastic Law, the Teacher’s instruction—that by which that legal issue is resolved. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.30	This is the meaning of face-to-face with the persons concerned: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.31	both sides—those who are disputing and those they are disputing with—are present. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.33	This is the meaning of majority decision: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.34	the doing of, the performing of, the participation in, the consent to, the agreement to, the non-objection to that legal procedure of majority decision. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.36	When a legal issue has been resolved like this, if any of the participants reopen it, they incur an offense entailing confession for the reopening. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.24.37	If anyone who gave their consent criticizes the resolution, they incur an offense entailing confession.” 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.0	9.4 The three kinds of voting 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.1	At one time at Sāvatthī a legal issue had arisen in this way. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.2	But those monks 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.3	were dissatisfied with how the Sangha at Sāvatthī had resolved that legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.4	They heard that in a certain monastery there was a number of senior monks who were learned and masters of the tradition; who were experts on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; who were knowledgeable and competent, had a sense of conscience, and were afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.5	They thought, “If these senior monks resolve this legal issue—according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction—then it will be properly resolved.” 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.6	They then went to that monastery and said to those senior monks, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.7	“This legal issue has arisen in this way. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.8	It would be good, Venerables, if you would resolve it—according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction—so that it will be properly resolved.” 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.9	Those senior monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.10	“This legal issue was properly resolved by the Sangha at Sāvatthī,” 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.11	and they resolved it in the same way. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.12	Those monks 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.13	were dissatisfied with how the Sangha at Sāvatthī had resolved that legal issue and also with how that number of senior monks had resolved it. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.14	But they heard that in a certain monastery there were three senior monks … 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.15	two senior monks … 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.16	one senior monk who was learned and a master of the tradition; who was an expert on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; who was knowledgeable and competent, had a sense of conscience, and was afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.17	They thought, “If this senior monk resolves this legal issue—according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction—then it will be properly resolved.” 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.18	They then went to that monastery and said to that senior monk, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.19	“This legal issue has arisen in this way. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.20	It would be good, Venerable, if you would resolve it—according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction—so that it will be properly resolved.” 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.21	That senior monk thought, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.22	“This legal issue was properly resolved by the Sangha at Sāvatthī, and likewise by that number of senior monks, by those three senior monks, and by those two senior monks,” 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.23	and he resolved it in the same way. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.24	Since those monks were dissatisfied with how all of these had resolved that legal issue, they went to the Buddha and told him what had happened. … 
pli-tv-kd14:14.25.25	The Buddha said, “Monks, this legal issue has been settled, laid to rest, and properly resolved. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.1	To persuade those monks, I allow three kinds of voting: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.2	a secret one, one by whispering in the ear, and an open vote. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.3	What is a secret vote? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.4	The manager of the vote should make voting tickets of two different colors, go up to the monks one by one and say, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.5	‘This is the voting ticket for those who hold this view, and this is the voting ticket for those who hold that view. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.6	Take the one you like.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.7	When someone has taken a voting ticket, he should be told, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.8	‘Don’t show it to anyone.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.9	If the manager knows that 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.10	those who speak contrary to the Teaching are in the majority, then that vote is invalid and to be postponed. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.11	If he knows that 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.12	those who speak in accordance with the Teaching are in the majority, then that vote is valid and is to be announced. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.14	What is a vote by whispering in the ear? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.15	The manager of the vote should inform the monks one by one by whispering in the ear, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.16	‘This is the voting ticket for those who hold this view, and this is the voting ticket for those who hold that view. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.17	Take the one you like.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.18	When someone has taken a voting ticket, he should be told, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.19	‘Don’t tell anyone.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.20	If the manager knows that 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.21	those who speak contrary to the Teaching are in the majority, then that vote is invalid and to be postponed. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.22	If he knows that 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.23	those who speak in accordance with the Teaching are in the majority, then that vote is valid and is to be announced. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.25	What is an open vote? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.26	If he knows that 
pli-tv-kd14:14.26.27	those who speak in accordance with the Teaching are in the majority, the voting tickets should be distributed openly.” 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.0	9.5 Resolution through recollection 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.2	“There are four principles for settling a legal issue arising from an accusation: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.3	resolution face-to-face, resolution through recollection, resolution because of past insanity, and by further penalty. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.4	Can it be that a legal issue arising from an accusation should be settled 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.5	not by resolution because of past insanity or by further penalty, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.6	but 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.7	by resolution face-to-face and by resolution through recollection? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.8	It can. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.9	How is that? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.10	It may be that monks are groundlessly charging a monk with failure in morality. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.11	If that monk has great clarity of memory, he is to be granted resolution through recollection. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.12	And it should be granted like this: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.13	That monk should approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.14	and say: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.15	‘Venerables, monks are groundlessly charging me with failure in morality. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.16	Because of my great clarity of memory, I ask the Sangha for resolution through recollection.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.17	And he should ask a second 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.18	and a third time. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.19	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.20	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.21	Monks are groundlessly charging monk so-and-so with failure in morality. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.22	Because of his great clarity of memory, he is asking the Sangha for resolution through recollection. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.23	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should grant him resolution through recollection.

pli-tv-kd14:14.27.25	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.26	Monks are groundlessly charging monk so-and-so with failure in morality. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.27	Because of his great clarity of memory, he is asking the Sangha for resolution through recollection. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.28	The Sangha grants him resolution through recollection. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.29	Any monk who approves of granting him resolution through recollection should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.30	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.31	For the second time I speak on this matter. … 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.32	For the third time I speak on this matter. … 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.33	Because of his great clarity of memory, the Sangha has granted monk so-and-so resolution through recollection. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.34	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.35	This is called the resolution of a legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.37	It has been resolved by resolution face-to-face and by resolution through recollection. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.38	Face-to-face with what? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.39	Face-to-face with the Sangha, face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Sangha: the monks who should be present have arrived, consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and no one present objects to the decision. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law: the Teaching, the Monastic Law, the Teacher’s instruction—that by which that legal issue is resolved. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.40	This is the meaning of face-to-face with the persons concerned: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.41	both those who are accusing and those who have been accused are present. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.43	This is the meaning of resolution through recollection: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.44	the doing of, the performing of, the participation in, the consent to, the agreement to, the non-objection to that legal procedure of resolution through recollection. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.46	When a legal issue has been resolved like this, if any of the participants reopen it, they incur an offense entailing confession for the reopening. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.27.47	If anyone who gave their consent criticizes the resolution, they incur an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.0	9.6 Resolution because of past insanity 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.1	“Can it be that a legal issue arising from an accusation should be settled 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.2	not by resolution through recollection or by further penalty, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.3	but 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.4	by resolution face-to-face and by resolution because of past insanity? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.5	It can. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.6	How is that? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.7	It may be that a monk is insane and suffering from psychosis. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.8	Because of that, he does and says many things unworthy of a monastic. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.9	Monks accuse him of an offense, saying, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.10	‘Venerable, do you remember committing such-and-such an offense?’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.11	He replies, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.12	‘I was insane and suffering from psychosis. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.13	Because of that, I did and said many things unworthy of a monastic. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.14	I don’t remember it; 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.15	I did it because I was insane.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.16	But they still accused him 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.17	in the same way. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.18	If he is no longer insane, that monk should be granted resolution because of past insanity. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.19	And it should be granted like this: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.20	That monk should approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.21	and say:

pli-tv-kd14:14.28.25	“Venerable, do you remember committing such-and-such an offense?” 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.26	I replied,

pli-tv-kd14:14.28.72	This is called the resolution of a legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.74	It has been resolved by resolution face-to-face and by resolution because of past insanity. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.75	Face-to-face with what? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.76	Face-to-face with the Sangha, face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Sangha: the monks who should be present have arrived, consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and no one present objects to the decision.

pli-tv-kd14:14.28.77	This is the meaning of resolution because of past insanity: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.78	the doing of, the performing of, the participation in, the consent to, the agreement to, the non-objection to that legal procedure of resolution because of past insanity. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.80	When a legal issue has been resolved like this, if any of the participants reopen it, they incur an offense entailing confession for the reopening. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.28.81	If anyone who gave their consent criticizes the resolution, they incur an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.0	9.7 Resolution by further penalty 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.1	“Can it be that a legal issue arising from an accusation should be settled 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.2	not by resolution through recollection or by resolution because of past insanity, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.3	but 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.4	by resolution face-to-face and by further penalty? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.5	It can. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.6	How is that? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.7	It may be that a monk accuses a monk of an offense in the midst of the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.8	‘Venerable, do you remember committing such-and-such a heavy offense entailing expulsion or bordering on expulsion?’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.9	He replies, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.10	‘I don’t.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.11	As he tries to free himself, the accusing monk presses him further: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.12	‘Come on, Venerable, think properly whether you remember committing such-and-such a heavy offense.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.13	He replies, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.14	‘I don’t remember committing a heavy offense. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.15	But I do remember committing such-and-such a minor offense.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.16	As he tries to free himself, the accusing monk presses him further: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.17	‘Come on, Venerable, think properly whether you remember committing such-and-such a heavy offense.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.18	He replies, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.19	‘I have admitted that I’ve committed this minor offense without being asked. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.20	So when asked about such-and-such a heavy offense, why would I not admit it?’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.21	The accusing monk says, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.22	‘But you didn’t admit that you had committed this minor offense without being asked. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.23	So when asked about such-and-such a heavy offense, why would you admit it? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.24	Come on, Venerable, think properly whether you remember committing such-and-such a heavy offense.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.25	He then says, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.26	‘I remember committing such-and-such a heavy offense entailing expulsion or bordering on expulsion. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.27	When I said that I didn’t remember, I spoke playfully, I spoke too fast.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.29	They should do a legal procedure of further penalty against that monk. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.30	And it should be done like this. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.31	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.32	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.33	The monk so-and-so, while being examined in the midst of the Sangha about a heavy offense, asserts things after denying them, denies things after asserting them, evades the issue, and lies. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.34	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do a legal procedure of further penalty against this monk. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.35	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.36	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.37	The monk so-and-so, while being examined in the midst of the Sangha about a heavy offense, asserts things after denying them, denies things after asserting them, evades the issue, and lies. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.38	The Sangha does a legal procedure of further penalty against this monk. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.39	Any monk who approves of doing a legal procedure of further penalty against this monk should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.40	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.41	For the second time I speak on this matter. … 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.42	For the third time I speak on this matter. … 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.43	The Sangha has done a legal procedure of further penalty against this monk. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.44	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.45	This is called the resolution of a legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.47	It has been resolved face-to-face and by further penalty. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.48	Face-to-face with what? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.49	Face-to-face with the Sangha, face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Sangha: the monks who should be present have arrived, consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and no one present objects to the decision. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law: the Teaching, the Monastic Law, the Teacher’s instruction—that by which that legal issue is resolved. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the persons concerned: both those who are accusing and those who have been accused are present. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.50	This is the meaning of further penalty: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.51	the doing of, the performing of, the participation in, the consent to, the agreement to, the non-objection to that legal procedure of further penalty. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.53	When a legal issue has been resolved like this, if any of the participants reopen it, they incur an offense entailing confession for the reopening. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.29.54	If anyone who gave their consent criticizes the resolution, they incur an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.0	9.8 Acting according to what has been admitted 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.2	“There are three principles for settling a legal issue arising from an offense: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.3	resolution face-to-face, acting according to what has been admitted, and covering over as if with grass. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.4	Can it be that a legal issue arising from an accusation should be settled 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.5	not by covering over as if with grass, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.6	but by resolution face-to-face and by acting according to what has been admitted? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.7	It can. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.8	How is that? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.9	It may be that a monk has committed a light offense. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.10	That monk should approach a single monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.11	‘I have committed such-and-such an offense. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.12	I confess it.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.13	—
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.14	‘Do you recognize the offense?’ —
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.15	‘Yes, I recognize it.’ —
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.16	‘You should restrain yourself in the future.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.17	This is called the resolution of a legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.19	It has been resolved face-to-face and by acting according to what has been admitted. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.20	Face-to-face with what? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.21	Face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law: the Teaching, the Monastic Law, the Teacher’s instruction—that by which that legal issue is resolved. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.22	This is the meaning of face-to-face with the persons concerned: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.23	both the one who confesses and the one he confesses to are present. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.25	This is the meaning of acting according to what has been admitted: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.26	the doing of, the performing of, the participation in, the consent to, the agreement to, the non-objection to that legal procedure of acting according to what has been admitted. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.30.28	When a legal issue has been resolved like this, if the receiver of the confession reopens it, he incurs an offense entailing confession for the reopening. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.1	If this is what happens, all is well. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.2	If not, that monk should approach several monks, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.3	‘Venerables, I have committed such-and-such an offense. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.4	I confess it.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.5	A competent and capable monk should then inform those monks: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.6	‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.7	The monk so-and-so remembers an offense—he reveals it, makes it plain, and confesses it. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.8	If it seems appropriate to the venerables, I will receive the confession.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.9	And he should say: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.10	‘Do you recognize the offense?’ —
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.11	‘Yes, I recognize it.’ —
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.12	‘You should restrain yourself in the future.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.13	This is called the resolution of a legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.15	It has been resolved face-to-face and by acting according to what has been admitted. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.16	Face-to-face with what? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.17	Face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law: the Teaching, the Monastic Law, the Teacher’s instruction—that by which that legal issue is resolved. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.18	This is the meaning of face-to-face with the persons concerned: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.19	both the one who confesses and the one he confesses to are present. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.21	This is the meaning of acting according to what has been admitted: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.22	the doing of, the performing of, the participation in, the consent to, the agreement to, the non-objection to that legal procedure of acting according to what has been admitted. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.31.24	When a legal issue has been resolved like this, if the receiver of the confession reopens it, he incurs an offense entailing confession for the reopening. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.32.1	If this is what happens, all is well. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.32.2	If not, that monk should approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.32.3	‘Venerables, I have committed such-and-such an offense. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.32.4	I confess it.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.32.5	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.32.6	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.32.7	The monk so-and-so remembers an offense—he reveals it, makes it plain, and confesses it. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.32.8	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will receive the confession.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.32.9	And he should say: 
pli-tv-kd14:14.32.10	‘Do you recognize the offense?’ —
pli-tv-kd14:14.32.11	‘Yes, I recognize it.’ —
pli-tv-kd14:14.32.12	‘You should restrain yourself in the future.’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.32.13	This is called the resolution of a legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.32.15	It has been resolved face-to-face and by acting according to what has been admitted. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.32.16	Face-to-face with what? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.32.17	Face-to-face with the Sangha, face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Sangha: the monks who should be present have arrived, consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and no one present objects to the decision. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law: the Teaching, the Monastic Law, the Teacher’s instruction—that by which that legal issue is resolved. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the persons concerned: both the one who confesses and the one he confesses to are present. This is the meaning of acting according to what has been admitted: the doing of, the performing of, the participation in, the consent to, the agreement to, the non-objection to that legal procedure of acting according to what has been admitted. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.32.18	When a legal issue has been resolved like this, if the receiver of the confession reopens it, he incurs an offense entailing confession for the reopening. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.32.19	If anyone who gave their consent criticizes the resolution, they incur an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.33.0	9.9 Covering over as if with grass 
pli-tv-kd14:14.33.1	“Can it be that a legal issue arising from an offense should be settled 
pli-tv-kd14:14.33.2	not by acting according to what has been admitted, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.33.3	but by resolution face-to-face and by covering over as if with grass? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.33.4	It can. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.33.5	How is that? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.33.6	It may be that monks who are arguing and disputing do and say many things unworthy of a monastic. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.33.7	If they consider this and think, 
pli-tv-kd14:14.33.9	‘If we deal with one another for these offenses, this legal issue might lead to harshness, nastiness, and schism,’ 
pli-tv-kd14:14.33.10	then I allow you to resolve this legal issue by covering over as if with grass. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.33.11	And it should be resolved like this. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.33.12	Everyone should gather in one place. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:

pli-tv-kd14:14.33.41.2	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. While we were arguing and disputing, we did and said many things unworthy of an ascetic. If we deal with each other for these offenses, this legal issue might lead to harshness, nastiness, and schism.

pli-tv-kd14:14.33.45	It has been resolved face-to-face and by covering over as if with grass. 
pli-tv-kd14:14.33.46	Face-to-face with what? 
pli-tv-kd14:14.33.47	Face-to-face with the Sangha, face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned.

pli-tv-kd15:1.0.2	Rules relating to bathing 
pli-tv-kd15:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. 
pli-tv-kd15:1.1.2	At that time the monks from the group of six rubbed their bodies—thighs, arms, chest, and back—against trees while bathing. 
pli-tv-kd15:1.1.3	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:1.1.4	“How can the Sakyan monastics act like this? They are just like boxers and city slickers who beautify their bodies.” 
pli-tv-kd15:1.1.5	The monks heard the complaints of those people 
pli-tv-kd15:1.1.6	and they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:1.1.7	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:1.1.8	“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are acting like this?” 
pli-tv-kd15:1.1.9	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd15:1.1.10	The Buddha criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:1.1.11	“It’s not suitable for those foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-kd15:1.1.12	How can they act like this? 
pli-tv-kd15:1.1.13	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” 
pli-tv-kd15:1.1.14	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd15:1.1.15	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:1.1.16	“You should not rub your body against a tree while bathing. 
pli-tv-kd15:1.1.17	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:1.2.1	At that time the monks from the group of six rubbed their bodies—thighs, arms, chest, and back—against posts while bathing. 
pli-tv-kd15:1.2.2	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:1.2.3	“How can the Sakyan monastics act like this? They are just like boxers and city slickers who beautify their bodies.” 
pli-tv-kd15:1.2.4	The monks heard the complaints of those people 
pli-tv-kd15:1.2.5	and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:1.2.6	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd15:1.2.7	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd15:1.2.8	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:1.2.9	“You should not rub your body against a post while bathing. 
pli-tv-kd15:1.2.10	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

pli-tv-kd15:1.3.3	They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:1.3.9	“You should not rub your body against a rubbing board while bathing. 
pli-tv-kd15:1.3.10	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:1.3.11	At that time the monks from the group of six bathed with a wooden rubbing-hand. 
pli-tv-kd15:1.3.12	People complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan monastics act like this?

pli-tv-kd15:1.3.14	The monks heard the complaints of those people 
pli-tv-kd15:1.3.15	and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

pli-tv-kd15:1.4.11	“You should not bathe with an ornamented scrubber. 
pli-tv-kd15:1.4.12	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:1.4.13	Soon afterwards a certain monk had an itchy skin disease. 
pli-tv-kd15:1.4.14	He was not comfortable without a scrubber. 
pli-tv-kd15:1.4.16	“I allow a plain scrubber for those who are sick.” 
pli-tv-kd15:1.5.1	At that time a monk who was weak from old age was unable to rub his own body while bathing. 
pli-tv-kd15:1.5.3	“I allow gloves of cloth.” 
pli-tv-kd15:1.5.4	Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not give back massages. 
pli-tv-kd15:1.5.6	“I allow an ordinary massage by hand.” 
pli-tv-kd15:2.1.0	Rules on personal beautification

pli-tv-kd15:2.1.11	The monks heard the complaints of those people. 
pli-tv-kd15:2.1.12	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd15:2.1.13	“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are wearing these things?” 
pli-tv-kd15:2.1.15	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd15:2.1.16	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd15:2.1.17	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:2.1.18	“You should not wear earrings,

pli-tv-kd15:2.2.5	“You should not grow your hair long. 
pli-tv-kd15:2.2.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:2.2.7	I allow you to grow it to a length of 3.5 centimeters or for two months at the most.”

pli-tv-kd15:2.4.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:2.4.7	Soon afterwards a certain monk had a sore on his face. 
pli-tv-kd15:2.4.8	He asked the monks, 
pli-tv-kd15:2.4.9	“What kind of sore is it?” 
pli-tv-kd15:2.4.10	They replied, 
pli-tv-kd15:2.4.11	“It’s such-and-such a kind of sore.” 
pli-tv-kd15:2.4.12	He did not trust them. 
pli-tv-kd15:2.4.14	“I allow you to look at your face in a mirror or in a bowl of water if you have a disease.” 
pli-tv-kd15:2.5.1	At that time the monks from the group of six used facial ointments, 
pli-tv-kd15:2.5.2	applied facial creams, powdered the face, applied rouge to the face, wore cosmetics on the body, wore cosmetics on the face, and wore cosmetics on the body and the face.

pli-tv-kd15:2.5.8	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:2.5.9	Soon afterwards a certain monk had an eye disease. 
pli-tv-kd15:2.5.11	“I allow facial ointments for those who are sick.” 
pli-tv-kd15:2.6.0	Rules on entertainment, etc. 
pli-tv-kd15:2.6.1	On one occasion in Rājagaha there was a hilltop fair, 
pli-tv-kd15:2.6.2	and the monks from the group of six went to see it. 
pli-tv-kd15:2.6.3	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:2.6.4	“How can the Sakyan monastics go to see dancing, singing, and the playing of music? They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:2.6.5	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:2.6.6	“You should not go to see dancing, singing, and the playing of music. 
pli-tv-kd15:2.6.7	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:3.1.1	At that time the monks from the group of six recited the Teaching by singing in a drawn-out fashion. 
pli-tv-kd15:3.1.2	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:3.1.3	“These Sakyan monastics sing just like we do.” 
pli-tv-kd15:3.1.4	The monks heard the complaints of those people, 
pli-tv-kd15:3.1.5	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:3.1.6	“How can the monks from the group of six sing like this?” 
pli-tv-kd15:3.1.7	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:3.1.8	“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are singing like this?” 
pli-tv-kd15:3.1.9	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd15:3.1.10	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:3.1.11	“There are these five dangers in reciting the Teaching by singing in a drawn-out fashion: 
pli-tv-kd15:3.1.12	one delights in the sound; others delight in the sound; householders criticize it; for one who takes pleasure in the melody, the concentration is disrupted; later generations follow one’s example. 
pli-tv-kd15:3.1.14	You should not recite the Teaching by singing in a drawn-out fashion. 
pli-tv-kd15:3.1.15	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:3.2.1	Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not chant. 
pli-tv-kd15:3.2.2	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:3.2.3	“I allow chanting.” 
pli-tv-kd15:4.1.1	At that time the monks from the group of six wore fleecy woolen robes with the fleece on the outside. 
pli-tv-kd15:4.1.2	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:4.1.3	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:4.1.5	“You should not wear a fleecy woolen robe with the fleece on the outside. 
pli-tv-kd15:4.1.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:5.1.0	Rules on fruit 
pli-tv-kd15:5.1.1	On one occasion when the mango trees in King Bimbisāra’s park were bearing fruit, 
pli-tv-kd15:5.1.2	the King allowed the monks 
pli-tv-kd15:5.1.3	to eat as many mangoes as they wished. 
pli-tv-kd15:5.1.4	The monks from the group of six plucked and ate them all, even the young ones. 
pli-tv-kd15:5.1.5	Just then the King needed mangoes. 
pli-tv-kd15:5.1.6	He told his people, 
pli-tv-kd15:5.1.7	“Go to the park and bring back mangoes.” 
pli-tv-kd15:5.1.8	Saying, “Yes, Sir,” they went to the park and said to the park keeper, 
pli-tv-kd15:5.1.9	“The King needs mangoes. Please get some.” 
pli-tv-kd15:5.1.10	“There aren’t any. 
pli-tv-kd15:5.1.11	The monks plucked and ate them all, including the young ones.” 
pli-tv-kd15:5.1.12	They reported to the King what had happened. He said, 
pli-tv-kd15:5.1.13	“It’s good that the venerables have eaten the mangoes. Still, the Buddha has praised moderation.” 
pli-tv-kd15:5.1.14	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:5.1.15	“How can the Sakyan monastics eat the King’s mangoes without moderation?” 
pli-tv-kd15:5.1.16	The monks heard the complaints of those people 
pli-tv-kd15:5.1.17	and they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:5.1.18	“You should not eat mangoes. 
pli-tv-kd15:5.1.19	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:5.2.1	Soon afterwards a certain association was offering a meal to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd15:5.2.2	They had prepared mango curry. 
pli-tv-kd15:5.2.3	Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not accept it. 
pli-tv-kd15:5.2.4	“Accept and eat. 
pli-tv-kd15:5.2.5	I allow pieces of mango.” 
pli-tv-kd15:5.2.6	Soon afterwards a certain association was offering a meal to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd15:5.2.7	They were unable to make mango pieces and so they gave whole mangoes in the dining hall. 
pli-tv-kd15:5.2.8	Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not accept them. 
pli-tv-kd15:5.2.9	“Accept and eat. 
pli-tv-kd15:5.2.10	I allow you to eat fruit that is allowable for monastics for any of five reasons: 
pli-tv-kd15:5.2.11	it has been damaged by fire, it has been damaged by a knife, it has been damaged by a nail, it’s seedless, the seeds have been removed.” 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.0	Protection 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.1	On one occasion a monk had been bitten by a snake and died. 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.3	“That monk had not radiated good will to the four royal snake clans. 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.4	Had he done so, he would not have died. 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.5	What are the four clans? 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.6	The Virūpakkhas, the Erāpathas, the Chabyāputtas, and the Kaṇhāgotamas. 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.9	To protect yourselves, monks, you should spread good will to these four royal snake clans. 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.10	And it should be done like this: 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.11	I have good will toward the Virūpakkhas, 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.12	Toward the Erāpathas I have good will; 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.13	I have good will toward the Chabyāputtas, 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.14	And toward the Kaṇhāgotamas. 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.15	I have good will toward the legless, 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.16	Toward the two-legged I have good will; 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.17	I have good will toward the four-legged, 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.18	And toward the many-legged. 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.19	May the legless not hurt me, 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.20	May the two-legged not hurt me. 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.21	May the four-legged not hurt me, 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.22	May the many-legged not hurt me. 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.23	All beings, all creatures, 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.24	All living beings everywhere, 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.25	May they all have good fortune, 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.26	May none meet with anything bad. 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.27	The Buddha is unlimited, 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.28	The Teaching is unlimited, 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.29	The Sangha is unlimited. 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.30	But creeping animals are limited: 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.31	Snakes, scorpions, centipedes, 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.32	Spiders, lizards, and mice. 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.33	I’m now protected and guarded; 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.34	May the creatures turn back. 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.35	I pay homage to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd15:6.1.36	And to the seven fully awakened Buddhas.” 
pli-tv-kd15:7.1.1	On one occasion a monk who was plagued by lust cut off his own penis. 
pli-tv-kd15:7.1.2	They told the Buddha. He said, 
pli-tv-kd15:7.1.3	“This fool has cut off one thing, when he should have cut off something else. 
pli-tv-kd15:7.1.4	You should not cut off your own penis. 
pli-tv-kd15:7.1.5	If you do, you commit a serious offense.” 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.0	Rules relating to bowls 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.1	On one occasion a wealthy merchant of Rājagaha had obtained a very valuable block of sandalwood. 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.2	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.3	“Let me have a bowl carved from this block of sandal. 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.4	I’ll use the chips myself, but give the bowl away as a gift.” 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.5	He then had a bowl carved, put it in a carrying net, hung it at the end of a succession of vertical bamboo poles, and announced, 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.6	“I will give this bowl to any perfected monastic or brahmin who brings it down by supernormal powers.” 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.7	Pūraṇa Kassapa went to that merchant and said, 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.8	“I’m perfected and have supernormal powers. Give me the bowl.” 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.9	“If you’re perfected and have supernormal powers, then bring it down and it’s yours.” 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.10	The same thing happened with Makkhali Gosāla, 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.11	Ajita Kesakambala, 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.12	Pakudha Kaccāyana, 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.13	Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta, 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.14	and Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta. 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.17	Soon afterwards, after robing up in the morning, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja took their bowls and robes and entered Rājagaha for alms. 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.18	Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja said to Mahāmoggallāna, 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.19	“Venerable, you are perfected and have supernormal powers. 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.20	If you go and bring down that bowl, 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.21	it’s yours.” 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.22	“Venerable, you too are perfected and have supernormal powers. 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.23	If you bring it down, 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.24	it’s yours.” 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.25	Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja then rose up in the air, took hold of that bowl, and circled around Rājagaha three times. 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.26	Just then that merchant together with his wives and children was standing in his own house with joined palms raised in homage, thinking, 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.27	“May Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja land right here at our house.” 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.28	And Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja did just that. 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.29	The merchant then took the bowl from his hands, filled it with expensive fresh foods, and gave it back to Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja, 
pli-tv-kd15:8.1.30	who then left for the monastery. 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.1	People heard 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.2	that Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja had taken down the merchant’s bowl, 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.3	and making a great uproar, they followed right behind him. 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.4	Hearing all the noise, 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.5	the Buddha asked Venerable Ānanda what it was, 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.7	and Ānanda explained to him all that had happened. 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.12	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja: 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.13	“Is it true, Bhāradvāja, that you brought down that merchant’s bowl?” 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.14	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.15	The Buddha rebuked him, 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.16	“It’s not suitable, Bhāradvāja, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.17	How can you show a superhuman ability, a wonder of supernormal power, to householders for the sake of a miserable wooden bowl? 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.18	It’s just like a woman showing her private parts for a miserable _māsaka_ coin. 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.20	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.21	after rebuking him … 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.22	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.23	“You should not show a superhuman ability, a wonder of supernormal power, to householders. 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.24	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.25	Now destroy that wooden bowl and make it into splinters. Give these to the monks to use as scent in ointments. 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.26	And you should not use a wooden bowl. 
pli-tv-kd15:8.2.27	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.1.1	At that time the monks from the group of six used luxurious bowls made with gold and silver. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.1.2	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:9.1.3	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.1.5	“You should not use an almsbowl made with gold, 
pli-tv-kd15:9.1.6	silver, 
pli-tv-kd15:9.1.7	gems, 
pli-tv-kd15:9.1.8	beryl, 
pli-tv-kd15:9.1.9	crystal, 
pli-tv-kd15:9.1.10	bronze, 
pli-tv-kd15:9.1.11	glass, 
pli-tv-kd15:9.1.12	tin, 
pli-tv-kd15:9.1.13	lead, 
pli-tv-kd15:9.1.14	or copper. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.1.15	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.1.16	I allow two kinds of almsbowls: 
pli-tv-kd15:9.1.17	an iron bowl and a ceramic bowl.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.2.1	At that time the bottoms of the bowls became scratched. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.2.3	“I allow a circular bowl stand.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.2.4	Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six used luxurious bowl stands made with gold and silver. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.2.5	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:9.2.6	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.2.8	“You should not use a luxurious bowl stand. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.2.9	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.2.10	I allow two kinds of bowl stands: 
pli-tv-kd15:9.2.11	a bowl stand made of tin and a bowl stand made of lead.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.2.12	There were thick bowl stands on which the bowls did not sit properly. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.2.14	“I allow you to carve them out.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.2.15	There were marks left from the carving. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.2.17	“I allow you to cut a shark-teeth pattern.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.2.18	Soon the monks from the group of six used bowl stands with colorful patterns, decorated like walls. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.2.19	As they were walking about, they showed them off in the streets. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.2.20	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:9.2.21	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.2.23	“You should not use a bowl stand with a colorful pattern, decorated like a wall. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.2.24	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.2.25	I allow an ordinary bowl stand.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.3.1	At this time the monks put away their bowls while still wet. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.3.2	The bowls were stained. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.3.4	“You should not put away your bowl while still wet. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.3.5	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.3.6	You should sun your bowl and then put it away.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.3.7	Soon afterwards the monks sunned their bowls while still wet. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.3.8	The bowls became smelly. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.3.10	“You should not sun your bowl while still wet. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.3.11	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.3.12	You should dry the bowl and then sun it before you put it away.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.3.13	Monks left their bowls in the heat of the sun. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.3.14	The bowls became discolored. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.3.16	“You should not leave your bowl in the heat of the sun. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.3.17	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.3.18	You should sun it in the heat for a short time and then put it away.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.1	On one occasion a number of almsbowls had been put down outside without support. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.2	A whirlwind rolled the bowls around and as a result they broke. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.4	“I allow a bowl rest.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.5	On one occasion the monks had put their bowls on the edge of a bench. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.6	They fell down and broke. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.8	“You should not put your almsbowl on the edge of a bench. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.9	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.10	On one occasion the monks had put their bowls on the edge of a shelf. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.11	They fell down and broke. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.13	“You should not put your almsbowl on the edge of a shelf. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.14	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.15	At that time the monks put their bowls upside down on the ground. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.16	The edge of the bowls were scratched. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.18	“I allow a straw mat.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.19	The straw mat was eaten by termites. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.21	“I allow a cloth.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.22	The cloth was eaten by termites. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.24	“I allow a pedestal for almsbowls.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.25	The bowls fell off the pedestals and broke. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.27	“I allow a storage container for almsbowls.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.28	The bowls were scratched in the storage containers. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.30	“I allow a bowl bag.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.31	There were no shoulder straps. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.4.33	“I allow a shoulder strap and a string for fastening.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.1	At that time the monks hung their bowls from wall pegs. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.2	The bowls fell down and broke. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.4	“You should not hang up your almsbowl. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.5	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.6	At that time the monks put their bowls on their beds. Sitting down absentmindedly, they crushed the bowls, breaking them. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.8	“You should not keep your almsbowl on a bed. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.9	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.10	At that time the monks put their bowls on their benches. Sitting down absentmindedly, they crushed the bowls, breaking them. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.12	“You should not keep your bowl on a bench. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.13	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.14	At that time the monks put their bowls in their laps. When they got up absentmindedly, 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.15	the bowls fell down and broke. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.17	“You should not put your bowl in your lap. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.18	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.19	At one time the monks put their bowls on a sunshade. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.20	A whirlwind lifted up the sunshade, and the bowls fell down and broke. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.22	“You should not put your bowl on a sunshade. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.23	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.24	At that time the monks opened doors with a bowl in their hand. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.25	The doors swung back and the bowls broke. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.27	“You should not open a door with an almsbowl in your hand. 
pli-tv-kd15:9.5.28	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:10.1.1	At that time the monks went on almsround using gourds as bowls. 
pli-tv-kd15:10.1.2	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:10.1.3	“They are just like the monastics of other religions.” 
pli-tv-kd15:10.1.5	“You should not go on almsround using a gourd as a bowl. 
pli-tv-kd15:10.1.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:10.1.7	At that time the monks went on almsround using waterpots as bowls. 
pli-tv-kd15:10.1.8	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:10.1.9	“They are just like the monastics of other religions.” 
pli-tv-kd15:10.1.11	“You should not go on almsround using a water-pot as a bowl. 
pli-tv-kd15:10.1.12	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:10.2.1	At that time a certain monk who only used discarded things 
pli-tv-kd15:10.2.2	used a skull as a bowl. 
pli-tv-kd15:10.2.3	A woman who saw this was terrified, screaming, 
pli-tv-kd15:10.2.4	“Oh my God, a demon!” 
pli-tv-kd15:10.2.5	People complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd15:10.2.6	“How can the Sakyan monastics use skulls as bowls? They are just like goblins.” 
pli-tv-kd15:10.2.8	“You should not use a skull as a bowl. 
pli-tv-kd15:10.2.9	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:10.2.10	And you should not use only discarded things. 
pli-tv-kd15:10.2.11	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:10.3.1	At that time the monks carried away chewed food remnants, bones, and dirty mouth-rinsing water in their bowls. 
pli-tv-kd15:10.3.2	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:10.3.3	“These Sakyan monastics eat from the same thing that they use as a trash can.” 
pli-tv-kd15:10.3.5	“You should not carry away chewed food remnants, bones, and dirty mouth-rinsing water in your almsbowl. 
pli-tv-kd15:10.3.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:10.3.7	I allow trash cans.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.1.0	Rules relating to robe making 
pli-tv-kd15:11.1.1	At that time the monks tore the cloth to pieces by hand and then sewed robes. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.1.2	The robes were ugly. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.1.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd15:11.1.4	“I allow a knife and a felt sheath.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.1.5	Soon afterwards the Sangha was given a knife with a handle. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.1.7	“I allow a knife with a handle.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.1.8	At this time the monks from the group of six used luxurious knife handles made with gold and silver. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.1.9	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:11.1.10	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.1.12	“You should not use a luxurious knife handle. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.1.13	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.1.14	I allow a knife handle made of bone, ivory, horn, reed, bamboo, wood, resin, fruit, metal, and shell.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.2.1	At that time the monks used chicken feathers and pieces of bamboo to sew robes. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.2.2	The robes were badly sewn. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.2.4	“I allow needles.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.2.5	The needles rusted. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.2.6	“I allow a cylinder for the needles.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.2.7	The needles still rusted. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.2.8	“I allow you to fill them with powdered yeast.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.2.9	The needles still rusted. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.2.10	“I allow you to fill them with flour.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.2.11	The needles still rusted. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.2.12	“I allow stone powder.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.2.13	The needles still rusted. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.2.14	“I allow you to mix it with beeswax.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.2.15	The stone powder broke apart. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.2.16	“I allow a case.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.3.1	At that time the monks erected posts here and there, bound them together, and sewed robes. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.3.2	The corners of the robes were deformed. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.3.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd15:11.3.4	“I allow a frame and a string. You should tie down the cloth to the frame as required, before sewing the robe.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.3.5	They put up the frame on uneven ground. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.3.6	The frame broke. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.3.7	“You should not put up the frame on uneven ground. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.3.8	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.3.9	They placed the frame on the ground. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.3.10	The frame became dirty. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.3.11	“I allow a straw mat.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.3.12	The edges of the frame decayed. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.3.13	“I allow you to add an edge lengthwise and crosswise.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.3.14	The frame was not the right size. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.3.15	“I allow an inner frame, folding the straw mat to fit the frame, spacers, strings for tying together, and strings for tying down. After tying it together, you should sew the robe.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.3.16	The seams were unevenly spaced. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.3.17	“I allow a ruler.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.3.18	The seams were not straight. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.3.19	“I allow you to make a guide line.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.4.1	The monks stepped on the frame with dirty feet. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.4.2	The frame became dirty. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.4.4	“You should not step on the frame with dirty feet. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.4.5	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.4.6	The monks stepped on the frame with wet feet. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.4.7	The frame became dirty. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.4.9	“You should not step on the frame with wet feet. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.4.10	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.4.11	The monks stepped on the frame while wearing sandals. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.4.12	The frame became dirty. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.4.14	“You should not step on the frame while wearing sandals. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.4.15	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.5.1	When sewing robes, the monks received the needles with their fingers. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.5.2	They hurt their fingers. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.5.4	“I allow a thimble.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.5.5	Soon the monks from the group of six used luxurious thimbles made of gold and silver. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.5.6	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:11.5.7	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.5.9	“You should not use a luxurious thimble. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.5.10	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.5.11	I allow a thimble made of bone, ivory, horn, reed, bamboo, wood, resin, fruit, metal, 
pli-tv-kd15:11.5.12	and shell.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.5.13	Needles, knives, and thimbles got lost. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.5.15	“I allow a small bowl.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.5.16	The small bowls became too full. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.5.18	“I allow a bag for the thimbles.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.5.19	There was no shoulder strap. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.5.21	“I allow a shoulder strap and a string for fastening.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.6.1	When sewing robes outside, the monks were afflicted by cold and heat. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.6.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd15:11.6.3	“I allow a sewing-shed and a roof-cover under which to sew.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.6.4	They built the sewing-shed on a low base. It was flooded. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.6.6	“I allow you to make a high base.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.6.7	The mound collapsed. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.6.8	“I allow you to construct three kinds of raised foundations: 
pli-tv-kd15:11.6.9	a raised foundation of brick, a raised foundation of stone, and a raised foundation of wood.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.6.10	It was difficult to get up to the sewing-shed. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.6.11	“I allow three kinds of stairs: 
pli-tv-kd15:11.6.12	stairs of brick, stairs of stone, and stairs of wood.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.6.13	People fell down while climbing the stairs. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.6.14	“I allow rails.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.6.15	Grass and dust fell into the sewing-shed. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.6.16	“I allow you to firm up the structure and then plaster it inside and outside, including: 
pli-tv-kd15:11.6.17	treating with white color, black color, and red ocher; making a garland pattern, a creeper pattern, a shark-teeth pattern, and the fivefold pattern; putting up a bamboo robe-rack and a clothesline.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.7.1	At that time, when the monks had finished sewing a robe, they abandoned the frame right there and left. Rats and termites ate it. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.7.3	“You should fold up the frame.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.7.4	The frame broke. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.7.5	“You should fold it up with a rod for support.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.7.6	The frame unfolded. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.7.7	“You should tie it up with a rope.” 
pli-tv-kd15:11.7.8	At that time the monks leaned the frame against a wall or a pillar and left. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.7.9	It fell down and broke. 
pli-tv-kd15:11.7.11	“You should hang it from a wall peg.” 
pli-tv-kd15:12.1.0	Rules on allowable requisites 
pli-tv-kd15:12.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Vesālī. 
pli-tv-kd15:12.1.2	And the monks went, too, after putting their needles, knives, and medicines in their almsbowls. 
pli-tv-kd15:12.1.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd15:12.1.4	“I allow a medicine bag.” 
pli-tv-kd15:12.1.5	There was no shoulder strap. 
pli-tv-kd15:12.1.6	“I allow a shoulder strap and a string for fastening it.” 
pli-tv-kd15:12.1.7	At this time a certain monk bound his sandals to his belt and entered a village for alms. 
pli-tv-kd15:12.1.8	A lay follower who bowed to that monk hit his head against those sandals. 
pli-tv-kd15:12.1.9	The monk was embarrassed. 
pli-tv-kd15:12.1.10	When he had returned to the monastery, he told the monks what had happened, 
pli-tv-kd15:12.1.11	and they in turn told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:12.1.12	“I allow a bag for sandals.” 
pli-tv-kd15:12.1.13	There was no shoulder strap. 
pli-tv-kd15:12.1.14	“I allow a shoulder strap and a string for fastening it.” 
pli-tv-kd15:13.1.1	While they were traveling, the water was unallowable to use, 
pli-tv-kd15:13.1.2	but there was no water filter. 
pli-tv-kd15:13.1.4	“I allow a water filter.” 
pli-tv-kd15:13.1.5	There was no suitable cloth. 
pli-tv-kd15:13.1.6	“I allow a filter with a handle.” 
pli-tv-kd15:13.1.7	There was still no suitable cloth. 
pli-tv-kd15:13.1.8	“I allow a water strainer.” 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.1	At this time two monks were traveling through the Kosalan country. 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.2	One monk misbehaved, 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.3	and the second monk said to him, 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.4	“Don’t do that; 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.5	it’s not allowable.” 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.6	Because of that the first monk became resentful. 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.7	Soon afterwards the second monk was very thirsty. He asked the resentful monk 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.8	to borrow his water filter. 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.9	He refused, 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.10	and the second monk died from thirst. 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.11	When the resentful monk arrived at the monastery, he told the monks what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.12	“So you refused to lend your water filter when asked?” 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.13	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.14	The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.15	“How can a monk act like this?” 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.16	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.17	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the monks gathered and questioned that monk: 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.18	“Is it true, monk, that you acted like this?” 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.19	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.20	The Buddha rebuked him, 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.21	“It’s not suitable, foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.22	How can you refuse to lend your water filter when asked? 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.23	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.24	after rebuking him … 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.25	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.26	“If you’re traveling with a monk and he asks to borrow your water filter, you should lend it. 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.27	If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.28	But you should not travel without a water filter. 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.29	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.30	If there is no water filter or strainer, you should determine a corner of your robe: 
pli-tv-kd15:13.2.31	‘I’ll drink after filtering with this.’” 
pli-tv-kd15:13.3.1	The Buddha eventually arrived at Vesālī, 
pli-tv-kd15:13.3.2	where he stayed in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. 
pli-tv-kd15:13.3.3	At this time the monks were doing building work, 
pli-tv-kd15:13.3.4	but there were not enough water filters. 
pli-tv-kd15:13.3.5	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd15:13.3.6	“I allow a water filter of cloth fitted to a wooden framework.” 
pli-tv-kd15:13.3.7	There were still not enough filters. 
pli-tv-kd15:13.3.9	“I allow you to filter by spreading cloth on water.” 
pli-tv-kd15:13.3.10	At this time the monks were troubled by mosquitoes. 
pli-tv-kd15:13.3.12	“I allow a mosquito tent” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.1.0.1	Rules on buildings 
pli-tv-kd15:14.1.0.2	Walking-paths 
pli-tv-kd15:14.1.1	At this time in Vesālī people had arranged a succession of fine meals. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.1.2	After eating the fine food, the monks’ bodies were full of impurities and they were often sick. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.1.3	Just then Jīvaka Komārabhacca went to Vesālī on some business 
pli-tv-kd15:14.1.4	and he saw those monks. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.1.5	He then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd15:14.1.6	and said, 
pli-tv-kd15:14.1.7	“At present, Sir, there are monks who are often sick and whose bodies are full of impurities. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.1.8	It would be good if you would allow walking-paths and saunas. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.1.9	In this way the monks will rarely get sick.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.1.10	The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, 
pli-tv-kd15:14.1.11	after which he got up from his seat, bowed, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.1.12	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:14.1.13	“I allow a walking-path and a sauna.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.1	The monks walked on an uneven walking-path, 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.2	and as a result their feet hurt. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.4	“I allow you to even it out.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.5	They built the walking-path on a low base. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.6	It was flooded. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.7	“I allow you to make a high base.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.8	The mound collapsed. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.9	“I allow you to construct three kinds of raised foundations: 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.10	a raised foundation of brick, a raised foundation of stone, and a raised foundation of wood.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.11	It was difficult to get up on the walking-path. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.12	“I allow three kinds of stairs: 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.13	stairs of brick, stairs of stone, and stairs of wood.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.14	People fell down while climbing the stairs. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.15	“I allow rails.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.16	Walking up and down on the walking-path, the monks fell off. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.18	“I allow railings.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.19	Walking up and down outside, the monks were afflicted with cold and heat. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.20	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.21	“I allow an indoor walking-path.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.22	Grass and dust fell into the indoor walking-paths. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.23	“I allow you to firm up the structure and then to plaster it inside and outside, including: 
pli-tv-kd15:14.2.24	treating with white color, black color, and red ocher; making a garland pattern, a creeper pattern, a shark-teeth pattern, and the fivefold pattern; putting up a bamboo robe-rack and a clothesline.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.0	Saunas 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.1	They built the sauna on a low base. It was flooded. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.2	“I allow you to make a high base.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.3	The mound collapsed. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.4	“I allow you to construct three kinds of raised foundations: 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.5	a raised foundation of brick, a raised foundation of stone, and a raised foundation of wood.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.6	It was difficult to get up to the sauna. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.7	“I allow three kinds of stairs: 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.8	stairs of brick, stairs of stone, and stairs of wood.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.9	People fell down while climbing the stairs. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.10	“I allow rails.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.11	The sauna had no door. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.12	“I allow a door, a door frame, a lower hinge, an upper hinge, a bolt-receiving post, a bolt socket, a bolt, an upper bolt, a keyhole, a door-pulling hole, a door-pulling rope.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.13	The base of the sauna wall rotted. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.14	“I allow you to make an encircling ditch.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.15	The sauna had no flue. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.16	“I allow a flue.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.17	At that time the monks built a fire-place in the middle of a small sauna. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.18	There was no room around the fire-place. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.20	“In a small sauna, you should make the fire-place to one side, but in a large one in the middle.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.21	The fire in the sauna burnt their faces. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.22	“I allow clay for the face.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.23	They moistened the clay with their hands. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.24	“I allow a trough for the clay.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.25	The clay was smelly. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.26	“I allow you to add scent.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.27	The fire in the sauna burnt their bodies. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.28	“I allow you to bring water.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.29	They brought the water in basins and bowls. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.30	“I allow a place for the water and a water scoop.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.31	Because the sauna had a grass roof, they did not sweat. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.32	“I allow you to firm up the structure and then to plaster it inside and outside.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.33	The sauna became muddy. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.34	“I allow three kinds of floors: 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.35	a brick floor, a stone floor, and a wooden floor.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.36	It was still muddy. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.37	“You should wash it.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.38	The water remained. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.39	“I allow a water drain.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.40	The monks sat on the ground and their limbs became itchy. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.42	“I allow a sauna stool.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.43	At that time the sauna was unenclosed. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.44	“I allow three kinds of encircling walls: 
pli-tv-kd15:14.3.45	a brick wall, a stone wall, and a wooden wall.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.4.1	There was no gateway. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.4.2	“I allow a gateway.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.4.3	They built the gateway on a low base. It was flooded. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.4.4	“I allow you to make a high base.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.4.5	The mound collapsed. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.4.6	“I allow you to construct three kinds of raised foundations: 
pli-tv-kd15:14.4.7	a raised foundation of brick, a raised foundation of stone, and a raised foundation of wood.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.4.8	It was difficult to get up to the gateway. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.4.9	“I allow three kinds of stairs: 
pli-tv-kd15:14.4.10	stairs of brick, stairs of stone, and stairs of wood.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.4.11	People fell down while climbing the stairs. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.4.12	“I allow rails.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.4.13	The gateway had no door. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.4.14	“I allow a door, a door frame, a lower hinge, an upper hinge, a bolt-receiving post, a bolt socket, a bolt, an upper bolt, a keyhole, a door-pulling hole, and a door-pulling rope.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.4.15	Grass and dust fell into the gateway. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.4.16	“I allow you to firm up the structure and then plaster it inside and outside, including: 
pli-tv-kd15:14.4.17	treating with white color, black color, and red ocher; making a garland pattern, a creeper pattern, a shark-teeth pattern, and the fivefold pattern.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.5.1	The precincts were muddy. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.5.2	“I allow a you to cover it with gravel.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.5.3	They were unable to do it. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.5.4	“I allow you to lay down paving stones.” 
pli-tv-kd15:14.5.5	The water remained. 
pli-tv-kd15:14.5.6	“I allow a water drain.” 
pli-tv-kd15:15.1.1	At that time naked monks bowed down to other naked monks … 
pli-tv-kd15:15.1.2	naked monks had other naked monks bow down to them … naked monks did services for other naked monks … naked monks had other naked monks do services for them … naked monks gave to other naked monks … naked monks received … they ate fresh foods while naked … they ate cooked foods while naked … they ate other foods while naked … they drank while naked. 
pli-tv-kd15:15.1.3	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:15.1.4	“One who is naked should not bow down to one who is naked, 
pli-tv-kd15:15.1.5	should not bow down to anyone, 
pli-tv-kd15:15.1.6	should not have a naked monk bow down to him, 
pli-tv-kd15:15.1.7	should not have anyone bow down to him, 
pli-tv-kd15:15.1.8	should not do services for a naked monk, 
pli-tv-kd15:15.1.9	should not have a naked monk do services for him, 
pli-tv-kd15:15.1.10	should not give to a naked monk, 
pli-tv-kd15:15.1.11	should not receive, 
pli-tv-kd15:15.1.12	should not eat fresh foods, 
pli-tv-kd15:15.1.13	should not eat cooked food, 
pli-tv-kd15:15.1.14	should not eat anything, 
pli-tv-kd15:15.1.15	and should not drink. 
pli-tv-kd15:15.1.16	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.1.1	At that time the monks put their robes on the ground in the sauna. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.1.2	The robes became dirty. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.1.3	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.1.4	“I allow a bamboo robe-rack and a clothesline.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.1.5	It rained and the robes became wet. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.1.6	“I allow a sauna shed.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.1.7	They built the sauna shed on a low base. It was flooded. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.1.8	“I allow you to make a high base.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.1.9	The mound collapsed. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.1.10	“I allow you to construct three kinds of raised foundations: a raised foundation of brick, a raised foundation of stone, and a raised foundation of wood.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.1.11.1	It was difficult to get up to the sauna shed. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.1.11.2	“I allow three kinds of stairs: stairs of brick, stairs of stone, and stairs of wood.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.1.12	People fell down while climbing the stairs. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.1.13	“I allow rails.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.1.14	Grass and dust fell into the sauna shed. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.1.15	“I allow you to firm up the structure and then to plaster it inside and outside, including: treating with white color, black color, and red ocher; making a garland pattern, a creeper pattern, a shark-teeth pattern, and the fivefold pattern; 
pli-tv-kd15:16.1.16	putting up a bamboo robe-rack and a clothesline.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.1	Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not do services for one another either in the sauna or in the water. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.3	“I allow you to regard three things as a ‘covering’: 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.4	a sauna, water, and a cloth.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.5.0	Wells 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.5.1	On one occasion there was no water in the sauna. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.6	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.7	“I allow a well.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.8	The edge of the well collapsed. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.9	“I allow you to construct three kinds of foundations: 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.10	a foundation of brick, a foundation of stone, and a foundation of wood.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.11	The well was situated on a low site. It was flooded. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.12	“I allow you to make a high base.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.13.1	The mound collapsed. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.13.2	“I allow you to construct three kinds of raised foundation: a raised foundation of brick, a raised foundation of stone, and a raised foundation of wood.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.14.1	It was difficult to get up to the well. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.14.2	“I allow three kinds of stairs: stairs of brick, stairs of stone, and stairs of wood.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.15	People fell down while climbing the stairs. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.16	“I allow rails.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.17	At that time the monks used creepers and belts to haul water. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.19	“I allow a water-hauling rope.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.20	It hurt their hands. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.21	“I allow a well-sweep, a pulley, and well-wheels.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.22	Many vessels broke. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.23	“I allow three kinds of buckets: 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.24	an iron bucket, a wooden bucket, and a bucket made of hide.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.25	While hauling water outside, the monks were afflicted by cold and heat. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.26	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.27	“I allow a well house.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.28	Grass and dust fell into the well house. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.29	“I allow you to firm up the structure and then plaster it inside and outside, including: 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.30	treating with white color, black color, and red ocher; making a garland pattern, a creeper pattern, a shark-teeth pattern, and the fivefold pattern; putting up a bamboo robe-rack and a clothesline.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.31	The well was not covered. Grass, dust, and dirt fell into it. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.32	“I allow a lid.” 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.33	There was no vessel for the water. 
pli-tv-kd15:16.2.34	“I allow a water-trough and a water-bowl.” 
pli-tv-kd15:17.1.0	Other structures 
pli-tv-kd15:17.1.1	At that time the monks bathed here and there in the monastery. 
pli-tv-kd15:17.1.2	The monastery became muddy. 
pli-tv-kd15:17.1.3	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:17.1.4	“I allow a waste-water collection tank.” 
pli-tv-kd15:17.1.5	The tank was unenclosed. 
pli-tv-kd15:17.1.6	The monks were embarrassed to wash there. 
pli-tv-kd15:17.1.7	“I allow three kinds of encircling walls: 
pli-tv-kd15:17.1.8	a brick wall, a stone wall, and a wooden wall.” 
pli-tv-kd15:17.1.9	The area became muddy. 
pli-tv-kd15:17.1.10	“I allow three kinds of decking: 
pli-tv-kd15:17.1.11	a brick decking, a stone decking, and a wooden decking.” 
pli-tv-kd15:17.1.12	The water remained. 
pli-tv-kd15:17.1.13	“I allow a water drain.” 
pli-tv-kd15:17.1.14	The monks were cold. 
pli-tv-kd15:17.1.16	“I allow a water wiper and a cloth to dry yourselves with.” 
pli-tv-kd15:17.2.1	On one occasion a lay follower wanted to build a lotus bathing tank for the benefit of the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd15:17.2.2	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:17.2.3	“I allow lotus bathing tanks.” 
pli-tv-kd15:17.2.4	The edges of the tank collapsed. 
pli-tv-kd15:17.2.5	“I allow you to construct three kinds of foundations: 
pli-tv-kd15:17.2.6	a foundation of brick, a foundation of stone, and a foundation of wood.” 
pli-tv-kd15:17.2.7	It was difficult to get up to the tank. 
pli-tv-kd15:17.2.8	“I allow three kinds of stairs: 
pli-tv-kd15:17.2.9	stairs of brick, stairs of stone, and stairs of wood.” 
pli-tv-kd15:17.2.10	People fell down while climbing the stairs. 
pli-tv-kd15:17.2.11	“I allow rails.” 
pli-tv-kd15:17.2.12	The water in the tanks became stagnant. 
pli-tv-kd15:17.2.13	“I allow a channel and a drain.” 
pli-tv-kd15:17.2.14	On one occasion a lay follower wanted to build a sauna with a pointed roof for the benefit of the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd15:17.2.16	“I allow a sauna with a pointed roof.” 
pli-tv-kd15:18.1.0	Rules on proper conduct and allowable requisites 
pli-tv-kd15:18.1.1	At one time the monks from the group of six did not have sitting mats for four months. 
pli-tv-kd15:18.1.2	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:18.1.3	“You should not be without a sitting mat for four months. 
pli-tv-kd15:18.1.4	If you are, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:18.1.5	At that time the monks from the group of six slept in beds covered in flowers. 
pli-tv-kd15:18.1.6	When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:18.1.7	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:18.1.9	“You should not sleep in a bed covered in flowers. 
pli-tv-kd15:18.1.10	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:18.1.11	People took scents and garlands and went to the monastery. 
pli-tv-kd15:18.1.12	Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not accept. 
pli-tv-kd15:18.1.14	“I allow you to accept scent to make the five-finger mark on your door, and to accept flowers to place them to one side in your dwelling.” 
pli-tv-kd15:19.1.1	On one occasion the Sangha was given a piece of felt. 
pli-tv-kd15:19.1.3	“I allow felt.” 
pli-tv-kd15:19.1.4	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd15:19.1.5	“Should it be determined or transferred to another?” 
pli-tv-kd15:19.1.6	“It should neither be determined nor transferred to another.” 
pli-tv-kd15:19.1.7	The monks from the group of six ate food from a heating device. 
pli-tv-kd15:19.1.8	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:19.1.9	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:19.1.11	“You should not eat food from a heating device. 
pli-tv-kd15:19.1.12	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:19.1.13	On one occasion a certain monk who was sick 
pli-tv-kd15:19.1.14	was unable to hold his bowl with his hands while eating. 
pli-tv-kd15:19.1.16	“I allow a stand.” 
pli-tv-kd15:19.2.1	At that time the monks from the group of six ate from the same vessel, 
pli-tv-kd15:19.2.2	drank from the same vessel, and lay down on the same bed, on the same sheet, under the same cover, and both on the same sheet and under the same cover. 
pli-tv-kd15:19.2.3	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:19.2.4	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:19.2.6	“You should not eat from the same vessel, 
pli-tv-kd15:19.2.7	drink from the same vessel, 
pli-tv-kd15:19.2.8	lie down on the same bed, 
pli-tv-kd15:19.2.9	lie down on the same sheet, 
pli-tv-kd15:19.2.10	lie down under the same cover, 
pli-tv-kd15:19.2.11	or lie down both on the same sheet and under the same cover. 
pli-tv-kd15:19.2.12	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:20.1.0	The overturning of the bowl 
pli-tv-kd15:20.1.1	At one time Vaḍḍha the Licchavī was a friend of the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.1.2	On one occasion he went to them and said, 
pli-tv-kd15:20.1.3	“I pay respect to you, Venerables.” 
pli-tv-kd15:20.1.4	But they did not respond. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.1.5	A second time 
pli-tv-kd15:20.1.8	and a third time he said the same thing, 
pli-tv-kd15:20.1.10	but they still did not respond. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.1.11	“Have I done something wrong? Why don’t you respond?” 
pli-tv-kd15:20.1.12	“It’s because we’ve been treated badly by Dabba the Mallian and you’re not taking an interest.” 
pli-tv-kd15:20.1.13	“What can I do?” 
pli-tv-kd15:20.1.14	“If you like, you could make the Buddha expel Dabba.” 
pli-tv-kd15:20.1.15	“What should I do? How am I able to do that?” 
pli-tv-kd15:20.1.16	“Go to the Buddha and say, 
pli-tv-kd15:20.1.17	‘Sir, this is not proper or appropriate. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.1.18	There’s fear, distress, and oppression in this district, where none of these should exist. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.1.19	From where one would expect security, there’s insecurity. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.1.20	It’s as if water is burning. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.1.21	Venerable Dabba the Mallian has raped my wife.’” 
pli-tv-kd15:20.2.1	Saying, “Yes,” he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd15:20.2.2	and repeated 
pli-tv-kd15:20.2.3	what he had been told to say. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.2.8	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Dabba: 
pli-tv-kd15:20.2.9	“Dabba, do you remember doing as Vaḍḍha says?” 
pli-tv-kd15:20.2.10	“Venerable Sir, you know what I’m like.” 
pli-tv-kd15:20.2.11	A second 
pli-tv-kd15:20.2.12	and a third time the Buddha asked the same question 
pli-tv-kd15:20.2.14	and got the same response. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.2.15	He then said, “Dabba, the Dabbas don’t give such evasive answers. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.2.16	If it was done by you, say so; 
pli-tv-kd15:20.2.17	if it wasn’t done by you, then say that.” 
pli-tv-kd15:20.2.18	“Since I was born, Sir, I don’t recall having sexual intercourse even in a dream, let alone when awake.” 
pli-tv-kd15:20.3.1	And the Buddha addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:20.3.2	“Well then, monks, the Sangha should overturn the almsbowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.3.3	When a lay follower has eight qualities, you should overturn your bowl against him: 
pli-tv-kd15:20.3.4	he’s trying to stop monks from acquiring material gains; he’s trying to harm monks; he’s trying to get monks to lose their place of residence; he abuses and reviles monks; he causes division between monks; he disparages the Buddha; he disparages the Teaching; he disparages the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.4.1	And the overturning of the bowl is to be done like this. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.4.2	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd15:20.4.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.4.4	Vaḍḍha the Licchavī is groundlessly charging Venerable Dabba the Mallian with failure in morality. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.4.5	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should overturn the bowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.4.6	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.4.7	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.4.8	Vaḍḍha the Licchavī is groundlessly charging Venerable Dabba the Mallian with failure in morality. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.4.9	The Sangha overturns the bowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.4.10	Any monk who approves of overturning the bowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Sangha, should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.4.11	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.4.12	The Sangha has overturned the bowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.4.13	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd15:20.5.0	Turning the bowl upright 
pli-tv-kd15:20.5.1	After robing up the following morning, Venerable Ānanda took his bowl and robe, went to the house of Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, and told him, 
pli-tv-kd15:20.5.2	“Vaḍḍha, the Sangha has overturned the bowl against you. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.5.3	You’re prohibited from interacting with the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-kd15:20.5.4	As a result, 
pli-tv-kd15:20.5.6	Vaḍḍha fainted right there. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.5.7	But Vaḍḍha’s friends and relatives said to him, 
pli-tv-kd15:20.5.8	“Don’t be sad, Vaḍḍha. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.5.9	We’ll reconcile you with the Buddha and the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd15:20.5.10	Soon afterwards Vaḍḍha, together with his wives and children, together with his friends and relatives, with wet clothes and wet hair, went to the Buddha. He bowed down at the Buddha’s feet and said, 
pli-tv-kd15:20.5.11	“Sir, I’ve made a mistake. I’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.5.12	Please forgive me so that I may restrain myself in the future.” 
pli-tv-kd15:20.5.13	“You have certainly made a mistake. You’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.5.14	But since you acknowledge your mistake and make proper amends, I forgive you. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.5.15	For this is called growth in the training of the noble ones: acknowledging a mistake, making proper amends, and undertaking restraint for the future.” 
pli-tv-kd15:20.6.1	The Buddha then addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:20.6.2	“Well then, the Sangha should turn the almsbowl upright for Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, allowing him to interact with the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.6.3	When a lay follower has eight qualities, you should turn your bowl upright for him: 
pli-tv-kd15:20.6.4	he is not trying to stop monks from acquiring material gains; he is not trying to harm monks; he is not trying to get monks to lose their place of residence; he doesn’t abuse or revile monks; he doesn’t cause division between monks; he doesn’t disparage the Buddha; he doesn’t disparage the Teaching; he doesn’t disparage the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.7.1	And the turning of the bowl upright is to be done like this. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.7.2	Vaḍḍha the Licchavī should approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: 
pli-tv-kd15:20.7.3	‘Venerables, the Sangha has overturned the bowl against me, prohibiting me from interacting with the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.7.4	I’m conducting myself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released. I ask the Sangha to turn the bowl upright for me.’ 
pli-tv-kd15:20.7.5	And he should ask a second 
pli-tv-kd15:20.7.6	and a third time. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.7.7	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd15:20.7.8	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.7.9	The Sangha had overturned the bowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.7.10	He is now conducting himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released, and is asking the Sangha to turn the bowl upright for him. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.7.11	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should turn the bowl upright for Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, allowing him to interact with the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.7.12	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.7.13	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.7.14	The Sangha had overturned the bowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.7.15	He is now conducting himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released, and is asking the Sangha to turn the bowl upright for him. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.7.16	The Sangha turns the bowl upright for Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, allowing him to interact with the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.7.17	Any monk who approves of turning the bowl upright for Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, allowing him to interact with the Sangha, should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.7.18	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.7.19	The Sangha has turned the bowl upright for Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, allowing him to interact with the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd15:20.7.20	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd15:21.1.0	Rules about stepping on cloth 
pli-tv-kd15:21.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Vesālī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward the country of Bhaggā. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.1.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd15:21.1.3	he stayed at Susumāragira in the Bhesakaḷā Grove, the deer park. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.1.4	At this time Prince Bodhi had recently built the Kokanada stilt house. It had not yet been inhabited by any monastic or brahmin, or anyone else. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.1.5	The Prince said to the young brahmin Sañcikāputta, 
pli-tv-kd15:21.1.6	“My dear Sañcikāputta, please go to the Buddha, bow down in my name with your head at his feet, 
pli-tv-kd15:21.1.7	and ask 
pli-tv-kd15:21.1.8	if he is healthy, strong, and living at ease. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.1.9	And then say, 
pli-tv-kd15:21.1.10	‘Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal, together with the Sangha of monks, from Prince Bodhi.’” 
pli-tv-kd15:21.1.11	Saying, “Yes, Sir,” Sañcikāputta went to the Buddha and exchanged pleasantries with him. He then sat down 
pli-tv-kd15:21.1.12	and told the Buddha all he had been asked to say, 
pli-tv-kd15:21.1.15	concluding with the invitation for the meal on the following day. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.1.16	The Buddha consented by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.2.1	Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Sañcikāputta got up from his seat, returned to the Prince, and told him what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.2.7	The next morning Prince Bodhi had various kinds of fine food prepared, and had the entire Kokanada stilt house covered with white cloth, all the way to the bottom step of the staircase. He then said to Sañcikāputta, 
pli-tv-kd15:21.2.8	“Go to the Buddha 
pli-tv-kd15:21.2.9	and tell him the meal is ready.” 
pli-tv-kd15:21.2.10	He did as instructed. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.2.12	Soon afterwards, the Buddha robed up in the morning, took his bowl and robe, and went the Prince’s house. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.2.13	The Prince was standing outside the gateway, waiting for the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.2.14	When he saw the Buddha coming, 
pli-tv-kd15:21.2.15	he went out to meet him, bowed down to him, and went to the Kokanada stilt house with the Buddha in front. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.2.16	But the Buddha stopped at the bottom stair of that staircase. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.2.17	The Prince said, 
pli-tv-kd15:21.2.18	“Sir, please step on the cloth. It will be for my longterm benefit and happiness.” 
pli-tv-kd15:21.2.19	But the Buddha remained silent. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.2.20	A second time the Prince repeated his request, but the Buddha still remained silent. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.2.21	When the Prince made his request for the third time, 
pli-tv-kd15:21.2.23	the Buddha looked at Venerable Ānanda. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.2.24	And Ānanda said to the Prince, 
pli-tv-kd15:21.2.25	“Please fold up the cloth. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.2.26	The Buddha doesn’t step on cloth coverings. The Buddha has compassion for later generations.” 
pli-tv-kd15:21.3.1	The Prince then had the cloth folded up and had a seat prepared up in the stilt house. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.3.2	The Buddha ascended the house and sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.3.3	The Prince personally served the various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal and had washed his hands and bowl, the Prince sat down to one side. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.3.4	The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which he got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.3.5	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:21.3.6	“You should not step on a cloth covering. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.3.7	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:21.4.1	On one occasion a woman who was unable to conceive invited the monks, prepared a cloth, and said, 
pli-tv-kd15:21.4.2	“Venerables, please step on the cloth.” 
pli-tv-kd15:21.4.3	But being afraid of wrongdoing, they refused. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.4.4	“Please step on the cloth as a blessing.” 
pli-tv-kd15:21.4.5	They still refused. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.4.6	That woman complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:21.4.7	“How can the venerables, when asked, not step on a cloth as a blessing?” 
pli-tv-kd15:21.4.8	The monks heard the complaints of that woman 
pli-tv-kd15:21.4.9	and they told the Buddha what had happened. He said, 
pli-tv-kd15:21.4.10	“Householders want blessings. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.4.11	I allow you, when asked, to step on a cloth covering as a blessing for householders.” 
pli-tv-kd15:21.4.12	Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not step on a sheet after washing their feet. 
pli-tv-kd15:21.4.14	“I allow you to step on a sheet after washing your feet.” 
pli-tv-kd15:21.4.15	The second section for recitation is finished. 
pli-tv-kd15:22.1.0	More rules on proper conduct and allowable requisites. 
pli-tv-kd15:22.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed in the country of Bhaggā for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd15:22.1.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd15:22.1.3	he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd15:22.1.4	Soon Visākhā Migāramātā went to the Buddha, taking a waterpot, a ceramic foot-scrubber, and a broom. She bowed to the Buddha, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd15:22.1.5	and said, 
pli-tv-kd15:22.1.6	“Venerable Sir, for my longterm benefit and happiness, please accept this waterpot, this foot-scrubber, and this broom.” 
pli-tv-kd15:22.1.7	The Buddha accepted the waterpot and the broom, 
pli-tv-kd15:22.1.8	but not the ceramic foot-scrubber. 
pli-tv-kd15:22.1.9	He then instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching, 
pli-tv-kd15:22.1.10	after which she got up from her seat, bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd15:22.1.11	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:22.1.12	“I allow waterpots and brooms. 
pli-tv-kd15:22.1.13	But you should not use a ceramic foot-scrubber. 
pli-tv-kd15:22.1.14	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:22.1.15	I allow three kinds of foot-scrubbers: 
pli-tv-kd15:22.1.16	stones, pebbles, and pumice.” 
pli-tv-kd15:22.2.1	Visākhā again went to the Buddha, now taking a fan and a palm-leaf fan. She bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd15:22.2.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd15:22.2.3	“Venerable Sir, for my longterm benefit and happiness, please accept this fan and this palm-leaf fan.” 
pli-tv-kd15:22.2.4	The Buddha accepted both. 
pli-tv-kd15:22.2.5	He then instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching, after which she got up from her seat, bowed, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, 
pli-tv-kd15:22.2.6	and left. 
pli-tv-kd15:22.2.7	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:22.2.8	“I allow a fan and a palm-leaf fan.” 
pli-tv-kd15:23.1.1	On one occasion the Sangha was given a mosquito whisk. 
pli-tv-kd15:23.1.3	“I allow a mosquito whisk.” 
pli-tv-kd15:23.1.4	The Sangha was given a yak-tail whisk. 
pli-tv-kd15:23.1.6	“You should not use a yak-tail whisk. 
pli-tv-kd15:23.1.7	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:23.1.8	I allow three kinds of fans: 
pli-tv-kd15:23.1.9	made of bark, made of khus grass, and made of peacocks’ tail feathers.” 
pli-tv-kd15:23.2.1	On one occasion the Sangha was given a sunshade. 
pli-tv-kd15:23.2.3	“I allow a sunshade.” 
pli-tv-kd15:23.2.4	Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six walked about holding a sunshade. 
pli-tv-kd15:23.2.5	When a certain Buddhist lay follower and a number of Ājīvaka followers went to a park, 
pli-tv-kd15:23.2.6	they saw the group of six monks with their sunshades. 
pli-tv-kd15:23.2.7	They said to that lay follower, 
pli-tv-kd15:23.2.8	“These venerables of yours are coming. They are holding sunshades, just like accountants and government officials.” 
pli-tv-kd15:23.2.9	“These are not monks; they are wanderers.” 
pli-tv-kd15:23.2.10	And they made a bet on whether they were monks or not. 
pli-tv-kd15:23.2.11	When the monks came close, that lay follower recognized them. And he complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:23.2.12	“How can the venerables walk about holding sunshades?” 
pli-tv-kd15:23.2.13	The monks heard the complaints of that lay follower 
pli-tv-kd15:23.2.14	and they told the Buddha. He said, 
pli-tv-kd15:23.2.15	“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are acting like this?” 
pli-tv-kd15:23.2.16	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd15:23.2.17	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd15:23.2.18	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:23.2.19	“You should not use a sunshade. 
pli-tv-kd15:23.2.20	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:23.3.1	Soon afterwards a certain sick monk 
pli-tv-kd15:23.3.2	was not comfortable without a sunshade. 
pli-tv-kd15:23.3.4	“I allow a sick monk to use a sunshade.” 
pli-tv-kd15:23.4.1	When they heard 
pli-tv-kd15:23.4.2	 that the Buddha had allowed sunshades for the sick, but not for the healthy, 
pli-tv-kd15:23.4.3	and being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not use sunshades in the monastery or in the vicinity of the monastery. 
pli-tv-kd15:23.4.5	“I allow you to use a sunshade in a monastery and in the vicinity of a monastery, even if you’re healthy.” 
pli-tv-kd15:24.1.1	On one occasion a monk put his almsbowl in a carrying net, hung it from a staff, and entered the gateway to a certain village at the wrong time. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.1.2	People said, 
pli-tv-kd15:24.1.3	“This must be a gangster coming with his gleaming sword.” They pounced and took hold of him, but when they recognized him, they let him go. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.1.4	He returned to the monastery and told the monks what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.1.5	They said, “So you used a carrying net and a staff?” 
pli-tv-kd15:24.1.6	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd15:24.1.7	The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd15:24.1.8	“How can a monk use a carrying net and a staff?” 
pli-tv-kd15:24.1.9	They told the Buddha … 
pli-tv-kd15:24.1.10	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd15:24.1.11	after criticizing him … 
pli-tv-kd15:24.1.12	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:24.1.13	“You should not use a carrying net and a staff. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.1.14	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:24.2.1	On one occasion there was a sick monk who was unable to walk about without a staff. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.2.3	“I allow you to give a sick monk permission to use a staff. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.2.4	And it should be given like this. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.2.5	The sick monk should approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: 
pli-tv-kd15:24.2.6	‘Venerables, I’m sick. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.2.7	I’m unable to walk about without a staff. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.2.8	I ask the Sangha for permission to use a staff.’ 
pli-tv-kd15:24.2.9	And he should ask a second 
pli-tv-kd15:24.2.10	and a third time. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.2.11	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd15:24.2.12	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.2.13	Monk so-and-so is sick. He is unable to walk about without a staff. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.2.14	He is asking the Sangha for permission to use a staff. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.2.15	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should give him permission to use a staff. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.2.16	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.2.17	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.

pli-tv-kd15:24.2.24	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.1	On one occasion there was a sick monk who was unable to carry his almsbowl around without a carrying-net. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.2	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.3	“I allow you to give a sick monk permission to use a a carrying-net. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.4	And it should be given like this.

pli-tv-kd15:24.3.27	“I allow you to give a sick monk permission to use a staff and a carrying-net. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.28	And it should be given like this. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.29	The sick monk should approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.30	‘Venerables, I’m sick. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.31	I’m unable to walk about without a staff 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.32	or to carry my bowl around without a carrying-net. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.33	I ask the Sangha to give me permission to use a staff and a carrying-net.’ 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.34	And he should ask a second 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.35	and a third time. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.36	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.37	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.38	Monk so-and-so is sick. He is unable to walk about without a staff or to carry his bowl around without a carrying-net. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.39	He is asking the Sangha for permission to use a staff and a carrying-net. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.40	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should give him permission to use a staff and a carrying-net. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.41	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.42	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.43	Monk so-and-so is sick. He is unable to walk about without a staff or to carry his bowl around without a carrying-net. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.44	He is asking the Sangha for permission to use a staff and a carrying-net. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.45	The Sangha gives him permission to use a staff and a carrying-net. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.46	Any monk who approves of giving monk so-and-so permission to use a staff and a carrying-net should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.47	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.48	The Sangha has given monk so-and-so permission to use a staff and a carrying-net. 
pli-tv-kd15:24.3.49	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd15:25.1.1	At that time there was a monk who was a regurgitator. 
pli-tv-kd15:25.1.2	After regurgitating, he would swallow. 
pli-tv-kd15:25.1.3	The monks complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd15:25.1.4	“This monk is eating at the wrong time.” 
pli-tv-kd15:25.1.5	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:25.1.6	“This monk has only recently passed away as a cow. 
pli-tv-kd15:25.1.7	I allow a regurgitator to regurgitate. 
pli-tv-kd15:25.1.8	But you should not take it out of the mouth and then swallow it. 
pli-tv-kd15:25.1.9	If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule.” 
pli-tv-kd15:26.1.1	Soon afterwards a certain association was offering a meal to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd15:26.1.2	Lots of rice fell on the floor in the dining hall. 
pli-tv-kd15:26.1.3	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:26.1.4	“When they are given rice, how can the Sakyan monastics not receive it with care? Each lump of rice is the result of a lot of work.” 
pli-tv-kd15:26.1.5	The monks heard the complaints of those people. 
pli-tv-kd15:26.1.6	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:26.1.7	“I allow you to pick up yourselves what falls down when given, and then eat it. 
pli-tv-kd15:26.1.8	It has been relinquished by the donors.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.0	Personal grooming 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.1	On one occasion a certain monk with long nails was walking for alms. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.2	A woman who saw him said to him, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.3	“Come, Venerable, and have sex.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.4	“It’s not allowable.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.5	“If you don’t, I’ll scratch my limbs with my nails and make a scene, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.6	saying that you abused me.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.7	“That’s your business, sister.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.8	Yet that woman did what she had threatened to do. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.10	People came running to and took hold of that monk. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.11	But when they saw the skin and blood on that woman’s nails, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.12	they realized 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.13	she had done it herself, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.14	and they released the monk. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.15	That monk then returned to the monastery and told the monks what had happened. They said, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.16	“So you grow your nails long?” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.17	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.18	The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.19	“How can a monk grow his nails long?” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.20	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.21	“You should not grow your nails long. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.1.22	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.2.1	Soon afterwards the monks were cutting their nails with their nails, with their teeth, or by grinding them on a wall. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.2.2	Their fingers hurt. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.2.4	“I allow nail clippers.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.2.5	They cut their nails so short that they bled. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.2.6	Their fingers hurt. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.2.7	“I allow you to cut your nails so that they are even with the tip of the flesh.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.2.8	At this time the monks from the group of six polished their finger and toe nails. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.2.9	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.2.10	They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.2.12	“You should not polish your finger and toe nails. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.2.13	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.2.14	But I allow you to remove dirt.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.3.1	At that time the monks had long hair. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.3.2	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.3.3	“Are you able to shave each other’s heads?” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.3.4	“We are.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.3.5	The Buddha then gave a teaching 
pli-tv-kd15:27.3.6	and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:27.3.7	“I allow a razor, a whetstone, a razor case, felt, and all barber equipment.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.1	At this time the monks from the group of six trimmed their beards, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.2	grew their beards long, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.3	grew goatees, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.4	grew sideburns, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.5	removed their chest hair, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.6	sculpted their stomach hair, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.7	grew mustaches, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.8	and removed the hair from their private parts. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.9	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.10	They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.12	“You should not trim your beard, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.13	grow your beard long, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.14	grow a goatee, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.15	grow sideburns, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.16	remove your chest hair, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.17	sculpt your stomach hair, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.18	grow a mustache, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.19	or remove the hair from your private parts. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.20	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.21	A certain monk had a sore on his private parts, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.22	and the medicine did not stick. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.4.24	“I allow you to remove hair on the private parts if you have a disease.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.5.1	At that time the monks from the group of six cut their hair with scissors. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.5.2	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.5.3	They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.5.5	“You should not cut your hair with scissors. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.5.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.5.7	A monk who had a sore on his head was unable to shave with a razor. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.5.9	“I allow you to cut your hair with scissors if you have a disease.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.5.10	At this time the monks grew their nasal hair long. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.5.11	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.5.12	“They are just like goblins.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.5.14	“You should not grow your nasal hair long. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.5.15	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.5.16	The monks had their nasal hair removed with small stones or beeswax. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.5.17	Their noses hurt. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.5.19	“I allow tweezers.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.5.20	The monks from the group of six had their gray hairs removed. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.5.21	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.5.22	They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.5.24	“You should not remove gray hairs. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.5.25	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.6.1	On one occasion a monk’s ear was blocked by earwax. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.6.3	“I allow an ear-pick.” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.6.4	Soon the monks from the group of six used luxurious ear-picks made of gold and silver. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.6.5	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:27.6.6	They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:27.6.8	“You should not use a luxurious ear-pick. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.6.9	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:27.6.10	I allow an ear-pick made of bone, ivory, horn, reed, bamboo, wood, resin, fruit, metal, or shell.” 
pli-tv-kd15:28.1.0	More rules on proper conduct and allowable requisites 
pli-tv-kd15:28.1.1	At one time the monks from the group of six had amassed a large number of metal and bronze goods. 
pli-tv-kd15:28.1.2	People who were walking about the dwellings saw this, and they complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:28.1.3	“How can the Sakyan monastics amass a large number of metal and bronze goods? They are just like merchants.” 
pli-tv-kd15:28.1.5	“You should not amass a large number of metal and bronze goods. 
pli-tv-kd15:28.1.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:28.2.1	Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not accept ointment boxes, ointment sticks, earpicks, or even metal used for joining. 
pli-tv-kd15:28.2.3	“I allow an ointment box, an ointment stick, an ear-pick, and metal used for joining.” 
pli-tv-kd15:28.2.4	On one occasion the monks from the group of six were sitting using their upper robes as a back-and-knee strap. 
pli-tv-kd15:28.2.5	The panels of the robes broke up. 
pli-tv-kd15:28.2.7	“You should not sit using your upper robe as a back-and-knee strap. 
pli-tv-kd15:28.2.8	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:28.2.9	A monk who was sick 
pli-tv-kd15:28.2.10	was not comfortable without a back-and-knee strap. 
pli-tv-kd15:28.2.12	“I allow a back-and-knee strap.” 
pli-tv-kd15:28.2.13	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd15:28.2.14	“How should we make back-and-knee straps?” 
pli-tv-kd15:28.2.16	“I allow a warp, a reed, a weft, a shuttle, and all weaving equipment.” 
pli-tv-kd15:29.1.1	On one occasion a monk entered a village for alms without a belt. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.1.2	His sarong fell off on the street. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.1.3	People shouted out, 
pli-tv-kd15:29.1.4	and he felt humiliated. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.1.5	When he had returned to the monastery, he told the monks what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.1.6	They in turn told the Buddha, who said, 
pli-tv-kd15:29.1.7	“You should not enter a village without a belt. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.1.8	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.1.9	I allow a belt.” 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.1	Soon the monks from the group of six wore luxurious belts: 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.2	belts with multiple strings, belts like the head of a water snake, belts of twisted strings of various colors, belts like ornamental strings. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.3	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.4	They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.6	“You should not wear a luxurious belt. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.8	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.9	I allow two kinds of belts: 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.10	made from strips of cloth and made from pigs’ intestines.” 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.11	The edges of the belts wore away. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.12	“I allow a belt of twisted strings of various colors and a belt like ornamental strings.” 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.13	The ends of the belts wore away. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.14	“I allow looping the end and then sewing around the loop, and sewing into a knot.” 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.15	The loop at the end wore away. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.16	“I allow a buckle.” 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.17	Soon the monks from the group of six wore luxurious buckles made of gold and silver. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.18	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.19	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.21	“You should not wear a luxurious buckle. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.22	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.23	I allow a buckle made of bone, ivory, horn, reed, bamboo, wood, resin, fruit, metal, 
pli-tv-kd15:29.2.24	shell, and string.” 
pli-tv-kd15:29.3.1	On one occasion Venerable Ānanda robed up in light upper robes and entered a village for alms. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.3.2	A whirlwind lifted up his robes. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.3.3	When he had returned to the monastery, he told the monks what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.3.4	They in turn told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.3.5	“I allow toggles and loops.” 
pli-tv-kd15:29.3.6	Soon the monks from the group of six wore luxurious toggles made of gold and silver. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.3.7	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:29.3.8	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:29.3.10	“You should not wear luxurious toggles. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.3.11	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.3.12	I allow toggles made of bone, ivory, horn, reed, bamboo, wood, resin, fruit, metal, shell, and string.” 
pli-tv-kd15:29.3.13	The monks fastened toggles and loops to their robes, 
pli-tv-kd15:29.3.14	but it caused the robes to wear. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.3.16	“I allow a toggle-shield and a loop-shield.” 
pli-tv-kd15:29.3.17	They fastened the toggle-shield and the loop-shield on the edge of the robe. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.3.18	The border of the robe opened up. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.3.20	“I allow you to fasten the toggle-shield at the edge 
pli-tv-kd15:29.3.21	and the loop-shield twelve or thirteen centimeters in from the edge.” 
pli-tv-kd15:29.4.1	At this time the monks from the group of six wore their sarongs like householders—
pli-tv-kd15:29.4.2	in the elephant-trunk style, the fish-tail style, the four corner style, the palm-leaf style, and the hundred fold style. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.4.3	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:29.4.4	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:29.4.6	“You should not wear your sarong like householders—
pli-tv-kd15:29.4.7	in the elephant-trunk style, the fish-tail style, the four corner style, the palm-leaf style, and the hundred fold style. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.4.8	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:29.4.9	The monks from the group of six wore their upper robes like householders. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.4.10	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:29.4.11	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:29.4.13	“You should not wear your upper robe like householders. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.4.14	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:29.5.1	The monks from the group of six wore their sarongs like loin cloths. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.5.2	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:29.5.3	“They are just like the king’s porters.” 
pli-tv-kd15:29.5.5	“You should not wear your sarong like a loin cloth. 
pli-tv-kd15:29.5.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:30.1.1	At that time the monks from the group of six used carrying poles with loads on both ends. 
pli-tv-kd15:30.1.2	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:30.1.3	“They are just like the king’s porters.” 
pli-tv-kd15:30.1.5	“You should not use a carrying pole with loads on both ends. 
pli-tv-kd15:30.1.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:30.1.7	I allow a carrying pole with a load on one end, a two-person carrying pole with a load in the middle, loads for the head, loads for the shoulder, loads for the hip, and hanging loads.” 
pli-tv-kd15:31.1.1	At that time the monks did not clean their teeth. 
pli-tv-kd15:31.1.2	As a consequence, they had bad breath. 
pli-tv-kd15:31.1.3	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:31.1.4	“There are these five disadvantages of not cleaning your teeth: 
pli-tv-kd15:31.1.5	it’s bad for your eyes; you get bad breath; your ability to taste is reduced; bile and phlegm cover over the food; you don’t enjoy the food. 
pli-tv-kd15:31.1.7	There are these five benefits of cleaning your teeth: 
pli-tv-kd15:31.1.8	it’s good for your eyes; you don’t get bad breath; your ability to taste is improved; bile and phlegm don’t cover over the food; you enjoy the food. 
pli-tv-kd15:31.1.10	I allow tooth cleaners.” 
pli-tv-kd15:31.2.1	The monks from the group of six used long tooth cleaners and even used them to hit the novice monks. 
pli-tv-kd15:31.2.3	“You should not use long tooth cleaners. 
pli-tv-kd15:31.2.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:31.2.5	I allow tooth cleaners that are a maximum of thirteen centimeters long. And you should not use them to hit the novice monks. 
pli-tv-kd15:31.2.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:31.2.7	On one occasion a monk used a tooth cleaner that was too short and it got stuck in his throat. 
pli-tv-kd15:31.2.9	“You should not use tooth cleaners that are too short. 
pli-tv-kd15:31.2.10	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:31.2.11	You should not use tooth cleaners shorter than seven centimeters.” 
pli-tv-kd15:32.1.1	On one occasion the monks from the group of six set fire to a grove. 
pli-tv-kd15:32.1.2	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:32.1.3	“They are just like land clearers.” 
pli-tv-kd15:32.1.5	“You should not set fire to groves. 
pli-tv-kd15:32.1.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:32.1.7	On one occasion the dwellings were overgrown with grass. When the forest was burning, the dwellings burnt too. 
pli-tv-kd15:32.1.8	Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not light a counter-fire for protection. 
pli-tv-kd15:32.1.10	“When the forest is burning, I allow you to light a counter-fire for protection.” 
pli-tv-kd15:32.2.1	At that time the monks from the group of six ascended trees and then climbed from tree to tree. 
pli-tv-kd15:32.2.2	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:32.2.3	“They are just like monkeys.” 
pli-tv-kd15:32.2.5	“You should not climb trees. 
pli-tv-kd15:32.2.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:32.2.7	On one occasion a certain monk was walking on a road in the Kosalan country on his way to Sāvatthī when he was blocked by an elephant. 
pli-tv-kd15:32.2.8	He quickly went up to a tree, but being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not climb it. 
pli-tv-kd15:32.2.9	Soon the elephant went away. 
pli-tv-kd15:32.2.10	When he arrived at Sāvatthī, he told the monks what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd15:32.2.11	They in turn told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:32.2.12	“When there is something to be done, I allow you to climb a tree to the height of a man, or as far as you need if there are dangers.” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.1.0	Rules relating to teaching 
pli-tv-kd15:33.1.1	At this time there were two monks called Yameḷa and Kekuṭa, brothers born into a brahmin family, who were well-spoken and had good voices. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.1.2	They went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd15:33.1.3	and said, 
pli-tv-kd15:33.1.4	“Venerable Sir, the monks now have a variety of names, and come from a variety of families, castes, and households. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.1.5	They corrupt the word of the Buddha by using their own expressions. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.1.6	Now we could give metrical form to the word of the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.1.7	The Buddha rebuked them, 
pli-tv-kd15:33.1.8	“Foolish men, how can you say such a thing? 
pli-tv-kd15:33.1.10	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.1.11	after rebuking them … 
pli-tv-kd15:33.1.12	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:33.1.13	“You should not give metrical form to the word of the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.1.14	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.1.15	You should learn the word of the Buddha using its own expressions.” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.1	At that time the monks from the group of six were learning cosmology. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.2	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.3	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.4	The monks heard the complaints of those lay people 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.5	and they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.6	“Is there any growth and fulfillment on this spiritual path, monks, for one who sees cosmology as the essence?” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.7	“Certainly not.” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.8	“Would anyone who sees this spiritual path as the essence learn cosmology?” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.9	“Certainly not.” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.10	“You should not learn cosmology. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.11	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.12	The monks from the group of six taught cosmology. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.13	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.14	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.15	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.16	“You should not teach cosmology. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.17	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.18	The monks from the group of six studied pointless knowledge. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.19	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.20	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.21	The monks heard the complaints of those lay people and they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.22	“You should not study pointless knowledge. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.23	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.24	The monks from the group of six taught pointless knowledge. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.25	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.26	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.28	“You should not teach pointless knowledge. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.2.29	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.3.1	On one occasion the Buddha sneezed while teaching a large gathering. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.3.2	The monks made an uproar, saying, 
pli-tv-kd15:33.3.3	“Long live the Buddha!” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.3.6	Because of the noise, the teaching was interrupted. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.3.7	The Buddha said to the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:33.3.8	“If you say, ‘May you live long!’ to one who sneezes, will he live or die because of that?” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.3.9	“Certainly not.” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.3.10	“You should not say, ‘May you live long!’ to one who sneezes. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.3.11	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.3.12	At that time when monks sneezed, people said, “May you live long, Venerable!” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.3.13	Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not respond. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.3.14	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd15:33.3.15	“How can the Sakyan monastics not respond when spoken to like this?” 
pli-tv-kd15:33.3.17	“Householders want blessings. 
pli-tv-kd15:33.3.18	When householders say, ‘May you live long!’ I allow you to respond with similar words.” 
pli-tv-kd15:34.1.1	On one occasion when the Buddha was seated teaching a large gathering, 
pli-tv-kd15:34.1.2	there was a monk who had eaten garlic. 
pli-tv-kd15:34.1.4	Not to annoy the other monks, 
pli-tv-kd15:34.1.5	he had sat down at a distance. 
pli-tv-kd15:34.1.6	The Buddha saw him 
pli-tv-kd15:34.1.7	and asked the monks why he was sitting there. 
pli-tv-kd15:34.1.8	The monks told him and the Buddha said, 
pli-tv-kd15:34.1.13	“Monks, should one eat anything that would stop one from hearing a teaching such as this?” 
pli-tv-kd15:34.1.14	“Certainly not.” 
pli-tv-kd15:34.1.15	“You should not eat garlic. 
pli-tv-kd15:34.1.16	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd15:34.2.1	On one occasion Venerable Sāriputta had a stomach ache. 
pli-tv-kd15:34.2.2	Venerable Mahāmoggallāna went to him and said, 
pli-tv-kd15:34.2.3	“When you had a stomach ache in the past, Sāriputta, what made you better?” —
pli-tv-kd15:34.2.4	“Garlic.” 
pli-tv-kd15:34.2.5	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:34.2.6	“I allow you to eat garlic if you are sick.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.1.0	Rules about restrooms 
pli-tv-kd15:35.1.1	At that time the monks urinated here and there in the monastery. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.1.2	The monastery became unclean. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.1.4	“You should urinate in one place.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.1.5	The monastery became smelly. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.1.6	“I allow a urine-collection pot.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.1.7	It was painful to sit there while urinating. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.1.8	“I allow foot-stands for urinating.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.1.9	The foot-stands were unenclosed. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.1.10	The monks were embarrassed to urinate there. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.1.11	“I allow three kinds of encircling walls: 
pli-tv-kd15:35.1.12	a brick wall, a stone wall, and a wooden wall.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.1.13	The urine-collection pot was not covered. It was smelly. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.1.14	“I allow a lid.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.1	At that time the monks defecated here and there in the monastery. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.2	The monastery became filthy. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.4	“You should defecate in one place.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.5	The monastery became smelly. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.6	“I allow a cesspit.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.7	The edge of the cesspit collapsed. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.8	“I allow you to construct three kinds of foundations: 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.9	a foundation of brick, a foundation of stone, and a foundation of wood.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.10	The cesspit was situated on a low site. It was flooded. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.11	“I allow you to make a high base.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.12	The mound collapsed. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.13	“I allow you to construct three kinds of raised foundations: 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.14	a raised foundation of brick, a raised foundation of stone, and a raised foundation of wood.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.15	It was difficult to get up to the cesspit. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.16	“I allow three kinds of stairs: 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.17	stairs of brick, stairs of stone, and stairs of wood.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.18	People fell down while climbing the stairs. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.19	“I allow rails.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.20	When seated on the edge to defecate, they fell down. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.21	“I allow you to lay a floor with a gap in the middle for defecating.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.22	It was painful to sit there while defecating. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.2.23	“I allow foot-stands for defecating.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.3.1	They urinated outside the cesspit. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.3.2	“I allow a urinal.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.3.3	There were no wiping sticks. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.3.4	“I allow wiping sticks.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.3.5	There was no container for the wiping sticks. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.3.6	“I allow a container for wiping sticks.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.3.7	The cesspit was not covered and it was smelly. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.3.8	“I allow a lid.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.3.9	Because they were defecating outside, the monks were afflicted by cold and heat. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.3.10	“I allow a restroom.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.3.11	The restroom had no door. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.3.12	“I allow a door, a door frame, a lower hinge, an upper hinge, a bolt-receiving post, a bolt socket, a bolt, an upper bolt, a keyhole, a door-pulling hole, and a door-pulling rope.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.3.13	Grass and dust fell into the restroom. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.3.14	“I allow you to firm up the structure and then to plaster it inside and outside, including: 
pli-tv-kd15:35.3.15	treating with white color, black color, and red ocher; making a garland pattern, a creeper pattern, a shark-teeth pattern, and the fivefold pattern; putting up a bamboo robe-rack and a clothesline.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.3.16	On one occasion a monk who was weak from old age fell over as he was getting up after defecating. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.3.18	“I allow a suspended rope to hold onto.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.3.19	The restroom was unenclosed. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.3.20	“I allow three kinds of encircling walls: 
pli-tv-kd15:35.3.21	a brick wall, a stone wall, and a wooden wall.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.1	There was no gateway. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.2	“I allow a gateway.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.3	The gateway had no door. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.4	“I allow a door, a door frame, a lower hinge, an upper hinge, a bolt-receiving post, a bolt socket, a bolt, an upper bolt, a keyhole, a door-pulling hole, and a door-pulling rope.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.5	Grass and dust fell into the gateway. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.6	“I allow you to firm up the structure and then plaster it inside and outside, including: 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.7	treating with white color, black color, and red ocher; making a garland pattern, a creeper pattern, a shark-teeth pattern, and the fivefold pattern.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.8	The precincts were muddy. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.9	“I allow you to cover it with gravel.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.10	They were unable to do it. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.11	“I allow you to lay down paving stones.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.12	The water remained. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.13	“I allow a water drain.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.14	There was no pot for rinsing water. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.15	“I allow a pot for rinsing water.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.16	There was no scoop for the rinsing water. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.17	“I allow a scoop for the rinsing water.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.18	It was painful to sit there while rinsing. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.19	“I allow foot-stands for rinsing.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.20	The foot-stands were unenclosed. The monks were embarrassed to rinse there. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.21	“I allow three kinds of encircling wall: 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.22	a brick wall, a stone wall, or a wooden wall.” 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.23	The rinsing-water pot was not covered. Grass, dust, and dirt fell into it. 
pli-tv-kd15:35.4.24	“I allow a lid.” 
pli-tv-kd15:36.1.0	Even more rules on proper conduct and allowable requisites 
pli-tv-kd15:36.1.1	At one time the monks from the group of six were misbehaving in many ways. 
pli-tv-kd15:36.1.2	They planted flowering trees, watered and plucked them, and then tied the flowers together. They made the flowers into garlands, garlands with stalks on one side and garlands with stalks on both sides. They made flower arrangements, wreaths, ornaments for the head, ornaments for the ears, and ornaments for the chest. And they had others do the same. 
pli-tv-kd15:36.1.3	They then took these things, or sent them, to the women, the daughters, the girls, the daughters-in-law, and the female slaves of good families. 
pli-tv-kd15:36.1.4	They ate from the same plates as these women and drank from the same vessels. They sat on the same seats as them, and they lay down on the same beds, on the same sheets, under the same covers, and both on the same sheets and under the same covers. They ate at the wrong time, drank alcohol, and wore garlands, perfumes, and cosmetics. They danced, sang, played instruments, and performed. 
pli-tv-kd15:36.1.5	While the women were dancing, singing, playing instruments, and performing, 
pli-tv-kd15:36.1.6	so would they. 
pli-tv-kd15:36.1.7	They played various games: eight-row checkers, ten-row checkers, imaginary checkers, hopscotch, spillikins, dice, tip-cat, painting with the hand, ball games, leaf flutes, toy plows, somersaults, toy windmills, toy measures, toy carriages, toy bows, letter guessing, thought guessing, mimicking deformities. 
pli-tv-kd15:36.1.8	They trained in elephant riding, in horsemanship, in carriage riding, in archery, 
pli-tv-kd15:36.1.9	in swordsmanship. 
pli-tv-kd15:36.1.10	And they ran in front of elephants, horses, and carriages, and they ran backwards and forwards. 
pli-tv-kd15:36.1.11	They whistled, clapped their hands, wrestled, and boxed. 
pli-tv-kd15:36.1.12	They spread their outer robes on a stage and said to the dancing girls, 
pli-tv-kd15:36.1.13	“Dance here, Sister,” 
pli-tv-kd15:36.1.14	and they made gestures of approval. 
pli-tv-kd15:36.1.15	And they engaged in many kinds of misbehavior. 
pli-tv-kd15:36.1.16	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:36.1.17	“You should not engage in various kinds of misbehavior 
pli-tv-kd15:36.1.18	If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule.” 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.1	At the time of Venerable Uruvelakassapa’s going forth, the Sangha was given a large number of iron goods, wooden goods, and ceramic goods. 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.2	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.3	“Which iron, 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.4	wooden, 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.5	and ceramic goods have been allowed by the Buddha, and which not?” 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.6	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.7	The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.8	“I allow all iron goods except weapons; all wooden goods except high couches, luxurious couches, wooden almsbowls, and wooden shoes; and all ceramic goods except ceramic foot-scrubbers and clay huts.” 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.9	The fifth chapter with short topics is finished. 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.201	The details of the topics, 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.202	If taken altogether with the previous, 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.203	Is also found in brief in the summary verses, 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.204	For the purpose of guiding those who have understood it. 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.205	Thus there are one hundred and ten topics 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.206	In the Chapter on short topics in the Monastic Law. 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.207	Indeed, the true Teaching will be long lived, 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.208	And good people will be supported. 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.209	A well-trained expert in the Monastic Law, 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.210	A good person intent on what’s beneficial, 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.211	A wise one, lighting a lamp—
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.212	This is a learned one worthy of homage. 
pli-tv-kd15:37.1.213	The chapter with short topics is finished.
pli-tv-kd16:0.1	Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law 
pli-tv-kd16:0.2	The Short Division 
pli-tv-kd16:0.3	The chapter on dwellings 
pli-tv-kd16:0.4	1.1 The allowance for dwellings 
pli-tv-kd16:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.1.2	At this time the Buddha had not yet allowed dwellings. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.1.3	And the monks stayed here and there: 
pli-tv-kd16:1.1.4	in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, on a hill, in a gorge, in a hillside cave, in a charnel ground, in the forest, in the open, on a heap of straw. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.1.5	Early in the morning, they would emerge from those places. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.1.6	And they were pleasing in their conduct: in going out and coming back, in looking ahead and looking aside, in bending and stretching their arms. Their eyes were lowered, and they were perfect in deportment. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.2.1	One morning a wealthy merchant of Rājagaha was going to a park 
pli-tv-kd16:1.2.2	when he saw those monks. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.2.4	Being inspired, 
pli-tv-kd16:1.2.5	he approached them and said, 
pli-tv-kd16:1.2.6	“Venerables, if I build dwellings, would you stay there?” 
pli-tv-kd16:1.2.7	“The Buddha hasn’t allowed dwellings.” 
pli-tv-kd16:1.2.8	“Well then, please ask the Buddha and let me know his response.” 
pli-tv-kd16:1.2.9	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd16:1.2.10	Those monks then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd16:1.2.11	and said, 
pli-tv-kd16:1.2.12	“Venerable Sir, a wealthy merchant of Rājagaha wants to build dwellings. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.2.13	What should we do?” 
pli-tv-kd16:1.2.14	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd16:1.2.15	“I allow five kinds of shelters: 
pli-tv-kd16:1.2.16	dwellings, three kinds of stilt houses, and caves.” 
pli-tv-kd16:1.3.1	The monks went to that merchant and said, 
pli-tv-kd16:1.3.2	“The Buddha has allowed dwellings. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.3.3	Please do whatever you think is appropriate.” 
pli-tv-kd16:1.3.4	Then, on a single day, that merchant built sixty dwellings. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.3.5	When the dwellings were finished, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd16:1.3.6	and said, 
pli-tv-kd16:1.3.7	“Venerable Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me, together with the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd16:1.3.8	The Buddha consented by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.3.9	Knowing that the Buddha had consented, he got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.4.1	The next morning he had various kinds of fine food prepared and then had the Buddha informed 
pli-tv-kd16:1.4.2	that the meal was ready. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.4.3	After robing up, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to the house of that merchant, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.4.4	That merchant personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal and had washed his hands and bowl, the merchant sat down to one side 
pli-tv-kd16:1.4.5	and said, 
pli-tv-kd16:1.4.6	“Sir, I’ve had these sixty dwellings built to make merit and for the purpose of going to heaven. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.4.7	What should I do now?” 
pli-tv-kd16:1.4.8	“Well then, give those sixty dwellings to the Sangha everywhere, both present and future.” 
pli-tv-kd16:1.4.9	Saying, “Yes,” he did just that. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.1	The Buddha then expressed his appreciation to the merchant with these verses: 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.2	“Cold and heat are kept away, 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.3	And predatory animals too, 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.4	And creeping animals and mosquitoes, 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.5	And also chill and rain. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.6	It keeps away the wind and burning sun, 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.7	When those awful things arise. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.8	It’s for the sake of shelter and happiness, 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.9	To attain absorption and to see clearly. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.10	Giving dwellings to the Sangha 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.11	Is praised as the best by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.12	Therefore the wise man, 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.13	Seeing what is beneficial for himself, 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.14	Should build delightful dwellings 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.15	And have the learned stay there. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.16	Food, drink, robes, and dwellings—
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.17	With an inspired mind, 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.18	He should give to them, 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.19	The upright ones. 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.20	They will give him the Teaching 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.21	For removing all suffering; 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.22	And understanding this Teaching in this life, 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.23	He attains extinguishment, free of corruptions.” 
pli-tv-kd16:1.5.24	The Buddha then got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-kd16:2.1.1	Hearing that the Buddha had allowed dwellings, 
pli-tv-kd16:2.1.2	people had dwellings built with care. 
pli-tv-kd16:2.1.3	But because the dwellings did not have doors, 
pli-tv-kd16:2.1.4	snakes, scorpions, and centipedes came inside. 
pli-tv-kd16:2.1.5	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd16:2.1.6	“I allow doors.” 
pli-tv-kd16:2.1.7	They made a hole in the wall and bound the doors with creepers and ropes. 
pli-tv-kd16:2.1.8	Rats and termites ate the creepers and ropes, 
pli-tv-kd16:2.1.9	and the doors fell off. 
pli-tv-kd16:2.1.11	“I allow door frames, and lower and upper hinges.” 
pli-tv-kd16:2.1.12	The doors did not touch the door frames.

pli-tv-kd16:3.10.12	The monasteries were muddy. 
pli-tv-kd16:3.10.13	“I allow you to cover them with gravel.” 
pli-tv-kd16:3.10.14	They were unable to do it. 
pli-tv-kd16:3.10.15	“I allow you to lay down paving stones.” 
pli-tv-kd16:3.10.16	The water remained. 
pli-tv-kd16:3.10.17	“I allow water drains.” 
pli-tv-kd16:3.11.1	On one occasion King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha wanted to build a stilt house smeared with clay plaster for the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd16:3.11.2	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd16:3.11.3	“Which roofing materials have been allowed by the Buddha and which have not?” 
pli-tv-kd16:3.11.5	“I allow five kinds of roofing materials: 
pli-tv-kd16:3.11.6	tiles, slate, plaster, grass, and leaves.” 
pli-tv-kd16:3.11.7	The first section for recitation is finished. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.1.0	2.1 The account of Anāthapiṇḍika 
pli-tv-kd16:4.1.1	The householder Anāthapiṇḍika was the brother in law of a wealthy merchant in Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.1.2	On one occasion when Anāthapiṇḍika went to Rājagaha on business, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.1.3	that merchant had invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha for the meal on the following day. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.1.4	The merchant was telling his slaves and workers 
pli-tv-kd16:4.1.5	to get up early to cook rice porridge and rice, and to prepare various kinds of curry. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.1.6	Anāthapiṇḍika thought, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.1.7	“When I’ve arrived before, this householder put down all his business to greet me. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.1.8	But this time he’s all over the place, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.1.9	telling his workers what to do. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.1.10	Is he preparing for a marriage or a great sacrifice, or has he invited King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha together with the army for a meal tomorrow?” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.2.1	When the merchant was finished with telling his workers what to do, he went up to Anāthapiṇḍika, greeted him, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.2.2	Anāthapiṇḍika then told him what he had observed 
pli-tv-kd16:4.2.6	and asked him what was happening. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.2.7	The merchant replied, “I’m not preparing for a marriage, nor have I invited King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha together with the army. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.2.8	But I’m preparing for a great sacrifice. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.2.9	I have invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha for a meal tomorrow.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.2.10	“Did you say, ‘Buddha’?” —
pli-tv-kd16:4.2.11	“I did.” —
pli-tv-kd16:4.2.12	“Did you say, ‘Buddha’?” —
pli-tv-kd16:4.2.13	“I did.” —
pli-tv-kd16:4.2.14	“Did you say, ‘Buddha’?” —
pli-tv-kd16:4.2.15	“I did.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.2.16	“It’s rare in the world 
pli-tv-kd16:4.2.17	to hear the word ‘Buddha’. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.2.18	Is it possible at this time to go and visit that Buddha, that fully awakened and perfected one?” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.2.19	“Now is the wrong time to visit the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.2.20	Tomorrow will be the right time.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.2.21	Because he lay down thinking of the Buddha—
pli-tv-kd16:4.2.22	“Tomorrow I will go and visit that Buddha, that fully awakened and perfected one!”—
pli-tv-kd16:4.2.23	he got up three times during the night thinking it was light. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.3.1	Anāthapiṇḍika then went to the Sivaka gate, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.3.2	and the gate was opened by spirits. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.3.3	Then, as he was leaving town, the light disappeared and it was dark. He was paralyzed with fear, with goosebumps all over, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.3.4	and he wanted to turn back. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.3.5	Just then the invisible spirit Sivaka proclaimed: 
pli-tv-kd16:4.3.6	“A hundred elephants, a hundred horses, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.3.7	A hundred carriages drawn by mules, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.3.8	A hundred thousand girls 
pli-tv-kd16:4.3.9	Wearing jeweled earrings 
pli-tv-kd16:4.3.10	Are not worth a sixteenth part 
pli-tv-kd16:4.3.11	Of a single step forward. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.3.12	Go forward, householder, go forward! 
pli-tv-kd16:4.3.13	Going forward is better for you than going back.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.3.14	The light returned, the darkness disappeared, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.3.15	and his fear subsided. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.3.16	A second 
pli-tv-kd16:4.3.17	and a third time 
pli-tv-kd16:4.3.18	the light disappeared and he was paralyzed with fear, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.3.19	upon which the spirit proclaimed the same verses. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.3.28	And on both occasions the light returned, the darkness disappeared, and his fear subsided. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.4.1	Anāthapiṇḍika then went to the Sītavana, the Cool Grove. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.4.2	Just then the Buddha was walking back and forth outside, having got up early in the morning. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.4.3	When the Buddha saw Anāthapiṇḍika coming, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.4.4	he came down from the walking-path, sat down on the prepared seat, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.4.5	and said, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.4.6	“Come, Sudatta.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.4.7	Anāthapiṇḍika thought, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.4.8	“The Buddha is addressing me by name!” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.4.9	and glad and joyful he went up to him, bowed down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.4.10	“Venerable Sir, I hope you have slept well.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.4.11	“Indeed, he always sleeps well, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.4.12	The brahmin who is extinguished, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.4.13	Who’s not soiled among worldly pleasures, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.4.14	But is cool and ownerless. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.4.15	After cutting all attachments, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.4.16	After removing distress from the heart, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.4.17	Calmed, he sleeps well, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.4.18	Having attained peace of mind.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.5.1	The Buddha then gave him a progressive teaching: 
pli-tv-kd16:4.5.2	talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.5.3	When the Buddha knew that his mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: 
pli-tv-kd16:4.5.4	suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.5.5	And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.5.6	so too, while he was sitting right there, Anāthapiṇḍika experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: 
pli-tv-kd16:4.5.7	“Anything that has a beginning has an end.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.5.8	He had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. He then said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.5.9	“Wonderful, Sir, wonderful! 
pli-tv-kd16:4.5.10	Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness 
pli-tv-kd16:4.5.11	so that one with eyes might see what’s there—
pli-tv-kd16:4.5.12	just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.5.13	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the Teaching, and to the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.5.14	Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.5.15	And please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.5.16	The Buddha consented by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.5.17	Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Anāthapiṇḍika got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.1	The merchant heard 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.2	that Anāthapiṇḍika had invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha for the meal on the following day. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.3	And he said to Anāthapiṇḍika, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.4	“You have invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.5	but you have just arrived here. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.6	I will give you the means to make a meal for them.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.7	“There’s no need. I have the necessary means.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.8	The householder association of Rājagaha heard 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.9	that Anāthapiṇḍika had invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha for a meal on the following day. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.10	And they said to Anāthapiṇḍika, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.11	“You have invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.12	but you have just arrived here. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.13	We’ll give you the means to make a meal for them.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.14	“There’s no need, sirs. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.15	I have the necessary means.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.16	King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha heard 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.17	that Anāthapiṇḍika had invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha for a meal on the following day. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.18	And he said to Anāthapiṇḍika, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.19	“You have invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.20	but you have just arrived here. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.21	I will give you the means to make a meal for them.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.22	“There’s no need, sir. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.6.23	I have the necessary means.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.7.1	The following morning, in that wealthy merchant’s house, Anāthapiṇḍika had various kinds of fine food prepared. He then had the Buddha informed 
pli-tv-kd16:4.7.2	that the meal was ready. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.7.3	The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to that merchant’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.7.4	Anāthapiṇḍika then personally served the various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal and had washed his hands and bowl, he sat down to one side 
pli-tv-kd16:4.7.5	and said, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.7.6	“Sir, please spend the rainy-season residence at Sāvatthī together with the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.7.7	“The Buddha delights in solitude, householder.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.7.8	“I understand, Sir, I understand!” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.7.9	Then, after instructing, inspiring, and gladdening him with a teaching, the Buddha got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.8.1	After finishing his business in Rājagaha, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.8.2	Anāthapiṇḍika set out for Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.8.3	Now at that time Anāthapiṇḍika had many friends and acquaintances who listened to him. On his way to Sāvatthī 
pli-tv-kd16:4.8.4	he told people to make monasteries, to build dwellings, and to prepare offerings: 
pli-tv-kd16:4.8.5	“There’s a Buddha in the world! 
pli-tv-kd16:4.8.6	He’s been invited by me and will be traveling this way.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.8.7	And those people did as Anāthapiṇḍika had urged them to do. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.8.8	After arriving at Sāvatthī, Anāthapiṇḍika searched all around town for a place for the Buddha to stay, thinking, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.8.9	“Where might the Buddha stay 
pli-tv-kd16:4.8.10	that’s neither too far from the village nor too close, that has good access roads, that’s easily accessible for people who seek him, that has few people during the day and is quiet at night, that’s free from chatter and offers solitude, that’s away from human habitation and suitable for seclusion?” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.9.1	Anāthapiṇḍika saw that Prince Jeta’s park 
pli-tv-kd16:4.9.2	had all these qualities. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.9.3	He then went to Prince Jeta and said, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.9.4	“Sir, give me your park to make a monastery.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.9.5	“I won’t give it even if you cover the park with ten million coins.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.9.6	“It’s a deal!” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.9.7	“No it isn’t.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.9.8	They then asked judges to decide on the matter. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.9.9	They said, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.9.10	“Sir, since you gave a price, the park is sold.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.9.11	Anāthapiṇḍika then had gold coins brought out in carts and covered the Jeta Grove with ten million coins. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.10.1	After one more load had been brought out, there was still a small area near the gateway that was not covered. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.10.2	Anāthapiṇḍika told his people, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.10.3	“Go and get more coins. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.10.4	We’ll cover this area too.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.10.5	But Prince Jeta thought, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.10.6	“It must be really worthwhile, seeing as he’s giving up so much money.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.10.7	And he said to Anāthapiṇḍika, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.10.8	“It’s enough; 
pli-tv-kd16:4.10.9	don’t cover that area. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.10.10	Let me keep that area. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.10.11	That will be my gift.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.10.12	Anāthapiṇḍika thought, 
pli-tv-kd16:4.10.13	“Prince Jeta is a well-known person. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.10.14	It’s very beneficial that such well-known people gain confidence in this spiritual path.” 
pli-tv-kd16:4.10.15	And he granted that area to Prince Jeta. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.10.16	Prince Jeta then had a gateway built at that place. 
pli-tv-kd16:4.10.17	Anāthapiṇḍika had dwellings build in the Jeta Grove, and precincts, gateways, assembly halls, water-boiling sheds, food-storage huts, restrooms, walking-paths, indoor walking-paths, wells, well houses, saunas, sauna sheds, ponds, and roof-covers. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.1.0	2.2 Putting in charge of building work 
pli-tv-kd16:5.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Vesālī. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.1.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd16:5.1.3	he stayed, in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.1.4	At that time people were doing careful building work. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.1.5	And the monks who supervised the building work were respectfully supported with robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.1.6	Then a certain poor tailor thought, 
pli-tv-kd16:5.1.7	“It must be really worthwhile, seeing as these people do such careful building work. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.1.8	Why donʼt I too do building work?” 
pli-tv-kd16:5.1.9	He then made a mixture of mud, made bricks out of it, and built a wall. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.1.10	But because of his lack of skill, the wall was not straight and it fell down. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.1.11	A second 
pli-tv-kd16:5.1.12	and a third time the same thing happened. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.2.1	He then complained and criticized the monks, 
pli-tv-kd16:5.2.2	“These Sakyan monastics teach and instruct only those who give them robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines. They only supervise their building work. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.2.3	But since I’m poor, 
pli-tv-kd16:5.2.4	nobody teaches, instructs, or supervises me.” 
pli-tv-kd16:5.2.5	The monks heard the complaints of that poor tailor. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.2.6	They informed the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd16:5.2.7	who gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd16:5.2.8	“You should put a monk in charge of the building work. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.2.9	The monk in charge of building work should make an effort 
pli-tv-kd16:5.2.10	to complete the dwellings as quickly as possible, 
pli-tv-kd16:5.2.11	and he should repair what is broken or damaged. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.3.1	And he is to be put in charge like this. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.3.2	First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd16:5.3.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.3.4	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should put monk so-and-so in charge of the building work relating to the dwelling of householder so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.3.5	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.3.6	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.3.7	The Sangha puts monk so-and-so in charge of the building work relating to the dwelling of householder so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.3.8	Any monk who approves of putting monk so-and-so in charge of that building work should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.3.9	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.3.10	The Sangha has put monk so-and-so in charge of the building work relating to the dwelling of householder so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd16:5.3.11	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.1.0	2.3 The instruction on the best seat, etc. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Vesālī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.1.2	On that occasion the monks who were the pupils of the monks from the group of six went ahead of the Sangha headed by the Buddha and took possession of dwellings and beds, thinking, 
pli-tv-kd16:6.1.3	“This will be for our preceptors and teachers, and also for ourselves.” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.1.4	Venerable Sāriputta followed behind the Sangha. Being unable to get a bed—the dwellings and beds having all been taken—he sat down at the foot of a tree. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.1.5	After getting up early in the morning, the Buddha cleared his throat. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.1.6	Sāriputta, too, cleared his throat. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.1.7	“Who is there?” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.1.8	“It’s me, Venerable Sir, Sāriputta.” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.1.9	“Why are you sitting here?” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.1.10	Sāriputta told the Buddha what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.2	“Is it true, monks, that the monks who are the pupils of the monks from the group of six did this?” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.4	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.5	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.6	“How can they act like this? 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.8	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.9	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.10	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.11	“Monks, who deserves the best seat, the best water, and the best almsfood?” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.12	Some monks said, 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.13	“Those who have gone forth from an aristocratic family deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.14	Others said, 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.15	“Those who have gone forth from a brahmin family deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.16	Still others said, 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.17	“Those who have gone forth from a householder family deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.19	Or, “The experts on the discourses deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.21	Or, “The experts on the Monastic Law deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.23	Or, “The expounders of the Teaching deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.25	Or, “Those who obtain the first absorption deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.27	Or, “Those who obtain the second absorption deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.29	Or, “Those who obtain the third absorption deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.31	Or, “Those who obtain the fourth absorption deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.33	Or, “The stream-enterers deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.35	Or, “The once-returners deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.36	Or, “The nonreturners deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.37	Or, “The perfected ones deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.39	Or, “Those who have attained the three true insights deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.2.41	Or, “Those who have attained the six direct knowledges deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.1	The Buddha then addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.2.0	Jataka 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.2.1	“Once upon a time, monks, there was a great banyan tree on the slope of the Himalayas. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.3	Three friends lived near it: 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.4	a partridge, a monkey, and an elephant. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.5	They were disrespectful, undeferential, and rude toward one another. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.6	They thought, 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.7	‘If only we knew which one of us was the oldest. We would honor, respect, and esteem him, and we would wait for his instructions.’ 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.8	The partridge and the monkey then asked the elephant, 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.9	‘What’s your first memory?’ 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.10	‘When I was a young, I stepped over this banyan tree, keeping it between my thighs, and the top shoots touched my belly. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.11	That’s my first memory.’ 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.12	The partridge and the elephant asked the monkey, 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.13	‘What’s your first memory?’ 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.14	‘When I was a young, I sat on the ground and ate the top shoots of the banyan tree. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.15	That’s my first memory.’ 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.16	The monkey and the elephant asked the partridge, 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.17	‘What’s your first memory?’ 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.18	‘In such and such a spot there was a great banyan tree. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.19	I ate one of its fruits and defecated here. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.20	This banyan tree has grown from that. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.21	Well then, I must be the oldest one.’ 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.22	The monkey and the elephant said to the partridge, 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.23	‘You’re the oldest of us. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.24	We will honor, respect, and esteem you, and we’ll wait for your instructions.’ 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.25	The partridge had the monkey and the elephant take the five precepts, and he also undertook them himself. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.26	They were respectful, deferential, and courteous toward one another. And when they died, they were reborn in a happy, heavenly destination. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.27	In this way the spiritual life called _tittiriya_ came to be. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.28	Those who respect the seniors, 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.29	And who are learned in the Teaching, 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.30	They are praised while still alive, 
pli-tv-kd16:6.3.31	And then go to a good destination. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.4.1	“Even those animals, monks, were respectful, deferential, and courteous toward one another. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.4.2	Having gone forth on this well-proclaimed spiritual path, will you look good if you are disrespectful, undeferential, and rude toward one another? 
pli-tv-kd16:6.4.3	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.4.4	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd16:6.4.5	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd16:6.4.6	“You should do these things according to seniority: bowing down, standing up, raising your joined palms, doing acts of respect, giving the best seat, giving the best water, and giving the best almsfood. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.4.7	But what belongs to the Sangha should not be reserved according to seniority. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.4.8	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd16:6.5.0	2.4 Persons one should not pay respect to, etc. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.5.1	“Monks, you should not pay respect to these ten kinds of persons: 
pli-tv-kd16:6.5.2	one who has been given the full ordination after you; one who isn’t fully ordained; one who belongs to a different Buddhist sect who is senior to you, but who speaks contrary to the Teaching; a woman; a _paṇḍaka_; one who is on probation; one who deserves to be sent back to the beginning; one who deserves to be given the trial period; one who is undertaking the trial period; or one who deserves rehabilitation. 
pli-tv-kd16:6.5.4	You should pay respect to these three kinds of persons: 
pli-tv-kd16:6.5.5	one who has been given the full ordination before you; one who belongs to a different Buddhist sect who is senior to you and who speaks in accordance with the Teaching; and in this world with its gods, lords of death, and supreme beings, in this society with its monastics and brahmins, its gods and humans, you should pay respect to the Buddha, perfected and fully awakened.” 
pli-tv-kd16:7.0	2.5 The prohibition against reserving seats 
pli-tv-kd16:7.1	At that time people prepared roof-covers, mats, and places to stay for the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd16:7.2	The monks who were the pupils of the monks from the group of six, thought, 
pli-tv-kd16:7.3	“The Buddha has instructed that what belongs to the Sangha should not be reserved according to seniority. But he’s given no such instruction about what has merely been prepared for the Sangha.” They then went ahead of the Sangha headed by the Buddha and took possession of roof-covers, mats, and places to stay, thinking, 
pli-tv-kd16:7.4	“This will be for our preceptors and teachers, and also for ourselves.” 
pli-tv-kd16:7.5	Venerable Sāriputta followed behind the Sangha. Being unable to get a place to stay—the roof-covers, the mats, and the places to stay having all been taken—he sat down at the foot of a tree. 
pli-tv-kd16:7.6	After getting up early in the morning, the Buddha cleared his throat. 
pli-tv-kd16:7.7	Sāriputta, too, cleared his throat. 
pli-tv-kd16:7.8	“Who is there?” 
pli-tv-kd16:7.9	“It’s me, Venerable Sir, Sāriputta.” 
pli-tv-kd16:7.10	“Why are you sitting here?” 
pli-tv-kd16:7.11	Sāriputta told the Buddha what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd16:7.12	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd16:7.13	“Is it true, monks, that the monks who are the pupils of the monks from the group of six did this?” 
pli-tv-kd16:7.16	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd16:7.17	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd16:7.18	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd16:7.19	“Even what has merely been prepared for the Sangha should not be reserved according to seniority. 
pli-tv-kd16:7.20	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd16:8.0	2.6 The allowance for what belongs to a householder 
pli-tv-kd16:8.1	At that time people prepared high and luxurious resting places in the dining halls in inhabited areas, that is: 
pli-tv-kd16:8.2	a high couch, a luxurious couch, a long-fleeced woolen rug, a multi-colored woolen rug, a white woolen rug, a red woolen rug, a cotton-down quilt, a woolen rug decorated with the images of predatory animals, a woolen rug with long fleece on one side, a woolen rug with long fleece on both sides, a sheet of silk embroidered with gems, a silken sheet, a woolen rug like a dancers’ rug, an elephant-back rug, a horse-back rug, a carriage-seat rug, a rug made of black antelope hide, an excellent rug made of _kadalī_-deer hide, a seat with a canopy, a seat with red cushions at each end. 
pli-tv-kd16:8.3	Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not sit on them. 
pli-tv-kd16:8.4	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd16:8.5	“Apart from
pli-tv-kd16:8.6	the high couch, the luxurious couch, and the cotton-down quilt, 
pli-tv-kd16:8.7	I allow you to sit down on what belongs to householders, but not to lie down on it.” 
pli-tv-kd16:8.8	At that time people prepared beds and benches upholstered with cotton down in the dining halls in inhabited areas. 
pli-tv-kd16:8.9	Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not sit on them. 
pli-tv-kd16:8.10	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd16:8.11	“I allow you to sit down on what belongs to householders, but not to lie down on it.” 
pli-tv-kd16:9.0	2.7 The expression of appreciation for the Jeta Grove dwellings 
pli-tv-kd16:9.1.1	Wandering on, the Buddha eventually arrived at Sāvatthī, 
pli-tv-kd16:9.1.2	where he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
pli-tv-kd16:9.1.3	Anāthapiṇḍika then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd16:9.1.4	and said, 
pli-tv-kd16:9.1.5	“Venerable Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd16:9.1.6	The Buddha consented by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-kd16:9.1.7	Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Anāthapiṇḍika got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd16:9.1.8	The following morning Anāthapiṇḍika had various kinds of fine food prepared. He then had the Buddha informed 
pli-tv-kd16:9.1.9	that the meal was ready. 
pli-tv-kd16:9.1.10	The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to Anāthapiṇḍika’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd16:9.1.11	Anāthapiṇḍika then personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal and had washed his hands and bowl, Anāthapiṇḍika sat down to one side 
pli-tv-kd16:9.1.12	and said, 
pli-tv-kd16:9.1.13	“Sir, what should I do in regard to the Jeta Grove?” 
pli-tv-kd16:9.1.14	“You should dedicate the Jeta Grove to the Sangha everywhere, present and future.” 
pli-tv-kd16:9.1.15	“Yes.” And he did just that. 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.1	The Buddha then expressed his appreciation with these verses: 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.2	“Cold and heat are kept away, 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.3	And predatory animals too, 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.4	And creeping animals and mosquitoes, 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.5	And also chill and rain. 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.6	It keeps away the burning wind, 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.7	That terrible thing that comes. 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.8	It’s for the sake of shelter and happiness, 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.9	To attain absorption and to see clearly. 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.10	Giving dwellings to the Sangha 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.11	Is praised as the best by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.12	Therefore the wise man, 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.13	Seeing what is beneficial for himself, 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.14	Should build delightful dwellings 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.15	And have the learned stay there. 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.16	Food, drink, cloth, and dwellings—
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.17	With an inspired mind, 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.18	He should give to them, 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.19	The upright ones. 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.20	They will give him the Teaching 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.21	For removing all suffering; 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.22	And understanding this Teaching in this very life, 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.23	He attains extinguishment, free of corruptions.” 
pli-tv-kd16:9.2.24	The Buddha then got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.0	2.8 Reservation of seats, etc. 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.1	On one occasion a certain government official who was an Ājīvaka disciple was offering a meal to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.2	Arriving late, Venerable Upananda the Sakyan made the nearest monk get up before he had finished his meal. 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.3	There was an uproar in the dining hall. 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.4	The official complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.5	“How can the Sakyan monastics arrive late and make the nearest monk get up in the middle of his meal? 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.6	There was an uproar in the dining hall. 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.7	It’s impossible to eat as much as you like when you’re not seated.” 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.8	The monks heard the complaints of the official, 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.9	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.10	“How could Upananda act like this?” 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.12	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.13	“Is it true, Upananda, that you acted like this?” 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.14	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.15	The Buddha rebuked him … 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.16	“Foolish man, how can you act like this? 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.18	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.19	after rebuking him … 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.20	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.21	“You should not make a monk get up who hasn’t finished his meal. 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.22	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.23	If you’re asked to get up, and you have already refused an invitation to eat more, you should say, “Please, go and get some water.” 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.24	If the other goes, all is well. 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.25	If not, you should properly swallow the mouthful and give the seat to the more senior monk. 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.26	Under no circumstances should you block a more senior monk from a seat. 
pli-tv-kd16:10.1.27	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd16:10.2.1	On one occasion the monks from the group of six asked the sick monks to get up. 
pli-tv-kd16:10.2.2	The sick monks said, 
pli-tv-kd16:10.2.3	“We’re not able to get up; we’re sick.” 
pli-tv-kd16:10.2.4	Saying, “We’ll make the venerables get up,” they took hold of them, lifted them up, and then released them when they were standing. 
pli-tv-kd16:10.2.5	The sick monks fainted and collapsed. 
pli-tv-kd16:10.2.7	“You should not make the sick get up. 
pli-tv-kd16:10.2.8	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd16:10.2.9	The monks from the group of six took possession of the best beds, saying, 
pli-tv-kd16:10.2.10	“We’re sick and no one can make us get up.” 
pli-tv-kd16:10.2.12	“You should give suitable beds to those who are sick.” 
pli-tv-kd16:10.2.13	The monks from the group of six used a pretext to reserve resting places. 
pli-tv-kd16:10.2.15	“You should not use a pretext to reserve a resting place. 
pli-tv-kd16:10.2.16	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.1	At that time the monks from the group of seventeen were repairing a large dwelling nearby, 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.2	intending to stay there for the rainy season. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.3	The monks from the group of six saw this 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.4	and said, 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.5	“These monks from the group of seventeen are repairing a dwelling. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.6	Let’s throw them out.” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.7	But some of them said, 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.8	“Let’s wait until they’ve finished repairing it.” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.9	Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six said to those from the group of seventeen, 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.10	“Leave, this dwelling is ours.” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.11	“Shouldn’t you have told us beforehand? 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.12	We would have repaired another one.” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.13	“Doesn’t this dwelling belong to the Sangha?” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.14	“Yes it does.” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.15	“Well then, leave; this dwelling is ours.” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.16	“The dwelling is large. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.17	You can stay here and so can we.” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.18	But they said, “Leave, this dwelling is ours,” and they grabbed them by the neck and threw them out in anger. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.19	The monks from the group of seventeen cried. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.20	When other monks asked them why, 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.22	they told them what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.23	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.24	“How can the monks from the group of six angrily throw other monks out of a dwelling belonging to the Sangha?” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.25	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.26	“Is it true, monks, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.27	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.28	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.29	and after giving a teaching, he addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.30	“You should not, in anger, throw a monk out of a dwelling belonging to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.31	If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.1.32	You should allocate the dwellings.” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.2.0	2.9 The appointment of allocators of dwellings 
pli-tv-kd16:11.2.1	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd16:11.2.2	“Who should allocate the dwellings?” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.2.3	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd16:11.2.4	“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the allocator of dwellings: 
pli-tv-kd16:11.2.5	he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows which dwellings have and have not been allocated. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.2.6	And he should be appointed like this. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.2.7	First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd16:11.2.8	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.2.9	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint monk so-and-so as allocator of dwellings. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.2.10	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.2.11	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.2.12	The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as allocator of dwellings. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.2.13	Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as allocator of dwellings should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.2.14	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.2.15	The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as allocator of dwellings. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.2.16	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.3.1	The allocators of dwellings thought, 
pli-tv-kd16:11.3.2	“How should we allocate the dwellings?” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.3.3	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.3.4	“First you should count the monks and the beds. You should then allocate one monk to each bed.” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.3.5	When they were allocating the beds, there were beds left over. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.3.6	“You should allocate one monk to each dwelling.” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.3.7	When they were allocating the dwellings, there were dwellings left over. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.3.8	“You should allocate one monk to the precincts of each dwelling.” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.3.9	When they were allocating the precincts, there were precincts left over. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.3.10	“You should give out additional shares. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.3.11	If another monk arrives after the additional shares have been allocated, then if you’re unwilling, you need not give him a share.” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.3.12	On one occasion the monks allocated a dwelling to one who was outside the monastic boundary. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.3.14	“You should not allocate a dwelling to one outside the monastic boundary. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.3.15	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.3.16	At that time, after accepting a dwelling, the monks reserved it at all times. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.3.18	“After you have accepted a dwelling, you should not reserve it at all times. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.3.19	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.3.20	I allow you to reserve it for the three months of the rainy-season residence, but not at other times.” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.4.1	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd16:11.4.2	“How many times are there for the allocation of dwellings?” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.4.4	“There are three times for the allocation of dwellings: 
pli-tv-kd16:11.4.5	the first, the second, and when given up in between. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.4.6	The first allocation is on the day after the full moon of July. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.4.7	The second allocation is one month after the full moon of July. 
pli-tv-kd16:11.4.8	The allocation of what is given up in between the two is on the day after the invitation procedure and is for the purpose of spending the next rains residence.” 
pli-tv-kd16:11.4.10	The second section for recitation is finished. 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.1	On one occasion Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had accepted a dwelling at Sāvatthī, but then went to a certain village monastery, 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.2	where he was also allocated a dwelling. 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.3	The monks there thought, 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.4	“This Upananda is quarrelsome and argumentative, and creates legal issues in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.5	If he spends the rainy season here, none of us will be at ease. 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.6	Well, let’s question him.” 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.7	And they said to Upananda, 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.8	“Have you not been allocated a dwelling at Sāvatthī? ” 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.9	“Yes, I have.” 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.10	“But being only one person, why do you reserve two dwellings?” 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.11	“I will give up this one 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.12	and take the one at Sāvatthī.” 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.13	The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.14	“How could Upananda reserve two dwellings for himself?” 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.15	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Upananda: 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.16	“Is it true, Upananda, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.17	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.18	The Buddha rebuked him … 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.19	“Foolish man, how can you reserve two dwellings for yourself? 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.20	What you had been allocated at Sāvatthī, you gave up when you were allocated a dwelling here. And what you have been allocated here, you have now given up. 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.21	You’re now excluded from both. 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.22	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.23	after rebuking him … 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.24	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.25	“A single monk should not reserve two dwellings. 
pli-tv-kd16:12.1.26	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd16:13.1.1	At one time the Buddha gave many talks about the Monastic Law, spoke in praise of the Monastic Law and of learning the Monastic Law, and he repeatedly praised Venerable Upāli. 
pli-tv-kd16:13.1.2	When the monks 
pli-tv-kd16:13.1.3	heard this, they thought, 
pli-tv-kd16:13.1.4	“Well then, let’s learn the Monastic Law from Venerable Upāli.” 
pli-tv-kd16:13.1.5	And many monks, both senior and junior, as well as those of middle standing, learned the Monastic Law from Upāli. 
pli-tv-kd16:13.1.6	Out of respect for the senior monks, Upāli taught while standing. 
pli-tv-kd16:13.1.7	And out of respect for the Teaching, the senior monks, too, were standing. 
pli-tv-kd16:13.1.8	Both the senior monks and Upāli became tired. 
pli-tv-kd16:13.1.9	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd16:13.1.10	“A junior monk who is teaching should sit on a similar or higher seat out of respect for the Teaching. 
pli-tv-kd16:13.1.11	A senior monk who is being taught should sit on a similar or lower seat out of respect for the Teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd16:13.2.1	On one occasion many monks were standing in the presence of Upāli, honoring the recitation. They became tired. 
pli-tv-kd16:13.2.3	“I allow those who are entitled to a seat of the same height to sit together.” 
pli-tv-kd16:13.2.4	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd16:13.2.5	“Who are entitled to a seat of the same height?” 
pli-tv-kd16:13.2.7	“I allow those with a difference of three years or less in seniority to sit together.” 
pli-tv-kd16:13.2.8	On one occasion a number of monks entitled to a seat of the same height were seated on a bed; the bed broke. They were seated on the same bench; the bench broke. 
pli-tv-kd16:13.2.10	“I allow a maximum of three on a bed or bench.” 
pli-tv-kd16:13.2.11	The beds and benches still broke. 
pli-tv-kd16:13.2.12	“I allow a maximum of two on a bed or bench.” 
pli-tv-kd16:13.2.13	At that time, being afraid of wrongdoing, monks who were not entitled to a seat of the same height did not sit together on a long seat. 
pli-tv-kd16:13.2.15	“I allow those who are not entitled to a seat of the same height to sit together on a long seat, except with a _paṇḍaka_, a woman, or a hermaphrodite.” 
pli-tv-kd16:13.2.16	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd16:13.2.17	“What is the size of the smallest long seat?” 
pli-tv-kd16:13.2.19	“A seat for three is the smallest long seat.” 
pli-tv-kd16:14.1.1	At one time Visākhā Migāramātā wanted to build a stilt house for the benefit of the Sangha, including a porch and elephant globes. 
pli-tv-kd16:14.1.2	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd16:14.1.3	“What stilt-house equipment has the Buddha allowed and what has he not allowed?” 
pli-tv-kd16:14.1.4	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd16:14.1.5	“I allow all stilt-house equipment.” 
pli-tv-kd16:14.1.6	At one time King Pasenadi of Kosala’s grandmother had just died. 
pli-tv-kd16:14.1.7	As a result, many unallowable goods were given to the Sangha, that is: 
pli-tv-kd16:14.1.8	a high couch, a luxurious couch, a long-fleeced woolen rug, a multi-colored woolen rug, a white woolen rug, a red woolen rug, a cotton-down quilt, a woolen rug decorated with the images of predatory animals, a woolen rug with long fleece on one side, a woolen rug with long fleece on both side, a sheet of silk embroidered with gems, a silken sheet, a woolen rug like a dancers’ rug, an elephant-back rug, a horse-back rug, a carriage-seat rug, a rug made of black antelope hide, an excellent rug made of _kadalī_-deer hide, a seat or bed with a canopy, a seat or bed with red cushions at each end. 
pli-tv-kd16:14.1.10	“I allow you to use a high couch after cutting its legs down to size, to use a luxurious couch after removing the images of predatory animals, to make a pillow after removing the cotton down from the cotton-down quilt, and to make floor covers of the rest.” 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.0	3.1 What is not to be given away 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.1	At one time in a village monastery not far from Sāvatthī the resident monks were fed up with assigning dwellings for newly arrived and departing monks. 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.2	They considered this 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.4	and thought, “Well, let’s give all the dwellings belonging to the Sangha to one of us. 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.5	We’ll then use what belongs to him.” 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.6	And they did just that. 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.7	When newly arrived monks said to them, 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.8	“Please assign us a dwelling,” 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.9	they replied, “There are no dwellings belonging to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.10	They have all been given to one of us.” 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.11	“So you have given away the dwellings belonging to the Sangha?” 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.12	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.13	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.14	“How can monks give away dwellings belonging to the Sangha?” 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.15	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.16	“Is it true, monks, that they did this?” 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.17	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.18	The Buddha criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.19	“How can those foolish men give away dwellings belonging to the Sangha? 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.20	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.21	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd16:15.1.22	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd16:15.2.1	“There are five things not to be given away, either by a sangha, a group, or an individual. 
pli-tv-kd16:15.2.2	Even if given away, they are not actually given away. 
pli-tv-kd16:15.2.3	If you give any of them away, you commit a serious offense. 
pli-tv-kd16:15.2.4	What are the five? 
pli-tv-kd16:15.2.5	A monastery or the site of a monastery; 
pli-tv-kd16:15.2.9	A dwelling or the site of a dwelling; 
pli-tv-kd16:15.2.13	A bed, bench, mattress, or pillow; 
pli-tv-kd16:15.2.17	A metal pot, a metal jar, a metal bucket, a metal bowl, a adz, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, or a chisel; 
pli-tv-kd16:15.2.21	A creeper, bamboo, reed, grass, clay, wooden goods, or ceramic goods. 
pli-tv-kd16:15.2.25	These are the five things not to be given away, either by a sangha, a group, or an individual. 
pli-tv-kd16:15.2.26	Even if given away, they are not actually given away. 
pli-tv-kd16:15.2.27	If you give any of them away, you commit a serious offense.” 
pli-tv-kd16:16.1.0	3.2 What is not to be shared out 
pli-tv-kd16:16.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Sāvatthī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Kīṭāgiri with a large sangha of five hundred monks, including Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna. 
pli-tv-kd16:16.1.2	The monks Assaji and Punabbasuka heard about this and said, 
pli-tv-kd16:16.1.4	“Well, let’s share out all the dwellings belonging to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd16:16.1.5	Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna are in the grip of bad desires. 
pli-tv-kd16:16.1.6	We won’t assign dwellings to them.” And they shared out all the dwellings belonging to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd16:16.1.7	The Buddha eventually arrived at Kīṭāgiri. 
pli-tv-kd16:16.1.8	And he said to a group of monks, 
pli-tv-kd16:16.1.10	“Go to the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka and say, 
pli-tv-kd16:16.1.11	‘The Buddha is coming with a large sangha of five hundred monks, including Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna. 
pli-tv-kd16:16.1.12	Assign dwellings to the Buddha, to the Sangha of monks, and to Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna.’” 
pli-tv-kd16:16.1.13	Saying, “Yes, Sir,” they did just that. 
pli-tv-kd16:16.1.16	The monks Assaji and Punabbasuka replied, “There are no dwellings belonging to the Sangha; 
pli-tv-kd16:16.1.17	they have all been shared out by us. 
pli-tv-kd16:16.1.18	The Buddha is welcome 
pli-tv-kd16:16.1.19	and he may stay wherever he likes. 
pli-tv-kd16:16.1.20	But Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna are in the grip of bad desires. 
pli-tv-kd16:16.1.21	We won’t assign dwellings to them.” 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.1	“So you have shared out the dwellings belonging to the Sangha?” 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.2	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.3	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.4	“How can these monks share out dwellings belonging to the Sangha?” 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.5	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.6	“Is it true, monks, that they did this?” 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.7	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.8	The Buddha criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.9	“How can those foolish men share out the dwellings belonging to the Sangha? 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.10	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.11	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.12	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.13	“There are five things not to be shared out, either by a sangha, a group, or an individual. 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.14	Even if shared out, they are not actually shared out. 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.15	If you share out any of them, you commit a serious offense. 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.16	What are the five? 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.17	A monastery or the land of a monastery; 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.21	A dwelling or the land of a dwelling; 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.25	A bed, bench, mattress, or pillow; 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.29	A metal pot, a metal jar, a metal bucket, a metal bowl, a adz, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, or a chisel; 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.33	A creeper, bamboo, reed, grass, clay, wooden goods, or ceramic goods. 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.37	These are the five things not to be shared out, either by a sangha, a group, or an individual. 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.38	Even if shared out, they are not actually shared out. 
pli-tv-kd16:16.2.39	If you share out any of them, you commit a serious offense.” 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.0	3.3 Discussion on putting in charge of building work 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Kīṭāgiri for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Āḷavī. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.3	he stayed at Aggāḷava Shrine. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.4	At that time the monks of Āḷava put monks in charge of building work such as this: 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.5	the mere filling of gaps, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.6	the mere plastering of walls, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.7	the mere hanging of doors, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.8	the mere making of bolt-receiving posts, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.9	the mere making of windows, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.10	the mere application of white coloring, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.11	the mere application of black coloring, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.12	the mere treatment with red ocher, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.13	the mere covering with a roof, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.14	the mere fastening of a roof, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.15	the mere fixing of cornices, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.16	the mere repair of what is defective or broken, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.17	the mere plastering of a floor; 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.18	and they put monks in charge of building work for twenty years, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.19	for thirty years, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.20	for life; 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.21	and they put monks in charge of building work for life on finished dwellings. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.22	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.23	“How can the monks at Āḷavī put monks in charge of such kinds of work?” 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.41	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.42	“Is it true, monks, that they do this?” 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.43	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.44	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.45	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.46	“You should not put monks in charge of building work such as this: the mere filling of gaps, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.47	the mere plastering of walls, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.48	the mere hanging of doors, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.49	the mere making of bolt-receiving posts, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.50	the mere making of windows, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.51	the mere application of white coloring, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.52	the mere application of black coloring, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.53	the mere treatment with red ocher, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.54	the mere covering with a roof, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.55	the mere fastening of a roof, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.56	the mere fixing of cornices, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.57	the mere repair of what is defective or broken, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.58	or the mere plastering of a floor; 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.59	and you should not put monks in charge of building work for twenty years, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.60	for thirty years, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.61	for life, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.62	or put monks in charge of building work for life on finished dwellings. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.63	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.1.64	I allow you to put a monk in charge of building work that isn’t yet started or that’s partially complete. For a small dwelling, after inspecting the work, you may put a monk in charge of the building work for five or six years. For a small stilt house, after inspecting the work, you may put a monk in charge of the building work for seven or eight years. For a large dwelling or stilt house, after inspecting the work, you may put a monk in charge of the building work for ten or twelve years.” 
pli-tv-kd16:17.2.1	On one occasion the monks put one person in charge of building work on all the dwellings. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.2.3	“You should not put one person in charge of building work on all the dwellings. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.2.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd16:17.2.5	On one occasion the monks put one person in charge of building work on two dwellings. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.2.7	“You should not put one person in charge of building work on two dwellings. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.2.8	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd16:17.2.9	On one occasion the monks who had taken on building work had someone else stay in the dwelling. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.2.11	“When you have taken on building work, you should not have someone else stay in that dwelling. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.2.12	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd16:17.2.13	At one time monks who had taken on building work reserved what belonged to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.2.15	“When you have taken on building work, you should not reserve what belongs to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.2.16	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.2.17	I allow you to take one good bed.” 
pli-tv-kd16:17.2.18	On one occasion the monks put one who was outside the monastic boundary in charge of building work. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.2.20	“You should not put one who is outside the monastic boundary in charge of building work. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.2.21	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd16:17.2.22	At one time the monks who had taken on building work reserved a dwelling at all times. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.2.24	“When you have taken on building work, you should not reserve a dwelling at all times. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.2.25	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.2.26	I allow you to reserve it for the three months of the rainy-season residence, but not at other times.” 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.1	At that time monks who had taken on building work left, disrobed, died, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.2	admitted to being novice monks, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.3	admitted to having renounced the training, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.4	admitted to having committed the worst kind of offense, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.5	admitted to being insane, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.6	admitted to being deranged,

pli-tv-kd16:17.3.16	admitted to being a patricide, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.17	admitted to being a murderer of a perfected one, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.18	admitted to having raped a nun, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.19	admitted to having caused a schism in the Sangha, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.20	admitted to having caused the Buddha to bleed, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.21	admitted to being a hermaphrodite. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.22	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.23	“If a monk who has taken on building work departs, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.24	it should be given to another, with the thought, ‘What belongs to the Sangha should not be allowed to deteriorate.’

pli-tv-kd16:17.3.27	it should be given to another, with the thought, ‘What belongs to the Sangha should not be allowed to deteriorate.’ 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.28	If a monk who has taken on building work departs while it is still unfinished, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.29	it should be given to another, with the thought, ‘What belongs to the Sangha should not be allowed to deteriorate.’ 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.30	If a monk who has taken on building work disrobes while it is still unfinished … 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.31	admits to being a hermaphrodite while it is still unfinished, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.32	it should be given to another, with the thought, ‘What belongs to the Sangha should not be allowed to deteriorate.’ 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.33	If a monk who has taken on building work departs when it is finished, 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.34	then it is still for him. 
pli-tv-kd16:17.3.35	If a monk who has taken on building work disrobes when it is finished;

pli-tv-kd16:18.1.0	3.4 The prohibition against using requisites where they don’t belong, etc. 
pli-tv-kd16:18.1.1	At one time the monks used a certain lay follower’s furniture where it did not belong. 
pli-tv-kd16:18.1.2	That lay follower complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd16:18.1.3	“How can those venerables use the furniture where it doesn’t belong?” 
pli-tv-kd16:18.1.4	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd16:18.1.5	“You should not use furniture where it doesn’t belong. 
pli-tv-kd16:18.1.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd16:18.1.7	Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not take any equipment to the observance-day hall or to meetings, and they sat down on the bare ground. 
pli-tv-kd16:18.1.8	Their limbs and robes became dirty. 
pli-tv-kd16:18.1.10	“I allow you to borrow.” 
pli-tv-kd16:18.1.11	At that time a large dwelling belonging to the Sangha was decaying. 
pli-tv-kd16:18.1.12	Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not remove the furniture. 
pli-tv-kd16:18.1.14	“I allow you to move it for the purpose of protection.” 
pli-tv-kd16:19.1.1	On one occasion the Sangha was given a valuable, woolen furniture cloth. 
pli-tv-kd16:19.1.3	“I allow you to make a beneficial swap.” 
pli-tv-kd16:19.1.4	On one occasion the Sangha was given a valuable furniture cloth. 
pli-tv-kd16:19.1.6	“I allow you to make a beneficial swap.” 
pli-tv-kd16:19.1.7	On one occasion the Sangha was given a bear skin. 
pli-tv-kd16:19.1.9	“I allow you to make it into a doormat.” 
pli-tv-kd16:19.1.10	On one occasion the Sangha was given a round pad. 
pli-tv-kd16:19.1.12	“I allow you to make it into a doormat.” 
pli-tv-kd16:19.1.13	On one occasion the Sangha was given a cloth. 
pli-tv-kd16:19.1.15	“I allow you to make it into a doormat.” 
pli-tv-kd16:20.1.1	At that time the monks entered the dwellings with dirty feet. 
pli-tv-kd16:20.1.2	The dwellings became dirty. 
pli-tv-kd16:20.1.4	“You should not enter a dwelling with dirty feet. 
pli-tv-kd16:20.1.5	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd16:20.1.6	At that time the monks entered the dwellings with wet feet. 
pli-tv-kd16:20.1.7	The dwellings became dirty. 
pli-tv-kd16:20.1.9	“You should not enter a dwelling with wet feet. 
pli-tv-kd16:20.1.10	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd16:20.1.11	At that time the monks entered the dwellings with their sandals on. 
pli-tv-kd16:20.1.12	The dwellings became dirty. 
pli-tv-kd16:20.1.14	“You should not enter a dwelling with your sandals on. 
pli-tv-kd16:20.1.15	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd16:20.2.1	At that time the monks spat on treated floors. 
pli-tv-kd16:20.2.2	The coloring was spoiled. 
pli-tv-kd16:20.2.4	“You should not spit on treated floors. 
pli-tv-kd16:20.2.5	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd16:20.2.6	I allow a spittoon.” 
pli-tv-kd16:20.2.7	At that time the legs of the beds and benches scratched the treated floors. The coloring was spoiled. 
pli-tv-kd16:20.2.9	“You should wrap the legs in cloth.” 
pli-tv-kd16:20.2.10	At that time the monks were leaning on treated walls. 
pli-tv-kd16:20.2.11	The coloring was spoiled. 
pli-tv-kd16:20.2.13	“You should not lean on treated walls. 
pli-tv-kd16:20.2.14	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd16:20.2.15	I allow a leaning board.” 
pli-tv-kd16:20.2.16	The lower edge of the leaning boards scratched the floor and the upper edge the wall. 
pli-tv-kd16:20.2.18	“You should wrap the lower and upper edges in cloth.” 
pli-tv-kd16:20.2.19	Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not lie down with washed feet. 
pli-tv-kd16:20.2.21	“You should spread a sheet and then lie down.” 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.0	3.5 The allowance for meals for the Sangha, etc. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Āḷavī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.3	he stayed in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.4	At that time Rājagaha was short of food 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.5	and people were not able to make meals for the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.6	Instead they wished to make meals for designated monks, invitational meals, meals for which lots are drawn, half-monthly meals, meals on the observance day, and meals on the day after the observance day. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.8	“I allow meals for the Sangha, meals for designated monks, invitational meals, meals for which lots are drawn, half-monthly meals, meals on the observance days, and meals on the days after the observance day.” 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.9.0	3.6 The appointment of a designator of meals 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.9.1	At that time the monks from the group of six took the best meals for themselves and gave the inferior ones to the other monks. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.11	“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the designator of meals: 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.12	he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows what has and has not been designated. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.13	And he should be appointed like this. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.14	First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.15	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.16	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint monk so-and-so as designator of meals. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.17	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.18	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.19	The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as designator of meals. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.20	Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as designator of meals should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.21	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.22	The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as designator of meals. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.23	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.24	The monks who were designator of meals thought, 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.25	“How should we designate the meals?” 
pli-tv-kd16:21.1.27	“You should mark the tickets and make a heap of them, and then designate the meals.” 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.0	3.7 The appointment of assigners of dwellings, etc. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.1	At that time there was no assigner of dwellings … 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.2	no storeman … 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.3	no receiver of robe-cloth … 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.4	no distributor of robe-cloth … 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.5	no distributor of rice porridge … 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.6	no distributor of fruit … 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.7	no distributor of fresh foods. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.8	Because it was not distributed, the fresh food perished. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.10	“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the distributor of fresh foods: 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.11	he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows what has and has not been distributed. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.12	And he should be appointed like this. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.13	First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.14	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.15	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint monk so-and-so as distributor of fresh foods. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.16	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.17	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.18	The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as distributor of fresh foods. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.19	Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as distributor of fresh foods should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.20	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.21	The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as distributor of fresh foods. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.2.22	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.0	3.8 The appointment of distributors of minor requisites 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.1	At that time there were minor requisites in the storeroom. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.3	“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the distributor of minor requisites: 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.4	he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows what has and has not been distributed. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.5	And he should be appointed like this. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.6	First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.7	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.8	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint monk so-and-so as distributor of minor requisites. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.9	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.10	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.11	The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as distributor of minor requisites. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.12	Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as distributor of minor requisites should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.13	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.14	The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as distributor of minor requisites. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.15	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.16	The monk who is the distributor of minor requisites should give out, one by one: needles, knives, sandals, belts, shoulder straps, water filters, water strainers; and robe material for long inter-panel strips, short inter-panel strips, large panels, medium-sized panels, lengthwise borders, and crosswise borders. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.17	If the Sangha has ghee, oil, honey, or syrup, he should give it out for a single use. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.18	If it is needed again, he should give it out again. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.19.0	3.9 The appointment of distributors of rainy-season bathing cloths, etc. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.19.1	At that time there was no distributor of rainy-season bathing cloths … 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.20	no distributor of almsbowls … 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.21	no supervisor of monastery workers … 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.22	no supervisor of novice monks. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.23	Not being supervised, the novice monks didn’t do their work. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.25	“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the supervisor of novice monks: 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.26	he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows who is and is not supervised. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.27	And he should be appointed like this. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.28	First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.29	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.30	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint monk so-and-so as supervisor of novice monks. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.31	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.32	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.

pli-tv-kd16:21.3.36	The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as supervisor of novice monks. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.37	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.38	The third section for recitation is finished. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.39	The sixth chapter on dwellings is finished. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.197	He has conquered all and knows the world,
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.198	The Leader intent on what’s beneficial: 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.199	It’s for the sake of shelter and happiness, 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.200	To attain absorption and to see clearly. 
pli-tv-kd16:21.3.201	The chapter on dwellings is finished.
pli-tv-kd17:0.1	Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law 
pli-tv-kd17:0.2	The Short Division 
pli-tv-kd17:0.3	The chapter on schism in the Sangha 
pli-tv-kd17:0.4	1.1 The account of the going forth of the six Sakyans 
pli-tv-kd17:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at the Mallian town of Anupiyā. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.1.2	At this time a number of well-known young Sakyans had followed the Buddha in going forth. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.1.3	The Sakyans Mahānāma and Anuruddha were brothers. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.1.4	Anuruddha had been brought up in great comfort. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.1.5	He had three stilt houses: 
pli-tv-kd17:1.1.6	one for the winter, one for the summer, and one for the rainy season. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.1.7	He spent the four months of the rainy season in the rainy-season house, attended on only by female musicians, never descending from that house. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.1.8	Mahānāma thought, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.1.9	“A number of well-known young Sakyans have just followed the Buddha in going forth, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.1.10	but no one from our household. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.1.11	Why donʼt Anuruddha or I go forth?” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.1.12	He then went to Anuruddha and told him what he had thought. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.1.16	Anuruddha replied, “I’ve been brought up in great comfort; I’m not able to go forth. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.1.17	You go forth.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.1	“Come then, and I’ll teach you the affairs of the household life. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.2	First you must plow the fields, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.3	then sow the seeds, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.4	irrigate, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.5	and drain, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.6	and then weed. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.7	Next you must cut the harvest, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.8	gather it together, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.9	and make sheaves. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.10	You must then thresh it, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.11	remove the straw 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.12	and husk, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.13	and then winnow it 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.14	before you bring it into storage. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.15	And next year you must do the same, and the next.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.16	“But does the work never stop? 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.17	I can’t see any end to it. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.20	When can you enjoy yourself with worldly pleasures, free from bother?” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.21	“The work doesn’t stop 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.22	and you won’t see any end of it. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.23	While the work was still unfinished, our fathers and grandfathers have all died.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.24	“Well then, you go ahead with the affairs of the household life. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.25	I’ll go forth into homelessness.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.26	Anuruddha then went to his mother and said, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.27	“Mum, I wish to go forth into homelessness. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.28	Please allow me.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.30	“Both of you, Anuruddha, my two sons, are dear and beloved to me. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.31	Even if you died I would lose you against my wishes. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.32	So how can I allow you to go forth from home into homelessness while you’re still living?” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.33	A second time Anuruddha asked the same question and got the same reply. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.2.34	He then asked a third time. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.1	At that time the Sakyans were ruled by King Bhaddiya, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.2	who was a friend of Anuruddha’s. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.3	Anuruddha’s mother considered this 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.6	and thought, “Bhaddiya won’t be able to go forth into homelessness.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.7	And she said to Anuruddha, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.8	“If Bhaddiya the King of the Sakyans goes forth, then you too may go forth.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.9	Anuruddha then went to King Baddiya and said, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.10	“My going forth depends on yours.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.11	“Don’t worry about whether your going forth depends on mine or not. I’m with you. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.12	So just go forth when you like.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.13	“Come, let’s go forth together.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.14	“I’m not able to go forth. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.15	I’m not able to do what you do. What can I do? 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.16	You go forth.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.17	“My mother told me 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.18	that I may go forth only if you go forth. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.19	And then you said, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.20	‘Don’t worry about whether your going forth depends on mine or not. I’m with you. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.21	So just go forth when you like.’ 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.22	So come, let’s go forth together.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.23	At that time people spoke the truth, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.24	and so Bhaddiya said to Anuruddha, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.25	“Please wait seven years. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.26	Then we’ll go forth together.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.27	“That’s too long. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.28	I’m not able to wait for seven years.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.29	“Then wait six years … 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.30	five years … 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.31	four years … 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.32	three years … 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.33	two years … 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.34	one year, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.35	and we’ll go forth together.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.36	“That’s too long. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.37	I’m not able to wait for one year.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.38	“Then wait seven months, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.39	and we’ll go forth together.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.40	“That’s too long. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.41	I’m not able to wait for seven months.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.42	“Then wait six months … 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.43	five months … 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.44	four months … 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.45	three months … 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.46	two months … 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.47	one month … 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.48	half a month, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.49	and we’ll go forth together.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.50	“That’s too long. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.51	I’m not able to wait for half a month.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.52	“Then wait seven days, while I hand over the rulership to my sons and brothers.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.3.53	“Seven days isn’t long. I’ll wait.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.1	Soon afterwards King Bhaddiya, Anuruddha, Ānanda, Bhagu, Kimila, and Devadatta, with the barber Upāli as the seventh, went out to the park with the fourfold army, just as they used to. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.2	After going a good distance, they turned back the army. They then entered a foreign territory, removed their ornaments, bound them in a bundle with an upper robe, and said to Upāli, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.3	“Now turn back, Upāli. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.4	This is enough for you to live on.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.5	As Upāli was returning, he thought, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.6	“The Sakyans are temperamental. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.7	Thinking that I’m responsible for the departure of these young men, they might have me killed. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.8	Now, if these young Sakyans are going forth into homelessness, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.9	why shouldn’t I?” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.10	Undoing the bundle, he hung the goods from a tree, saying, “Whoever sees this may take it as given.” And he returned to the young Sakyans. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.11	Seeing Upāli coming, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.12	they said to him, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.13	“Why are you coming back, Upāli?” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.14	And he told what he had done. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.20	“You have done the right thing. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.21	The Sakyans are indeed temperamental. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.22	Thinking that you were responsible for our departure, they might have killed you.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.23	Then the young Sakyans, taking Upāli with them, went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.24	and said, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.25	“Venerable Sir, we Sakyans are proud. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.26	This barber Upāli has been serving us for a long time. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.27	Please let him go forth first. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.28	We will then bow down to him, rise up for him, raise our joined palms to him, and do acts of respect toward him. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.29	In this way our Sakyan pride will be subdued.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.30	And the Buddha had Upāli go forth first, and afterwards the young Sakyans. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.31	During that very rainy season Venerable Bhaddiya realized the three insights, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.32	Venerable Anuruddha obtained clairvoyance, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.33	Venerable Ānanda realized stream-entry, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.4.34	whereas Devadatta obtained supernormal powers, but no stage of awakening. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.5.1	When Bhaddiya was in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, he frequently exclaimed an inspired utterance: 
pli-tv-kd17:1.5.2	“Oh, what happiness! Oh, what happiness!” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.5.3	A number of monks went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.5.4	and told him what was happening, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.5.7	adding, “No doubt Bhaddiya is dissatisfied with the spiritual life. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.5.8	It’s because he’s recalling his former happiness as a king that he is saying this.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.5.10	The Buddha addressed a certain monk: 
pli-tv-kd17:1.5.11	“Go, monk, and in my name say to Bhaddiya, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.5.12	‘Bhaddiya, the Teacher is calling you.’” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.5.13	Saying, “Yes, Sir,” he did just that. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.6.1	Bhaddiya consented. He then went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.6.2	And the Buddha said to him, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.6.3	“Is it true, Bhaddiya, that when you’re in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, you frequently exclaim an inspired utterance: 
pli-tv-kd17:1.6.4	‘Oh, what happiness! Oh, what happiness!’?” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.6.5	“Yes, Venerable Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.6.6	“But why do you say this?” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.6.8	“In the past, when I was a king, I was well protected within and outside the royal compound, within and outside of town, and within and outside of the country. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.6.9	But although I was protected and guarded in this way, I was fearful, agitated, and distrustful. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.6.10	But now, Sir, when I’m in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, I’m free from fear, agitation, and distrust. I’m free from bother, relaxed, living on what’s given by others, with a mind as free as a wild animal. 
pli-tv-kd17:1.6.11	This is why I say this.” 
pli-tv-kd17:1.6.13	Seeing the significance of this, on that occasion the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utterance: 
pli-tv-kd17:1.6.14	“They who have no anger within, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.6.15	Gone beyond any kind of existence, 
pli-tv-kd17:1.6.16	Happy, free from fear and sorrow—
pli-tv-kd17:1.6.17	Even the gods are unable to see them.” 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.0	1.2 The account of Devadatta 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Anupiyā for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Kosambī. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.3	he stayed in Ghosita’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.4	At this time, while in seclusion, Devadatta thought, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.5	“Who might I inspire to have confidence in me, so that I’d get much gain and honor?” 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.6	And it occurred to him, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.7	“Prince Ajātasattu is young and has a bright future. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.8	Let me inspire him to have confidence in me. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.9	I’ll then get much gain and honor.” 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.10	Devadatta put his dwelling in order, took his bowl and robes, and left for Rājagaha, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.11	where he eventually arrived. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.12	He then transformed himself into a boy wearing a snake as a belt and appeared on Prince Ajātasattu’s lap. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.13	When Ajātasattu became fearful and agitated, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.14	Devadatta said to him, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.15	“Are you afraid of me, Prince?” 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.16	“I am. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.17	Who are you?” 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.18	“I’m Devadatta.” 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.19	“If you are Venerable Devadatta, then please appear in your own form.” 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.20	Devadatta abandoned the form of a boy and then stood in front of Ajātasattu, wearing his robes and carrying his bowl. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.21	By means of this wonder Devadatta was able to inspire Ajātasattu to have confidence in him. Ajātasattu then attended on him morning and evening, with five hundred carriages and a meal offering of five hundred dishes of food. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.22	Overcome by gain, honor, and fame, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.23	Devadatta started desiring to lead the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.1.24	But with the appearance of that thought, his supernormal powers disappeared. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.2.1	At that time Kakudha the Koḷiyan, the attendant to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, had recently died and been reborn in a mind-made body. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.2.2	He had acquired a body 
pli-tv-kd17:2.2.3	two or three times the size of the fields of a Magadhan village. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.2.4	Yet he harmed neither himself nor others with that body. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.2.5	Soon afterwards the god Kakudha approached Mahāmoggallāna, bowed down, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.2.6	and told him 
pli-tv-kd17:2.2.7	about Devadatta’s desire 
pli-tv-kd17:2.2.9	and the disappearance of his supernormal powers. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.2.11	He then bowed down, circumambulated Mahāmoggallāna with his right side toward him, and disappeared on the spot. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.2.12	Mahāmoggallāna then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.2.13	and told him all that had happened. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.2.25	The Buddha said, “But, Moggallāna, have you read Kakudha’s mind 
pli-tv-kd17:2.2.26	so that you know that all he says is just so and not otherwise?” 
pli-tv-kd17:2.2.27	“I have, Venerable Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd17:2.2.29	“Remember these words, Moggallāna! 
pli-tv-kd17:2.2.31	Soon that fool will show himself as he truly is. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.3.0	1.3 Discussion of the five kinds of teachers 
pli-tv-kd17:2.3.1	“Moggallāna, there are five kinds of teachers in the world. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.3.3	One kind of teacher is impure in behavior, while claiming it is pure. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.3.4	His disciples know about his impure behavior, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.3.6	but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.3.8	Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines. How then can we inform them? 
pli-tv-kd17:2.3.9	He will be known through his own actions.’ 
pli-tv-kd17:2.3.10	The disciples conceal the impure behavior of such a teacher. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.3.11	And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal it. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.1	Another kind of teacher is impure in livelihood, while claiming it is pure. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.2	His disciples know about his impure livelihood, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.4	but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.6	Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines. How then can we inform them? 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.7	He will be known through his own actions.’ 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.8	The disciples conceal the impure livelihood of such a teacher. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.9	And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal it. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.10	Still another kind of teacher gives impure teachings, while claiming they are pure. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.11	His disciples know about his impure teachings, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.13	but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.15	Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines. How then can we inform them? 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.16	He will be known through his own actions.’ 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.17	The disciples conceal the impure teachings of such a teacher. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.18	And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal them. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.19	Still another kind of teacher gives impure explanations, while claiming they are pure. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.20	His disciples know about his impure explanations, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.22	but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.24	Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines. How then can we inform them? 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.25	He will be known through his own actions.’ 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.26	The disciples conceal the impure explanations of such a teacher. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.27	And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal them. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.28	Still another kind of teacher has impure knowledge and vision, while claiming they are pure. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.29	His disciples know about his impure knowledge and vision, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.31	but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.33	Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines. How then can we inform them? 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.34	He will be known through his own actions.’ 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.35	The disciples conceal the impure knowledge and vision of such a teacher. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.36	And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal it. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.38	But in my case, Moggallāna, I claim my behavior is pure because it is. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.39	My disciples don’t conceal my behavior 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.40	and I don’t expect them to do so. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.41	I claim my livelihood is pure … 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.42	I claim my teachings are pure … 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.43	I claim my explanations are pure … 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.44	I claim my knowledge and vision are pure because they are. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.45	My disciples don’t conceal my knowledge and vision 
pli-tv-kd17:2.4.46	and I don’t expect them to do so.” 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Kosambī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.3	he stayed in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.4	Then a number of monks went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.5	and said, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.6	“Venerable Sir, Prince Ajātasattu attends on Devadatta morning and evening, with five hundred carriages 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.7	and a meal offering of five hundred dishes of food.” 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.8	“Don’t envy Devadatta, monks, his gain, honor, and fame. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.9	So long as Prince Ajātasattu treats him like this, Devadatta can be expected to decline in good qualities. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.10	Just as a fierce dog would get even more fierce if you break a gall bladder on its nose, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.11	so too, so long as Prince Ajātasattu treats like this, Devadatta can be expected to decline in good qualities. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.12	Devadatta’s gain, honor, and fame will cause his destruction and ruin. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.13	Just as a plantain banana tree produces fruit for its own destruction and ruin, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.14	so too do Devadatta’s gain, honor, and fame cause his own destruction and ruin. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.15	Just as a bamboo produces fruit for its own destruction and ruin, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.16	so too do Devadatta’s gain, honor, and fame cause his own destruction and ruin. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.17	Just as a _naḷa_ reed produces fruit for its own destruction and ruin, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.18	so too do Devadatta’s gain, honor, and fame cause his own destruction and ruin. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.19	Just as a mule becomes pregnant for its own destruction and ruin, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.20	so too do Devadatta’s gain, honor, and fame cause his own destruction and ruin.” 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.21	“The fruit destroys the plantain, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.22	And the bamboo and the reed. 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.23	Honor destroys the bad person, 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.24	As the fetus destroys the mule.” 
pli-tv-kd17:2.5.25	The first section for recitation is finished. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.1.0	2.1 The legal procedure of announcement 
pli-tv-kd17:3.1.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha was seated giving a teaching surrounded by a large gathering of people, including the King. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.1.2	Then Devadatta got up from his seat, put his upper robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms, and said, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.1.3	“Venerable Sir, you’re now old and close to the end of your life. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.1.4	You should live free from bother and enjoy the happiness of the present life. Hand the Sangha of monks over to me. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.1.5	Let me lead the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.1.6	“Let it be, Devadatta, don’t think of leading the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.1.7	A second time Devadatta said the same thing and got the same reply. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.1.8	He then said it a third time, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.1.11	and the Buddha replied: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.1.12	“I wouldn’t even hand the Sangha over to Sāriputta and Mogallāna, so why then to you, a wretched devourer of junk?” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.1.13	Devadatta thought, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.1.14	“The Buddha disparages me in front of a gathering that includes the king as a devourer of junk, while praising Sāriputta and Mogallāna,” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.1.15	and he bowed down in anger, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.1.16	This was the first time Devadatta had ill will toward the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.2	“Well then, the Sangha should do a legal procedure to announce the following about Devadatta in Rājagaha: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.3	‘Previously Devadatta had one nature, now he has another. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.4	Whatever Devadatta does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha, but only with Devadatta.’ 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.5	And it should be done like this. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.6	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.7	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.8	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do a legal procedure to announce the following about Devadatta in Rājagaha: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.9	‘Previously Devadatta had one nature, now he has another. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.10	Whatever Devadatta does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha, but only with Devadatta.’ 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.11	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.12	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.13	The Sangha does a legal procedure to announce the following about Devadatta in Rājagaha: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.14	‘Previously Devadatta had one nature, now he has another. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.15	Whatever Devadatta does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha, but only with Devadatta.’ 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.16	Any monk who approves of doing this procedure 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.18	should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.19	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.20	The Sangha has done a legal procedure to announce the following about Devadatta in Rājagaha: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.21	‘Previously Devadatta had one nature, now he has another. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.22	Whatever Devadatta does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha, but only with Devadatta.’ 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.23	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.24	And the Buddha addressed Sāriputta: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.25	“Well then, Sāriputta, make the announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.26	“Previously, Venerable Sir, I have praised Devadatta in Rājagaha, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.27	saying, ‘The Godhian is powerful and mighty.’ 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.28	How then can I now make this announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha?” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.29	“Didn’t you truthfully praise Devadatta in Rājagaha 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.30	when you said that?” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.31	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.32	“In the same way, you should truthfully make an announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.2.33	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.1	And the Buddha addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.2	“Well then, the Sangha should appoint Sāriputta to make that announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.5	And he should be appointed like this. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.6	First Sāriputta should be asked, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.7	and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.8	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.9	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint Venerable Sāriputta to make the following announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.10	‘Previously Devadatta had one nature, now he has another. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.11	Whatever Devadatta does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha, but only with Devadatta.’ 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.12	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.13	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.14	The Sangha appoints Venerable Sāriputta to make the following announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.15	‘Previously Devadatta had one nature, now he has another. Whatever Devadatta does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha, but only with Devadatta.’ 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.16	Any monk who approves of appointing Venerable Sāriputta to make this announcement 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.18	should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.19	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.20	The Sangha has appointed Venerable Sāriputta to make the following announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.21	‘Previously Devadatta had one nature, now he has another. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.22	Whatever Devadatta does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha, but only with Devadatta.’ 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.23	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.24	When he had been appointed, Sāriputta entered Rājagaha accompanied by a number of monks. He then made that announcement about Devadatta: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.25	“Previously Devadatta had one nature, now he has another. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.26	Whatever Devadatta does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha, but only with Devadatta.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.27	The foolish people there, those with little faith and confidence, said, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.28	“These Sakyan monastics are envious of Devadatta’s gain and honor.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.29	But the wise ones, those with faith and confidence, said, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.3.30	“This must be a serious matter, seeing as the Buddha has an announcement made about Devadatta in Rājagaha.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.0	2.2 The account of Prince Ajātasattu 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.1	Soon afterwards Devadatta went to Prince Ajātasattu and said, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.2	“Formerly, Prince, people were long-lived, but now they are short-lived. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.3	It’s possible that you might die while still a prince. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.4	So kill your father and become the King. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.5	And I’ll kill the Buddha and become the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.6	Ajātasattu thought, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.7	“Venerable Devadatta is powerful and mighty. He would know.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.8	So he bound a dagger to his thigh and, fearful and agitated, he hastily entered the royal compound in the middle of the day. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.9	The officials in the royal compound saw Ajātasattu’s strange behavior 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.10	and seized him. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.11	When they examined him, they found the dagger tied to his thigh. They asked him 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.12	what he was up to. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.13	“I want to kill my father.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.14	“Who has instigated you?” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.15	“Venerable Devadatta.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.16	Some officials opined, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.17	“The Prince should be executed, as well as Devadatta and all the monks.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.18	Others opined, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.19	“The monks should not be executed; 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.20	they haven’t done anything wrong. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.21	The Prince should be executed, as well as Devadatta.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.22	Others again opined, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.23	“Neither the Prince nor Devadatta 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.24	nor the monks should be executed. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.25	The King should be informed, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.4.26	and we should do as he says.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.5.1	Taking Ajātasattu with them, they went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and informed him of what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.5.2	The King said, “What do you all think?” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.5.3	And they told him their views. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.5.14	The King said, “What has this to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha? 
pli-tv-kd17:3.5.15	Didn’t the Buddha have an announcement made in Rājagaha as a warning: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.5.16	‘Previously Devadatta had one nature, now he has another. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.5.17	Whatever Devadatta does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha, but only with Devadatta’?” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.5.18	And he fired those officials who had suggested 
pli-tv-kd17:3.5.19	to execute the Prince, Devadatta, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.5.20	and the Sangha; 
pli-tv-kd17:3.5.22	he demoted those who had suggested 
pli-tv-kd17:3.5.25	to execute the Prince and Devadatta; 
pli-tv-kd17:3.5.27	and he promoted those who had suggested 
pli-tv-kd17:3.5.31	to act according to the King’s orders. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.5.33	The King then said to Ajātasattu, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.5.34	“Why do you want to kill me?” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.5.35	“I want to rule, sir.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.5.36	“If you want to rule, the kingdom is yours.” And he handed the rulership over to the Prince. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.6.0	2.3 The sending of assassins 
pli-tv-kd17:3.6.1	Soon afterwards Devadatta went to Ajātasattu and said, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.6.2	“Great king, tell your men to kill the ascetic Gotama.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.6.3	And the King told his men, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.6.4	“Do as Venerable Devadatta says.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.6.5	Devadatta then told one man, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.6.6	“Go to such and such a place where the ascetic Gotama is staying. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.6.7	Kill him and return via this path.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.6.8	On that path he stationed two men, saying, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.6.9	“Kill the man who comes along this path and return via that path.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.6.10	On that path he stationed four men, saying, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.6.11	“Kill the two men who come along this path and return via that path.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.6.12	On that path he stationed eight men, saying, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.6.13	“Kill the four men who come along this path and return via that path.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.6.14	On that path he stationed sixteen men, saying, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.6.15	“Kill the eight men who come along this path and then return.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.1	Soon afterwards that one man took a sword and shield, fastened on a bow and quiver, and went to the Buddha. When he got close, he became fearful and agitated, his body rigid. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.2	The Buddha saw him 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.3	and said, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.4	“Come, don’t be afraid.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.5	He then placed his sword and shield to one side, put down his bow and quiver, and went up to the Buddha. He bowed down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.6	“Sir, I’ve made a mistake. I’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful in coming here with an evil mind intent on murder. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.7	Please forgive me so that I may restrain myself in the future.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.8	“You have certainly made a mistake. You’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.9	But since you acknowledge your mistake and make proper amends, I forgive you. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.10	For this is called growth in the training of the noble ones: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.11	acknowledging a mistake, making proper amends, and undertaking restraint for the future.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.12	The Buddha then gave him a progressive teaching: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.13	talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.14	When the Buddha knew that his mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.15	suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.16	And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.17	so too, while he was sitting right there that man experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.18	“Anything that has a beginning has an end.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.19	He had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. And he said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.20	“Wonderful, Sir, wonderful! 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.21	Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.22	so that one with eyes might see what’s there—
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.23	just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.24	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the Teaching, and to the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.25	Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.26	The Buddha then said to him, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.7.27	“Don’t go back along this path, go along that one.” And he sent him down a different path. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.8.1	The two men thought, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.8.2	“Why is it taking that one man so long to arrive?” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.8.3	As they were walking along that path in the opposite direction, they saw the Buddha seated at the foot of a tree. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.8.4	They approached him, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.8.5	And the Buddha gave them a progressive teaching … 
pli-tv-kd17:3.8.6	and they had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. They then said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.8.7	“Wonderful, Sir … 
pli-tv-kd17:3.8.8	Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.8.9	The Buddha then said to them, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.8.10	“Don’t go back along this path, go along that one.” And he sent them down a different path. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.8.11	The four men … 
pli-tv-kd17:3.8.12	the eight men … 
pli-tv-kd17:3.8.13	the sixteen men thought, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.8.14	“Why is it taking those eight men so long to arrive?” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.8.15	As they were walking along that path in the opposite direction, they saw the Buddha seated at the foot of a tree. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.8.16	They approached him, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.8.17	And the Buddha gave them a progressive teaching … 
pli-tv-kd17:3.8.19	and they had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. They then said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.8.20	“Wonderful, Sir … 
pli-tv-kd17:3.8.21	Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.9.1	Soon afterwards that one man went to Devadatta and said, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.9.2	“I wasn’t able to kill him, Sir. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.9.3	He’s powerful and mighty that Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.9.4	“Forget it. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.9.5	Don’t kill the ascetic Gotama. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.9.6	I’ll do it myself.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.9.7.0	2.4 The act of causing the Buddha to bleed 
pli-tv-kd17:3.9.7.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha was walking up and down in the shade of the Vulture Peak. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.9.8	Devadatta climbed the peak and threw down a large stone, thinking, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.9.9	“With this I’ll kill the ascetic Gotama.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.9.10	But the stone got stuck in the junction of two outcrops. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.9.11	A chip flew off, hitting the Buddha’s foot and causing it to bleed. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.9.12	The Buddha looked up and said to Devadatta, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.9.13	“Foolish man, you have made much demerit. With an evil mind intent on murder you have made the Buddha bleed.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.9.14	Soon afterwards the Buddha addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.9.15	“With an evil mind intent on murder Devadatta has made the Buddha bleed. This is his first action with immediate results.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.1	When the monks heard 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.2	that Devadatta was trying to murder the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.3	they walked back and forth on all sides of the Buddha’s dwelling, trying to protect the Buddha by reciting loudly. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.4	The Buddha heard that loud sound of recitation. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.5	He asked Ānanda what it was 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.7	and Ānanda told him. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.11	The Buddha said, “Well then, Ānanda, tell those monks in my name 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.12	that the Teacher is calling them.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.13	Saying, “Yes, Sir,” he did just that. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.15	The monks consented. They then went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.16	The Buddha said to them, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.17	“It’s impossible, monks, for anyone to kill me through an act of violence. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.18	The Buddha will not attain final extinguishment through an act of violence. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.19	“Monks, there are five kinds of teachers in the world. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.21	One kind of teacher is impure in behavior, while claiming it is pure. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.22	His disciples know about his impure behavior, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.24	but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.26	Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines. How then can we inform them? 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.27	He will be known through his own actions.’ 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.28	The disciples conceal the impure behavior of such a teacher. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.29	And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal it. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.30	Another kind of teacher is impure in livelihood … 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.31	gives impure teachings … 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.32	gives impure explanations … 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.33	has impure knowledge and vision, while claiming they are pure. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.34	His disciples know about his impure knowledge and vision, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.36	but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.38	Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines. How then can we inform them? 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.39	He will be known through his own actions.’ 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.40	The disciples conceal the impure knowledge and vision of such a teacher. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.41	And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal it. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.43	But in my case, I claim my behavior is pure because it is. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.44	My disciples don’t conceal my behavior 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.45	and I don’t expect them to do so. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.46	I claim my livelihood is pure … 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.47	I claim my teachings are pure … 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.48	I claim my explanations are pure … 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.49	I claim my knowledge and vision are pure because they are. My disciples don’t conceal my knowledge and vision and I don’t expect them to do so. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.50	It’s impossible for anyone to kill me through an act of violence. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.51	The Buddha will not attain final extinguishment through an act of violence. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.52	Go to your dwellings, monks. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.10.53	I don’t need any protection.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.0	2.5 The letting loose of Nāḷāgiri 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.1	At that time in Rājagaha there was a violent elephant called Nāḷāgiri, a killer of humans. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.2	Devadatta then entered Rājagaha, went to the elephant stables, and said to the elephant keepers, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.3	“We who are relatives of the King are capable of having people promoted and getting them a raise. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.4	So then, when the ascetic Gotama comes walking along this street, release the elephant Nāḷāgiri down this same street.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.5	“Yes, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.6	One morning soon afterwards, the Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and entered Rājagaha for alms together with a number of monks. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.7	And the Buddha walked down that very street. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.8	When the elephant keepers saw the Buddha coming, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.9	they released Nāḷāgiri down the same street. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.10	Nāḷāgiri saw the Buddha coming. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.11	He blew his trunk, and with ears and tail bristling, he charged toward the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.12	When the monks saw Nāḷāgiri coming, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.13	they said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.14	“This elephant coming down the street is Nāḷāgiri, a violent killer of humans. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.15	Please retreat, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.17	“Come, don’t be afraid. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.18	It’s impossible for anyone to kill the Buddha through an act of violence. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.19	The Buddha will not attain final extinguishment through an act of violence.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.20	A second time 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.21	and a third time those monks said the same thing to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.11.25	each time getting the same reply. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.1	On that occasion people had ascended their stilt houses and even their roofs. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.2	The foolish people with little faith and confidence said, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.3	“The elephant will hurt the handsome great ascetic.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.4	But the wise people with faith and confidence said, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.5	“Soon the great man and the great elephant will meet in battle.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.6	The Buddha then pervaded Nāḷāgiri with a mind of love. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.7	Feeling it, Nāḷāgiri lowered his trunk, went up to the Buddha, and stood in front of him. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.8	And while stroking Nāḷāgiri on the forehead with his right hand, the Buddha spoke these verses: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.9	“Do not, elephant, attack a great man; 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.10	Painful it is to attack a great man. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.11	For a killer of a great man, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.12	The next rebirth is not good. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.13	Don’t be intoxicated or heedless, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.14	For the heedless are not reborn well. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.15	Only do those things 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.16	That will take you to a good rebirth.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.17	Nāḷāgiri sucked the dust from the Buddha’s feet with his trunk and scattered it overhead. He then walked backwards while looking at the Buddha 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.18	and returned to his own spot in the elephant stables. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.19	That is how tame Nāḷāgiri had become. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.20	On that occasion people chanted this verse: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.21	“Some are tamed with sticks 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.22	And with goads and whips. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.23	Without stick or sword, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.12.24	The great sage tamed the elephant.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.1	And people complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.2	“How evil he is this Devadatta, how benighted, in that he tries to kill the ascetic Gotama so powerful and mighty.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.3	Devadatta’s gain and honor declined, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.4	whereas those of the Buddha increased. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.5.0	2.6 The account of the request for the five points 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.5.1	Because of decline in material support and loss of respect, Devadatta and his followers were only invited to meals after repeatedly asking. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.6	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.7	“How can the Sakyan monastics eat at invitations after repeatedly asking? 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.8	Who doesn’t like nice food? Who doesn’t prefer tasty food?” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.9	The monks heard the complaints of those people, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.10	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.11	“How can Devadatta and his followers eat at invitations after repeatedly asking?” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.12	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Devadatta: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.13	“Is it true, Devadatta, that you do this?” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.14	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.15	After rebuking him … 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.16	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.17	“Well then, for monks eating among families I’ll lay down a rule against eating in groups of more than three, for these three reasons: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.18	for the restraint of bad people; 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.19	for the ease of good monks, stopping those with bad desires from creating a faction and then splitting the Sangha; 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.20	and out of compassion for families. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.13.21	Anyone eating in a group is to be dealt with according to the rule.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.14.1	Soon afterwards Devadatta went to see Kokālika, Kaṭamodakatissaka, Khaṇḍadeviyā-putta, and Samuddadatta, and he said to them, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.14.2	“Let’s create a schism in the Sangha of the ascetic Gotama. Let’s break its authority.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.14.3	Kokālika said to Devadatta, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.14.4	“The ascetic Gotama is powerful and mighty. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.14.5	How can we achieve this?” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.14.6	“Well, let’s go to the ascetic Gotama and request five things: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.14.7	‘In many ways, Sir, you praise fewness of wishes, contentment, the erasing of defilements, ascetic practices, being inspiring, the reduction in things, and being energetic. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.14.8	And there are five things that lead to just that. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.14.9	It would be good, Sir, if the monks stayed in the wilderness for life, and whoever stays near an inhabited area would commit an offense; 
pli-tv-kd17:3.14.10	if they ate only almsfood for life, and whoever accepts an invitational meal would commit an offense; 
pli-tv-kd17:3.14.11	if they wore rag-robes for life, and whoever accepts a robe from a householder would commit an offense; 
pli-tv-kd17:3.14.12	if they live at the foot of a tree for life, and whoever takes shelter would commit an offense; 
pli-tv-kd17:3.14.13	if they didn’t eat fish or meat for life, and whoever does would commit an offense.’ 
pli-tv-kd17:3.14.14	The ascetic Gotama won’t allow this. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.14.15	We’ll then be able to win people over with these five points.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.14.16	Kokālika said, “It might be possible to create a schism in the Sangha with these five points, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.14.17	for people have confidence in austerity.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.15.1	Devadatta and his followers then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.15.2	and Devadatta made his request. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.15.10	The Buddha replied, “No, Devadatta. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.15.11	Those who wish may stay in the wilderness and those who wish may live near an inhabited area. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.15.12	Those who wish may eat only almsfood and those who wish may accept invitations. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.15.13	Those who wish may wear rag-robes and those who wish may accept robes from householders. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.15.14	I have allowed the foot of a tree as resting place for eight months of the year, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.15.15	as well as fish and meat that are pure in three respects: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.15.16	one hasn’t seen, heard, or suspected that the animal was specifically killed to feed a monastic.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.15.17	Devadatta thought, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.15.18	“The Buddha doesn’t allow the five points,” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.15.19	and he was glad and elated. He got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left with his followers. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.15.20	Devadatta then entered Rājagaha and won people over with the five points, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.15.28	saying, “The ascetic Gotama doesn’t agree to them, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.15.29	but we practice in accordance with them.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.16.1	The foolish people there with little faith and confidence said, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.16.2	“These Sakyan monastics are practicing asceticism and they live their lives to erase defilements. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.16.3	But the acetic Gotama is extravagant and has chosen to live a life of abundance.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.16.4	But the wise people who had faith and confidence complained and criticized Devadatta, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.16.5	“How can Devadatta pursue schism in the Sangha of the Buddha? How can he break its authority?” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.16.6	The monks heard the criticism of those people, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.16.7	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him in the same way. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.16.9	They then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Devadatta: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.16.10	“Is it true, Devadatta, that you are doing this?” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.16.11	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.16.12	“Let it be, Devadatta, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.16.13	don’t create a schism in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.16.14	Schism in the Sangha is a serious matter. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.16.15	Whoever creates a schism in a united Sangha, does a bad act with effect for an eon; he is boiled in hell for an eon. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.16.16	But whoever unites a divided Sangha, generates the supreme merit; he rejoices in heaven for an eon. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.16.17	So let it be, Devadatta, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.16.18	don’t create a schism in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.16.19	Schism in the Sangha is a serious matter.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.17.1	Soon afterwards, after robing up in the morning, Venerable Ānanda took his bowl and robe and entered Rājagaha for alms. 
pli-tv-kd17:3.17.2	When Devadatta saw him, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.17.3	he approached him, and said, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.17.4	“From today on, Ānanda, I’ll do the observance-day procedure and the legal procedures of the Sangha separate from the Buddha and the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.17.5	When Ānanda had walked for alms, after his meal and after returning from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.17.6	and told him what had happened, 
pli-tv-kd17:3.17.11	adding, “From today, Venerable Sir, Devadatta has created a schism in the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.17.12	Understanding the significance of this, on that occasion the Buddha exclaimed a heartfelt utterance: 
pli-tv-kd17:3.17.13	“For the good doing good is easy; 
pli-tv-kd17:3.17.14	For the bad doing good is hard; 
pli-tv-kd17:3.17.15	For the bad doing evil is easy; 
pli-tv-kd17:3.17.16	For the noble ones doing evil is hard.” 
pli-tv-kd17:3.17.17	The second section for recitation is finished. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.0	3.1 The account of schism in the Sangha 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.1	On the observance day soon afterwards, Devadatta got up from his seat and distributed voting tickets, saying, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.2	“We have gone to the ascetic Gotama and asked for five things: 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.3	‘In many ways, Sir, you praiss fewness of wishes, contentment, the erasing of defilements, ascetic practices, being inspiring, the reduction in things, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.4	and being energetic. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.5	And there are five things that lead to just that. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.7.1	It would be good, Sir, if the monks stayed in the wilderness for life, and whoever stays near an inhabited area would commit an offense; 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.7.2	if they were alms-collectors for life, and whoever accepts an invitation would commit an offense; 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.7.3	if they were rag-robe wearers for life, and whoever accepts a robe from a lay person would commit an offense; 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.7.4	if they dwelt at the foot of a tree for life, and whoever takes shelter would commit an offense; 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.8	if they didn’t eat fish or meat for life, and whoever does would commit an offense.’ 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.9	The ascetic Gotama doesn’t agree to them, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.10	but we practice in accordance with them. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.11	Any monk who approves of these five things should take a voting ticket.” 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.12	On that occasion five hundred Vajjian monks from Vesālī, newly ordained and ignorant, were present. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.13	Thinking, “This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction,” they took voting tickets. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.14	Then, after causing a schism in the Sangha, Devadatta left for Gayāsīsa together with five hundred monks. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.15	Soon afterwards Sāriputta and Moggallāna went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.16	and said, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.17	“Venerable Sir, Devadatta has split the Sangha and left for Gayāsīsa together with five hundred monks.” 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.18	“You have compassion for those five hundred newly ordained monks, don’t you? 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.19	Go then, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, before they are affected by misfortune and disaster.” 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.20	Saying, “Yes,” Sāriputta and Moggallāna got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with their right side toward him, and went to Gayāsīsa. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.21	Just then a certain monk who was standing near the Buddha was crying. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.22	The Buddha asked him why. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.24	He replied, “Even Sāriputta and Moggallāna, the Buddha’s chief disciples, are going to Devadatta because they approve of his teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd17:4.1.25	“It’s impossible for Sāriputta and Moggallāna to approve of Devadatta’s teaching. Instead, they’ve gone to win those monks over.” 
pli-tv-kd17:4.2.1	On that occasion Devadatta was seated giving a teaching surrounded by a great gathering. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.2.2	When Devadatta saw Sāriputta and Moggallāna coming, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.2.3	he said to the monks, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.2.4	“See how well-taught my teaching is, in that even Sāriputta and Moggallāna, the ascetic Gotama’s chief disciples, are coming here 
pli-tv-kd17:4.2.5	because they approve of my teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd17:4.2.6	But Kokālika said, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.2.7	“Don’t trust Sāriputta and Moggallāna. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.2.8	They have bad desires. They are in the grip of bad desires.” 
pli-tv-kd17:4.2.9	“Don’t worry. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.2.10	Anyone who comes to approve of my teaching is welcome.” 
pli-tv-kd17:4.2.11	Devadatta invited Venerable Sāriputta 
pli-tv-kd17:4.2.12	to sit on a seat half the height of his own. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.2.13	Saying, “There’s no need,” Sāriputta took another seat and sat down to one side, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.2.14	as did Mahāmoggallāna. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.2.15	After spending most of the night instructing, inspiring, and gladdening the monks with a teaching, Devadatta invited Sāriputta, saying 
pli-tv-kd17:4.2.16	“The Sangha of monks is without dullness and drowsiness. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.2.17	Give a teaching, Sāriputta. My back is aching and I’ll stretch it.” 
pli-tv-kd17:4.2.18	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd17:4.2.19	Devadatta then folded his upper robe in four and lay down on his right side. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.2.20	Because he was tired, absentminded, and heedless, he fell asleep in an instant. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.3.1	Venerable Sāriputta then used the wonder of mind reading to instruct them, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.3.2	and Venerable Mahāmoggallāna used the wonder of supernormal powers to the same effect. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.3.3	While those monks were being instructed like this, they experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: 
pli-tv-kd17:4.3.4	“Anything that has a beginning has an end.” 
pli-tv-kd17:4.3.5	And Sāriputta addressed those monks: 
pli-tv-kd17:4.3.6	“Let’s go to the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.3.7	Whoever approves of the teaching of the Buddha should come along.” 
pli-tv-kd17:4.3.8	Sāriputta and Moggallāna then went to the Bamboo Grove accompanied by those five hundred monks. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.3.9	In the meantime Kokālika woke up Devadatta, saying, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.3.10	“Get up, Devadatta, your monks are being led away by Sāriputta and Moggallāna. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.3.11	Didn’t I tell you 
pli-tv-kd17:4.3.12	not to trust Sāriputta and Moggallāna? 
pli-tv-kd17:4.3.13	Didn’t I say that they have bad desires, that they are in the grip of bad desires?” 
pli-tv-kd17:4.3.14	And right there warm blood emerged from Devadatta’s mouth. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.4.1	But Sāriputta and Moggallāna went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.4.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.4.3	“Venerable Sir, it would be good if we could reordain the monks who sided with the schism.” 
pli-tv-kd17:4.4.4	“Let it be, Sāriputta, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.4.5	don’t think of reordaining the monks who sided with the schism. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.4.6	Instead, have them confess a serious offense. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.4.7	And Devadatta, how did he treat you?” 
pli-tv-kd17:4.4.8	“Just as you, Sir, spend most of the night instructing, inspiring, and gladdening the monks with a teaching, and then invite me, saying, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.4.9	‘The Sangha of monks is without dullness and drowsiness. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.4.10	Give a teaching, Sāriputta. My back is aching and I’ll stretch it,’ 
pli-tv-kd17:4.4.11	that’s how Devadatta treated us.” 
pli-tv-kd17:4.5.1	And the Buddha addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd17:4.5.2	“Once upon a time there was a great lake in a wilderness area, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.5.3	with elephants living nearby. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.5.4	They plunged into the lake, pulled up lotus roots and tubers with their trunks, gave them a good rinse to remove the mud, and then chewed and swallowed them. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.5.5	That gave them beauty and strength. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.5.6	And they didn’t die or experience death-like suffering because of that. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.5.7	Then baby elephants tried to imitate those great elephants. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.5.8	They plunged into the lake, pulled up lotus roots and tubers with their trunks, but didn’t give them a good rinse to remove the mud, and then chewed and swallowed them while muddy. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.5.9	That didn’t give them any beauty or strength. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.5.10	And they died or experienced death-like suffering because of that. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.5.11	Just so, by imitating me, Devadatta will die miserably. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.5.12	‘While the great elephant removes the earth, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.5.13	Eats the tuber, and is alert in the rivers, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.5.14	He’s like a baby elephant that’s eaten mud: 
pli-tv-kd17:4.5.15	By imitating me, he will die miserably.’ 
pli-tv-kd17:4.6.1	A monk who has eight qualities is qualified to act as messenger. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.6.3	He listens and communicates, he learns and remembers, he understands and gets things across, he’s skilled in what is and what isn’t relevant, he’s not argumentative. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.6.8	Because he has these eight qualities, Sāriputta is qualified to act as messenger. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.6.9	‘He doesn’t tremble when faced with 
pli-tv-kd17:4.6.10	A gathering of fierce debaters. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.6.11	He doesn’t mangle his words 
pli-tv-kd17:4.6.12	Or fail to get the instruction across. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.6.13	He speaks with confidence 
pli-tv-kd17:4.6.14	And isn’t agitated when questioned. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.6.15	This kind of monk, indeed, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.6.16	Is qualified to act as messenger.’ 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.1	Because he is overcome by and immersed in eight bad qualities, Devadatta is irredeemably destined to an eon in hell. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.3	Because Devadatta is overcome by and immersed in gain, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.4	lack of gain, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.5	fame, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.6	lack of fame, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.7	honor, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.8	lack of honor, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.9	bad desires, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.10	and bad friends, he is irredeemably destined to an eon in hell. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.12	It’s good for a monk to overcome whatever gain he’s affected by, whatever lack of gain he’s affected by, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.13	whatever fame he’s affected by, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.14	whatever lack of fame he’s affected by, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.15	whatever honor he’s affected by, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.16	whatever lack of honor he’s affected by, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.17	whatever bad desires he’s affected by, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.18	or whatever bad friends he’s affected by. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.19	For what reason should a monk overcome these things? 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.26	If he doesn’t overcome whatever gain he’s affected by, corruptions, distress, and fevers may arise. But if he overcomes whatever gain he’s affected by, he won’t have those corruptions, distress, and fevers. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.27	If he doesn’t overcome whatever lack of gain he’s affected by, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.28	whatever fame he’s affected by, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.29	whatever lack of fame he’s affected by, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.30	whatever honor he’s affected by,
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.31	whatever lack of honor he’s affected by, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.32	whatever bad desires he’s affected by, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.33	or whatever bad friends he’s affected by, corruptions, distress, and fevers may arise. But if he overcomes whatever bad friends he’s affected by, he won’t have those corruptions, distress, and fevers. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.34	Therefore, monks, you should overcome whatever gain you’re affected by, whatever lack of gain you’re affected by, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.35	whatever fame you’re affected by, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.36	whatever lack of fame you’re affected by, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.37	whatever honor you’re affected by, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.38	whatever lack of honor you’re affected by, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.39	whatever bad desires you’re affected by, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.40	and whatever bad friends you’re affected by. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.48	It’s in this way you should train yourselves. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.49	Because he is overcome by and immersed in three bad qualities, Devadatta is irredeemably destined to an eon in hell. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.50	What three? 
pli-tv-kd17:4.7.51	Bad desires; bad friends; after minor success, he stopped short of the goal. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.1	‘No one with bad desires 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.2	Is ever reborn in this world. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.3	In this way you may know 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.4	The destination of those with bad desires. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.5	Designated as “wise”, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.6	Agreed upon as “well-trained”, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.7	It was as if he was shining with fame—
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.8	I have heard Devadatta was like this. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.9	He was heedless, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.10	And after hurting the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.11	He’s gone to the Avīci hell, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.12	Frightful and with four doors. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.13	If you hurt one free from anger, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.14	One who doesn’t do anything bad, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.15	You experience that evil yourself, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.16	Being evil-minded and disrespectful. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.17	You might think to pollute 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.18	The ocean with a pot of poison, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.19	But you would not be able to do so, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.20	For the ocean is frightfully large. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.21	It’s the same with the Buddha: 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.22	If by speech one tries to harm him—
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.23	With his right conduct and peaceful mind—
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.24	That speech doesn’t affect him. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.25	The wise make friends with such a person, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.26	And they associate with him. 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.27	The monk who follows his path, 
pli-tv-kd17:4.8.28	Achieves the end of suffering.’” 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.0	3.2 Upāli’s questions 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.1	On one occasion Upāli went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.3	“Venerable Sir, we speak of ‘fracture in the Sangha’. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.4	But how is there fracture in the Sangha, yet not schism in the Sangha? 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.5	And how is there both fracture  and schism in the Sangha?” 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.6	“If, Upāli, there is one monk on one side and two on the other, and a fourth makes the proclamation and distributes voting tickets, saying, 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.7	‘This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction; take this, approve of this,’ 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.8	then this is a fracture in the Sangha, but not schism in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.9	If there are two monks on one side and two on the other, and a fifth makes the proclamation and distributes voting tickets, saying, 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.10	‘This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction; take this, approve of this,’ 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.11	then this is a fracture in the Sangha, but not schism in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.12	If there are two monks on one side and three on the other, and a sixth makes the proclamation and distributes voting tickets, saying, 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.13	‘This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction; take this, approve of this,’ 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.14	then this is a fracture in the Sangha, but not schism in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.15	If there are three monks on one side and three on the other, and a seventh makes the proclamation and distributes voting tickets, saying, 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.16	‘This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction; take this, approve of this,’ 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.17	then this is a fracture in the Sangha, but not schism in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.18	If there are three monks on one side and four on the other, and an eighth makes the proclamation and distributes voting tickets, saying, 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.19	‘This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction; take this, approve of this,’ 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.20	then this is a fracture in the Sangha, but not schism in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.21	But if there are four monks on one side and four on the other, and a ninth makes the proclamation and distributes voting tickets, saying, 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.22	‘This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction; take this, approve of this,’ 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.23	then this is both a fracture in the Sangha and also a schism in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.24	And if there are nine or more monks, then this is both a fracture in the Sangha and also a schism in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.25	A nun cannot cause a schism in the Sangha, even if she makes an effort to cause a schism. A trainee nun, 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.26	a novice monk, a novice nun, a male lay follower, or a female lay follower cannot cause a schism in the Sangha, even if she makes an effort to cause a schism. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.1.27	Only a monk of regular standing, one who belongs to the same Buddhist sect and is present within the same monastic boundary, can cause a schism in the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.1	“Venerable Sir, we speak of ‘schism in the Sangha’. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.2	But how is there schism in the Sangha?” 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.3	“Take the case when monks proclaim what is contrary to the Teaching as the Teaching. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.4	They proclaim what is the Teaching as contrary to the Teaching. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.5	They proclaim what is contrary to the Monastic Law as the Monastic Law. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.6	They proclaim what is the Monastic Law as contrary to the Monastic Law. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.7	They proclaim what hasn’t been spoken by the Buddha as spoken by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.8	They proclaim what has been spoken by the Buddha as not spoken by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.9	They proclaim what was not practiced by the Buddha as practiced by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.10	They proclaim what was practiced by the Buddha as not practiced by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.11	They proclaim what was not laid down by the Buddha as laid down by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.12	They proclaim what was laid down by the Buddha as not laid down by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.13	They proclaim a non-offense as an offense. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.14	They proclaim an offense as a non-offense. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.15	They proclaim a light offense as heavy. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.16	They proclaim a heavy offense as light. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.17	They proclaim a curable offense as incurable. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.18	They proclaim an incurable offense as curable. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.19	They proclaim a grave offense as minor. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.20	They proclaim a minor offense as grave. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.2.21	If, based on any of these eighteen grounds, they pull away and separate, and they do the observance-day procedure, the invitation procedure, or legal procedures of the Sangha separately, then there is a schism in the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-kd17:5.3.1	“Venerable Sir, we speak of ‘unity in the Sangha’. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.3.2	But how is there unity in the Sangha?” 
pli-tv-kd17:5.3.3	“Take the case when monks proclaim what is contrary to the Teaching as contrary to the Teaching. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.3.4	They proclaim what is the Teaching as the Teaching. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.3.5	They proclaim what is contrary to the Monastic Law as contrary to the Monastic Law.

pli-tv-kd17:5.3.22	then there is unity in the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-kd17:5.4.1	“But, Sir, what is the consequence of causing a schism in a united Sangha?” 
pli-tv-kd17:5.4.2	“Anyone who causes a schism in a united Sangha does a bad act with effect for an eon; he’s boiled in hell for an eon. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.4.3	‘Going downwards, bound for hell—
pli-tv-kd17:5.4.4	The schismatic stays there for an eon. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.4.5	Delighting in division and immoral, 
pli-tv-kd17:5.4.6	Barred from sanctuary, 
pli-tv-kd17:5.4.7	Having divided a united Sangha, 
pli-tv-kd17:5.4.8	He boils in hell for an eon.’” 
pli-tv-kd17:5.4.9	“But, Sir, what is the consequence of uniting a schismatic sangha?” 
pli-tv-kd17:5.4.10	“Anyone who unites a schismatic sangha generates supreme merit; he rejoices in heaven for an eon. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.4.11	‘Pleasant is unity in the Sangha, 
pli-tv-kd17:5.4.12	And to help in fostering harmony. 
pli-tv-kd17:5.4.13	Delighting in unity and moral, 
pli-tv-kd17:5.4.14	Not barred from sanctuary, 
pli-tv-kd17:5.4.15	Having united the Sangha, 
pli-tv-kd17:5.4.16	He rejoices in heaven for an eon.’” 
pli-tv-kd17:5.5.1	“Might one who causes a schism in the Sangha be irredeemably destined to an eon in hell?” 
pli-tv-kd17:5.5.2	“He might.” 
pli-tv-kd17:5.5.3	“Might one who causes a schism in the Sangha not be irredeemably destined to an eon in hell?” 
pli-tv-kd17:5.5.4	“He might.” 
pli-tv-kd17:5.5.5	“What sort of person who causes a schism in the Sangha is irredeemably destined to an eon in hell?”

pli-tv-kd18:0.3	The chapter on proper conduct 
pli-tv-kd18:0.4	1. Discussion of the proper conduct for newly arrived monks 
pli-tv-kd18:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.1.2	At that time newly arrived monks entered the monastery wearing sandals, holding sunshades, with their heads covered, with their robes on their heads; and they washed their feet with drinking water, did not bow down to the more senior resident monks, and did not ask about dwellings. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.1.3	A certain newly arrived monk unlocked the bolt of an unoccupied dwelling, opened the door, and entered hastily. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.1.4	A snake fell from the top of the door frame onto his shoulders. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.1.5	Terrified, he screamed. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.1.6	The monks came running to 
pli-tv-kd18:1.1.7	and asked why he was screaming. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.1.8	And he told them. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.1.9	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd18:1.1.10	“How can the newly arrived monks enter the monastery wearing sandals, holding sunshades, with their heads covered, with their robe on their head; and wash their feet with drinking water, not bow down to the more senior resident monks, and not ask about dwellings?” 
pli-tv-kd18:1.1.11	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd18:1.1.12	“Is it true, monks, that the newly arrived monks act like this?” 
pli-tv-kd18:1.1.13	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd18:1.1.14	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-kd18:1.1.15	“How can the newly arrived monks act like this? This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” 
pli-tv-kd18:1.1.16	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd18:1.1.17	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd18:1.1.18	“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct for newly arrived monks. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.1	When a newly arrived monk enters a monastery, he should remove his sandals, hold them low, knock them together, and carry them along; he should lower his sunshade, uncover his head, and put his robe over his shoulders; he should then enter the monastery carefully and without hurry. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.2	As he enters the monastery, 
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.3	he should look out for where the resident monks gather—
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.5	whether it’s in the assembly hall, under a roof-cover, or at the foot of a tree—
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.6	and he should go there. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.7	He should then put his bowl and robe aside, 
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.8	and sit down on a suitable seat. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.9	He should ask 
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.10	which is the water for drinking and which the water for washing. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.11	If he needs water to drink, he may take some and drink. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.12	If he needs water to wash, he may take some and wash his feet. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.13	When he washes his feet, he should pour the water with one hand and wash with the other. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.14	He should not pour the water and wash his feet with the same hand. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.15	He should ask for a sandal-wiping cloth, and then wipe them. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.16	When he wipes his sandals, he should first wipe them with a dry cloth, then a wet one. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.17	He should wash the cloth and put it aside. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.18	If a resident monk is more senior, the newly arrived monk should bow down to him. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.19	If a resident monk is more junior, he should bow down to the newly arrived monk. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.20	The newly arrived monk should ask which dwelling he may use 
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.21	and whether it’s occupied or not. He should ask about where to go for alms and where to avoid, about any families designated as “in training”, about the place for defecating and the place for urinating, about the water for drinking and the water for washing, about walking sticks, and about the Sangha’s agreements 
pli-tv-kd18:1.2.22	concerning the right time to enter and the right time to leave. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.3.1	If the dwelling is unoccupied, he should knock on the door, wait for a moment, then unlock the bolt, open the door, and look inside while standing outside. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.3.2	If the dwelling is dirty, and if beds or benches are stacked on top of one another with furniture in a pile on top, he should clean it if he is able. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.3.3	When he is cleaning the dwelling, he should first take out the floor cover and put it aside. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.3.4	He should take out the bed supports and put them aside. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.3.5	He should take out the mattress and the pillow and put them aside. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.3.6	He should take out the sitting mat and the sheet and put them aside. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.3.7	Holding the bed low, he should carefully take it out without scratching it or knocking it against the door or the door frame, and he should put it aside. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.3.8	Holding the bench low, he should carefully take it out without scratching it or knocking it against the door or the door frame, and he should put it aside. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.3.9	He should take out the spittoon and put it aside. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.3.10	He should take out the leaning board and put it aside. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.3.11	If the dwelling has cobwebs, he should first remove them from the ceiling cloth, and he should then wipe the windows and the corners of the room. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.3.12	If the walls have been treated with red ocher and they’re moldy, he should moisten a cloth, wring it out, and wipe the walls. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.3.13	If the floor has been treated with black and it’s moldy, he should moisten a cloth, wring it out, and wipe the floor. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.3.14	If the floor is untreated, he should sprinkle it with water and then sweep it, 
pli-tv-kd18:1.3.15	while trying to avoid stirring up dust. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.3.16	He should look out for any trash and discard it. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.4.1	He should sun the floor cover, clean it, beat it, bring it back inside, and put it back in the same place as before. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.4.2	He should sun the bed supports, wipe them, bring them back inside, and place them in the same position as before. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.4.3	He should sun the bed, clean it, and beat it. Holding it low, he should carefully bring it back inside without scratching it or knocking it against the door or the door frame, and he should put in the same place as before. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.4.4	He should sun the bench, clean it, and beat it. Holding it low, he should carefully bring it back inside without scratching it or knocking it against the door or the door frame, and he should put it back in the same place as before. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.4.5	He should sun the mattress and the pillow, clean them, beat them, bring them back inside, and put them back the way they were. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.4.6	He should sun the sitting mat and the sheet, clean them, beat them, bring them back inside, and put them back the way they were. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.4.7	He should sun the spittoon, wipe it, bring it back inside, and put it back where it was. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.4.8	He should sun the leaning board, wipe it, bring it back inside, and put it back where it was. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.5.1	He should put away the bowl and robe. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.5.2	When putting away the bowl, he should hold the bowl in one hand, feel under the bed or the bench with the other, and then put it away. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.5.3	He should not put away the bowl on the bare ground. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.5.4	When putting away the robe, he should hold the robe in one hand, wipe the bamboo robe-rack or the clothesline with the other, and then put it away by folding the robe over it, making the ends face the wall and the fold face out. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.5.5	If dusty winds are blowing from the east, he should close the windows on the eastern side. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.5.6	If dusty winds are blowing from the west, he should close the windows on the western side. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.5.7	If dusty winds are blowing from the north, he should close the windows on the northern side. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.5.8	If dusty winds are blowing from the south, he should close the windows on the southern side. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.5.9	If the weather is cold, he should open the windows during the day and close them at night. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.5.10	If the weather is hot, he should close the windows during the day and open them at night. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.5.11	If the precincts are dirty, he should sweep them. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.5.12	If the gateway is dirty, he should sweep it. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.5.13	If the assembly hall is dirty, he should sweep it. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.5.14	If the water-boiling shed is dirty, he should sweep it. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.5.15	If the restroom is dirty, he should sweep it. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.5.16	If there is no water for drinking, he should set it out. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.5.17	If there is no water for washing, he should set it out. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.5.18	If there is no water in the rinsing pot, he should fill it. 
pli-tv-kd18:1.5.19	This is the proper conduct for newly arrived monks.” 
pli-tv-kd18:2.1.0	2. Discussion of the proper conduct for resident monks 
pli-tv-kd18:2.1.1	At that time, when they saw newly arrived monks, the resident monks did not prepare seats, or put out foot-stools, foot-scrapers, or water for washing the feet. They did not go out to meet them to receive their bowls and robes, or ask if they wanted water to drink. They did not bow down to more senior newly arrived monks or assign dwellings to them. 
pli-tv-kd18:2.1.2	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd18:2.1.3	“How can the resident monks act like this?” 
pli-tv-kd18:2.1.4	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd18:2.1.5	“Is it true, monks, that the resident monks are acting like this?” 
pli-tv-kd18:2.1.6	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd18:2.1.7	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd18:2.1.8	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd18:2.1.9	“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct for resident monks. 
pli-tv-kd18:2.2.1	When a resident monk sees a newly arrived monk who is more senior, he should prepare a seat, and put out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, and water for washing the feet. He should go out to meet him to receive his bowl and robe, and ask if he wants water to drink. 
pli-tv-kd18:2.2.2	If he is able, he should wipe his sandals, 
pli-tv-kd18:2.2.3	first with a dry cloth and then a wet one. 
pli-tv-kd18:2.2.4	He should wash the cloth and put it aside. 
pli-tv-kd18:2.2.5	If the newly arrived monk is more senior, the resident monk should bow down to him. 
pli-tv-kd18:2.2.6	He should assign a dwelling, 
pli-tv-kd18:2.2.7	tell him where it is, 
pli-tv-kd18:2.2.8	and inform him whether it’s occupied or not. 
pli-tv-kd18:2.2.9	He should tell him where to go for alms 
pli-tv-kd18:2.2.10	and where to avoid, 
pli-tv-kd18:2.2.11	and about any families designated as “in training”. 
pli-tv-kd18:2.2.12	He should point out the place for defecating

pli-tv-kd18:2.2.15	and the water for washing, 
pli-tv-kd18:2.2.16	and the walking sticks. 
pli-tv-kd18:2.2.17	He should tell him about the Sangha’s agreements 
pli-tv-kd18:2.2.18	concerning the right time to enter and the right time to leave. 
pli-tv-kd18:2.3.1	If the newly arrived monk is more junior, the resident monk should remain seated 
pli-tv-kd18:2.3.2	while telling him where to put his bowl and robe, and which seat to sit on. 
pli-tv-kd18:2.3.3	He should point out the water for drinking 
pli-tv-kd18:2.3.4	and the water for washing, 
pli-tv-kd18:2.3.5	as well as a sandal-wiping cloth. 
pli-tv-kd18:2.3.6	If the newly arrived monk is more junior, he should bow down to the resident monk. 
pli-tv-kd18:2.3.7	The resident monk should tell him 
pli-tv-kd18:2.3.8	where his dwelling is 
pli-tv-kd18:2.3.9	and whether it’s occupied or not. 
pli-tv-kd18:2.3.10	He should tell him where to go for alms

pli-tv-kd18:2.3.19	concerning the right time to enter and the right time to leave. 
pli-tv-kd18:2.3.20	This is the proper conduct for resident monks.” 
pli-tv-kd18:3.1.0	3. Discussion of the proper conduct for departing monks 
pli-tv-kd18:3.1.1	At that time the monks departed without putting the wooden and ceramic goods in order, while leaving the door and the windows open, and without taking leave. 
pli-tv-kd18:3.1.2	Wooden and ceramic goods were lost 
pli-tv-kd18:3.1.3	and the dwelling was unprotected. 
pli-tv-kd18:3.1.4	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd18:3.1.5	“How can the departing monks act like this?” 
pli-tv-kd18:3.1.8	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:

pli-tv-kd18:3.1.11	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd18:3.1.12	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd18:3.1.13	“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct for departing monks. 
pli-tv-kd18:3.2.1	Before he departs, a monk should put the wooden and ceramic goods in order, close the door and the windows, and take leave. 
pli-tv-kd18:3.2.2	If there are no monks, he should take leave of a novice monk; 
pli-tv-kd18:3.2.3	if there are no novice monks, he should take leave of a monastery worker; 
pli-tv-kd18:3.2.4	if there are no monastery workers, he should take leave of a lay follower. 
pli-tv-kd18:3.2.5	If there are no monks, novice monks, monastery workers, or lay followers, he should place the bed on four rocks. He should stack the beds or benches on top of one another, with the furniture in a pile on top, and put away the wooden and ceramic goods. He should close the door and the windows, and then depart. 
pli-tv-kd18:3.3.1	If rain enters the dwelling, he should cover it if he is able, or he should make an effort 
pli-tv-kd18:3.3.2	to have it covered. 
pli-tv-kd18:3.3.3	If this works out, all is well. 
pli-tv-kd18:3.3.4	If not, he should place the bed on four rocks in an area that isn’t getting wet. He should then stack the beds or benches on top of one another, with the furniture in a pile on top, and put away the wooden and ceramic goods. He should close the door and the windows, and then depart. 
pli-tv-kd18:3.3.5	If the whole dwelling is getting wet, he should carry the furniture to the village if he is able, or he should make an effort 
pli-tv-kd18:3.3.6	to have it carried to the village. 
pli-tv-kd18:3.3.7	If this works out, all is well.

pli-tv-kd18:3.3.9	thinking, ‘Hopefully the requisites will be okay.’ 
pli-tv-kd18:3.3.10	This is the proper conduct for departing monks.” 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.0	4. Discussion of the proper conduct in connection with the expression of appreciation 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.1	At that time the monks did not express their appreciation in the dining hall. 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.2	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.3	“How can the Sakyan monastics not express their appreciation in the dining hall?” 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.4	The monks heard the complaints of those people 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.5	and they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.6	The Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.7	“You should express your appreciation in the dining hall.” 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.8	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.9	“Who should give the expression of appreciation?” 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.10	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.11	He gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.12	“The most senior monk should give the expression of appreciation in the dining hall.” 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.13	Soon afterwards a certain association was offering a meal to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.14	Venerable Sāriputta was the most senior monk. 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.16	Because the Buddha had said the most senior monk should give the expression of appreciation, 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.17	the monks left, leaving Sāriputta behind by himself. 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.18	After giving the expression of appreciation, he left by himself. 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.19	The Buddha saw him coming 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.20	and asked, 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.21	“Did the meal go well?” 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.22	“The meal went well, Venerable Sir, 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.23	but the monks all left leaving me behind by myself.” 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.24	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.25	“The four or five most senior monks should wait in the dining hall.” 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.26	On one occasion a senior monk who needed to defecate was waiting in the dining hall. 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.27	Being unable to hold out, he fainted and fell over. 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.28	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd18:4.1.29	“When there is something to be done, I allow you to go after taking leave of the monk sitting next to you.” 
pli-tv-kd18:4.2.0	5. Discussion of the proper conduct in relation to the dining hall 
pli-tv-kd18:4.2.1	At that time the monks from the group of six went to the dining hall shabbily dressed and improper in appearance; going the wrong way, they went ahead of the senior monks; they sat down encroaching on the senior monks; they blocked the junior monks from seats; and they spread out their upper robes and sat on them in inhabited areas. 
pli-tv-kd18:4.2.2	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd18:4.2.3	“How can the monks from the group of six act like this?” 
pli-tv-kd18:4.2.4	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd18:4.2.5	“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are acting like this?” 
pli-tv-kd18:4.2.6	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd18:4.2.7	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd18:4.2.8	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd18:4.2.9	“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct in relation to the dining hall.

pli-tv-kd18:5.1.0	6. Discussion of the proper conduct for alms-collectors 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.1	At that time there were alms-collecting monks who were shabbily dressed and improper in appearance. They entered and left houses without being attentive; they entered and left too hastily; they stood too far away or too close; they waited too long or left too soon. 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.2	On one occasion a certain monk entered a house without being attentive. 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.3	Thinking it was the main door, he entered a room 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.4	where a woman was sleeping naked. 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.5	The monk saw her 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.7	and left the room. 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.8	Seeing her lying there, 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.10	the woman’s husband thought, “My wife has been raped by this monk,” and he took hold of that monk and gave him a beating. 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.11	The woman woke up from the noise and asked her husband, 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.12	“Why are you beating this monk?” 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.13	“Didn’t he rape you?” 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.14	“No he didn’t; 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.15	he didn’t do anything.” And she had him release that monk. 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.16	The monk returned to the monastery and told the monks what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.17	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.18	“How can the alms-collecting monks act like this?” 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.19	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.20	“Is it true, monks, that the alms-collecting monks are acting like this?” 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.21	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.22	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.23	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd18:5.1.24	“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct for alms-collecting monks.

pli-tv-kd18:5.3.1	“Whoever returns first from almsround in the village should prepare the seats and set out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, and water for washing the feet. He should clean the bowl for leftovers and set it out, and put out water for drinking and water for washing. 
pli-tv-kd18:5.3.2	Whoever returns last from almsround may eat whatever is leftover, 
pli-tv-kd18:5.3.3	or he should discard it where there are no cultivated plants or in water without life. 
pli-tv-kd18:5.3.4	He should put away the seats and also the foot-stool, the foot-scraper, and the water for washing the feet. He should clean the bowl for leftovers and put it away, put away the water for drinking and the water for washing, and sweep the dining hall.

pli-tv-kd18:5.3.6	If he can’t do it by himself, he should call someone over by hand signal and they should fill it together. He should not speak because of that. 
pli-tv-kd18:5.3.7	This is the proper conduct for alms-collectors.” 
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.0	7. Discussion of the proper conduct for those staying in the wilderness 
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.1	At that time there was a number of monks staying in the wilderness. 
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.2	They did not set out water for drinking or water for washing; they did not light fires or provide upper and lower fire sticks; and they did not know the constellations or the cardinal directions. 
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.3	Criminals went to that place and asked the monks, 
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.4	“Sir, is there any water for drinking?” —
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.5	“No, there isn’t.” —
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.6	“Is there any water for washing?” —
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.7	“No.” —
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.8	“Is there a fire?” —
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.9	“No.” —
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.10	“Are there any upper and lower fire sticks?” —
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.11	“No.” —
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.12	“Which constellation is the moon in today?” —
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.13	“We don’t know.” —
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.14	“Which direction is this?” —
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.15	“We don’t know.” 
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.16	Thinking, 
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.18	“They are criminals, not monks,” 
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.19	they beat them up and left. 
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.20	The monks told other monks what had happened 
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.21	and they in turn told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd18:6.1.22	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

pli-tv-kd18:7.1.3	The robe-making monks became dusty. 
pli-tv-kd18:7.1.4	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd18:7.1.5	“How can the monks from the group of six do this?” 
pli-tv-kd18:7.1.7	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:

pli-tv-kd18:8.1.0	9. Discussion of the proper conduct in regard to saunas 
pli-tv-kd18:8.1.1	On one occasion the monks from the group of six were kept out of the sauna by the senior monks. Then, out of disrespect, they stacked up much firewood, lit it, closed the door, and sat down against it. 
pli-tv-kd18:8.1.2	The monks overheated, but being unable to open the door, they fainted and collapsed. 
pli-tv-kd18:8.1.3	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,

pli-tv-kd18:8.1.10	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd18:8.1.11	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

pli-tv-kd18:8.1.13	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd18:8.1.14	And you should not close the door and sit down against it. 
pli-tv-kd18:8.1.15	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.

pli-tv-kd18:9.1.1	At that time a monk who had been born as a brahmin did not want to rinse after defecating, thinking, 
pli-tv-kd18:9.1.2	“Who would touch this foul, stinking stuff?” 
pli-tv-kd18:9.1.3	As a result, a worm settled in his anus. 
pli-tv-kd18:9.1.4	He told the monks, who said, 
pli-tv-kd18:9.1.5	“So you don’t rinse after defecating?” 
pli-tv-kd18:9.1.6	“That’s right.”

pli-tv-kd18:9.1.8	“How can a monk not rinse after defecating?” 
pli-tv-kd18:9.1.9	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd18:9.1.10	“Is it true, monk, that you don’t rinse after defecating?” 
pli-tv-kd18:9.1.11	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd18:9.1.12	after rebuking them … 
pli-tv-kd18:9.1.13	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd18:9.1.14	“When there is water available, you should rinse after defecating. 
pli-tv-kd18:9.1.15	If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd18:10.1.1	At that time the monks used the restroom according to seniority. 
pli-tv-kd18:10.1.2	Junior monks who had arrived before others had to wait to defecate. 
pli-tv-kd18:10.1.3	Holding it in, they fainted and collapsed. 
pli-tv-kd18:10.1.4	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd18:10.1.5	“Is it true, monks, that this is happening?” 
pli-tv-kd18:10.1.6	“It’s true, Sir.” … and the Buddha addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd18:10.1.7	“The restroom should not be used according to seniority. 
pli-tv-kd18:10.1.8	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd18:10.1.9	You should use the restroom according to the order of arrival.”

pli-tv-kd18:12.11.207	the teacher should try to find a way for the Sangha to get it done. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.208	If the pupil has committed a heavy offense and deserves to be given the trial period, 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.209	the teacher should try to find a way for the Sangha to get it done. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.210	If the pupil has committed a heavy offense and deserves rehabilitation, 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.211	the teacher should try to find a way for the Sangha to get it done. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.212	If the Sangha wants to do a legal procedure against his pupil—whether a procedure of condemnation, demotion, banishment, reconciliation, or ejection—
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.213	the teacher should make an effort to stop it or to reduce the penalty. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.214	But if the Sangha has already done a legal procedure against his pupil—whether a procedure of condemnation, demotion, banishment, reconciliation, or ejection—
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.215	the teacher should help the pupil conduct himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released, and try for the Sangha to lift that procedure. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.216	“If the pupil’s robe needs washing, the teacher should show him how to do it, 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.217	or he should make an effort to have it done. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.218	If the pupil needs a robe, the teacher should show him how to make one, 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.219	or he should make an effort to have one made. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.220	If the pupil needs dye, the teacher should show him how to make it, 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.221	or he should make an effort to have it made. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.222	If the pupil’s robe needs dyeing, the teacher should show him how to do it, 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.223	or he should make an effort to have it done. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.224	When he’s dyeing the robe, he should carefully and repeatedly turn it over, 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.225	and he shouldn’t go away while it’s still dripping. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.226	If his pupil is sick, he should nurse him for as long as he lives, or he should wait until he has recovered. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.227	This is the proper conduct of a teacher toward his pupil.” 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.228	The eighth chapter on proper conduct is finished. In this chapter there are nineteen topics and fourteen kinds of proper conduct. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.544	If you do not fulfill the proper conduct, 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.545	Then you do not fulfill your virtue. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.546	If your virtue is impure, you are weak in wisdom; 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.547	And you do not know the unity of mind. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.548	A mind distracted, not unified, 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.549	Does not see the truth of nature. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.550	Not seeing the truth of nature, 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.551	You are not released from suffering. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.552	But if you do fulfill the proper conduct, 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.553	Then you also fulfill your virtue. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.554	If your virtue is pure, you are possessed of wisdom; 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.555	And you know the unity of mind. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.556	A non-distracted mind, unified, 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.557	Sees the truth of nature. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.558	Seeing the truth of nature, 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.559	You are released from suffering.
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.560	So, fulfill the proper conduct,
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.561	you the Son of the Conqueror, possessed of insight. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.562	The instruction of the Buddha, the best—
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.563	Go from that to extinguishment, in this way. 
pli-tv-kd18:12.11.564	The chapter on proper conduct is finished.
pli-tv-kd19:0.1	Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law 
pli-tv-kd19:0.2	The Short Division 
pli-tv-kd19:0.3	The chapter on the cancellation of the Monastic Code 
pli-tv-kd19:0.4	1. The request for the recitation of the Monastic Code 
pli-tv-kd19:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, in Migāramāta’s stilt house. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.1.2	On one occasion on the observance day, he was seated surrounded by the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.1.3	Then, when the night was well advanced and the first part of the night was over, Venerable Ānanda got up from his seat, put his upper robe over one shoulder, raise his joined palms, and said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd19:1.1.4	“Venerable Sir, the night is well advanced and the first part of the night is over. The Sangha of monks has been seated for a long time. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.1.5	Please recite the Monastic Code.” 
pli-tv-kd19:1.1.6	But the Buddha did not reply. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.1.7	At the end of the middle part of the night, Venerable Ānanda asked a second time, 
pli-tv-kd19:1.1.10	and again received no reply. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.1.11	At the end of the last part of the night, when the sky was flaring up at dawn, he asked a third time. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.1.14	And the Buddha replied, “Ānanda, the gathering is impure.” 
pli-tv-kd19:1.2.1	Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought, 
pli-tv-kd19:1.2.2	“Who is the Buddha talking about?” 
pli-tv-kd19:1.2.4	He then read the minds of the the entire Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.2.5	And he saw that person—immoral, with bad qualities, impure and dubious in conduct, hiding his actions, not a monastic while claiming to be one, not abstaining from sexuality while claiming to do so, rotten inside, lustful, defiled—seated in the midst of the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.2.6	He went up to him and said, 
pli-tv-kd19:1.2.7	“Get up, the Buddha has seen you. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.2.8	You don’t belong to the community of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd19:1.2.9	But he did not reply. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.2.10	Mahāmoggallāna said the same thing a second 
pli-tv-kd19:1.2.14	and a third time, 
pli-tv-kd19:1.2.17	still not getting a reply. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.2.18	Mahāmoggallāna then grabbed him by the arms, took him outside the gateway, and fastened the bolts. And he went to the Buddha and said, 
pli-tv-kd19:1.2.19	“Sir, I have taken that person outside; 
pli-tv-kd19:1.2.20	the gathering is pure. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.2.21	Please recite the Monastic Code to the monks.” 
pli-tv-kd19:1.2.22	“It’s amazing, Moggallāna, how that fool waited until he was grabbed by the arms.” 
pli-tv-kd19:1.2.23	And the Buddha addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd19:1.3.0	2. The eight amazing qualities of the ocean 
pli-tv-kd19:1.3.1	“Monks, the antigods delight in the ocean when they see these eight amazing qualities in it: 
pli-tv-kd19:1.3.3	The ocean slopes and inclines gradually. It does not drop off all at once. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.3.6	The ocean is steady. It does not go beyond the shoreline. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.3.9	The ocean does not tolerate dead bodies, but quickly carries them to the shore and discards them on dry land. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.3.12	When the great rivers—the Ganges, the Yamunā, the Aciravatī, the Sarabhū, or the Mahī—reach the ocean, they lose their former names and become known simply as the ocean. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.3.15	Whatever rivers in the world flow into the ocean and whatever rain falls into it, the ocean is not diminished or filled up because of that. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.3.18	The ocean has only one taste, the taste of salt. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.3.21	The ocean contains many precious things—pearls, gems, beryls, mother-of-pearls, quartz, corals, silver, gold, rubies, and cat’s eyes. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.3.24	There are great beings in the ocean—sea-monsters, antigods, dragons, and divinities; creatures with bodies one thousand kilometers long, two thousand, three thousand, four thousand, and five thousand kilometers long. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.0	3. The eight amazing qualities on this spiritual path 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.1	“Just so, the monks delight in this spiritual path when they see these eight amazing qualities in it: 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.3	Just as the ocean slopes and inclines gradually, and does not drop off all at once, 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.4	so too, on this spiritual path, the training is gradual, the practice is gradual, and penetration to perfect insight does not happen all at once. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.7	Just as the ocean is steady and does not go beyond the shoreline, 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.8	so too, on this spiritual path, my disciples don’t transgress the training rules I have laid down, even for the sake of life. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.11	Just as the ocean does not tolerate dead bodies, but quickly carries them to the shore and discards them on dry land, 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.12	so too, the Sangha of monks does not associate with anyone who is immoral—someone with bad qualities, impure and dubious in conduct, hiding his actions, not a monastic while claiming to be one, not abstaining from sexuality while claiming to do so, rotten inside, lustful, defiled. When the Sangha has gathered , they quickly eject him. Even if he is seated in the midst of the Sangha, he is far from the Sangha and the Sangha is far from him. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.15	Just as when the great rivers—the Ganges, the Yamunā, the Aciravatī, the Sarabhū, or the Mahī—reach the ocean, they lose their former names and become known simply as the ocean, 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.16	so too, when anyone who goes forth on this spiritual path made known by the Buddha—whether aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, or workers—they lose their former name and class and become known simply as Sakyans monastics. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.19	Just as the ocean does not decrease or fill up because of all the rivers in the world that flow into it or the rain that falls into it, 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.20	so too, even if many monks are extinguished without remainder, there is no decrease or filling up of the element of extinguishment. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.23	Just as the ocean has only one taste, the taste of salt, 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.24	so too, this spiritual path has only one taste, the taste of freedom. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.27	Just as the ocean contains many precious things—pearls, gems, beryls, mother-of-pearls, quartz, corals, silver, gold, rubies, and cat’s eyes—
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.28	so too, this spiritual path contains many precious things—the four applications of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four foundations for supernormal power, the five spiritual faculties, the five spiritual powers, the seven factors of awakening, and the noble eightfold path. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.31	Just as there are great beings in the ocean—sea-monsters, antigods, dragons, and divinities; creatures with bodies one thousand kilometers long, two thousand, three thousand, four thousand, and five thousand kilometers long—
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.32	so too, there are great beings on this spiritual path—stream-enterers, those practicing for the realization of the fruit of stream-entry; once-returners, those practicing for the realization of the fruit of once-returning; non-returners, those practicing for the realization of the fruit of non-returning; perfected ones, and those practicing for the realization of the fruit of perfection.” 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.36	Seeing the significance of this, on that occasion the Buddha exclaimed this inspired utterance: 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.37	“It rains on what’s concealed, 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.38	Not on what’s revealed. 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.39	Therefore, reveal the concealed, 
pli-tv-kd19:1.4.40	And it will not be rained upon.” 
pli-tv-kd19:2.1.0	4. One deserving to hear the Monastic Code 
pli-tv-kd19:2.1.1	And the Buddha addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd19:2.1.2	“From now on I won’t do the observance-day procedure or recite the Monastic Code. 
pli-tv-kd19:2.1.3	You will be doing it instead. 
pli-tv-kd19:2.1.4	It’s impossible for the Buddha to do the observance-day procedure and recite the Monastic Code in an impure gathering. 
pli-tv-kd19:2.1.5	And, monks, you should not listen to the Monastic Code if you have an unconfessed offense. 
pli-tv-kd19:2.1.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd19:2.1.7	If anyone who has an unconfessed offense listens to the Monastic Code, I allow you to cancel his hearing of the Monastic Code. 
pli-tv-kd19:2.1.8	And it’s to be done like this. 
pli-tv-kd19:2.1.9	On the observance day, whether the fourteenth or the fifteenth, in the midst of the Sangha and in the presence of that person, you should announce: 
pli-tv-kd19:2.1.10	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd19:2.1.11	The person so-and-so has an unconfessed offense. I cancel his hearing of the Monastic Code. The Monastic Code should not be recited in his presence.’ Then the Monastic Code is canceled for him.” 
pli-tv-kd19:3.1.1	Soon afterwards, 
pli-tv-kd19:3.1.2	thinking that nobody knew about them, the monks from the group of six listened to the Monastic Code while having unconfessed offenses. 
pli-tv-kd19:3.1.3	The senior monks who could read the minds of others 
pli-tv-kd19:3.1.4	informed the monks about this. 
pli-tv-kd19:3.1.6	When they heard about this, 
pli-tv-kd19:3.1.12	the monks from the group of six canceled, without reason, the Monastic Code of the pure monks to preempt them. 
pli-tv-kd19:3.1.13	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd19:3.1.14	“How can the monks from the group of six cancel the Monastic Code of pure monks without reason?” 
pli-tv-kd19:3.1.15	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd19:3.1.16	“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six did this?” 
pli-tv-kd19:3.1.17	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd19:3.1.18	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd19:3.1.19	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd19:3.1.20	“You should not, without reason, cancel the Monastic Code of pure monks who don’t have any offenses. 
pli-tv-kd19:3.1.21	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.

pli-tv-kd19:3.9.24	The first section for recitation is finished. 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.0	7. The qualities needed to raise an issue 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.1	Venerable Upāli went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.3	“Venerable Sir, if a monk wishes to raise an issue, what factors should be fulfilled?” 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.4	“If a monk who wishes to raise an issue, five factors should be fulfilled: 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.5	He should reflect 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.6	whether or not it’s the right time to raise the issue. 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.7	If he knows 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.8	it’s the wrong time, he shouldn’t raise it. 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.9	But if he knows 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.10	it’s the right time, he should reflect further 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.11	whether or not it’s a real issue. 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.12	If he knows 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.13	it’s not, he shouldn’t raise it. 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.14	But if he knows 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.15	it’s real, he should reflect further 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.16	whether or not raising the issue will be beneficial. 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.17	If he knows 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.18	it won’t, he shouldn’t raise it. 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.19	But if he knows 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.20	it will be beneficial, he should reflect further 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.21	whether or not the monks who are on the side of the Teaching and the Monastic Law will take his side. 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.22	If he knows 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.23	that they won’t, he shouldn’t raise it. 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.24	But if he knows 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.25	they will take his side, he should reflect further 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.26	whether or not raising the issue will lead to arguments and disputes, to fracture and schism in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.27	If he knows 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.28	it will, he shouldn’t raise it. 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.29	But if he knows 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.30	it won’t, he may raise the issue. 
pli-tv-kd19:4.1.31	In this way, when five factors are fulfilled, he won’t regret raising it.” 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.0	8. The qualities to be reflected upon by one who accuses another 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.1	“Sir, how many qualities should a monk see in himself before accusing another?” 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.2	“A monk should see five qualities in himself before accusing another. 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.3	Before accusing another, a monk should reflect, 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.4	‘Is my bodily conduct pure and faultless? Is this quality found in me or not?’ 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.5	If it’s not, there will be those who say, 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.6	‘Please train your own bodily conduct first.’ 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.7	Before accusing another, a monk should reflect, 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.8	‘Is my verbal conduct pure and faultless? Is this quality found in me or not?’ 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.9	If it’s not, 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.10	there will be those who say, 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.11	‘Please train your own verbal conduct first.’ 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.12	Before accusing another, a monk should reflect, 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.13	‘Do I have a mind of good will toward my fellow monastics? Am I free from ill will toward them? Is this quality found in me or not?’ 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.14	If it’s not, there will be those who say, 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.15	‘Please set up a mind of good will toward your fellow monastics first.’ 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.16	Before accusing another, a monk should reflect, 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.17	‘Have I learned much and do I retain and accumulate what I’ve learned? Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, that have a true goal and are well articulated, and that set out the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life—have I learned many such teachings, retained them in mind, recited them verbally, mentally investigated them, and penetrated them well by view? Is this quality found in me or not?’  
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.18	If it’s not, there will be those who say, 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.19	‘Please learn the tradition first.’ 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.20	Before accusing another, a monk should reflect, 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.21	‘Have I properly learned both Monastic Codes in detail; have I analyzed them well, thoroughly mastered them, and investigated them well, both in terms of the rules and their detailed exposition? Is this quality found in me or not?’ 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.22	If it’s not, then when he is asked, ‘Where was this said by the Buddha?’ he won’t be able to reply. And there will be those who say, 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.23	‘Please learn the Monastic Law first.’ 
pli-tv-kd19:5.1.24	A monk should see these five qualities in himself before accusing another.” 
pli-tv-kd19:5.2.0	9. The qualities to be set up by one who accuses another 
pli-tv-kd19:5.2.1	“Sir, how many qualities should a monk set up in himself before accusing another?” 
pli-tv-kd19:5.2.2	“A monk should set up five qualities in himself before accusing another. He should think, 
pli-tv-kd19:5.2.3	‘I’ll speak at an appropriate time, not at an inappropriate one; 
pli-tv-kd19:5.2.4	I’ll speak the truth, not falsehood; 
pli-tv-kd19:5.2.5	I’ll speak gently, not harshly; 
pli-tv-kd19:5.2.6	I’ll speak what’s beneficial, not what’s unbeneficial; 
pli-tv-kd19:5.2.7	I’ll speak with a mind of good will, not with internal ill will.’” 
pli-tv-kd19:5.3.0	10. Discussion on the one who accuses and the one who is accused 
pli-tv-kd19:5.3.1	“Sir, if a monk accuses another illegitimately, in how many ways should regret be aroused in him?” 
pli-tv-kd19:5.3.2	“Regret should be aroused in him in five ways: 
pli-tv-kd19:5.3.3	‘Venerable, you’re accusing at the wrong time, not the right time; it’s appropriate for you to have regret. 
pli-tv-kd19:5.3.4	You’re accusing falsely, not truthfully; it’s appropriate for you to have regret. 
pli-tv-kd19:5.3.5	You’re accusing harshly, not gently; it’s appropriate for you to have regret. 
pli-tv-kd19:5.3.6	You’re accusing unbeneficially, not beneficially; it’s appropriate for you to have regret. 
pli-tv-kd19:5.3.7	You’re accusing with internal ill will, not with a mind of good will; it’s appropriate for you to have regret.’ 
pli-tv-kd19:5.3.8	These are the five ways regret should be aroused in a monk who accuses another illegitimately. 
pli-tv-kd19:5.3.9	For what reason? 
pli-tv-kd19:5.3.10	So that other monks won’t think to accuse others falsely.” 
pli-tv-kd19:5.4.1	“And if a monk has been accused illegitimately, in how many ways should non-regret be aroused in him?” 
pli-tv-kd19:5.4.2	“Non-regret should be aroused in him in five ways: 
pli-tv-kd19:5.4.3	‘Venerable, you have been accused at the wrong time, not the right time; there is no need for you to have regret. 
pli-tv-kd19:5.4.4	You have been accused falsely, not truthfully; there is no need for you to have regret. 
pli-tv-kd19:5.4.5	You have been accused harshly, not gently; there is no need for you to have regret. 
pli-tv-kd19:5.4.6	You have been accused unbeneficially, not beneficially; there is no need for you to have regret. 
pli-tv-kd19:5.4.7	You have been accused with internal ill will, not with a mind of good will; there is no need for you to have regret.’” 
pli-tv-kd19:5.5.1	“And if a monk accuses another legitimately, in how many ways should non-regret be aroused in him?” 
pli-tv-kd19:5.5.2	“Non-regret should be aroused in him in five ways: 
pli-tv-kd19:5.5.3	‘Venerable, you’re accusing at the right time, not the wrong time; there is no need for you to have regret. 
pli-tv-kd19:5.5.4	You’re accusing truthfully, not falsely; there is no need for you to have regret. 
pli-tv-kd19:5.5.5	You’re accusing gently, not harshly; there is no need for you to have regret. 
pli-tv-kd19:5.5.6	You’re accusing beneficially, not unbeneficially; there is no need for you to have regret. 
pli-tv-kd19:5.5.7	You’re accusing with a mind of good will, not with internal ill will; there is no need for you to have regret.’ 
pli-tv-kd19:5.5.8	These are the five ways non-regret should be aroused in a monk who accuses another legitimately. 
pli-tv-kd19:5.5.9	For what reason? 
pli-tv-kd19:5.5.10	So that other monks will think to accuse others truthfully.” 
pli-tv-kd19:5.6.1	“And if a monk has been accused legitimately, in how many ways should regret be aroused in him?” 
pli-tv-kd19:5.6.2	“Regret should be aroused in him in five ways: 
pli-tv-kd19:5.6.3	‘Venerable, you have been accused at the right time, not the wrong time; it’s appropriate for you to have regret. 
pli-tv-kd19:5.6.4	You have been accused truthfully, not falsely; it’s appropriate for you to have regret. 
pli-tv-kd19:5.6.5	You have been accused gently, not harshly; it’s appropriate for you to have regret. 
pli-tv-kd19:5.6.6	You have been accused beneficially, not unbeneficially; it’s appropriate for you to have regret. 
pli-tv-kd19:5.6.7	You have been accused with a mind of good will, not with internal ill will; it’s appropriate for you to have regret.’” 
pli-tv-kd19:5.7.1	“And, Sir, how many qualities should a monk attend to in himself before accusing another?” 
pli-tv-kd19:5.7.2	“A monk should attend to five qualities in himself before accusing another: 
pli-tv-kd19:5.7.3	compassion, being of benefit, sympathy, the idea of clearing offenses, and the idea of giving priority to the training.” 
pli-tv-kd19:5.7.5	“And how many qualities should a monk who has been accused set up?” 
pli-tv-kd19:5.7.6	“A monk who has been accused should set up two qualities: 
pli-tv-kd19:5.7.7	truth and composure.”

pli-tv-kd1:0.2	The Long Division 
pli-tv-kd1:0.3	The long chapter 
pli-tv-kd1:1.0.1	1. The story at the Bodhi tree 
pli-tv-kd1:1.0.2	Homage to the Buddha, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One 
pli-tv-kd1:1.1.1	At one time, soon after his awakening, the Buddha was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the river Nerañjara at the foot of a Bodhi tree. 
pli-tv-kd1:1.1.2	There the Buddha sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom. 
pli-tv-kd1:1.2.1	Then, in the first part of the night, the Buddha reflected on dependent origination in forward and reverse order: 
pli-tv-kd1:1.2.2	“Ignorance is a condition for intentional activities; intentional activities are a condition for consciousness; consciousness is a condition for name and form; name and form are a condition for the six sense spheres; the six sense spheres are a condition for contact; contact is a condition for feeling; feeling is a condition for craving; craving is a condition for grasping; grasping is a condition for existence; existence is a condition for birth; birth is a condition for old age and death, for grief, sorrow, pain, aversion, and distress to come to be. 
pli-tv-kd1:1.2.3	This is how there is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. 
pli-tv-kd1:1.2.4	“But with the complete fading away and end of ignorance comes the end of intentional activities; with the end of intentional activities comes the end of consciousness; with the end of consciousness comes the end of name and form; with the end of name and form comes the end of the six sense spheres; with the end of the six sense spheres comes the end of contact; with the end of contact comes the end of feeling; with the end of feeling comes the end of craving; with the end of craving comes the end of grasping; with the end of grasping comes the end of existence; with the end of existence comes the end of birth; with the end of birth comes the end of old age and death, and the end of sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and distress. 
pli-tv-kd1:1.2.5	This is how there is the end of this whole mass of suffering.” 
pli-tv-kd1:1.3.1	Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utterance: 
pli-tv-kd1:1.3.2	“When things become clear 
pli-tv-kd1:1.3.3	To the energetic brahmin who practices absorption, 
pli-tv-kd1:1.3.4	Then all his doubts are dispelled, 
pli-tv-kd1:1.3.5	Since he understands the natural order and its conditions.” 
pli-tv-kd1:1.4.1	In the middle part of the night, the Buddha again reflected on dependent origination in forward and reverse order: 
pli-tv-kd1:1.4.2	“Ignorance is a condition for intentional activities; intentional activities are a condition for consciousness; consciousness is a condition for name and form … 
pli-tv-kd1:1.4.3	This is how there is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. … 
pli-tv-kd1:1.4.4	This is how there is the end of this whole mass of suffering.” 
pli-tv-kd1:1.5.1	Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utterance: 
pli-tv-kd1:1.5.2	“When things become clear 
pli-tv-kd1:1.5.3	To the energetic brahmin who practices absorption, 
pli-tv-kd1:1.5.4	Then all his doubts are dispelled, 
pli-tv-kd1:1.5.5	Since he’s understood the end of the conditions.” 
pli-tv-kd1:1.6.1	In the last part of the night, the Buddha again reflected on dependent origination in forward and reverse order: 
pli-tv-kd1:1.6.2	“Ignorance is a condition for intentional activities; intentional activities are a condition for consciousness; consciousness is a condition for name and form … 
pli-tv-kd1:1.6.3	This is how there is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. … 
pli-tv-kd1:1.6.4	This is how there is the end of this whole mass of suffering.” 
pli-tv-kd1:1.7.1	Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utterance: 
pli-tv-kd1:1.7.2	“When things become clear 
pli-tv-kd1:1.7.3	To the energetic brahmin who practices absorption, 
pli-tv-kd1:1.7.4	He defeats the army of the Lord of Death, 
pli-tv-kd1:1.7.5	Like the sun shining in the sky.” 
pli-tv-kd1:1.7.6	The story at the Bodhi tree is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:2.1.0	2. The story at the goat-herd’s banyan tree 
pli-tv-kd1:2.1.1	After seven days, the Buddha came out from that stillness and went from the Bodhi tree to a goat-herd’s banyan tree. There too he sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom. 
pli-tv-kd1:2.2.1	Then a conceited brahmin went up to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:2.2.2	exchanged pleasantries with him, 
pli-tv-kd1:2.2.4	and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:2.2.5	“Good Gotama, how is one a brahmin? What are the things that make one a brahmin?” 
pli-tv-kd1:2.3.1	Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utterance: 
pli-tv-kd1:2.3.2	“The brahmin who has shut out bad qualities, 
pli-tv-kd1:2.3.3	Who is humble, free from flaws, and self-controlled, 
pli-tv-kd1:2.3.4	Who has reached the end of knowledge and has lived the spiritual life—
pli-tv-kd1:2.3.5	Righteously, without being full of himself, 
pli-tv-kd1:2.3.6	He may proclaim himself a brahmin.” 
pli-tv-kd1:2.3.7	The story at the goat-herd’s banyan tree is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:3.1.0	3. The story at the powder-puff tree 
pli-tv-kd1:3.1.1	After seven days, the Buddha came out from that stillness and went from the goat-herd’s banyan tree to a powder-puff tree. There too he sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom. 
pli-tv-kd1:3.2.1	Just then an unseasonal storm was approaching, with seven days of rain, cold winds, and clouds. 
pli-tv-kd1:3.2.2	Mucalinda, the dragon king, came out from his abode. And he encircled the body of the Buddha with seven coils and spread his large hood over his head, thinking, 
pli-tv-kd1:3.2.3	“May the Buddha not be hot or cold, nor be touched by horseflies or mosquitoes, by the wind or the burning sun, or by creeping animals and insects.” 
pli-tv-kd1:3.3.1	After seven days, when he knew the sky was clear, Mucalinda unraveled his coils from the Buddha’s body and transformed himself into a young brahmin. He then stood in front of the Buddha, venerating him with joined palms raised. 
pli-tv-kd1:3.3.2	Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utterance: 
pli-tv-kd1:3.4.1	“Seclusion is bliss for the contented one, 
pli-tv-kd1:3.4.2	For the one who sees the Truth that he has heard. 
pli-tv-kd1:3.4.3	Kindness to the world is happiness, 
pli-tv-kd1:3.4.4	For the one who is harmless to living beings. 
pli-tv-kd1:3.4.5	Dispassion for the world is happiness, 
pli-tv-kd1:3.4.6	For the one who overcomes sensuality. 
pli-tv-kd1:3.4.7	But removing the conceit ʻI am’, 
pli-tv-kd1:3.4.8	This, indeed, is the highest bliss.” 
pli-tv-kd1:3.4.9	The story at the powder-puff tree is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:4.1.0	4. The story at the ape-flower tree 
pli-tv-kd1:4.1.1	After seven days, the Buddha came out from that stillness and went from the powder-puff tree to an ape-flower tree. There too he sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom. 
pli-tv-kd1:4.2.1	Just then the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika were traveling from Ukkala to that area. 
pli-tv-kd1:4.2.2	Then a god who was a former relative of theirs said to them, 
pli-tv-kd1:4.2.3	“Sirs, a Buddha who has just attained awakening is staying at the foot of an ape-flower tree. 
pli-tv-kd1:4.2.4	Go to that Buddha and offer him baked goods and honey. 
pli-tv-kd1:4.2.5	That will be for your benefit and happiness for a long time.” 
pli-tv-kd1:4.3.1	And they took baked goods and honey and went to the Buddha. They bowed down 
pli-tv-kd1:4.3.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:4.3.3	“Venerable Sir, please accept the baked goods and honey from us. That will be to our benefit and happiness for a long time.” 
pli-tv-kd1:4.4.1	The Buddha thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:4.4.2	“Buddhas don’t receive with their hands. 
pli-tv-kd1:4.4.3	In what should I receive the baked goods and honey?” 
pli-tv-kd1:4.4.4	Then, reading the mind of the Buddha, the four great kings offered him four stone bowls from the four directions, saying, 
pli-tv-kd1:4.4.5	“Here, Sir, please receive the baked goods and honey in these.” 
pli-tv-kd1:4.4.6	After receiving the baked goods and honey in one of the valuable stone bowls, the Buddha ate them. 
pli-tv-kd1:4.5.1	When Tapussa and Bhallika knew that the Buddha had finished his meal, they bowed down with their head at his feet, and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:4.5.2	“Sir, we take refuge in the Buddha and the Teaching. Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” 
pli-tv-kd1:4.5.3	By means of the double refuge, they became the first lay followers in the world. 
pli-tv-kd1:4.5.4	The story at the ape-flower tree is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:5.1.0	5. The account of the supreme being’s request 
pli-tv-kd1:5.1.1	After seven days, the Buddha came out from that stillness and went from the ape-flower tree to a goat-herd’s banyan tree, 
pli-tv-kd1:5.1.2	and he stayed there. 
pli-tv-kd1:5.2.1	Then, while in seclusion, the Buddha thought this: 
pli-tv-kd1:5.2.2	“I have discovered this profound truth, so hard to see, so hard to comprehend. It’s peaceful and sublime, subtle, beyond the intellect, and knowable only to the wise. 
pli-tv-kd1:5.2.3	But human beings delight in holding on, find pleasure in holding on, rejoice in holding on, 
pli-tv-kd1:5.2.4	and because of that it’s hard for them to see causal relationships, dependent origination. 
pli-tv-kd1:5.2.5	This too is very hard for them to see: the stilling of all intentional activities, the giving up of all ownership, the stopping of craving, fading away, ending, extinguishment. 
pli-tv-kd1:5.2.6	If I was to teach this truth, others would not understand, and that would be wearying and troublesome for me.” 
pli-tv-kd1:5.3.1	And spontaneously, these verses never heard before occurred to the Buddha: 
pli-tv-kd1:5.3.2	“What I’ve discovered with difficulty, 
pli-tv-kd1:5.3.3	There’s no point in making it known. 
pli-tv-kd1:5.3.4	For those overcome by sensual desire and ill will, 
pli-tv-kd1:5.3.5	This truth is hard to understand. 
pli-tv-kd1:5.3.6	Those who are excited by sensual desire, 
pli-tv-kd1:5.3.7	Obstructed by a mass of darkness, 
pli-tv-kd1:5.3.8	Won’t see what goes against the stream, 
pli-tv-kd1:5.3.9	What’s subtle and refined, profound and hard to see.” 
pli-tv-kd1:5.4.1	When the Buddha reflected like this, he inclined to inactivity, and not to teaching. 
pli-tv-kd1:5.4.2	Just then the supreme being Sahampati read the mind of the Buddha. And he thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:5.4.3	“The world is lost; it’s perished!—for the Buddha, perfected and fully awakened, inclines to inaction, and not to teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd1:5.5.1	Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch his arm, so Sahampati disappeared from the world of supreme beings and appeared in front of the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd1:5.6.1	He put his upper robe over one shoulder, placed his right knee on the ground, raise his joined palms, and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:5.6.2	“Please teach, Venerable Sir, please teach! 
pli-tv-kd1:5.6.3	There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are ruined because of not hearing the Teaching. There will be those who understand.” 
pli-tv-kd1:5.7.1	This is what Sahampati said, and he added: 
pli-tv-kd1:5.7.2	“Earlier, among the Magadhans, 
pli-tv-kd1:5.7.3	An impure teaching appeared, conceived by defiled people. 
pli-tv-kd1:5.7.4	Open this door to the deathless! 
pli-tv-kd1:5.7.5	Let them hear the Truth, discovered by the Pure One. 
pli-tv-kd1:5.7.6	Just as one standing on a rocky mountain top 
pli-tv-kd1:5.7.7	Would see the people all around, 
pli-tv-kd1:5.7.8	Just so, All-seeing Wise One, 
pli-tv-kd1:5.7.9	Ascend the temple of the Truth. 
pli-tv-kd1:5.7.10	Being rid of sorrow, look upon the people, 
pli-tv-kd1:5.7.11	Sunk in grief, overcome by birth and old age. 
pli-tv-kd1:5.7.12	Stand up, Victorious Hero! 
pli-tv-kd1:5.7.13	Debtless One, Leader of travelers, go walking in the world. 
pli-tv-kd1:5.7.14	Sir, proclaim the Teaching; 
pli-tv-kd1:5.7.15	There will be those who understand.” 
pli-tv-kd1:5.8.1	Twice the Buddha repeated to Sahampati what he had thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:5.8.4	
pli-tv-kd1:5.8.5	
pli-tv-kd1:5.8.6	
pli-tv-kd1:5.9.1	and on both occasions Sahampati repeated his request. 
pli-tv-kd1:5.9.53	
pli-tv-kd1:5.10.1	When the Buddha had understood the request of that supreme being, and because he had compassion for the world, he surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd1:5.11.1	He saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust in their eyes, with sharp faculties and with dull faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, those easy to teach and those difficult to teach, and he even saw some who regarded the next world as dangerous and to be avoided. 
pli-tv-kd1:5.11.2	It was just like a lotus pond with lotuses born and grown in water: some remain submerged in the water without rising out of it, others reach the surface of the water, and others still rise out of the water without being touched by it. 
pli-tv-kd1:5.12.1	When he had seen this, the Buddha replied to Sahampati in verse: 
pli-tv-kd1:5.12.2	“Open to them are the doors to the deathless; 
pli-tv-kd1:5.12.3	May those who hear give rise to faith. 
pli-tv-kd1:5.12.4	Seeing trouble, supreme being, 
pli-tv-kd1:5.12.5	I did not speak the sublime and subtle Truth.” 
pli-tv-kd1:5.13.1	Sahampati thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:5.13.2	“The Buddha has consented to teach.” He bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and disappeared right there. 
pli-tv-kd1:5.13.3	The account of the supreme being’s request is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.1.0	6. The account of the group of five 
pli-tv-kd1:6.1.1	The Buddha thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.1.2	“Who should I teach first? 
pli-tv-kd1:6.1.3	Who will understand this Teaching quickly?” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.1.4	And it occurred to him, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.1.5	“Ālāra Kālāma is wise and competent, and has for a long time had little dust in his eyes. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.1.6	Let me teach him first. He will understand this Teaching quickly.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.2.1	But an invisible god informed the Buddha, “Sir, Ālāra Kālāma died seven days ago,” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.2.2	and the Buddha also knew this for himself. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.2.3	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.2.4	“Ālāra Kālāma’s loss is great, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.2.5	for if he had heard this Teaching he would have understood it quickly.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.3.1	Again the Buddha thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.3.2	“Who should I teach first? 
pli-tv-kd1:6.3.3	Who will understand this Teaching quickly?” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.3.4	And it occurred to him, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.3.5	“Udaka Rāmaputta is wise and competent, and has for a long time had little dust in his eyes. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.3.6	Let me teach him first. He will understand this Teaching quickly.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.4.1	But an invisible god informed the Buddha, “Sir, Udaka Rāmaputta died last night,” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.4.2	and the Buddha also knew this for himself. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.4.3	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.4.4	“Udaka Rāmaputta’s loss is great, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.4.5	for if he had heard this Teaching he would have understood it quickly.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.5.1	Once again the Buddha thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.5.2	“Who should I teach first? 
pli-tv-kd1:6.5.3	Who will understand this Teaching quickly?” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.5.4	And it occurred to him, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.5.5	“The group of five monks who supported me while I was striving were of great service to me. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.6.1	Let me teach them first. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.6.3	But where are they staying now?” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.6.4	And with superhuman and purified clairvoyance, the Buddha saw that the group of five monks were staying near Benares, in the dear park at Isipatana. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.6.5	Then, after staying at Uruvelā for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Benares. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.7.1	The Ājīvaka ascetic Upaka saw the Buddha traveling between Gayā and the place of awakening. And he said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.7.2	“Sir, your senses are clear and your skin is pure and bright. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.7.3	Who have you gone forth under? 
pli-tv-kd1:6.7.4	Who is your teacher 
pli-tv-kd1:6.7.5	or whose teaching do you follow?” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.8.1	The Buddha replied to Upaka in verse: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.8.2	“Overcoming all, I know all. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.8.3	Abandoning all, I’m not soiled by anything. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.8.4	Through my own insight, I’m freed by the ending of craving—
pli-tv-kd1:6.8.5	So who should I refer to as a teacher? 
pli-tv-kd1:6.8.6	I have no teacher; 
pli-tv-kd1:6.8.7	No-one like me exists. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.8.8	In the world with its gods, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.8.9	I have no equal. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.8.10	For I’m a Perfected One, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.8.11	A teacher supreme. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.8.12	I alone am fully awakened; 
pli-tv-kd1:6.8.13	I am cool and extinguished. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.8.14	I’m going to the city of Kāsi, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.8.15	To set rolling the wheel of the Teaching. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.8.16	In this world immersed in darkness, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.8.17	I’ll beat the drum of the deathless.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.9.1	“According to your own claim you must be a universal conqueror.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.9.2	“Indeed, those like me are conquerors, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.9.3	Those who have ended the corruptions. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.9.4	I have conquered all bad traits; 
pli-tv-kd1:6.9.5	Therefore, Upaka, I’m a conqueror.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.9.6	Saying, “May it be so,” Upaka shook his head, chose the wrong road, and left. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.10.1	The Buddha continued wandering toward the deer park at Isipatana near Benares. When he eventually arrived, he went to the group of five monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.10.2	Seeing him coming, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.10.3	the group of five made an agreement with one another: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.10.4	“Here comes the ascetic Gotama, who has has given up his striving and returned to a life of abundance. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.10.5	We shouldn’t bow down to him, stand up for him, or receive his bowl and robe, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.10.6	but we should prepare a seat. If he wishes, he may sit down.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.11.1	But as the Buddha approached, the group of five monks was unable to keep their agreement. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.11.2	One went to meet him to receive his bowl and robe, another prepared a seat, another set out water for washing the feet, yet another set out a foot-stool, and the last one put out a foot-scraper. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.11.3	The Buddha sat down on the prepared seat 
pli-tv-kd1:6.11.4	and washed his feet. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.11.5	But they still addressed him by name and as “friend”. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.12.1	The Buddha said to the group of five monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.12.2	“Monks, don’t address the Buddha by name or as ʻfriend’. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.12.3	Listen, I’m perfected and fully awakened. I have discovered the deathless. I will instruct you and teach you the Truth. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.12.4	When you practice as instructed, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.12.5	in this very life you will soon realize with your own insight the supreme goal of the spiritual life 
pli-tv-kd1:6.12.6	for which people from good families rightly go forth from home to homelessness.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.13.1	They replied, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.13.2	“Friend Gotama, by practicing extreme austerities you didn’t gain any superhuman quality, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of noble ones. Since you have given up your striving and returned to a life of abundance, how could you now have achieved any of this?” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.14.1	The Buddha said, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.14.2	“I haven’t given up striving and returned to a life of abundance,” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.14.3	and he repeated what he had said before. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.15.1	A second time the group of five monks repeated their question 
pli-tv-kd1:6.15.2	and a second time the Buddha repeated his reply. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.15.3	A third time they repeated their question, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.16.1	and the Buddha then said, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.16.2	“Do you remember me ever making such a statement?” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.16.3	“No, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.16.4	“Then listen. I’m perfected and fully awakened. I have discovered the deathless. I will instruct you and teach you the Truth. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.16.5	When you practice as instructed, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.16.6	in this very life you will soon realize with your own insight the supreme goal of the spiritual life 
pli-tv-kd1:6.16.7	for which people from good families rightly go forth from home to homelessness.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.16.8	The Buddha was able to persuade the group of five monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.16.9	They then listened to the Buddha, paid careful attention, and applied their minds to understand. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.17.1	And the Buddha addressed them: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.17.2	“There are these two opposites that should not be pursued by one who has gone forth. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.17.4	One is the devotion to worldly pleasures, which is inferior, common, for the ordinary person, ignoble, and unbeneficial. The other is the devotion to self-torment, which is painful, ignoble, and unbeneficial. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.17.5	By avoiding both these opposites, I have awakened to the middle path, which produces vision and knowledge, which leads to peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.18.1	And what, monks, is that middle path? 
pli-tv-kd1:6.18.2	It’s just this noble eightfold path, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.18.3	that is, right view, right aim, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right stillness. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.19.1	And this is noble truth of suffering: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.19.2	birth is suffering, old age is suffering, sickness is suffering, death is suffering, association with what is disliked is suffering, separation from what is liked is suffering, not getting what one wants is suffering. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.19.3	In brief, the five aspects of existence affected by grasping are suffering. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.20.1	And this is noble truth of the origin of suffering: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.20.2	the craving that leads to rebirth, that comes with delight and sensual desire, ever delighting in this and that, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.20.3	that is, craving for worldly pleasures, craving for existence, and craving for non-existence. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.21.1	And this is noble truth of the end of suffering: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.21.2	the full fading away and ending of that very craving; giving it up, relinquishing it, releasing it, letting it go. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.22.1	And this is noble truth of the path leading to the end of suffering: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.22.2	just this noble eightfold path, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.22.3	that is, right view, right aim, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right stillness. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.23.1	When I knew that this is the noble truth of suffering, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.23.2	When I knew that this noble truth of suffering should be fully understood, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.23.3	When I knew that this noble truth of suffering has been fully understood, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.24.1	When I knew that this is the noble truth of the origin of suffering, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.24.2	When I knew that this noble truth of the origin of suffering should be fully abandoned, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.24.3	When I knew that this noble truth of the origin of suffering has been fully abandoned, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.25.1	When I knew that this is the noble truth of the end of suffering, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.25.2	When I knew that this noble truth of the end of suffering should be fully experienced, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.25.3	When I knew that this noble truth of the end of suffering has been fully experienced, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.26.1	When I knew that this is the noble truth of the path leading to the end of suffering, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.26.2	When I knew that this noble truth of the path leading to the end of suffering should be fully developed, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.26.3	When I knew that this noble truth of the path leading to the end of suffering has been fully developed, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.27.1	So long as I had not fully purified my knowledge and vision according to reality of these four noble truths with their three stages and twelve characteristics, I didn’t claim the supreme full awakening in this world with its gods, lords of death, and supreme beings, in this society with its monastics and brahmins, its gods and people. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.28.1	But when I had fully purified my knowledge and vision according to reality of these four noble truths with their three stages and twelve characteristics, then I did claim the supreme full awakening in this world with its gods, lords of death, and supreme beings, in this society with its monastics and brahmins, its gods and people. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.29.1	And knowledge and vision arose in me: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.29.2	ʻMy freedom is unshakable, this is my last birth, now there is no further rebirth.’” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.29.3	This is what the Buddha said. The monks from the group of five were pleased and they rejoiced in the Buddha’s exposition. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.29.4	And while this exposition was being spoken, Venerable Koṇḍañña experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.29.5	“Anything that has a beginning has an end.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.30.1	When the Buddha had set rolling the wheel of the Teaching, the earth gods cried out, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.30.2	“At Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has set rolling the supreme wheel of the Teaching. It can’t be stopped by any monastic, brahmin, god, lord of death, supreme being, or anyone in the world.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.30.3	Hearing the earth gods, the gods of the four great kings cried out … 
pli-tv-kd1:6.30.4	Hearing the gods of the four great kings, the Tāvatiṁsa gods cried out … 
pli-tv-kd1:6.30.5	the Yāma gods … 
pli-tv-kd1:6.30.6	the Tusita gods … 
pli-tv-kd1:6.30.7	the gods who delight in creation … 
pli-tv-kd1:6.30.8	the gods who control the creations of others … 
pli-tv-kd1:6.30.9	the gods of the Brahmā realm cried out, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.30.10	“At Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has set rolling the supreme wheel of the Teaching. It can’t be stopped by any monastic, brahmin, god, lord of death, supreme being, or anyone in the world.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.31.1	In that instant the news spread as far as the Brahmā world. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.31.2	Ten thousand solar systems quaked and shook. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.31.3	And there appeared in the world an immeasurable and glorious radiance, surpassing the splendor of the gods. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.31.4	And the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utterance: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.31.5	“Koṇḍañña has understood; indeed, Koṇḍañña has understood!” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.31.6	In this way Koṇḍañña got the name “Aññāsikoṇḍañña”, “Koṇḍañña who has understood.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.32.1	Aññāsikoṇḍañña had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. And he said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.32.2	“Venerable Sir, I wish to receive the going forth in your presence; I wish to receive the full ordination.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.32.3	The Buddha said, “Come, monk. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.32.4	The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.32.5	And that was the full ordination of that venerable. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.33.1	The Buddha then instructed and taught the rest of the monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.33.2	While they were being instructed and taught, Venerable Vappa and Venerable Bhaddiya experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.33.3	“Anything that has a beginning has an end.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.34.1	They had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; they had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. They then said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.34.2	“Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence; we wish to receive the full ordination.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.34.3	And the Buddha said, “Come, monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.34.4	The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.34.5	And that was the full ordination of those venerables. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.35.1	Living on the food brought to him, the Buddha then instructed and taught the rest of the monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.35.2	The six of them lived on the almsfood brought by three. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.36.1	While they were being instructed and taught, Venerable Mahānāma and Venerable Assaji experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.36.2	“Anything that has a beginning has an end.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.37.1	They had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; they had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. They said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:6.37.2	“Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence; we wish to receive the full ordination.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.37.3	And the Buddha said, “Come, monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.37.4	The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.37.5	And that was the full ordination of those venerables. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.38.1	The Buddha addressed the group of five: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.38.2	“Form is not your essence. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.38.3	For if form was your essence, it would not lead to suffering, and you could make it 
pli-tv-kd1:6.38.4	be like this and not be like that. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.38.5	But because form is not your essence, it leads to suffering, and you can’t make it 
pli-tv-kd1:6.38.6	be like this and not be like that. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.39.1	Feelings are not your essence. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.39.2	For if feelings were your essence, they would not lead to suffering, and you could make them 
pli-tv-kd1:6.39.3	be like this and not be like that. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.39.4	But because feelings are not your essence, they lead to suffering, and you can’t make them 
pli-tv-kd1:6.39.5	be like this and not be like that. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.40.1	Perceptions are not your essence. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.40.2	For if perceptions were your essence, they would not lead to suffering, and you could make them 
pli-tv-kd1:6.40.3	be like this and not be like that. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.40.4	But because perceptions are not your essence, they lead to suffering, and you can’t make them 
pli-tv-kd1:6.40.5	be like this and not be like that. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.40.6	Intentional activities are not your essence. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.40.7	For if intentional activities were your essence, they would not lead to suffering, and you could make them 
pli-tv-kd1:6.40.8	be like this and not be like that. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.40.9	But because intentional activities are not your essence, they lead to suffering, and you can’t make them 
pli-tv-kd1:6.40.10	be like this and not be like that. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.41.1	Consciousness is not your essence. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.41.2	For if consciousness was your essence, it would not lead to suffering, and you could make it 
pli-tv-kd1:6.41.3	be like this and not be like that. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.41.4	But because consciousness is not your essence, it leads to suffering, and you can’t make it 
pli-tv-kd1:6.41.5	be like this and not be like that. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.42.1	What do you think, monks: is form permanent or impermanent?”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.42.2	“Impermanent, Sir.”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.42.3	“Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.42.4	“Suffering.”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.42.5	“And that which is impermanent, suffering, and changeable by nature, is it proper to regard it like this: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.42.6	ʻThis is mine, I am this, this is my essence?ʼ”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.42.7	“Definitely not.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.1	“What do you think: are feelings permanent or impermanent?”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.2	“Impermanent.”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.3	“Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.4	“Suffering.”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.5	“And that which is impermanent, suffering, and changeable by nature, is it proper to regard it like this: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.6	ʻThis is mine, I am this, this is my essence?ʼ”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.7	“Definitely not.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.8	“What do you think: are perceptions permanent or impermanent?”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.9	“Impermanent.”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.10	“Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.11	“Suffering.”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.12	“And that which is impermanent, suffering, and changeable by nature, is it proper to regard it like this: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.13	ʻThis is mine, I am this, this is my essence?ʼ”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.14	“Definitely not.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.15	“What do you think: are intentional activities permanent or impermanent?”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.16	“Impermanent.”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.17	“Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.18	“Suffering.”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.19	“And that which is impermanent, suffering, and changeable by nature, is it proper to regard it like this: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.20	ʻThis is mine, I am this, this is my essence?ʼ”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.21	“Definitely not.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.22	“What do you think: is consciousness permanent or impermanent?”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.23	“Impermanent.”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.24	“Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.25	“Suffering.”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.26	“And that which is impermanent, suffering, and changeable by nature, is it proper to regard it like this: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.27	ʻThis is mine, I am this, this is my essence?ʼ”—
pli-tv-kd1:6.43.28	“Definitely not.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.44.1	“Therefore, whatever form there is—whether past, present, or future, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, near or far—it should all be seen with right wisdom according to reality like this: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.44.2	ʻThis is not mine, I am not this, this is not my essence.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:6.45.1	Whatever feelings there are—whether past, present, or future, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, near or far—they should all be seen with right wisdom according to reality like this: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.45.2	ʻThis is not mine, I am not this, this is not my essence.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:6.45.4	Whatever perceptions there are—whether past, present, or future, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, near or far—they should all be seen with right wisdom according to reality like this: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.45.5	ʻThis is not mine, I am not this, this is not my essence.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:6.45.7	Whatever intentional activities there are—whether past, present, or future, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, near or far—they should all be seen with right wisdom according to reality like this: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.45.8	ʻThis is not mine, I am not this, this is not my essence.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:6.45.10	Whatever consciousness there is—whether past, present, or future, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, near or far—it should all be seen with right wisdom according to reality like this: 
pli-tv-kd1:6.45.11	ʻThis is not mine, I am not this, this is not my essence.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:6.46.1	When they see this, the learned noble disciples are repelled by form, repelled by feeling, repelled by perception, repelled by intentional activities, and repelled by consciousness. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.46.2	Being repelled, they become desireless. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.46.3	Because they are desireless, they are freed. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.46.4	When the are freed, they know they are freed. They understand that birth has come to an end, that the spiritual life has been fulfilled, that the job has been done, that there is no further state of existence.” 
pli-tv-kd1:6.47.1	This is what the Buddha said. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.47.2	The monks from the group of five were pleased and they rejoiced in the Buddha’s exposition. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.47.3	And while this exposition was being spoken to the monks from the group of five, their minds let go and were freed from the corruptions. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.47.4	Then there were six perfected ones in the world. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.47.5	The account of the group of five is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:6.47.6	The first section for recitation is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.1.0	7. The account of the going forth 
pli-tv-kd1:7.1.1	At that time in Benares there was a son of a good family called Yasa, the son of a wealthy merchant, who had been brought up in great comfort. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.1.2	He had three stilt houses: 
pli-tv-kd1:7.1.3	one for the winter, one for the summer, and one for the rainy season. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.1.4	While Yasa was spending the four months of the rainy season in the rainy-season house, he was only attended on by female musicians, and he did not come down from that house. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.2.1	On one occasion, while he was enjoying himself with worldly pleasures, he fell asleep early, and so did his attendants. When he woke up early, the oil lamp was still burning. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.2.2	He saw his attendants sleeping: 
pli-tv-kd1:7.2.3	one with a lute in her armpit, another with a tabor on her neck, still another with a drum in her armpit; one with hair disheveled, another drooling, still another talking in her sleep. It was like a charnel ground before his very eyes. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.2.4	When he saw this, the misery became clear, and a feeling of repulsion stayed with him. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.2.5	He exclaimed a heartfelt utterance: 
pli-tv-kd1:7.2.6	“Oh the oppression! Oh the affliction!” 
pli-tv-kd1:7.3.1	Yasa put on his golden shoes and went to the entrance door. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.3.2	Spirits opened the door, thinking, 
pli-tv-kd1:7.3.3	“No-one should create any obstacle for Yasa’s going forth into homelessness.” 
pli-tv-kd1:7.3.4	He went to the town gate, 
pli-tv-kd1:7.3.5	and again it was opened by spirits. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.3.7	He then went to the dear park at Isipatana. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.4.1	Just then, after getting up early in the morning, the Buddha was walking up and down outside. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.4.2	When the Buddha saw Yasa coming, he came down from his walking-path and sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.4.3	As he was getting close to the Buddha, Yasa exclaimed the same heartfelt utterance: 
pli-tv-kd1:7.4.4	“Oh the oppression! Oh the affliction!” 
pli-tv-kd1:7.4.5	The Buddha said, 
pli-tv-kd1:7.4.6	“This, Yasa, isn’t oppressive, it isn’t afflictive. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.4.7	Come and sit down; I’ll give you a teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd1:7.5.1	Thinking, 
pli-tv-kd1:7.5.2	“Apparently this isn’t oppressive, apparently it’s not afflictive!” excited and joyful, Yasa removed his shoes, approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.5.3	The Buddha then gave Yasa a progressive teaching: 
pli-tv-kd1:7.5.4	talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.6.1	When the Buddha knew that Yasa’s mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: 
pli-tv-kd1:7.6.2	suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.6.3	Just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, 
pli-tv-kd1:7.6.4	so too, while he was sitting right there, Yasa experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: 
pli-tv-kd1:7.6.5	“Anything that has a beginning has an end.” 
pli-tv-kd1:7.7.1	Soon afterwards Yasa’s mother went up to his stilt house. Not seeing him, she went to her husband and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:7.7.2	“I can’t find your son Yasa.” 
pli-tv-kd1:7.7.3	The merchant then dispatched horsemen in the four directions, and he himself went to the dear park at Isipatana. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.7.4	He saw the imprints of the golden shoes on the ground and he followed along. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.8.1	When the Buddha saw the wealthy merchant coming, he thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:7.8.2	“Let me use my supernormal powers so that the merchant, when he sits down, doesn’t see Yasa seated next to him.” 
pli-tv-kd1:7.8.3	And he did just that. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.9.1	The merchant approached the Buddha and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:7.9.2	“Sir, have you seen Yasa by any chance?” 
pli-tv-kd1:7.9.3	“Please sit down, householder. Perhaps you’ll see Yasa seated next to you.” 
pli-tv-kd1:7.9.4	When the merchant heard this, 
pli-tv-kd1:7.9.5	he was elated and joyful, and he bowed and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.10.1	The Buddha then gave him a progressive teaching: 
pli-tv-kd1:7.10.2	talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.10.3	When the Buddha knew that his mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: 
pli-tv-kd1:7.10.4	suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.10.5	And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, 
pli-tv-kd1:7.10.6	so too, while he was sitting right there, the merchant experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: 
pli-tv-kd1:7.10.7	“Anything that has a beginning has an end.” 
pli-tv-kd1:7.10.8	He had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. And he said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:7.10.9	“Wonderful, Venerable Sir, wonderful! 
pli-tv-kd1:7.10.10	Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness 
pli-tv-kd1:7.10.11	so that one with eyes might see what’s there—
pli-tv-kd1:7.10.12	just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.10.13	I take refuge in the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.10.14	Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
pli-tv-kd1:7.10.15	And he was the first person in the world to become a lay follower by means of the triple refuge. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.11.1	While his father was given this teaching, Yasa reviewed what he had already seen and understood, and his mind was freed from the corruptions without grasping. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.11.2	The Buddha realized what had happened, 
pli-tv-kd1:7.11.4	and he thought, “Yasa is incapable of returning to the lower life to enjoy worldly pleasures as he did while still a householder. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.11.5	Let me stop using my supernormal powers.” 
pli-tv-kd1:7.11.6	And he did so. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.12.1	The merchant saw Yasa sitting there and he said to him, 
pli-tv-kd1:7.12.2	“Dear Yasa, your mother is grieving and lamenting. Please give her back her life.” 
pli-tv-kd1:7.13.1	Yasa looked to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:7.13.2	and the Buddha said to the merchant, 
pli-tv-kd1:7.13.3	“What do you think, householder: suppose the mind of one such as you—who has seen and understood the Truth with the trainee’s knowledge and vision—while he was reviewing what he had already seen and understood, was freed from the corruptions without grasping. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.13.4	Would he be able to return to the lower life to enjoy worldly pleasures as he did while still a householder?” 
pli-tv-kd1:7.13.5	“Definitely not.” 
pli-tv-kd1:7.13.6	“But this is what has happened to Yasa. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.13.7	He is now unable to return to the lower life.” 
pli-tv-kd1:7.14.1	“It’s a great gain for Yasa that his mind has been freed from the corruptions without grasping! 
pli-tv-kd1:7.14.2	Sir, please accept today’s meal from me with Yasa as your attendant.” 
pli-tv-kd1:7.14.3	And the Buddha consented by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.14.4	Knowing that the Buddha had consented, the merchant got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.15.1	Soon after the merchant had left, Yasa said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:7.15.2	“Sir, I wish to receive the going forth in your presence; I wish to receive the full ordination.” 
pli-tv-kd1:7.15.3	The Buddha said, “Come, monk. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.15.4	The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” 
pli-tv-kd1:7.15.5	And that was the full ordination of that venerable. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.15.6	Then there were seven perfected ones in the world. 
pli-tv-kd1:7.15.7	The going forth of Yasa is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:8.1.1	After robing up the following morning, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and, with Venerable Yasa as his attendant, he went to the house of that merchant and sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-kd1:8.1.2	Yasa’s mother and his ex-wife approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd1:8.2.1	The Buddha gave them a progressive teaching: 
pli-tv-kd1:8.2.2	talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. 
pli-tv-kd1:8.2.3	When the Buddha knew that their minds were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: 
pli-tv-kd1:8.2.4	suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. 
pli-tv-kd1:8.2.5	And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, 
pli-tv-kd1:8.2.6	so too, while they were sitting right there, they experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: 
pli-tv-kd1:8.2.7	“Anything that has a beginning has an end.” 
pli-tv-kd1:8.3.1	They had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; they had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. And they said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:8.3.2	“Wonderful, Venerable Sir, wonderful! … 
pli-tv-kd1:8.3.3	We take refuge in the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:8.3.4	Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” 
pli-tv-kd1:8.3.5	And they were the first women in the world to become lay followers by means of the triple refuge. 
pli-tv-kd1:8.4.1	Yasa’s mother, his father, and his ex-wife personally served various kinds of fine food to the Buddha and Yasa. When the Buddha had finished his meal, they sat down. 
pli-tv-kd1:8.4.2	And the Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened them with a teaching, and then got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-kd1:9.1.1	Now Yasa had four friends—
pli-tv-kd1:9.1.2	Vimala, Subāhu, Puṇṇaji, and Gavampati—
pli-tv-kd1:9.1.3	who were from the most wealthy merchant families in Benares. They heard that Yasa had shaved off his hair and beard, put on ocher robes, and gone forth into homelessness. 
pli-tv-kd1:9.1.4	And they said to one another, 
pli-tv-kd1:9.1.5	“It can be no ordinary spiritual path, no ordinary going forth, for Yasa to have acted like this.” 
pli-tv-kd1:9.2.1	They then went to Yasa and bowed down to him. 
pli-tv-kd1:9.2.2	Yasa took his four friends and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd1:9.2.3	and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:9.2.4	“Venerable Sir, these four friends of mine—
pli-tv-kd1:9.2.5	Vimala, Subāhu, Puṇṇaji, and Gavampati—
pli-tv-kd1:9.2.6	are from the most wealthy merchant families in Benares. Please instruct them.” 
pli-tv-kd1:9.3.1	The Buddha gave them a progressive teaching: 
pli-tv-kd1:9.3.2	talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. 
pli-tv-kd1:9.3.3	When the Buddha knew that their minds were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. 
pli-tv-kd1:9.3.4	And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, 
pli-tv-kd1:9.3.5	so too, while they were sitting right there, they experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: 
pli-tv-kd1:9.3.6	“Anything that has a beginning has an end.” 
pli-tv-kd1:9.4.1	They had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; they had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. And they said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:9.4.2	“Venerable Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence; we wish to receive the full ordination.” 
pli-tv-kd1:9.4.3	The Buddha said, “Come, monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:9.4.4	The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” 
pli-tv-kd1:9.4.5	And that was the full ordination of those venerables. 
pli-tv-kd1:9.4.6	Then, as the Buddha instructed those monks in the Teaching, 
pli-tv-kd1:9.4.7	their minds were freed from the corruptions without grasping. 
pli-tv-kd1:9.4.8	And there were eleven perfected ones in the world. 
pli-tv-kd1:9.4.9	The going forth of the four friends is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:10.1.1	Fifty of Yasa’s friends from leading families in the countryside also heard 
pli-tv-kd1:10.1.2	that Yasa had shaved off his hair and beard, put on ocher robes, and gone forth into homelessness. 
pli-tv-kd1:10.1.3	They said to one another, 
pli-tv-kd1:10.1.4	“It can be no ordinary spiritual path, no ordinary going forth, for Yasa to have acted like this.” 
pli-tv-kd1:10.2.1	And they went to Yasa and bowed down to him. 
pli-tv-kd1:10.2.2	Yasa took his fifty friends and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd1:10.2.3	and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:10.2.4	“Sir, these fifty friends of mine are from leading families in the countryside. 
pli-tv-kd1:10.2.5	Please instruct them.” 
pli-tv-kd1:10.3.1	The Buddha then gave them a progressive teaching: 
pli-tv-kd1:10.3.2	talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. 
pli-tv-kd1:10.3.3	When the Buddha knew that their minds were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. 
pli-tv-kd1:10.3.4	And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, 
pli-tv-kd1:10.3.5	so too, while they were sitting right there, they experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: 
pli-tv-kd1:10.3.6	“Anything that has a beginning has an end.” 
pli-tv-kd1:10.4.1	They had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; they had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. And they said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:10.4.2	“Venerable Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence; we wish to receive the full ordination.” 
pli-tv-kd1:10.4.3	The Buddha said, “Come, monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:10.4.4	The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” 
pli-tv-kd1:10.4.5	And that was the full ordination of those venerables. 
pli-tv-kd1:10.4.6	Then, as the Buddha instructed those monks in the Teaching, 
pli-tv-kd1:10.4.7	their minds were freed from the corruptions without grasping. 
pli-tv-kd1:10.4.8	And there were sixty-one perfected ones in the world. 
pli-tv-kd1:10.4.9	The going forth of the fifty friends is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:11.1.0	8. The account of the Lord of Death 
pli-tv-kd1:11.1.1	Then the Buddha addressed those monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:11.1.2	“I’m free from all snares, both human and divine. 
pli-tv-kd1:11.1.3	You, too, are free from all snares, both human and divine 
pli-tv-kd1:11.1.4	Go wandering, monks, for the benefit and happiness of the general population, out of compassion for the world, for the good, the benefit, and the happiness of gods and humans. 
pli-tv-kd1:11.1.5	Each one of you should go your own way. 
pli-tv-kd1:11.1.6	Proclaim the Teaching, which is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, which has a true goal and is well articulated. Set out the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life. 
pli-tv-kd1:11.1.7	There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are ruined because of not hearing the Teaching. There will be those who understand. 
pli-tv-kd1:11.1.8	I too will go to Uruvelā, to Senānigama, to proclaim the Teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd1:11.2.1	Then the Lord of Death, the Evil One, went up to the Buddha and spoke to him in verse: 
pli-tv-kd1:11.2.2	“You’re bound by all snares, 
pli-tv-kd1:11.2.3	Both human and divine. 
pli-tv-kd1:11.2.4	You’re bound by the great bond: 
pli-tv-kd1:11.2.5	You’re not free from me, monastic.” 
pli-tv-kd1:11.2.6	“I’m free from all snares, 
pli-tv-kd1:11.2.7	Both human and divine. 
pli-tv-kd1:11.2.8	I’m free from the great bond: 
pli-tv-kd1:11.2.9	You’re defeated, End-maker.” 
pli-tv-kd1:11.2.10	“The snare is ethereal, 
pli-tv-kd1:11.2.11	And it comes from the mind. 
pli-tv-kd1:11.2.12	With that I’ll bind you: 
pli-tv-kd1:11.2.13	You’re not free from me, monastic.” 
pli-tv-kd1:11.2.14	“Sights, sounds, tastes, smells, 
pli-tv-kd1:11.2.15	And tangibles, the mind’s delights—
pli-tv-kd1:11.2.16	For these I have no desire: 
pli-tv-kd1:11.2.17	You’re defeated, End-maker.” 
pli-tv-kd1:11.2.18	Then the Lord of Death, the Evil One, thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:11.2.19	“The Buddha knows me, the Accomplished One knows me,” and sad and miserable he disappeared right there. 
pli-tv-kd1:11.2.20	The account of the Lord of Death is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:12.1.0	9. Discussion of the going forth and the full ordination 
pli-tv-kd1:12.1.1	Soon afterwards the monks were bringing back from various districts and countries people desiring to go forth and desiring the full ordination, thinking, 
pli-tv-kd1:12.1.2	“The Buddha will do it.” 
pli-tv-kd1:12.1.3	The monks became tired, as did those seeking the going forth and the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:12.1.4	While he was in seclusion, the Buddha reflected on this, 
pli-tv-kd1:12.1.8	and he thought, “Why donʼt I allow the monks 
pli-tv-kd1:12.1.9	to give the going forth and the full ordination in those various districts and countries?” 
pli-tv-kd1:12.2.1	In the evening, the Buddha came out from seclusion, gave a teaching, and told the monks what he had thought, adding: 
pli-tv-kd1:12.3.1	“I allow you to give the going forth and the full ordination in those various districts and countries. 
pli-tv-kd1:12.3.2	And, monks, it should be done like this. 
pli-tv-kd1:12.3.3	First the candidate should shave off his hair and beard and put on ocher robes. He should then put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the monks, squat on his heels, and raise his joined palms. He should then be told to say this: 
pli-tv-kd1:12.4.1	ʻI take refuge in the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:12.4.2	I take refuge in the Teaching, 
pli-tv-kd1:12.4.3	I take refuge in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd1:12.4.4	For the second time I take refuge in the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:12.4.5	For the second time I take refuge in the Teaching, 
pli-tv-kd1:12.4.6	For the second time I take refuge in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd1:12.4.7	For the third time I take refuge in the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:12.4.8	For the third time I take refuge in the Teaching, 
pli-tv-kd1:12.4.9	For the third time I take refuge in the Sangha.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:12.4.10	You should give the going forth and the full ordination through the taking of the three refuges.” 
pli-tv-kd1:12.4.11	The discussion of the full ordination through the taking of the three refuges is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:13.1.0	10. The second account of the Lord of Death 
pli-tv-kd1:13.1.1	When the Buddha had completed the rainy-season residence, he said to the monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:13.1.2	“Through wise attention and wise right effort, I have reached the supreme freedom, realized the supreme freedom. 
pli-tv-kd1:13.1.3	And you, monks, have done the same.” 
pli-tv-kd1:13.2.1	Then the Lord of Death, the Evil One, went up to the Buddha and spoke to him in verse: 
pli-tv-kd1:13.2.2	“You’re bound by the snares of the Lord of Death, 
pli-tv-kd1:13.2.3	Both human and divine. 
pli-tv-kd1:13.2.4	You’re bound by the great bond: 
pli-tv-kd1:13.2.5	You’re not free from me, monastic.” 
pli-tv-kd1:13.2.6	“I’m free from the snares of the Lord of Death, 
pli-tv-kd1:13.2.7	Both human and divine. 
pli-tv-kd1:13.2.8	I’m free from the great bond: 
pli-tv-kd1:13.2.9	You’re defeated, End-maker.” 
pli-tv-kd1:13.2.10	Then the Lord of Death, the Evil One, thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:13.2.11	“The Buddha knows me, the Accomplished One knows me,” and sad and miserable he disappeared right there. 
pli-tv-kd1:13.2.12	The second account of the Lord of Death is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:14.1.0	11. The account of a fine group of people 
pli-tv-kd1:14.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Benares for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Uruvelā. 
pli-tv-kd1:14.1.2	At a certain point he left the road, entered a forest grove, and sat down at the foot of a tree. 
pli-tv-kd1:14.1.3	Just then a fine group of thirty friends and their wives were enjoying themselves in that forest grove. 
pli-tv-kd1:14.1.4	Because one of them did not have a wife, 
pli-tv-kd1:14.1.5	they had given him a prostitute. 
pli-tv-kd1:14.1.6	While they were all carelessly enjoying themselves, that prostitute took that man’s possessions and ran away. 
pli-tv-kd1:14.2.1	To help their friend, they all went searching for that woman. And as they walked about that forest grove, they saw the Buddha seated at the foot of a tree. 
pli-tv-kd1:14.2.2	They approached him and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:14.2.3	“Sir, have you by any chance seen a woman by herself?” 
pli-tv-kd1:14.2.4	“But, young men, what use is a woman to you?” 
pli-tv-kd1:14.2.5	They told him what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd1:14.3.1	“What do you think is better for you: 
pli-tv-kd1:14.3.2	that you search for a woman, or that you search for yourselves?” 
pli-tv-kd1:14.3.3	“It’s better for us to search for ourselves.” 
pli-tv-kd1:14.3.4	“Well then, sit down, and I’ll give you a teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd1:14.3.5	Saying, “Yes, Sir,” those friends bowed to the Buddha and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd1:14.4.1	The Buddha then gave them a progressive teaching: 
pli-tv-kd1:14.4.2	talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. 
pli-tv-kd1:14.4.3	When the Buddha knew that their minds were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. 
pli-tv-kd1:14.4.4	And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, 
pli-tv-kd1:14.4.5	so too, while they were sitting right there, they experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: 
pli-tv-kd1:14.4.6	“Anything that has a beginning has an end.” 
pli-tv-kd1:14.5.1	They had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; they had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. And they said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:14.5.2	“Venerable Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence; we wish to receive the full ordination.” 
pli-tv-kd1:14.5.3	The Buddha said, “Come, monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:14.5.4	The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” 
pli-tv-kd1:14.5.5	And that was the full ordination of those venerables. 
pli-tv-kd1:14.5.6	The account of the fine group of friends is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:14.5.7	The second section for recitation is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:15.1.0	12. The account of the wonders at Uruvelā 
pli-tv-kd1:15.1.1	The Buddha continued his wandering and eventually arrived at Uruvelā. 
pli-tv-kd1:15.1.2	At that time three dreadlocked ascetics were living at Uruvelā: 
pli-tv-kd1:15.1.3	Uruvelā Kassapa, Nadī Kassapa, and Gayā Kassapa. 
pli-tv-kd1:15.1.4	Uruvelā Kassapa was the leader and chief of five hundred dreadlocked ascetics, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.1.5	Nadī Kassapa of three hundred, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.1.6	and Gayā Kassapa of two hundred. 
pli-tv-kd1:15.2.1	The Buddha went to the hermitage of Uruvelā Kassapa. When he arrived, he said to him, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.2.2	“If it’s convenient for you, Kassapa, may I stay for one night in your fire hut?” 
pli-tv-kd1:15.2.3	“It’s convenient for me, Great Ascetic, but there’s a fierce and highly venomous dragon king with supernormal powers there. I don’t want it to harm you.” 
pli-tv-kd1:15.2.4	The Buddha asked a second 
pli-tv-kd1:15.2.7	and a third time, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.2.9	and on both occasions Uruvelā Kassapa replied as before. 
pli-tv-kd1:15.2.10	The Buddha then said, “Perhaps it won’t harm me. Come on, Kassapa, allow me to stay in the fire hut.” 
pli-tv-kd1:15.2.11	“Well then, do as you like.” 
pli-tv-kd1:15.3.1	The Buddha entered the fire hut and prepared a straw mat. He sat down, crossed his legs, straightened his body, and established mindfulness in front of him. 
pli-tv-kd1:15.3.2	When the dragon saw that the Buddha had entered, he was displeased and emitted smoke. 
pli-tv-kd1:15.3.3	The Buddha thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.3.4	“Let me overpower this dragon, using fire against fire, but without harming it in the slightest way.” 
pli-tv-kd1:15.4.1	The Buddha then used his supernormal powers so that he, too, emitted smoke. 
pli-tv-kd1:15.4.2	The dragon, not being able to contain his rage, emitted flames. 
pli-tv-kd1:15.4.3	The Buddha entered the fire element and he, too, emitted flames. 
pli-tv-kd1:15.4.4	With both of them emitting flames, it was as if the fire hut was ablaze and burning. 
pli-tv-kd1:15.4.5	Those dreadlocked ascetics gathered around the fire hut, saying, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.4.6	“The Great Ascetic is handsome, but the dragon is harming him.” 
pli-tv-kd1:15.5.1	The next morning the Buddha had overcome that dragon, using fire against fire, but without harming it in the slightest way. He put it in his almsbowl and showed it to Uruvelā Kassapa: 
pli-tv-kd1:15.5.2	“This is your dragon, Kassapa, his fire overpowered by fire.” 
pli-tv-kd1:15.5.3	Uruvelā Kassapa thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.5.4	“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty—using fire against fire, he has overcome that fierce and highly venomous dragon king with its supernormal powers. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.1	At the Nerañjara the Buddha said 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.2	To the dreadlocked ascetic Uruvelā Kassapa, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.3	“If it’s not inconvenient for you, Kassapa, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.4	May I stay for a night in your fire hut?” 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.5	“It’s not inconvenient for me, Great Ascetic, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.6	But for your own good, I bar you. 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.7	A fierce dragon king is there, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.8	Highly venomous, with supernormal powers: 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.9	Don’t let it harm you.” 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.10	“Perhaps it won’t harm me. Come on, Kassapa, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.11	Please let me stay in the fire hut.” 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.12	When he knew the answer was “Yes,” 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.13	He entered it without fear. 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.14	Seeing the sage who had entered, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.15	The angry dragon emitted smoke. 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.16	With a mind of good will, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.17	The Best of Humans emitted smoke, too. 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.18	Unable to contain his rage, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.19	The dragon emitted fire. 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.20	Well-skilled in the fire element, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.21	The Best of Humans emitted fire, too. 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.22	With both of them emitting flames, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.23	The fire hut was glowing and ablaze. 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.24	Looking on, the dreadlocked ascetics said, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.25	“He’s handsome, the Great Ascetic, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.6.26	But the dragon is harming him.” 
pli-tv-kd1:15.7.1	Yet the following morning 
pli-tv-kd1:15.7.2	The dragon’s flames had been extinguished, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.7.3	While the One with supernormal powers 
pli-tv-kd1:15.7.4	Still had flames of various colors. 
pli-tv-kd1:15.7.5	Blue, red, and magenta, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.7.6	Yellow, and the color of crystal: 
pli-tv-kd1:15.7.7	Flames of various colors remained 
pli-tv-kd1:15.7.8	In the body of Aṅgīrasa. 
pli-tv-kd1:15.7.9	Putting the dragon in a bowl, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.7.10	He showed it to the brahmin: 
pli-tv-kd1:15.7.11	“This is your dragon, Kassapa, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.7.12	His fire overpowered by fire.” 
pli-tv-kd1:15.7.13	Because of this wonder of supernormal power, Uruvelā Kassapa gained confidence in the Buddha and said to him, 
pli-tv-kd1:15.7.14	“Great Ascetic, please stay right here. I’ll supply you with food.” 
pli-tv-kd1:15.7.15	The first wonder is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:16.1.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha stayed in a forest grove not far from Uruvelā Kassapa’s hermitage. 
pli-tv-kd1:16.1.2	Then, when the night was well advanced, the four great kings, extraordinarily beautiful, approached the Buddha, illuminating the whole forest grove. They bowed down to the Buddha and stood at the four cardinal points, appearing like great bonfires. 
pli-tv-kd1:16.2.1	The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:16.2.2	“It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready. 
pli-tv-kd1:16.2.3	And who was it that visited you last night?” 
pli-tv-kd1:16.2.4	“That was the four great kings. They came to me to hear the Teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd1:16.2.5	Uruvelā Kassapa thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:16.2.6	“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that even the four great kings go to him to hear the Teaching. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” 
pli-tv-kd1:16.2.7	The Buddha ate his meal and continued to stay in the same forest grove. 
pli-tv-kd1:16.2.8	The second wonder is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:17.1.1	Once again when the night was well advanced, the extraordinarily beautiful Sakka, the ruler of the gods, approached the Buddha, illuminating the whole forest grove. He bowed down to the Buddha, and standing up he appeared just like a great bonfire. But it was more splendid and sublime than the previous ones. 
pli-tv-kd1:17.2.1	The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:17.2.2	“It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready. 
pli-tv-kd1:17.2.3	And who was it that visited you last night?” 
pli-tv-kd1:17.2.4	“That was Sakka, the ruler of the gods. He came to me to hear the Teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd1:17.2.5	Uruvelā Kassapa thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:17.2.6	“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that even Sakka, the ruler of gods, goes to him to hear the Teaching. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” 
pli-tv-kd1:17.2.7	The Buddha ate his meal and continued to stay in the same forest grove. 
pli-tv-kd1:17.2.8	The third wonder is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:18.1.1	Once again when the night was well advanced, the supreme being Sahampati, extraordinarily beautiful, approached the Buddha, illuminating the whole forest grove. He bowed down to the Buddha, and standing up he appeared just like a great bonfire. But it was even more splendid and sublime than the previous ones. 
pli-tv-kd1:18.2.1	The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:18.2.2	“It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready. 
pli-tv-kd1:18.2.3	And who was it that visited you last night?” 
pli-tv-kd1:18.2.4	“That was the supreme being Sahampati. He came to me to hear the Teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd1:18.2.5	Uruvelā Kassapa thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:18.2.6	“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that even the supreme being Sahampati goes to him to hear the Teaching. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” 
pli-tv-kd1:18.2.7	The Buddha ate his meal and continued to stay in the same forest grove. 
pli-tv-kd1:18.2.8	The fourth wonder is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:19.1.1	At this time Uruvelā Kassapa was holding a great sacrifice, and the whole of Aṅga and Magadha wanted to attend with much food of various kinds. 
pli-tv-kd1:19.1.2	Uruvelā Kassapa considered this 
pli-tv-kd1:19.1.4	and thought, “If the Great Ascetic performs a wonder of supernormal power for the great crowd, his gain and honor will increase, whereas mine will decrease. 
pli-tv-kd1:19.1.5	I hope he doesn’t come tomorrow.” 
pli-tv-kd1:19.2.1	The Buddha read the mind of Uruvelā Kassapa. He then went to Uttarakuru, collected almsfood there, ate it at the Anotatta lake, and stayed there for the day’s meditation. 
pli-tv-kd1:19.2.2	The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:19.2.3	“It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready. 
pli-tv-kd1:19.2.4	And why didn’t you come yesterday? 
pli-tv-kd1:19.2.5	We did think of you, 
pli-tv-kd1:19.2.7	and we had set aside a share of various kinds of food.” 
pli-tv-kd1:19.3.1	“But, Kassapa, didn’t you think, 
pli-tv-kd1:19.3.2	ʻI hope he doesn’t come tomorrow’? 
pli-tv-kd1:19.4.1	Because I read your mind, I went to Uttarakuru, collected almsfood there, ate it at the Anotatta lake, and stayed there for the day’s meditation.” 
pli-tv-kd1:19.4.2	Uruvelā Kassapa thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:19.4.3	“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he can read the minds of others. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” 
pli-tv-kd1:19.4.4	The Buddha ate his meal and continued to stay in the same forest grove. 
pli-tv-kd1:19.4.5	The fifth wonder is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.1.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha was given a rag 
pli-tv-kd1:20.1.2	and he thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.1.3	“Where can I wash it?” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.1.4	After reading the Buddha’s mind, Sakka dug a pond there with his hand. And he said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.1.5	“Sir, please wash it here.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.1.6	The Buddha thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.1.7	“Where can I beat this rag?” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.1.8	After reading the Buddha’s mind once again, Sakka placed a large stone there. And he said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.1.9	“Sir, please beat it here.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.2.1	The Buddha thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.2.2	“What can I hold onto to get out of this pond?” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.2.3	A god living in an arjun tree read the Buddha’s mind. She then bent down a branch and said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.2.4	“Sir, please come out by holding onto this.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.2.5	The Buddha thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.2.6	“Where can I dry this rag?” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.2.7	After reading the Buddha’s mind yet again, Sakka placed another large stone there. And he said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.2.8	“Sir, please dry it here.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.3.1	The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.3.2	“It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.3.3	But what’s going on? There was no pond here before, but now there is. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.3.4	These stones were not here before. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.3.5	Who placed them here? 
pli-tv-kd1:20.3.6	This arjun tree didn’t have a bent branch, but now it does.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.4.1	
pli-tv-kd1:20.6.1	The Buddha told him what had happened. Uruvelā Kassapa thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.6.2	“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that even Sakka, the ruler of the gods, performs services for him. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.6.3	The Buddha ate his meal and continued to stay in the same forest grove. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.7.1	The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.7.2	“It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.7.3	“You just go ahead, Kassapa, I’ll come.” After dismissing him, he took a fruit from a rose-apple tree—the tree after which the Rose-apple Land of India is named—and then arrived first in the fire hut, where he sat down. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.8.1	When Uruvelā Kassapa saw the Buddha sitting there, he said to him, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.8.2	“Which path did you take? 
pli-tv-kd1:20.8.3	I left first, but you’re already here.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.9.1	The Buddha told him what he had done and added, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.9.2	“This rose apple has a good color, and it’s fragrant and delicious too. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.9.3	Please eat it, if you wish.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.9.4	“There’s no need. You deserve it and you should eat it.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.9.5	Uruvelā Kassapa thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.9.6	“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he dismissed me, then took a fruit from a rose-apple tree, and still arrived first in the fire hut. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.9.7	The Buddha ate his meal and continued to stay in the same forest grove. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.10.1	The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.10.2	“It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.10.3	“You just go ahead, Kassapa, I’ll come.” After dismissing him, he took a fruit from a mango tree not far from the rose-apple tree … 
pli-tv-kd1:20.10.4	he took a fruit from an emblic myrobalan tree not far from the rose-apple tree … 
pli-tv-kd1:20.10.5	he took a fruit from a chebulic myrobalan tree not far from the rose-apple tree … 
pli-tv-kd1:20.10.6	he went to Tāvatiṁsa heaven, took a flower from an orchid tree, and then arrived first in the fire hut, where he sat down. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.10.7	When Uruvelā Kassapa saw the Buddha sitting there, he said to him, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.10.8	“Which path did you take? 
pli-tv-kd1:20.10.9	I left first, but you’re already here.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.11.1	The Buddha told him what he had done, and added, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.11.2	“This orchid tree flower is colorful and fragrant. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.11.3	Please take it, if you wish.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.11.4	“There’s no need. You deserve it and you should keep it.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.11.5	Uruvelā Kassapa thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.11.6	“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he dismissed me, then went to Tāvatiṁsa heaven, took an orchid tree flower, and still arrived first in the fire hut. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.12.1	Soon afterwards those dreadlocked ascetics wanted to tend the sacred fire, but were unable to split the logs. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.12.2	They thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.12.3	“This must be because of the supernormal powers of the Great Ascetic.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.12.4	The Buddha said to Uruvelā Kassapa, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.12.5	“May the logs be split, Kassapa.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.12.6	“Yes, may they,” he replied. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.12.7	And five hundred logs were split all at once. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.12.8	Uruvelā Kassapa thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.12.9	“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he can split logs just like that. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.13.1	Those ascetics still wanted to tend the sacred fire, but were unable to light it. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.13.2	They thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.13.3	“This must be because of the supernormal powers of the Great Ascetic.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.13.4	The Buddha said to Uruvelā Kassapa, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.13.5	“May the fire be lit, Kassapa.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.13.6	“Yes, may it,” he replied. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.13.7	And five hundred fires were lit all at once. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.13.8	Uruvelā Kassapa thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.13.9	“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he can light fires just like that. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.14.1	When those ascetics had tended the sacred fires, they were unable to extinguish them. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.14.2	They thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.14.3	“This must be because of the supernormal powers of the Great Ascetic.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.14.4	The Buddha said to Uruvelā Kassapa, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.14.5	“May the fires be extinguished, Kassapa.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.14.6	“Yes, may they,” he replied. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.14.7	And the five hundred fires were extinguished all at once. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.14.8	Uruvelā Kassapa thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.14.9	“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he can extinguish fires just like that. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.15.1	At that time it was midwinter, when the days are cold and the snow is falling. During this period those ascetics emerged from the Nerañjara river, immersed themselves in it, and repeatedly emerged and immersed themselves. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.15.2	Then the Buddha manifested five hundred pans with hot coals, where those ascetics could warm themselves after coming out of the water. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.15.3	They thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.15.4	“These were no doubt created by the supernormal powers of the Great Ascetic.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.15.5	Uruvelā Kassapa thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.15.6	“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he can manifest so many pans with hot coals. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.16.1	Soon afterwards an unseasonal storm poured down, producing a great flood. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.16.2	The place where the Buddha was staying was inundated. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.16.3	The Buddha thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.16.4	“Let me drive back the water on all sides and walk on the dry ground in the middle.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.16.5	And he did so. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.16.6	Uruvelā Kassapa thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.16.7	“I hope the Great Ascetic hasn’t been swept away by the water.” Together with a number of ascetics he went by boat to where the Buddha was staying. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.16.8	He saw that the Buddha had driven back the water on all sides and was walking on dry ground in the middle, and he said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.16.9	“Is that you, Great Ascetic?” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.16.10	“It’s me, Kassapa.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.16.11	The Buddha rose up into the air and reappeared in the boat. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.16.12	Uruvelā Kassapa thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.16.13	“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he can displace the water. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.17.1	Then the Buddha thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.17.2	“For a long time this foolish man has thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.17.3	ʻThe Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, but he’s not a perfected one like me.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:20.17.4	Let me stir up this dreadlocked ascetic.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.17.5	And he said to Uruvelā Kassapa, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.17.6	“Kassapa, you’re not a perfected one or on the path to perfection. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.17.7	You don’t have the practice by which you might be a perfected one or on the path to perfection.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.17.8	At that Uruvelā Kassapa bowed down with his head at the Buddha’s feet and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.17.9	“Venerable Sir, I wish to receive the going forth in your presence; I wish to receive the full ordination.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.18.1	“Kassapa, you’re the leader and chief of five hundred dreadlocked ascetics. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.18.2	Tell them first, so that they may act as they think appropriate.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.18.3	Uruvelā Kassapa then went to those ascetics and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.18.4	“I wish to practice the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic. Please do whatever you think is appropriate.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.18.5	“Sir, we’ve had confidence in the Great Ascetic for a long time. If you are to practice the spiritual life under him, so will all of us.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.19.1	Then, after letting their hair and dreadlocks, their carrying pole and bundle, and their fire-worship implements be carried away by the water, they went to the Buddha. They bowed down with their head at his feet and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.19.2	“Venerable Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence; we wish to receive the full ordination.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.19.3	The Buddha said, “Come, monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.19.4	The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.19.5	And that was the full ordination of those venerables. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.20.1	Nadī Kassapa saw those things being carried away by the water, and he thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.20.2	“I hope my brother is okay.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.20.3	He dispatched his ascetics, saying, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.20.4	“Go and check on my brother.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.20.5	Together with the three hundred ascetics he then went to Uruvelā Kassapa and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.20.6	“Is this better, Kassapa?” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.20.7	“Yes, this is better.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.21.1	Then, after letting their hair and dreadlocks, their carrying pole and bundle, and their fire-worship implements be carried away by the water, they went to the Buddha. They bowed down with their head at his feet and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.21.2	“Venerable Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence; we wish to receive the full ordination.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.21.3	The Buddha said, “Come, monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.21.4	The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.21.5	And that was the full ordination of those venerables. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.22.1	Gayā Kassapa saw those things being carried away by the water, and he thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.22.2	“I hope my brothers are okay.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.22.3	He dispatched his ascetics, saying, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.22.4	“Go and check on my brothers.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.22.5	Together with the two hundred ascetics he then went to Uruvelā Kassapa and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.22.6	“Is this better, Kassapa?” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.22.7	“Yes, this is better.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.23.1	Then, after letting their hair and dreadlocks, their carrying pole and bundle, and their fire-worship implements be carried away by the water, they went to the Buddha. They bowed down with their head at his feet and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:20.23.2	“Venerable Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence; we wish to receive the full ordination.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.23.3	The Buddha said, “Come, monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.23.4	The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” 
pli-tv-kd1:20.23.5	And that was the full ordination of those venerables. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.24.1	By an act of supernormal determination the Buddha stopped five hundred logs from being split before splitting them; 
pli-tv-kd1:20.24.2	he stopped fires from being lit before lighting them; 
pli-tv-kd1:20.24.3	he then stopped them from being extinguished before extinguishing them; 
pli-tv-kd1:20.24.4	and he created five hundred pans with hot coals. 
pli-tv-kd1:20.24.5	In this way, there were three and a half thousand wonders. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.1.1	After staying at Uruvelā for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out for Gayāsīsa together with that large sangha of one thousand monks, all of them previously dreadlocked ascetics, 
pli-tv-kd1:21.1.2	and they stayed there. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.2.1	Then the Buddha addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:21.2.2	“Everything is burning. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.2.3	What is that everything that is burning? 
pli-tv-kd1:21.2.4	The eye is burning. Sights are burning. Eye-consciousness is burning. Eye-contact is burning. Whatever feelings arise because of eye-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful—those too are burning. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.2.5	Burning with what? 
pli-tv-kd1:21.2.6	Burning with the fire of sensual desire, the fire of ill will, and the fire of confusion; burning with birth, old age, and death; burning with grief, sorrow, pain, aversion, and distress, I say. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.3.1	The ear is burning. Sounds are burning. Ear-consciousness is burning. Ear-contact is burning. Whatever feelings arise because of ear-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful—those too are burning. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.3.2	Burning with what? 
pli-tv-kd1:21.3.3	Burning with the fire of sensual desire, the fire of ill will, and the fire of confusion; burning with birth, old age, and death; burning with grief, sorrow, pain, aversion, and distress, I say. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.3.4	The nose is burning. Smells are burning. Nose-consciousness is burning. Nose-contact is burning. Whatever feelings arise because of nose-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful—those too are burning. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.3.5	Burning with what? 
pli-tv-kd1:21.3.6	Burning with the fire of sensual desire, the fire of ill will, and the fire of confusion; burning with birth, old age, and death; burning with grief, sorrow, pain, aversion, and distress, I say. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.3.7	The tongue is burning. Tastes are burning. Tongue-consciousness is burning. Tongue-contact is burning. Whatever feelings arise because of tongue-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful—those too are burning. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.3.8	Burning with what? 
pli-tv-kd1:21.3.9	Burning with the fire of sensual desire, the fire of ill will, and the fire of confusion; burning with birth, old age, and death; burning with grief, sorrow, pain, aversion, and distress, I say. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.3.10	The body is burning. Touches are burning. Body-consciousness is burning. Body-contact is burning. Whatever feelings arise because of body-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful—those too are burning. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.3.11	Burning with what? 
pli-tv-kd1:21.3.12	Burning with the fire of sensual desire, the fire of ill will, and the fire of confusion; burning with birth, old age, and death; burning with grief, sorrow, pain, aversion, and distress, I say. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.3.13	The mind is burning. Mental phenomena are burning. Mind-consciousness is burning. Mind-contact is burning. Whatever feelings arise because of mind-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful—those too are burning. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.3.14	Burning with what? 
pli-tv-kd1:21.3.15	Burning with the fire of sensual desire, the fire of ill will, and the fire of confusion; burning with birth, old age, and death; burning with grief, sorrow, pain, aversion, and distress, I say. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.4.1	When they see this, the learned noble disciple is repelled by the eye, repelled by sights, repelled by eye-consciousness, repelled by eye-contact, and repelled by whatever feelings arise because of eye-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.4.2	They are repelled by the ear, repelled by sounds, repelled by ear-consciousness, repelled by ear-contact, repelled by whatever feelings arise because of ear-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.4.3	They are repelled by the nose, repelled by smells, repelled by nose-consciousness, repelled by nose-contact, and repelled by whatever feelings arise because of nose-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.4.4	They are repelled by the tongue, repelled by tastes, repelled by tongue-consciousness, repelled by tongue-contact, and repelled by whatever feelings arise because of tongue-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.4.5	They are repelled by the body, repelled by touches, repelled by body-consciousness, repelled by body-contact, and repelled by whatever feelings arise because of body-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.4.6	They are repelled by the mind, repelled by mental phenomena, repelled by mind-consciousness, repelled by mind-contact, and repelled by whatever feelings arise because of mind-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.4.7	Being repelled, they become desireless. Because they are desireless, they are freed. When they are freed, they know they are freed. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.4.8	They understand that birth has come to an end, that the spiritual life has been fulfilled, that the job has been done, that there is no further state of existence.” 
pli-tv-kd1:21.4.9	And while this exposition was being spoken, the minds of those one thousand monks were freed from the corruptions without grasping. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.4.10	The discourse on fire is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:21.4.11	The third section for recitation on the wonders at Uruvelā is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.1.0	13. The account of the meeting with Bimbisāra 
pli-tv-kd1:22.1.1	After staying at Gayāsīsa for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward Rājagaha with that large sangha of one thousand monks, all of them previously dreadlocked ascetics. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.1.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd1:22.1.3	he stayed in the cane grove at the Suppatiṭṭha Shrine. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.2.1	King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was told: 
pli-tv-kd1:22.2.2	“Sir, the ascetic Gotama, the Sakyan, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, has arrived at Rājagaha and is staying in the cane grove at the Suppatiṭṭha Shrine. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.2.3	That good Gotama has a fine reputation: 
pli-tv-kd1:22.2.4	“‘He is a Buddha, perfected and fully awakened, complete in insight and conduct, happy, knower of the world, supreme leader of trainable people, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, a Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.2.5	With his own insight he has seen this world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings, this society with its monastics and brahmins, its gods and humans, and he makes it known to others. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.2.6	He has a Teaching that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. It has a true goal and is well articulated. He sets out a perfectly complete and pure spiritual life.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:22.2.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.” 
pli-tv-kd1:22.3.1	Then, accompanied by one hundred and twenty thousand brahmin householders from Magadha, King Bimbisāra went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.3.2	Among those brahmin householders, some bowed to the Buddha and then sat down, some exchanged pleasantries with him and then sat down, some raised their joined palms and then sat down, some announced their name and family and then sat down, and some sat down in silence. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.4.1	And they thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:22.4.2	“Is the Great Ascetic practicing the spiritual life under Uruvelā Kassapa, or is Uruvelā Kassapa practicing the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic?” 
pli-tv-kd1:22.4.3	After reading the minds of those brahmin householders, the Buddha spoke to Venerable Uruvelā Kassapa in verse: 
pli-tv-kd1:22.4.4	“The resident of Uruvelā, known as The Emaciated One—
pli-tv-kd1:22.4.5	What did he see that he abandoned the fire? 
pli-tv-kd1:22.4.6	Kassapa, I ask you this question: 
pli-tv-kd1:22.4.7	Why did you abandon the fire worship?” 
pli-tv-kd1:22.4.8	“As a reward for the sacrifice, they promise sense pleasures: 
pli-tv-kd1:22.4.9	Sights, sounds, and tastes, and women, too. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.4.10	But knowing the stain in ownership, 
pli-tv-kd1:22.4.11	I found no delight in worship and sacrifice.” 
pli-tv-kd1:22.5.1	“So your mind didn’t delight there—
pli-tv-kd1:22.5.2	
pli-tv-kd1:22.5.3	In sights and sounds, and in tastes, too. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.5.4	What then, in the world of gods and humans, 
pli-tv-kd1:22.5.5	Does your mind delight in? Tell me this, Kassapa.” 
pli-tv-kd1:22.5.6	“I saw the state of peace that is detached from sense existence, 
pli-tv-kd1:22.5.7	Where there is nothing and no ownership; 
pli-tv-kd1:22.5.8	It doesn’t change, and can’t be found through another. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.5.9	That’s why I found no delight in worship and sacrifice.” 
pli-tv-kd1:22.6.1	And Uruvelā Kassapa got up from his seat, put his upper robe over one shoulder, bowed down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:22.6.2	“Venerable Sir, you’re my teacher, I’m your disciple; 
pli-tv-kd1:22.6.3	you’re my teacher, I’m your disciple.” 
pli-tv-kd1:22.6.4	The one hundred and twenty thousand brahmin householders from Magadha thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:22.6.5	“So Uruvelā Kassapa is practicing the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic.” 
pli-tv-kd1:22.7.1	Reading their minds, the Buddha gave them a progressive teaching: 
pli-tv-kd1:22.7.2	talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.7.3	When the Buddha knew that their minds were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: 
pli-tv-kd1:22.7.4	suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.8.1	And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, 
pli-tv-kd1:22.8.2	so too, while they were sitting right there, one hundred and ten thousand of those brahmin householders headed by Bimbisāra experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: 
pli-tv-kd1:22.8.3	“Anything that has a beginning has an end.” 
pli-tv-kd1:22.8.4	The remaining ten thousand declared themselves as lay followers. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.9.1	King Bimbisāra had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. He then said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:22.9.2	“Venerable Sir, when I was a prince, I had five wishes, and they have now been fulfilled. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.9.3	When I was a prince, I thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:22.9.4	‘Oh, I wish they would anoint me as the king!’ That was my first wish, which has now been fulfilled. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.9.5	‘May one who is perfected and fully awakened come to my kingdom!’ That was my second wish, which has now been fulfilled. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.10.1	‘May I get to visit that Buddha!’ That was my third wish, which has now been fulfilled. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.10.2	‘May that Buddha give me a teaching!’ That was my fourth wish, which has now been fulfilled. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.10.3	‘May I understand the Teaching of that Buddha!’ That was my fifth wish, which has now been fulfilled. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.11.1	Wonderful, Sir, wonderful! 
pli-tv-kd1:22.11.2	Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see what’s there—
pli-tv-kd1:22.11.3	just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.11.4	I take refuge in the Buddha, in the Teaching, and in the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.11.5	Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. And please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd1:22.11.6	The Buddha consented by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.12.1	Knowing that the Buddha had consented, the King got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.12.2	The following morning King Bimbisāra had various kinds of fine food prepared. He then had the Buddha informed 
pli-tv-kd1:22.12.3	that the meal was ready. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.12.4	The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and together with a large sangha of a thousand monks, all previously dreadlocked ascetics, he entered Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.1	Just then Sakka, the ruler of the gods, had transformed himself into a young brahmin. He walked in front of the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha, chanting these verses: 
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.2	“The Tamed One with the tamed ones, previously dreadlocked; 
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.3	The Liberated One with the liberated ones: 
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.4	Golden in color, 
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.5	The Buddha entered Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.6	The Freed One with the freed ones, previously dreadlocked; 
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.7	The Liberated One with the liberated ones: 
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.8	Golden in color, 
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.9	The Buddha entered Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.10	The One Gone Beyond with the ones gone beyond, previously dreadlocked; 
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.11	The Liberated One with the liberated ones: 
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.12	Golden in color, 
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.13	The Buddha entered Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.14	The Peaceful One with the peaceful ones, previously dreadlocked; 
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.15	The Liberated One with the liberated ones: 
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.16	Golden in color, 
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.17	The Buddha entered Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.18	He has ten abidings and ten powers; 
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.19	He knows ten truths and has ten qualities—
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.20	With a following of ten times one hundred, 
pli-tv-kd1:22.13.21	The Buddha entered Rājagaha.” 
pli-tv-kd1:22.14.1	People saw Sakka, and they said, 
pli-tv-kd1:22.14.2	“This young brahmin is beautiful; he’s handsome and graceful. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.14.3	Who is this young brahmin?” 
pli-tv-kd1:22.14.4	And Sakka replied to them in verse: 
pli-tv-kd1:22.14.5	“Unwavering and tamed in all respects, 
pli-tv-kd1:22.14.6	Purified, perfected, and without equal; 
pli-tv-kd1:22.14.7	The one in the world who is happy—
pli-tv-kd1:22.14.8	I’m his servant.” 
pli-tv-kd1:22.15.1	The Buddha then went to King Bimbisāra’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat, together with the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.15.2	The King personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, the King sat down to one side. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.16.1	And he thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:22.16.2	“Where will the Buddha stay 
pli-tv-kd1:22.16.3	that’s neither too far from the village nor too close, that has good access roads, that’s easily accessible for people who seek him, that has few people during the day and is quiet at night, that’s free from chatter and offers solitude, that’s away from human habitation and suitable for seclusion?” 
pli-tv-kd1:22.17.1	And it occurred to him, 
pli-tv-kd1:22.17.2	“My Bamboo Grove park has all these qualities. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.17.3	Let me give the park to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd1:22.18.1	The King then took hold of a golden ceremonial vessel and dedicated the park to the Buddha, saying, 
pli-tv-kd1:22.18.2	“I give this park, the Bamboo Grove, to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd1:22.18.3	The Buddha accepted the park. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.18.4	After instructing, inspiring, and gladdening the King with a teaching, he got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-kd1:22.18.5	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:22.18.6	“I allow monasteries.” 
pli-tv-kd1:22.18.7	The account of the meeting with Bimbisāra is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:23.1.0	14. The account of the going forth of Sāriputta and Moggallāna 
pli-tv-kd1:23.1.1	At that time the wanderer Sañcaya was staying at Rājagaha with a large group of two hundred and fifty wanderers, 
pli-tv-kd1:23.1.2	including Sāriputta and Moggallāna. 
pli-tv-kd1:23.1.3	The two of them had made an agreement 
pli-tv-kd1:23.1.4	that whoever reached the deathless first would inform the other. 
pli-tv-kd1:23.2.1	Just then, Venerable Assaji robed up in the morning, took his bowl and robe, and entered Rājagaha for almsfood. He was pleasing in his conduct: in going out and coming back, in looking ahead and looking aside, in bending and stretching his arms. His eyes were lowered, and he was perfect in deportment. 
pli-tv-kd1:23.2.2	The wanderer Sāriputta observed all this 
pli-tv-kd1:23.2.3	and thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:23.2.4	“This monk is among those in the world who are perfected or on the path to perfection. 
pli-tv-kd1:23.2.5	Let me went up to him and ask him 
pli-tv-kd1:23.2.6	who he has gone forth under, and who his teacher is or whose teachings he follows.” 
pli-tv-kd1:23.3.1	But it occurred to him, 
pli-tv-kd1:23.3.2	“It’s the wrong time to ask him while he’s walking for almsfood among the houses. 
pli-tv-kd1:23.3.3	Let me follow behind him, for one who seeks the path will find it.” 
pli-tv-kd1:23.3.4	After walking for almsfood in Rājagaha, Assaji took his almsfood and turned back. 
pli-tv-kd1:23.3.5	Sāriputta then went up to him and exchanged pleasantries with him. 
pli-tv-kd1:23.3.6	And he asked, 
pli-tv-kd1:23.3.7	“Venerable, your senses are clear and your skin is pure and bright. 
pli-tv-kd1:23.3.8	Who have you gone forth under? Who is your teacher or whose teaching do you follow?” 
pli-tv-kd1:23.4.1	“There’s a great ascetic, a Sakyan who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan. I’ve gone forth under him, he’s my teacher, and I follow his teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd1:23.4.2	“But what does your teacher teach?” 
pli-tv-kd1:23.4.3	“I’ve only recently gone forth and so I’m new to this spiritual path. I’m not capable of giving you the Teaching in full, but I can tell you the meaning in brief.” 
pli-tv-kd1:23.4.4	Sāriputta replied, 
pli-tv-kd1:23.4.5	“Yes, please,” and he added: 
pli-tv-kd1:23.4.6	“Speak little or much, 
pli-tv-kd1:23.4.7	But do tell me the meaning. 
pli-tv-kd1:23.4.8	I just want the meaning, 
pli-tv-kd1:23.4.9	For what’s the point of a detailed exposition?” 
pli-tv-kd1:23.5.1	And Assaji gave this teaching to the wanderer Sāriputta: 
pli-tv-kd1:23.5.2	“Of causally arisen things, 
pli-tv-kd1:23.5.3	The Buddha has declared their cause, 
pli-tv-kd1:23.5.4	As well as their ending. 
pli-tv-kd1:23.5.5	This is the teaching of the Great Ascetic.” 
pli-tv-kd1:23.5.6	When he had heard this teaching, Sāriputta experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: 
pli-tv-kd1:23.5.7	“Anything that has a beginning has an end.” 
pli-tv-kd1:23.5.8	“Now this is the truth, even just this, 
pli-tv-kd1:23.5.9	The sorrowless state that you have penetrated, 
pli-tv-kd1:23.5.10	Which has been unseen and neglected 
pli-tv-kd1:23.5.11	Through innumerable eons.” 
pli-tv-kd1:23.6.1	Then the wanderer Sāriputta went to the wanderer Moggallāna. 
pli-tv-kd1:23.6.2	When Moggallāna saw him coming, he said to Sāriputta, 
pli-tv-kd1:23.6.3	“Your senses are clear and your skin is pure and bright. 
pli-tv-kd1:23.6.4	You haven’t attained the deathless, have you?” 
pli-tv-kd1:23.6.5	“I have.” 
pli-tv-kd1:23.6.6	“But how did it happen?” 
pli-tv-kd1:23.7.1	And Sāriputta told him everything up to and including the teaching given by Assaji. 
pli-tv-kd1:23.10.6	When he had heard this teaching, Moggallāna experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: 
pli-tv-kd1:23.10.7	“Anything that has a beginning has an end.” 
pli-tv-kd1:23.10.8	“Now this is the truth, even just this, 
pli-tv-kd1:23.10.9	The sorrowless state that you have penetrated, 
pli-tv-kd1:23.10.10	Which has been unseen and neglected 
pli-tv-kd1:23.10.11	Through innumerable eons.” 
pli-tv-kd1:24.1.1	And Moggallāna said to Sāriputta, 
pli-tv-kd1:24.1.2	“Let’s go to the Buddha; he’s our teacher.” 
pli-tv-kd1:24.1.3	“But these two hundred and fifty wanderers look to us for support. We must tell them first. 
pli-tv-kd1:24.1.4	They can then act as they think appropriate.” 
pli-tv-kd1:24.1.5	And they went to those wanderers and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:24.1.6	“We’re going to the Buddha; he’s our teacher.” 
pli-tv-kd1:24.1.7	“But we look to you for support. If you are to practice the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic, so will all of us.” 
pli-tv-kd1:24.2.1	Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna went to Sañcaya and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:24.2.2	“We’re going to the Buddha; he’s our teacher.” 
pli-tv-kd1:24.2.3	“Don’t go. Let the three of us look after this community together.” 
pli-tv-kd1:24.2.4	Sāriputta and Moggallāna said the same thing a second time 
pli-tv-kd1:24.2.5	and a third time, 
pli-tv-kd1:24.2.7	and they got the same reply. 
pli-tv-kd1:24.3.1	They then took those two hundred and fifty wanderers and went to the Bamboo Grove. 
pli-tv-kd1:24.3.2	But the wanderer Sañcaya vomited warm blood right there. 
pli-tv-kd1:24.3.3	When the Buddha saw Sāriputta and Moggallāna coming, he said to the monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:24.3.4	“The two friends Kolita and Upatissa are coming. 
pli-tv-kd1:24.3.5	They will be my most eminent disciples, an excellent pair.” 
pli-tv-kd1:24.3.6	They had not even reached the Bamboo Grove, 
pli-tv-kd1:24.3.7	Yet had a profound range of knowledge, 
pli-tv-kd1:24.3.8	About the supreme end of ownership, about freedom. 
pli-tv-kd1:24.3.9	And the Teacher said of them: 
pli-tv-kd1:24.3.10	“These two friends are coming, 
pli-tv-kd1:24.3.11	Kolita and Upatissa. 
pli-tv-kd1:24.3.12	They will be an excellent pair, 
pli-tv-kd1:24.3.13	My most eminent disciples.” 
pli-tv-kd1:24.4.1	Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached the Buddha, bowed down with their heads at the Buddha’s feet, and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:24.4.2	“Venerable Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence; we wish to receive the full ordination.” 
pli-tv-kd1:24.4.3	The Buddha said, “Come, monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:24.4.4	The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” 
pli-tv-kd1:24.4.5	And that was the full ordination of those venerables. 
pli-tv-kd1:24.5.0	14.1 The going forth of those who were well-known 
pli-tv-kd1:24.5.1	At that time many well-known Magadhans from good families were practicing the spiritual life under the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd1:24.5.2	People complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd1:24.5.3	“The ascetic Gotama is making us childless and he’s making widows out of us; he’s breaking up good families. Right now a thousand dreadlocked ascetics have gone forth because of him, and also these two hundred and fifty wanderers who were disciples of Sañcaya. 
pli-tv-kd1:24.5.4	All these well-known Magadhans from good families are practicing the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama.” 
pli-tv-kd1:24.5.5	And when they saw monks, they confronted them with this verse: 
pli-tv-kd1:24.5.6	“The Great Ascetic has arrived 
pli-tv-kd1:24.5.7	At Giribbaja in Magadha. 
pli-tv-kd1:24.5.8	After leading away all of Sañcaya’s disciples, 
pli-tv-kd1:24.5.9	Who will he lead away next?” 
pli-tv-kd1:24.6.1	The monks heard the complaints of those people 
pli-tv-kd1:24.6.2	and they told the Buddha what had happened. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:24.6.3	“The complaining will soon stop; it will only last seven days. 
pli-tv-kd1:24.6.4	And when people confront you like this, 
pli-tv-kd1:24.6.9	you can confront them in return with this verse: 
pli-tv-kd1:24.6.10	ʻIndeed, the Great Heroes, the Buddhas, 
pli-tv-kd1:24.6.11	Lead by means of a good teaching. 
pli-tv-kd1:24.6.12	When you understand this, what indignation can there be 
pli-tv-kd1:24.6.13	Toward those who lead legitimately?’” 
pli-tv-kd1:24.7.1	Soon, when they had seen monks, people confronted them with this verse: 
pli-tv-kd1:24.7.2	“The Great Ascetic has arrived 
pli-tv-kd1:24.7.3	At Giribbaja in Magadha. 
pli-tv-kd1:24.7.4	After leading away all of Sañcaya’s disciples, 
pli-tv-kd1:24.7.5	Who will he lead away next?” 
pli-tv-kd1:24.7.6	And the monks confronted them in return with this verse: 
pli-tv-kd1:24.7.7	“Indeed, the Great Heroes, the Buddhas, 
pli-tv-kd1:24.7.8	Lead by means of a good teaching. 
pli-tv-kd1:24.7.9	When you understand this, what indignation can there be 
pli-tv-kd1:24.7.10	Toward those who lead legitimately?” 
pli-tv-kd1:24.7.11	People thought, “So it seems the Sakyan monastics lead legitimately, not illegitimately.” And the complaining lasted seven days, and then it stopped. 
pli-tv-kd1:24.7.12	The account of the going forth of Sāriputta and Moggallāna is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:24.7.13	The fourth section for recitation is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:25.1.0	15. Discussion of the proper conduct toward the preceptor 
pli-tv-kd1:25.1.1	At that time the monks did not have preceptors or teachers, and as a result they were not being instructed. While walking for almsfood, they were shabbily dressed and improper in appearance. 
pli-tv-kd1:25.1.2	While people were eating, they held out their almsbowls to receive leftovers, even right over their food, whether it was cooked or fresh food, delicacies or drinks. 
pli-tv-kd1:25.1.3	They ate bean curry and rice that they themselves had asked for, 
pli-tv-kd1:25.1.4	and they were noisy in the dining hall. 
pli-tv-kd1:25.2.1	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd1:25.2.2	“How can the Sakyan monastics act like this? 
pli-tv-kd1:25.2.5	They are just like brahmins at a brahminical meal.” 
pli-tv-kd1:25.3.1	The monks heard the complaints of those people. 
pli-tv-kd1:25.3.2	The monks of few desires, who had a sense of conscience, and who were contented, afraid of wrongdoing, and fond of the training, complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd1:25.3.3	“How can monks act like this?” 
pli-tv-kd1:25.4.1	They then told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd1:25.4.3	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:25.4.4	“Is it true, monks, that monks act like this?” 
pli-tv-kd1:25.4.5	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd1:25.5.1	The Buddha criticzed them, 
pli-tv-kd1:25.5.2	“It’s not suitable for those foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-kd1:25.5.3	How can they act like this? 
pli-tv-kd1:25.5.4	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence, 
pli-tv-kd1:25.5.5	but will hinder it and cause some to change their minds.” 
pli-tv-kd1:25.6.1	Then the Buddha spoke in many ways in dispraise of being difficult to support and maintain, in dispraise of great desires, discontent, socializing, and laziness; but he spoke in many ways in praise of being easy to support and maintain, of fewness of wishes, contentment, self-elimination, ascetic practices, serenity, reduction in things, and of being energetic. After giving a teaching on what is right and proper, he addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:25.6.2	“There should be a preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:25.6.3	The preceptor should regard his student as a son and the student his preceptor as a father. 
pli-tv-kd1:25.6.4	In this way they will respect, esteem, and be considerate toward each other, and they will grow and reach greatness on this spiritual path. 
pli-tv-kd1:25.7.1	And a preceptor should be chosen like this: 
pli-tv-kd1:25.7.2	After putting his upper robe over one shoulder, a student should pay respect at the feet of a potential preceptor. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-kd1:25.7.3	‘Venerable, please be my preceptor.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:25.7.4	And he should repeat this a second 
pli-tv-kd1:25.7.5	and a third time.

pli-tv-kd1:26.7.36	If the gateway is dirty, he should sweep it. 
pli-tv-kd1:26.7.37	If the assembly hall is dirty, he should sweep it. 
pli-tv-kd1:26.7.38	If the water-boiling shed is dirty, he should sweep it. 
pli-tv-kd1:26.7.39	If the restroom is dirty, he should sweep it. 
pli-tv-kd1:26.7.40	If there is no water for drinking, he should set it out. 
pli-tv-kd1:26.7.41	If there is no water for washing, he should set it out. 
pli-tv-kd1:26.7.42	If there is no water in the rinsing pot, he should fill it. 
pli-tv-kd1:26.8.1	“If the student becomes discontent, the preceptor should send him away or have him sent away, or he should give him a teaching 
pli-tv-kd1:26.8.2	If the student becomes anxious, the preceptor should dispel it or have it dispelled, or he should give him a teaching. 
pli-tv-kd1:26.8.3	If the student has a wrong view, the preceptor should make him give it up or have someone else do it, or he should give him a teaching. 
pli-tv-kd1:26.9.1	If the student has committed a heavy offense and deserves probation, 
pli-tv-kd1:26.9.2	the preceptor should try to find a way for the Sangha to get it done. 
pli-tv-kd1:26.9.3	If the student has committed a heavy offense and deserves to be sent back to the beginning, 
pli-tv-kd1:26.9.4	the preceptor should try to find a way for the Sangha to get it done. 
pli-tv-kd1:26.9.5	If the student has committed a heavy offense and deserves to be given the trial period, 
pli-tv-kd1:26.9.6	the preceptor should try to find a way for the Sangha to get it done. 
pli-tv-kd1:26.9.7	If the student has committed a heavy offense and deserves rehabilitation, 
pli-tv-kd1:26.9.8	the preceptor should try to find a way for the Sangha to get it done. 
pli-tv-kd1:26.10.1	If the Sangha wants to do a legal procedure against his student—whether a procedure of condemnation, demotion, banishment, reconciliation, or ejection—
pli-tv-kd1:26.10.2	the preceptor should make an effort to stop it or to reduce the penalty. 
pli-tv-kd1:26.10.3	But if the Sangha has already done a legal procedure against his student—whether a procedure of condemnation, demotion, banishment, reconciliation, or ejection—
pli-tv-kd1:26.10.4	the preceptor should help the student conduct himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released, and try for the Sangha to lift that procedure. 
pli-tv-kd1:26.11.1	“If the student’s robe needs washing, the preceptor should show him how to do it, 
pli-tv-kd1:26.11.2	or he should make an effort to have it done. 
pli-tv-kd1:26.11.3	If the student needs a robe, the preceptor should show him how to make one, 
pli-tv-kd1:26.11.4	or he should make an effort to have one made. 
pli-tv-kd1:26.11.5	If the student needs dye, the preceptor should show him how to make it, 
pli-tv-kd1:26.11.6	or he should make an effort to have it made. 
pli-tv-kd1:26.11.7	If the student’s robe needs dyeing, the preceptor should show him how to do it, 
pli-tv-kd1:26.11.8	or he should make an effort to have it done. 
pli-tv-kd1:26.11.9	When he’s dyeing the robe, he should carefully and repeatedly turn it over, 
pli-tv-kd1:26.11.10	and he shouldn’t go away while it’s still dripping. 
pli-tv-kd1:26.11.11	If his student is sick, he should nurse him for as long as he lives, or he should wait until he’s recovered.” 
pli-tv-kd1:26.11.12	The proper conduct toward a student is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.1.0	17. Discussion on dismissal 
pli-tv-kd1:27.1.1	On a later occasion the students did not conduct themselves properly toward their preceptors. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.1.2	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd1:27.1.3	“How can students not conduct themselves properly toward their preceptors?” 
pli-tv-kd1:27.1.4	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:27.1.5	“Is it true, monks, that students are acting like this?” 
pli-tv-kd1:27.1.6	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd1:27.1.7	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-kd1:27.1.8	“How can students not conduct themselves properly toward their preceptors?” … 
pli-tv-kd1:27.1.9	and after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd1:27.1.10	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:27.1.11	“A student should conduct himself properly toward his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.1.12	If he doesn’t, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:27.2.1	They still did not conduct themselves properly. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.2.2	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.2.3	“You should dismiss one who doesn’t conduct himself properly. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.2.4	And this is how he should be dismissed. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.2.5	If the preceptor makes it understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech: ʻI dismiss you,’ or, ʻDon’t come back here,’ or, ʻRemove your bowl and robe,’ or, ʻYou shouldn’t attend on me’—then the student has been dismissed. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.2.6	If he doesn’t make it understood by body, speech, or by body and speech, then the student hasn’t been dismissed.” 
pli-tv-kd1:27.3.1	Students who had been dismissed did not ask for forgiveness. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.3.2	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.3.3	“You should ask for forgiveness.” 
pli-tv-kd1:27.3.4	They still did not ask for forgiveness. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.3.5	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:27.3.6	“One who has been dismissed should ask for forgiveness. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.3.7	If he doesn’t, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:27.4.1	Preceptors who were asked for forgiveness did not forgive. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.4.2	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.4.3	“You should forgive.” 
pli-tv-kd1:27.4.4	They still did not forgive. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.4.5	The students left, disrobed, and joined the monastics of other religions. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.4.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:27.4.7	“When asked for forgiveness, you should forgive. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.4.8	If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:27.5.1	Preceptors dismissed students who were conducting themselves properly and did not dismiss those who were not. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.5.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:27.5.3	“You should not dismiss someone who is conducting himself properly. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.5.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.5.5	And you should dismiss someone who isn’t conducting himself properly. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.5.6	If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.6.1	“If a student has five qualities, he should be dismissed. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.6.2	He doesn’t have much affection for his preceptor; he doesn’t have much confidence in his preceptor; he doesn’t have a strong sense of conscience in regard to his preceptor; he doesn’t have much respect for his preceptor; he hasn’t developed his mind much under his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.6.4	If a student has five qualities, he shouldn’t be dismissed. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.6.5	He has much affection for his preceptor; he has much confidence in his preceptor; he has strong sense of conscience in regard to his preceptor; he has much respect for his preceptor; he has developed his mind much under his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.7.1	If a student has five qualities, he deserves to be dismissed. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.7.2	He doesn’t have much affection for his preceptor; he doesn’t have much confidence in his preceptor; he doesn’t have a strong sense of conscience in regard to his preceptor; he doesn’t have much respect for his preceptor; he hasn’t developed his mind much under his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.7.4	If a student has five qualities, he doesn’t deserve to be dismissed. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.7.5	He has much affection for his preceptor; he has much confidence in his preceptor; he has a strong sense of conscience in regard to his preceptor; he has much respect for his preceptor; he has developed his mind much under his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.8.1	If a student has five qualities, the preceptor is at fault if he doesn’t dismiss him, but he’s not at fault if he dismisses him. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.8.2	The student doesn’t have much affection for his preceptor; he doesn’t have much confidence in his preceptor; he doesn’t have a strong sense of conscience in regard to his preceptor; he doesn’t have much respect for his preceptor; he hasn’t developed his mind much under his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.8.4	If a student has five qualities, the preceptor is at fault if he dismisses him, but he’s not at fault if he doesn’t dismiss him. 
pli-tv-kd1:27.8.5	The student has much affection for his preceptor; he has much confidence in his preceptor; he has a strong sense of conscience in regard to his preceptor; he has much respect for his preceptor; he has developed his mind much under his preceptor.” 
pli-tv-kd1:28.1.1	On one occasion a brahmin went to the monks and asked for the going forth, 
pli-tv-kd1:28.1.2	but the monks declined. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.1.3	As a result, he became thin, haggard, and pale, with veins protruding all over his body. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.1.4	The Buddha saw him, and he asked the monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:28.1.5	“Why is that brahmin looking so sickly?” 
pli-tv-kd1:28.1.6	And they told him what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.2.1	The Buddha said, 
pli-tv-kd1:28.2.2	“Does anyone remember any act of service from that brahmin?” 
pli-tv-kd1:28.2.3	Venerable Sāriputta replied, 
pli-tv-kd1:28.2.4	“I do, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd1:28.2.5	“What service do you remember, Sāriputta?” 
pli-tv-kd1:28.2.6	“While I was walking for almsfood here in Rājagaha, that brahmin gave a ladleful of food.” 
pli-tv-kd1:28.3.1	“Good, good, Sāriputta, superior people have gratitude. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.3.2	Well then, Sāriputta, give that brahmin the going forth and the full ordination.” 
pli-tv-kd1:28.3.3	“But how should I do it?” 
pli-tv-kd1:28.3.4	The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:28.3.5	“From today I rescind the full ordination through the taking of the three refuges. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.4.1	Instead you should give the full ordination through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.4.2	And the ordination should be done like this. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.4.3	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd1:28.4.4	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.4.5	So-and-so wants the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.4.6	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.4.7	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.5.1	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.5.2	So-and-so wants the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.5.3	The Sangha gives the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.5.4	Any monk who approves of giving the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.5.5	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.5.6	For the second time I speak on this matter. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.5.7	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.5.8	So-and-so wants the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.5.9	The Sangha gives the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.5.10	Any monk who approves of giving the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.5.11	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.6.1	For the third time I speak on this matter. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.6.2	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.6.3	So-and-so wants the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.6.4	The Sangha gives the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.6.5	Any monk who approves of giving the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.6.6	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.6.7	The Sangha has given the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:28.6.8	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd1:29.1.1	On a later occasion, a monk misbehaved immediately after his full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:29.1.2	The monks told him, 
pli-tv-kd1:29.1.3	“Please don’t do that; it’s not allowable.” 
pli-tv-kd1:29.1.5	“But I didn’t ask you to ordain me. 
pli-tv-kd1:29.1.6	Why did you ordain me without being asked?” 
pli-tv-kd1:29.1.7	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:29.1.8	“You should not give the full ordination to someone without being asked. 
pli-tv-kd1:29.1.9	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd1:29.1.10	I allow you to give the full ordination to someone when you have been asked. 
pli-tv-kd1:29.2.1	And you should be asked like this. 
pli-tv-kd1:29.2.2	After approaching the Sangha, the one who wants the full ordination should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: 
pli-tv-kd1:29.2.3	‘Venerables, I ask the Sangha for the full ordination. May the Sangha lift me up out of compassion.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:29.2.4	And he should ask a second 
pli-tv-kd1:29.2.5	and a third time. 
pli-tv-kd1:29.3.1	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd1:29.3.2	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd1:29.3.3	So-and-so wants the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd1:29.3.4	So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:29.3.5	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:29.3.6	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd1:29.4.1	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd1:29.4.2	So-and-so wants the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd1:29.4.3	So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:29.4.4	The Sangha gives the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:29.4.5	Any monk who approves of giving the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd1:29.4.6	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd1:29.4.7	For the second time I speak on this matter. … 
pli-tv-kd1:29.4.8	For the third time I speak on this matter. … 
pli-tv-kd1:29.4.9	The Sangha has given the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:29.4.10	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd1:30.1.1	At that time in Rājagaha, there was a succession of fine meals. 
pli-tv-kd1:30.1.2	A certain brahmin thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:30.1.3	“These Sakyan monastics have pleasant habits and a happy life. After eating nice food, they sleep in beds sheltered from the wind. 
pli-tv-kd1:30.1.4	Why donʼt I go forth with the Sakyan monastics?” 
pli-tv-kd1:30.1.5	Then that brahmin went to the monks and asked for the going forth. 
pli-tv-kd1:30.1.6	The monks gave him the going forth and the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:30.2.1	When he had gone forth, that succession of meals came to a stop. 
pli-tv-kd1:30.2.2	The monks said to him, 
pli-tv-kd1:30.2.3	“Come now, let’s walk for almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd1:30.2.5	“I didn’t go forth to walk for almsfood. 
pli-tv-kd1:30.2.6	If you give me some, I’ll eat it. If not, I’ll disrobe.” 
pli-tv-kd1:30.2.7	“But did you go forth for the sake of your stomach?” 
pli-tv-kd1:30.2.8	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd1:30.3.1	The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd1:30.3.2	“How can a monk go forth on this well-proclaimed spiritual path for the sake of his stomach?” 
pli-tv-kd1:30.3.3	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned that monk: 
pli-tv-kd1:30.3.4	“Is it true, monk, that you went forth for the sake of our stomach?” 
pli-tv-kd1:30.3.5	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd1:30.3.6	The Buddha rebuked him … 
pli-tv-kd1:30.3.7	“Foolish man, how can you go forth on this well-proclaimed spiritual path for the sake of your stomach? 
pli-tv-kd1:30.3.8	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd1:30.3.9	and after rebuking him … 
pli-tv-kd1:30.3.10	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:30.4.1	“When you are giving the full ordination, you should point out the four supports: 
pli-tv-kd1:30.4.2	One gone forth is supported by almsfood. You should persevere with this for life. 
pli-tv-kd1:30.4.3	These are the extra material supports: 
pli-tv-kd1:30.4.4	a meal for the Sangha, a meal for designated monks, an invitational meal, a meal for which lots are drawn, a half-monthly meal, a meal on the observance day, and a meal on the day after the observance day. 
pli-tv-kd1:30.4.5	One gone forth is supported by rag-robes. You should persevere with this for life. 
pli-tv-kd1:30.4.6	These are the extra material supports: 
pli-tv-kd1:30.4.7	linen, cotton, silk, wool, sunn hemp, and hemp. 
pli-tv-kd1:30.4.8	One gone forth is supported by the foot of a tree as resting place. You should persevere with this for life. 
pli-tv-kd1:30.4.9	These are the extra material supports: 
pli-tv-kd1:30.4.10	a dwelling, a stilt house, and a cave. 
pli-tv-kd1:30.4.11	One gone forth is supported by medicine of fermented urine. You should persevere with this for life. 
pli-tv-kd1:30.4.12	These are the extra material supports: 
pli-tv-kd1:30.4.13	ghee, butter, oil, honey, and syrup.” 
pli-tv-kd1:30.4.14	The fifth section for recitation on the proper conduct toward the preceptor is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.1.0	18. Discussion of the proper conduct toward a teacher 
pli-tv-kd1:31.1.1	Soon afterwards a young brahmin went to the monks and asked for the going forth. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.1.2	The monks told him about the four supports. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.1.3	He said, 
pli-tv-kd1:31.1.4	“Venerables, if you had told me about this after my going forth, I would have been fine. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.1.5	But now I won’t go forth, 
pli-tv-kd1:31.1.6	for these supports are disgusting and repulsive to me.” 
pli-tv-kd1:31.1.7	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:31.1.8	“You should not point out the four supports beforehand. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.1.9	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.1.10	You should point out the supports immediately after the full ordination.” 
pli-tv-kd1:31.2.1	At that time the monks gave the full ordination in groups of two and three. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.2.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:31.2.3	“You should not give the full ordination in groups of less than ten. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.2.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.2.5	You should give the full ordination in groups of ten or more than ten.” 
pli-tv-kd1:31.3.1	At that time monks who only had one or two years of seniority gave the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.3.2	Among them was Venerable Upasena of Vaṅganta. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.3.3	After completing the rainy-season residence, he had two years of seniority and his student one. Taking his student, he then went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.3.4	Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:31.4.1	the Buddha said to Upasena, 
pli-tv-kd1:31.4.2	“I hope you’re keeping well, monk, I hope you’re getting by. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.4.3	I hope you’re not tired from traveling.” 
pli-tv-kd1:31.4.4	“I’m keeping well, Venerable Sir, I’m getting by. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.4.5	I’m not tired from traveling.” 
pli-tv-kd1:31.4.6	When Buddhas know what is going on, sometimes they ask and sometimes not. They know the right time to ask and when not to ask. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.4.7	Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, otherwise not, 
pli-tv-kd1:31.4.8	for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.4.9	Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.5.1	The Buddha said to Upasena, “How long have you been a monk?” 
pli-tv-kd1:31.5.2	“Two years, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd1:31.5.3	“And this monk?” 
pli-tv-kd1:31.5.4	“One year.” 
pli-tv-kd1:31.5.5	“And what’s his relationship to you?” 
pli-tv-kd1:31.5.6	“He’s my student.” 
pli-tv-kd1:31.5.7	The Buddha rebuked him, 
pli-tv-kd1:31.5.8	“It’s not suitable, foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.5.9	How can you, who should be taught and instructed by others, think to teach and instruct another? 
pli-tv-kd1:31.5.10	You have turned to abundance too readily, that is, by forming a group. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.5.11	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd1:31.5.12	and after rebuking him … 
pli-tv-kd1:31.5.13	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:31.5.14	“You should not give the full ordination if you have less than ten years of seniority. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.5.15	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.5.16	I allow you to give the full ordination if you have ten or more years of seniority.” 
pli-tv-kd1:31.6.1	Soon afterwards, 
pli-tv-kd1:31.6.2	when they had ten years of seniority, 
pli-tv-kd1:31.6.3	ignorant and incompetent monks gave the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.6.4	As a result there were ignorant preceptors with knowledgeable students, 
pli-tv-kd1:31.6.5	incompetent preceptors with competent students, 
pli-tv-kd1:31.6.6	uneducated preceptors with learned students, 
pli-tv-kd1:31.6.7	stupid preceptors with clever students. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.6.8	A monk who had been a monastic of another religion refuted his preceptor, even though he had been legitimately corrected by him. He then returned to that religious community. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.7.1	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd1:31.7.2	“How can ignorant and incompetent monks give the full ordination just because they have ten years of seniority? 
pli-tv-kd1:31.7.3	There are ignorant preceptors with knowledgeable students, incompetent preceptors with competent students, uneducated preceptors with learned students, stupid preceptors with clever students.” 
pli-tv-kd1:31.7.4	They told the Buddha. He said, 
pli-tv-kd1:31.7.5	“Is it true, monks, that this is happening?” 
pli-tv-kd1:31.7.9	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd1:31.8.1	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-kd1:31.8.2	“How can those foolish men give the full ordination just because they have ten years of seniority? 
pli-tv-kd1:31.8.3	The consequences are evident. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.8.4	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd1:31.8.5	and after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd1:31.8.6	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:31.8.7	“An ignorant and incompetent monk should not give the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.8.8	If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd1:31.8.9	I allow a competent and capable monk to give the full ordination, if he has ten or more years of seniority.” 
pli-tv-kd1:32.1.1	At that time there were preceptors who left, disrobed, died, or joined another faction, and as a consequence their students were not being instructed. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.1.2	While walking for almsfood, they were shabbily dressed and improper in appearance. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.1.3	While people were eating, they held out their almsbowls to receive leftovers, even right over their food, whether it was cooked or fresh food, delicacies or drinks. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.1.4	They ate bean curry and rice that they themselves had asked for, 
pli-tv-kd1:32.1.5	and they were noisy in the dining hall. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.1.6	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd1:32.1.7	“How can the Sakyan monastics act like this? 
pli-tv-kd1:32.1.10	They are just like brahmins at a brahminical meal.” 
pli-tv-kd1:32.1.11	The monks heard the complaints of those people. … 
pli-tv-kd1:32.1.12	They then told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.1.13	“Is it true, monks … ?” 
pli-tv-kd1:32.1.14	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd1:32.1.15	after rebuking them, the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:32.1.16	“There should be a teacher. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.1.17	The teacher should regard his pupil as a son and the pupil his teacher as a father. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.1.18	In this way they will respect, esteem, and be considerate toward each other, and they will grow and reach greatness on this spiritual path. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.1.19	You should live with formal support for ten years. And I allow a monk of ten years’ seniority to give such support. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.2.1	And a teacher should be chosen like this: 
pli-tv-kd1:32.2.2	After putting his upper robe over one shoulder, a pupil should pay respect at the feet of a potential teacher. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-kd1:32.2.3	‘Venerable, please be my teacher; I wish to live with formal support from you.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:32.2.4	And he should repeat this a second 
pli-tv-kd1:32.2.5	and a third time. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.2.6	If the other makes it understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech: ‘Yes,’ or, ‘No problem,’ or, ‘It’s suitable,’ or, ‘It’s appropriate,’ or, ‘Carry on with inspiration’—then a teacher has been chosen. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.2.7	If the other doesn’t make it understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then a teacher hasn’t been chosen. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.1	“A pupil should conduct himself properly toward his teacher. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.2	This is the proper conduct: 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.3	After getting up at the appropriate time, the pupil should take off his sandals, and put his upper robe over one shoulder. He should then give his teacher a tooth cleaner and water for rinsing the mouth, and he should prepare a seat for him. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.4	If there is rice porridge, he should wash a vessel and bring the rice porridge to his teacher. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.5	When the teacher has drunk the rice porridge, the pupil should give him water and receive the vessel, and holding it low, he should wash it carefully without scratching it and then put it away. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.6	When the teacher has gotten up, the pupil should put away the seat. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.7	If the place is dirty, he should sweep it. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.8	If the teacher wants to enter the village, the pupil should give him a sarong and receive the one he’s wearing in return. He should give him a belt. He should put the upper robes together, overlapping each other edge-to-edge, and then give them to him. He should wash his teacher’s bowl and then give it to him while wet. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.9	If the teacher wants an attendant, the pupil should put on his sarong evenly all around, covering the navel and the knees. He should put on a belt. Putting the upper robes together, overlapping each other edge-to-edge, he should put them on and fasten the toggle. After washing his bowl, he should take it with him and be his teacher’s attendant. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.10	He shouldn’t walk too far behind his teacher or too close to him. He should receive the contents of his bowl. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.11	He shouldn’t interrupt his teacher when he’s speaking. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.12	But if the teacher’s speech is bordering on an offense, he should stop him. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.13	When returning, the pupil should go first to prepare a seat and to set out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, and water for washing the feet. He should go out to meet the teacher to receive his bowl and robe. He should give him a sarong and receive the one he’s wearing in return. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.14	If the robe is moist, he should sun it for a short while, but he shouldn’t leave it in the heat. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.15	He should fold the robe, 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.16	offsetting the edges by seven centimeters, 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.17	so that the fold doesn’t become worn. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.18	He should place the belt in the fold. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.19	If there is almsfood and his teacher wants to eat, the pupil should give him water and then the almsfood. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.20	He should ask his teacher if he wants water to drink. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.21	When the teacher has eaten, the pupil should give him water and receive the bowl, and holding it low, he should wash it carefully without scratching it. He should then dry it and sun it for a short while, but he shouldn’t leave it in the heat. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.22	The pupil should put away the robe and bowl. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.23	When putting away the bowl, he should hold the bowl in one hand, feel under the bed or the bench with the other, and then put it away. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.24	He should not put away the bowl on the bare ground. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.25	When putting away the robe, he should hold the robe in one hand, wipe the bamboo robe-rack or the clothesline with the other, and then put it away by folding the robe over it, making the ends face the wall and the fold face out. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.26	When the teacher has gotten up, the pupil should put away the seat and also the foot-stool, the foot-scraper, and the water for washing the feet. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.27	If the place is dirty, he should sweep it. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.28	“If the teacher wants to bathe, the pupil should prepare the bath. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.29	If he wants a cold bath, he should prepare that; 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.30	if he wants a hot bath, he should prepare that.

pli-tv-kd1:32.3.35	and he shouldn’t block the junior monks from getting a seat. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.36	While in the sauna, he should do services for his teacher. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.37	When leaving the sauna, he should take the sauna stool, cover himself in front and behind, and then leave the sauna. 
pli-tv-kd1:32.3.38	He should also do services for his teacher in the water.

pli-tv-kd1:34.1.0	20. Asking for forgiveness when dismissed 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.1	On a later occasion the pupils did not conduct themselves properly toward their teachers. … 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.2	They told the Buddha. He had the monks gathered and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.3	“A pupil should conduct himself properly toward his teacher. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.4	If he doesn’t, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.5	They still did not conduct themselves properly. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.6	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.7	“You should dismiss one who doesn’t conduct himself properly. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.8	And this is how he should be dismissed. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.9	If the teacher makes it understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech: ʻI dismiss you,’ or, ʻDon’t come back here,’ or, ʻRemove your bowl and robe,’ or, ʻYou shouldn’t attend on me’—
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.10	then the pupil is dismissed. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.11	If he doesn’t make it understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then the pupil isn’t dismissed.” 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.12	Pupils who had been dismissed did not ask for forgiveness. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.13	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.14	“You should ask for forgiveness.” 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.15	They still did not ask for forgiveness. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.16	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.17	“One who has been dismissed should ask for forgiveness. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.18	If he doesn’t, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.19	Teachers who were asked for forgiveness did not forgive. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.20	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.21	“You should forgive.” 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.22	They still did not forgive. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.23	The pupils left, disrobed, and joined the monastics of other religions. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.24	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.25	“When asked for forgiveness, you should forgive. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.26	If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.27	Teachers dismissed pupils who were conducting themselves properly and did not dismiss those who were not. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.28	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.29	“You should not dismiss someone who is conducting himself properly. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.30	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.31	And you should dismiss someone who isn’t conducting himself properly. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.32	If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.33	“If a pupil has five qualities, he should be dismissed. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.34	He doesn’t have much affection for his teacher; he doesn’t have much confidence in his teacher; he doesn’t have a strong sense of conscience in regard to his teacher; he doesn’t have much respect for his teacher; he hasn’t developed his mind much under his teacher. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.36	If a pupil has five qualities, he shouldn’t be dismissed.

pli-tv-kd1:34.1.43	He has much affection for his teacher; he has much confidence in his teacher; he has a strong sense of conscience in regard to his teacher; he has much respect for his teacher; he has developed his mind much under his teacher. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.45	If a pupil has five qualities, the teacher is at fault if he doesn’t dismiss him, but he’s not at fault if he dismisses him. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.46	The pupil doesn’t have much affection for his teacher; he doesn’t have much confidence in his teacher; he doesn’t have a strong sense of conscience in regard to his teacher; he doesn’t have much respect for his teacher; he hasn’t developed his mind much under his teacher. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.48	If a pupil has five qualities, the teacher is at fault if he dismisses him, but he’s not at fault if he doesn’t dismiss him. 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.49	The pupil has much affection for his teacher; he has much confidence in his teacher; he has a strong sense of conscience in regard to his teacher; he has much respect for his teacher; he has developed his mind much under his teacher.” 
pli-tv-kd1:34.1.51	Asking for forgiveness when dismissed is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:35.1.0	21. The ignorant and incompetent 
pli-tv-kd1:35.1.1	Soon afterwards, when they had ten years of seniority, ignorant and incompetent monks gave formal support. 
pli-tv-kd1:35.1.2	As a result there were ignorant teachers with knowledgeable pupils, 
pli-tv-kd1:35.1.3	incompetent teachers with competent pupils, 
pli-tv-kd1:35.1.4	uneducated teachers with learned pupils, 
pli-tv-kd1:35.1.5	stupid teachers with clever pupils. 
pli-tv-kd1:35.1.6	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd1:35.1.7	“How can ignorant and incompetent monks give formal support, just because they have ten years of seniority? 
pli-tv-kd1:35.1.8	There are ignorant teachers with knowledgeable pupils, incompetent teachers with competent pupils, uneducated teachers with learned pupils, stupid teachers with clever pupils.” 
pli-tv-kd1:35.2.1	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:35.2.2	“Is it true, monks, that this is happening?” 
pli-tv-kd1:35.2.5	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd1:35.2.6	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-kd1:35.2.7	and after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd1:35.2.8	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:35.2.9	“An ignorant and incompetent monk should not give formal support. 
pli-tv-kd1:35.2.10	If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd1:35.2.11	I allow a competent and capable monk to give formal support, if he has ten or more years of seniority.” 
pli-tv-kd1:35.2.12	The section on the ignorant and incompetent is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:36.1.0	22. Discussion of the ending of formal support 
pli-tv-kd1:36.1.1	At that time there were preceptors and teachers who went away, disrobed, died, or joined another faction, but their pupils did not know about the ending of support. 
pli-tv-kd1:36.1.2	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd1:36.1.3	“There are these five reasons why the formal support from a preceptor comes to an end: 
pli-tv-kd1:36.1.4	the preceptor goes away; the preceptor disrobes; the preceptor dies; the preceptor joins another faction; or the preceptor gives an order. 
pli-tv-kd1:36.1.6	There are these six reasons why the formal support from a teacher comes to an end: 
pli-tv-kd1:36.1.7	the teacher goes away; the teacher disrobes; the teacher dies; the teacher joins another faction; the teacher gives an order; or one is reunited with one’s preceptor.” 
pli-tv-kd1:36.1.9	The discussion of the ending of formal support is finished.

pli-tv-kd1:37.9.2	He’s not capable of three things in regard to a student: to nurse him or to have someone nurse him when he’s sick; to send him away or to have him sent away when he’s discontent with the spiritual life; to use the Teaching to dispel anxiety. And he doesn’t know the offenses; he doesn’t know how offenses are cleared; and he has less than ten years of seniority. 
pli-tv-kd1:37.10.1	A monk who has another six qualities may give the full ordination, give formal support, and have a novice monk attend on him. 
pli-tv-kd1:37.10.2	He’s capable of three things in regard to a student: to nurse him or to have someone nurse him when he’s sick; to send him away or to have him sent away when he’s discontent with the spiritual life; to use the Teaching to dispel anxiety. And he knows the offenses; he knows how offenses are cleared; and he has ten or more years of seniority. 
pli-tv-kd1:37.11.1	“A monk who has another six qualities shouldn’t give the full ordination, give formal support, or have a novice monk attend on him. 
pli-tv-kd1:37.11.2	He’s not capable of five things in regard to a student: to make him train in good conduct; to train him in the basics of the spiritual life; to train him in the Teaching; to train him in the Monastic Law; or to use the Teaching to make him give up wrong views. And he has less than ten years of seniority. 
pli-tv-kd1:37.12.1	A monk who has another six qualities may give the full ordination, give formal support, and have a novice monk attend on him. 
pli-tv-kd1:37.12.2	He’s capable of five things in regard to a student: to make him train in good conduct; to train him in the basics of the spiritual life; to train him in the Teaching; to train him in the Monastic Law; and to use the Teaching to make him give up wrong views. And he has ten or more years of seniority. 
pli-tv-kd1:37.13.1	“A monk who has another six qualities shouldn’t give the full ordination, give formal support, or have a novice monk attend on him. 
pli-tv-kd1:37.13.2	He doesn’t know the offenses; he doesn’t know the non-offenses; he doesn’t know which offenses are light; he doesn’t know which offenses are heavy; neither Monastic Code has been properly learned by him in detail, and he hasn’t analyzed them well, thoroughly mastered them, or investigated them well, either in terms of the rules or their detailed exposition; he has less than ten years of seniority. 
pli-tv-kd1:37.14.1	A monk who has another six qualities may give the full ordination, give formal support, and have a novice monk attend on him. 
pli-tv-kd1:37.14.2	He knows the offenses; he knows the non-offenses; he knows which offenses are light; he knows which offenses are heavy; he’s properly learned both Monastic Codes in detail, and he’s analyzed them well, thoroughly mastered them, and investigated them well, both in terms of the rules and their detailed exposition; he has ten or more years of seniority.” 
pli-tv-kd1:37.14.4	The section consisting of fourteen groups of six requirements for giving the full ordination is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.1.0	25. Discussion on those who have been monastics of another religion 
pli-tv-kd1:38.1.1	Soon afterwards he who had been a monastic of another religion and who had returned to that religious community after refuting his preceptor 
pli-tv-kd1:38.1.2	came back to the monks and asked for the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.1.3	The monks told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.1.4	“Monks, when someone who has been a monastic of another religion refutes his preceptor after being legitimately corrected by him and then returns to that religion, but then comes back from that religious community once more, he should not be given the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.1.5	Anyone else who has been a monastic of another religion who wants the going forth and the full ordination on this spiritual path should be given four months of probation. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.2.1	And it should be given like this. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.2.2	First he should shave off his hair and beard and put on the ocher robes. He should then put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the monks, squat on his heels, and raise his joined palms. He should then be told to say this: 
pli-tv-kd1:38.2.3	ʻI take refuge in the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:38.2.4	I take refuge in the Teaching, 
pli-tv-kd1:38.2.5	I take refuge in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.2.6	For the second time I take refuge in the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:38.2.7	For the second time I take refuge in the Teaching, 
pli-tv-kd1:38.2.8	For the second time I take refuge in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.2.9	For the third time I take refuge in the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:38.2.10	For the third time I take refuge in the Teaching, 
pli-tv-kd1:38.2.11	For the third time I take refuge in the Sangha.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:38.3.1	Then, after approaching the Sangha, he who had been a monastic of another religion should put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the monks, squat on his heels, and raise his joined palms. He should then say this: 
pli-tv-kd1:38.3.2	ʻVenerables, I have been a monastic of another religion, and I wish for the full ordination on this spiritual path. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.3.3	I ask the Sangha for four months of probation.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:38.3.4	And he should ask a second 
pli-tv-kd1:38.3.5	and a third time. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.3.6	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd1:38.3.7	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.3.8	So-and-so who has been a monastic of another religion wants the full ordination on this spiritual path. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.3.9	He is asking the Sangha for four months of probation. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.3.10	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give so-and-so four months of probation. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.3.11	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.4.1	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.4.2	So-and-so who has been a monastic of another religion wants the full ordination on this spiritual path. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.4.3	He is asking the Sangha for four months of probation. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.4.4	The Sangha gives so-and-so four months of probation. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.4.5	Any monk who approves of giving so-and-so four months of probation should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.4.6	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.4.7	The Sangha has given so-and-so, who has been a monastic of another religion, four months of probation. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.4.8	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:38.5.1	“When someone who has been a monastic of another religion is on probation, 
pli-tv-kd1:38.5.2	this is how he’s unsuccessful: 
pli-tv-kd1:38.5.3	He enters the village too early and returns too late in the day. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.5.5	He regularly associates with prostitutes, widows, young unmarried women, _paṇḍakas_, and nuns. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.6.1	He’s not skilled or diligent in the various things that need to be done for his fellow monastics, and he doesn’t possess the good judgment needed to do and arrange them well. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.6.3	He doesn’t have a keen desire for recitation, for questioning, for the higher morality, for the higher mind, and for the higher wisdom. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.7.1	He is displeased when anyone disparages the teacher, the views, the beliefs, the persuasion, or the opinions of the religious community he’s left; but he’s pleased when anyone disparages the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha; 
pli-tv-kd1:38.7.2	and he’s pleased when anyone praises the teacher, the views, the beliefs, the persuasion, or the opinions of the religious community he’s left; but he is displeased when anyone praises the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.7.3	This is the critical factor in the lack of success of someone who has been a monastic of another religion. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.7.5	When someone who has been a monastic of another religion is unsuccessful in this way, he should not be given the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.8.1	“When someone who has been a monastic of another religion is on probation, this is how he’s successful: 
pli-tv-kd1:38.8.2	He doesn’t enter the village too early or return too late in the day. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.8.4	He doesn’t regularly associate with prostitutes, widows, young unmarried women, _paṇḍakas_, or nuns. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.9.1	He’s skilled and diligent in the various things that need to be done for his fellow monastics, and he possesses the good judgment needed to do and arrange them well. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.9.3	He has a keen desire for recitation, for questioning, for the higher morality, for the higher mind, and for the higher wisdom. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.10.1	He’s pleased when anyone disparages the teacher, the views, the beliefs, the persuasion, or the opinions of the religious community he’s left; but he is displeased when anyone disparages the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha; 
pli-tv-kd1:38.10.2	and he is displeased when anyone praises the teacher, the views, the beliefs, the persuasion, or the opinions of the religious community he’s left; but he’s pleased when anyone praises the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.10.3	This is the critical factor in the success of someone who has been a monastic of another religion. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.10.5	When someone who has been a monastic of another religion is successful in this way, he should be given the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.11.1	“If someone who has been a monastic of another religion arrives naked, a robe should be sought through his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.11.2	If he arrives with hair, he should get permission from the Sangha to shave. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.11.3	But any dreadlocked, fire-worshiping ascetic who comes to be ordained should be given the full ordination without probation. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.11.4	Why is that? 
pli-tv-kd1:38.11.5	Because they believe in the teaching of action, the teaching of doing. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.11.6	And if someone who has been a monastic of another religion arrives who is a Sakyan by birth, he should be given the full ordination without probation. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.11.7	I give this special privilege to my relatives.” 
pli-tv-kd1:38.11.8	The discussion on those who have been monastics of another religion is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:38.11.9	The seventh section for recitation is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.1.0	26. The five diseases 
pli-tv-kd1:39.1.1	At that time in Magadha, there were five common diseases: 
pli-tv-kd1:39.1.2	leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, and epilepsy. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.1.3	When people were afflicted with any of these five diseases, they went to Jīvaka Komārabhacca and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:39.1.4	“Doctor, please treat me.” 
pli-tv-kd1:39.1.5	He replied, “I’m very busy. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.1.6	I look after King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his harem. I also look after the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.1.7	I’m not able to treat you.” 
pli-tv-kd1:39.1.8	“I will give you everything I own, 
pli-tv-kd1:39.1.9	and I’ll be your slave. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.1.10	Please treat me, doctor.” 
pli-tv-kd1:39.2.1	Jīvaka repeated what he had already said. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.2.3	And those people thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:39.2.4	“These Sakyan monastics have pleasant habits and a happy life. After eating nice food, they sleep in beds sheltered from the wind. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.2.5	Perhaps I should go forth with the Sakyan monastics. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.2.6	If I do, the monks will nurse me and Jīvaka Komārabhacca will treat me.” 
pli-tv-kd1:39.2.7	They then went to the monks and asked for the going forth. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.2.8	The monks gave them the going forth and the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.2.9	And the monks nursed them, and Jīvaka treated them. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.3.1	At one time the monks were nursing many sick monks. As a result, they kept on asking, 
pli-tv-kd1:39.3.2	“Please give a meal for the sick and for those nursing the sick. Please give medicines for the sick.” 
pli-tv-kd1:39.3.3	And because Jīvaka was treating many sick monks, he was unable to fulfill his duty to the king. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.4.1	Then a certain man who was afflicted with one of the five diseases went to Jīvaka and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:39.4.2	“Doctor, please treat me.” 
pli-tv-kd1:39.4.3	He replied, “I’m very busy. I look after King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his harem. I also look after the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.4.4	I’m not able to treat you.” 
pli-tv-kd1:39.4.5	“I will give you everything I own, and I’ll be your slave. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.4.6	Please treat me, doctor.” 
pli-tv-kd1:39.4.7	Jīvaka repeated what he had already said. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.5.1	And that man thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:39.5.2	“These Sakyan monastics have pleasant habits and a happy life. After eating nice food, they sleep in beds sheltered from the wind. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.5.3	Why donʼt I go forth with the Sakyan monastics? 
pli-tv-kd1:39.5.4	If I do, the monks will nurse me and Jīvaka Komārabhacca will treat me. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.5.5	And when I’m healthy, I’ll disrobe.” 
pli-tv-kd1:39.5.6	He then went to the monks and asked for the going forth. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.5.7	The monks gave him the going forth and the full ordination, 
pli-tv-kd1:39.5.8	after which they nursed him and Jīvaka treated him. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.5.9	And when he was healthy again, he disrobed. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.5.10	Jīvaka saw that man after he had disrobed, and he asked him, 
pli-tv-kd1:39.5.11	“Didn’t you go forth with the monks?” 
pli-tv-kd1:39.5.12	“Yes, doctor.” 
pli-tv-kd1:39.5.13	“And why did you do it?” 
pli-tv-kd1:39.5.14	When that man had told him what had happened, 
pli-tv-kd1:39.6.1	Jīvaka complained and criticized the monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:39.6.2	“How can the venerables allow those with the five diseases to go forth?” 
pli-tv-kd1:39.6.3	He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd1:39.6.4	and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:39.6.5	“Venerable Sir, it would be good if the venerables didn’t allow those with the five diseases to go forth.” 
pli-tv-kd1:39.7.1	The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.7.2	Jīvaka then got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.7.3	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:39.7.4	“You should not give the going forth to anyone afflicted with any of the five diseases. 
pli-tv-kd1:39.7.5	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:40.1.0	27. Those employed by the king 
pli-tv-kd1:40.1.1	On one occasion anger erupted in the outlying districts governed by King Bimbisāra. 
pli-tv-kd1:40.1.2	The King told his generals, 
pli-tv-kd1:40.1.3	“Go and sort out those districts.” 
pli-tv-kd1:40.1.4	“Yes, sir.” 
pli-tv-kd1:40.2.1	But the most famous soldiers thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:40.2.2	“If we go and enjoy the battle, we’ll do what’s bad and make much demerit. 
pli-tv-kd1:40.2.3	How can we avoid what’s bad and do what’s good instead?” 
pli-tv-kd1:40.2.4	And it occurred to them, 
pli-tv-kd1:40.2.5	“These Sakyan monastics have integrity. They’re celibate and their conduct is good, and they’re truthful, moral, and have a good character. 
pli-tv-kd1:40.2.6	If we go forth with them, we’ll avoid what’s bad and do what’s good.” 
pli-tv-kd1:40.2.7	Those soldiers then went to the monks and asked for the going forth. 
pli-tv-kd1:40.2.8	And the monks gave them the going forth and the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:40.3.1	Soon afterwards the generals asked among the King’s employees, 
pli-tv-kd1:40.3.2	“Why are the soldiers so-and-so and so-and-so missing?” 
pli-tv-kd1:40.3.3	“They’ve gone forth with the monks.” 
pli-tv-kd1:40.3.4	The generals complained and criticized the monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:40.3.5	“How can the Sakyan monastics give the going forth to people who are employed by the King?” 
pli-tv-kd1:40.3.6	And they told the King. 
pli-tv-kd1:40.3.7	The King then asked the judge, 
pli-tv-kd1:40.3.8	“What’s the penalty for one who gives the going forth to someone employed by the King?” 
pli-tv-kd1:40.3.9	“The preceptor should have his head cut off, the one who does the formal proclamation should have his tongue cut out, and the participating group should have half their ribs broken.” 
pli-tv-kd1:40.4.1	The King went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd1:40.4.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:40.4.3	“Venerable Sir, there are kings with little faith and confidence. 
pli-tv-kd1:40.4.4	They would give the monks a hard time even over small matters. 
pli-tv-kd1:40.4.5	It would be good if the venerables didn’t give the going forth to those employed by a king.” 
pli-tv-kd1:40.4.6	The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching. 
pli-tv-kd1:40.4.7	The King then got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd1:40.4.8	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:40.4.9	“You should not give the going forth to anyone employed by a king. 
pli-tv-kd1:40.4.10	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:41.1.0	28. The criminal Aṅgulimāla 
pli-tv-kd1:41.1.1	At that time the criminal Aṅgulimāla had gone forth with the monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:41.1.2	When people saw him, they became alarmed and fearful. They ran away, took a different path, turned away, and closed their doors. 
pli-tv-kd1:41.1.3	People complained and criticized the monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:41.1.4	“How can the Sakyan monastics give the going forth to a notorious criminal?” 
pli-tv-kd1:41.1.5	The monks heard the complaints of those people. 
pli-tv-kd1:41.1.6	They then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:41.1.7	“You should not give the going forth to a notorious criminal. 
pli-tv-kd1:41.1.8	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:42.1.0	29. The escaped criminal 
pli-tv-kd1:42.1.1	At that time King Bimbisāra had given the following instruction: 
pli-tv-kd1:42.1.2	“Nothing should be done to anyone who has gone forth with the Sakyan monastics. 
pli-tv-kd1:42.1.3	The Teaching is well-proclaimed, so allow them to practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” 
pli-tv-kd1:42.1.4	Soon afterwards a man who had committed theft was put in prison. 
pli-tv-kd1:42.1.5	But he escaped from prison, ran away, and went forth with the monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:42.2.1	People saw him and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:42.2.2	“There’s that criminal who has escaped from prison. 
pli-tv-kd1:42.2.3	Let’s take him back.” 
pli-tv-kd1:42.2.4	But some said, 
pli-tv-kd1:42.2.5	“No! 
pli-tv-kd1:42.2.6	The King has given instruction 
pli-tv-kd1:42.2.7	that nothing should be done to anyone gone forth with the Sakyan monastics.” 
pli-tv-kd1:42.2.9	People complained and criticized the monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:42.2.10	“These Sakyan monastics are untouchable, since nothing can be done to them. 
pli-tv-kd1:42.2.11	So how can the Sakyan monastics give the going forth to an escaped criminal?” 
pli-tv-kd1:42.2.12	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:42.2.13	“You should not give the going forth to an escaped criminal. 
pli-tv-kd1:42.2.14	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:43.1.0	30. The wanted criminal 
pli-tv-kd1:43.1.1	On one occasion a certain man stole something, ran away, and then went forth with the monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:43.1.2	But he was wanted by the King’s court: 
pli-tv-kd1:43.1.3	“He should be executed wherever he’s seen.” 
pli-tv-kd1:43.1.4	Soon afterwards people saw him and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:43.1.5	“There’s that wanted criminal. 
pli-tv-kd1:43.1.6	Let’s execute him.” 
pli-tv-kd1:43.1.7	But some said, 
pli-tv-kd1:43.1.8	“No! 
pli-tv-kd1:43.1.9	King Bimbisāra has said, ʻNothing should be done to anyone who has gone forth with the Sakyan monastics. The Teaching is well-proclaimed, so allow them to practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.’” 
pli-tv-kd1:43.1.10	People complained and criticized the monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:43.1.11	“These Sakyan monastics are untouchable, since nothing can be done to them. 
pli-tv-kd1:43.1.12	So how can the Sakyan monastics give the going forth to a wanted criminal?” 
pli-tv-kd1:43.1.13	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:43.1.14	“You should not give the going forth to a wanted criminal. 
pli-tv-kd1:43.1.15	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:44.1.0	31. The one who had been whipped 
pli-tv-kd1:44.1.1	At one time a certain man who had been whipped as a penalty went forth with the monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:44.1.2	People complained and criticized the monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:44.1.3	“How can the Sakyan monastics give the going forth to one who has been whipped as a penalty?” 
pli-tv-kd1:44.1.4	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:44.1.5	“You should not give the going forth to one who has been whipped as a penalty. 
pli-tv-kd1:44.1.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:45.1.0	32. The one who had been branded 
pli-tv-kd1:45.1.1	At one time a certain man who had been branded as a penalty went forth with the monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:45.1.2	People complained and criticized the monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:45.1.3	“How can the Sakyan monastics give the going forth to one who has been branded as a penalty?” 
pli-tv-kd1:45.1.4	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:45.1.5	“You should not give the going forth to one who has been branded as a penalty. 
pli-tv-kd1:45.1.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:46.1.0	33. The one in debt 
pli-tv-kd1:46.1.1	On one occasion a certain indebted man ran away and went forth with the monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:46.1.2	Soon afterwards the creditors saw him and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:46.1.3	“There’s that man who owes us. 
pli-tv-kd1:46.1.4	Let’s take him with us.” 
pli-tv-kd1:46.1.5	But some said, 
pli-tv-kd1:46.1.6	“No! 
pli-tv-kd1:46.1.7	King Bimbisāra has said, 
pli-tv-kd1:46.1.8	ʻNothing should be done to anyone who has gone forth with the Sakyan monastics. 
pli-tv-kd1:46.1.9	The Teaching is well-proclaimed, so allow them to practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.’” 
pli-tv-kd1:46.1.10	People complained and criticized the monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:46.1.11	“These Sakyan monastics are untouchable, 
pli-tv-kd1:46.1.12	since nothing can be done to them. 
pli-tv-kd1:46.1.13	So how can the Sakyan monastics give the going forth to an indebted person?” 
pli-tv-kd1:46.1.14	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:46.1.15	“You should not give the going forth to one who is in debt. 
pli-tv-kd1:46.1.16	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:47.1.0	34. The slave 
pli-tv-kd1:47.1.1	On one occasion a certain slave ran away and went forth with the monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:47.1.2	Soon afterwards the owners saw him and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:47.1.3	“There’s that slave of ours. 
pli-tv-kd1:47.1.4	Let’s take him back.” 
pli-tv-kd1:47.1.5	But some said, 
pli-tv-kd1:47.1.6	“No! King Bimbisāra has said, ʻNothing should be done to anyone who has gone forth with the Sakyan monastics. The Teaching is well-proclaimed, so allow them to practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.’” 
pli-tv-kd1:47.1.7	People complained and criticized the monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:47.1.8	“These Sakyan monastics are untouchable, since nothing can be done to them. 
pli-tv-kd1:47.1.9	So how can the Sakyan monastics give the going forth to a slave?” 
pli-tv-kd1:47.1.10	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:47.1.11	“You should not give the going forth to a slave. 
pli-tv-kd1:47.1.12	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:48.1.0	35. The shaven-headed smith 
pli-tv-kd1:48.1.1	At that time a certain smith, after quarreling with his parents, went to the monastery and went forth with the monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:48.1.2	Then, while looking for their son, the parents went to that monastery and asked the monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:48.1.3	“Venerables, have you by any chance seen such-and-such a boy?” 
pli-tv-kd1:48.1.4	And because they had not seen him, 
pli-tv-kd1:48.1.5	they said, 
pli-tv-kd1:48.1.6	“No.” 
pli-tv-kd1:48.2.1	Soon afterwards those parents saw that their son had gone forth as a monk. They then complained and criticized the monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:48.2.2	“These Sakyan monastics are shameless and immoral liars. 
pli-tv-kd1:48.2.3	They deny knowing what they know and having seen what they’ve seen. 
pli-tv-kd1:48.2.4	Our boy has gone forth as a monk.” 
pli-tv-kd1:48.2.5	The monks heard the complaints of those parents. 
pli-tv-kd1:48.2.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:48.2.7	“You should get permission from the Sangha to shave someone’s head.” 
pli-tv-kd1:49.1.0	36. The boy Upāli 
pli-tv-kd1:49.1.1	At that time in Rājagaha, there was a group of seventeen boys who were friends 
pli-tv-kd1:49.1.2	and had the boy Upāli as their leader. 
pli-tv-kd1:49.1.3	On one occasion Upāli’s parents thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:49.1.4	“How can we ensure that Upāli is able to live happily without exhausting himself after we’ve passed away? 
pli-tv-kd1:49.1.6	He could become a scribe, 
pli-tv-kd1:49.1.8	but then his fingers will hurt. 
pli-tv-kd1:49.1.9	Or he could become an accountant, 
pli-tv-kd1:49.2.1	but then his chest will hurt. 
pli-tv-kd1:49.2.2	Or he could become a banker, 
pli-tv-kd1:49.2.4	but then his eyes will hurt. 
pli-tv-kd1:49.2.5	These Sakyan monastics, however, have pleasant habits and a happy life. After eating nice food, they sleep in beds sheltered from the wind. 
pli-tv-kd1:49.2.6	If Upāli goes forth with them, he’ll be able to live happily without exhausting himself after we’ve passed away.” 
pli-tv-kd1:49.3.1	Upāli heard this conversation between his parents. 
pli-tv-kd1:49.3.2	He then went to the other boys and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:49.3.3	“Come, let’s go forth with the Sakyan monastics.” 
pli-tv-kd1:49.3.4	“If you go forth, so will we.” 
pli-tv-kd1:49.3.5	Those boys went to their individual parents and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:49.3.6	“Allow me to go forth from home to homelessness.” 
pli-tv-kd1:49.3.7	Because the parents knew 
pli-tv-kd1:49.3.8	that all the boys had the same desire and good intentions, 
pli-tv-kd1:49.3.9	they gave their approval. 
pli-tv-kd1:49.3.10	The boys then went to the monks and asked them for the going forth, 
pli-tv-kd1:49.3.11	and the monks gave them both the going forth and the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:49.4.1	Soon afterwards they got up early in the morning and cried, 
pli-tv-kd1:49.4.2	“Give us rice porridge, give a meal, give fresh food.” 
pli-tv-kd1:49.4.3	The monks said, 
pli-tv-kd1:49.4.4	“Wait until the night is over. 
pli-tv-kd1:49.4.5	If any of those things becomes available then, you’ll be able have it. 
pli-tv-kd1:49.4.6	But if not, you’ll only be able to eat after walking for alms.” 
pli-tv-kd1:49.4.7	But they carried on in the same way. 
pli-tv-kd1:49.4.8	And they defecated and urinated on the furniture. 
pli-tv-kd1:49.5.1	After rising early in the morning, the Buddha heard the sound of those boys. 
pli-tv-kd1:49.5.2	He asked Venerable Ānanda 
pli-tv-kd1:49.5.3	what it was, 
pli-tv-kd1:49.5.4	and he told him. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:49.5.5	“Is it true, monks, that monks give the full ordination to people they know are less than twenty years old?” 
pli-tv-kd1:49.5.6	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd1:49.5.7	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-kd1:49.5.8	“How can those foolish men give the full ordination to people they know are less than twenty years old? 
pli-tv-kd1:49.6.1	A person who’s less than twenty years old is unable to endure cold and heat; hunger and thirst; horseflies, mosquitoes, wind, and the burning sun; creeping animals and insects; and rude and unwelcome speech. And he’s unable to bear up with bodily feelings that are painful, severe, sharp, and destructive of life. 
pli-tv-kd1:49.6.2	But a person who’s twenty years old is able to endure these things. 
pli-tv-kd1:49.6.3	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd1:49.6.4	and after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd1:49.6.5	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:49.6.6	“You should not give the full ordination to a person you know is less than twenty years old. 
pli-tv-kd1:49.6.7	If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule.” 
pli-tv-kd1:50.1.0	37. The deadly and contagious disease 
pli-tv-kd1:50.1.1	At that time most of the members of a particular family had died from a deadly and contagious disease. 
pli-tv-kd1:50.1.2	Only the father and the son were left. 
pli-tv-kd1:50.1.3	After going forth as monks, they walked together for almsfood. 
pli-tv-kd1:50.1.4	Then, when the boy had handed over his almsfood to his father, he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:50.1.5	“Give to me too, daddy, 
pli-tv-kd1:50.1.6	give to me too!” 
pli-tv-kd1:50.1.7	People complained and criticized the monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:50.1.8	“These Sakyan monastics are not celibate. 
pli-tv-kd1:50.1.9	This boy was born to a nun!” 
pli-tv-kd1:50.1.10	The monks heard the complaints of those people 
pli-tv-kd1:50.1.11	and they told the Buddha. He said, 
pli-tv-kd1:50.1.12	“You should not give the going forth to a boy less than fifteen years old. 
pli-tv-kd1:50.1.13	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:51.1.1	At that time there was a family with faith and confidence that was supporting Venerable Ānanda. Then most of its members died from a deadly and contagious disease, and only two boys were left. 
pli-tv-kd1:51.1.2	When they saw the monks, they ran up to them, as they had done before. 
pli-tv-kd1:51.1.3	When the monks dismissed them, 
pli-tv-kd1:51.1.4	they cried. 
pli-tv-kd1:51.1.5	Ānanda thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:51.1.6	“The Buddha has laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd1:51.1.7	that a boy less than fifteen years old shouldn’t be given the going forth, 
pli-tv-kd1:51.1.8	and these boys are less than fifteen. 
pli-tv-kd1:51.1.9	How can I ensure that these boys are not lost?” 
pli-tv-kd1:51.1.10	And he told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd1:51.1.11	“Ānanda, are those boys able to scare away crows?” 
pli-tv-kd1:51.1.12	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd1:51.1.13	The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:51.1.14	“I allow you to give the going forth to a boy less than fifteen years old, if he’s able to scare away crows.” 
pli-tv-kd1:52.1.0	38. Kaṇṭaka 
pli-tv-kd1:52.1.1	At one time Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had two novice monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:52.1.2	Kaṇṭaka and Mahaka. 
pli-tv-kd1:52.1.3	They had sex with each other. 
pli-tv-kd1:52.1.4	The monks complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd1:52.1.5	“How can novice monks misbehave like this?” 
pli-tv-kd1:52.1.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:52.1.7	“A single monk should not have two novice monks attend on him. 
pli-tv-kd1:52.1.8	If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:53.1.0	39. The obscure 
pli-tv-kd1:53.1.1	At that time the Buddha was staying right there at Rājagaha for the rainy season, for the cold season, and for the hot season. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.1.2	And people complained, 
pli-tv-kd1:53.1.3	“The districts are left dark and obscure by the Sakyan monastics. They don’t brighten them up.” 
pli-tv-kd1:53.1.4	The monks heard the complaints of those people 
pli-tv-kd1:53.1.5	and they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.2.1	He said to Venerable Ānanda, 
pli-tv-kd1:53.2.2	“Take a key, Ānanda, and go around the precincts and inform the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:53.2.3	ʻThe Buddha wishes to go wandering in the Southern Hills. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.2.4	Anyone is welcome to join him.’” 
pli-tv-kd1:53.2.5	Saying, “Yes, Sir,” he did just that. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.3.1	The monks said, 
pli-tv-kd1:53.3.2	“Ānanda, the Buddha has laid down a rule that one must live with formal support for ten years and that one who has ten years seniority can give such support. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.3.3	If we were to go, we would have to obtain support for a short time, and when we returned, we would have to obtain support once again. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.3.4	So, if our preceptors and teachers go, we’ll go too, 
pli-tv-kd1:53.3.5	but if they don’t, neither will we. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.3.6	In this way we will not be burdened.” 
pli-tv-kd1:53.4.1	As a result the Buddha went wandering in the Southern Hills with a small group of monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.4.2.0	40. Discussion of release from formal support 
pli-tv-kd1:53.4.2.1	After staying in the southern hills for as long as he liked, the Buddha returned to Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.4.3	He then asked Ānanda, 
pli-tv-kd1:53.4.4	“Why did only a small group of monks come wandering with me in the southern hills?” 
pli-tv-kd1:53.4.5	Ānanda told him what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.4.6	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:53.4.7	“A competent and capable monk should live with formal support for five years, but one who is incompetent should live with such support for life. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.5.1	“A monk who has five qualities shouldn’t live without formal support. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.5.2	He doesn’t have the virtue, stillness, wisdom, freedom, or knowledge and vision of freedom of one fully trained. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.5.4	A monk who has five qualities may live without formal support. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.5.5	He has the virtue, stillness, 
pli-tv-kd1:53.5.6	wisdom, 
pli-tv-kd1:53.5.7	freedom, 
pli-tv-kd1:53.5.8	and knowledge and vision of freedom of one fully trained. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.6.1	“A monk who has another five qualities shouldn’t live without formal support. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.6.2	He has no faith, conscience, or moral prudence, and is lazy and absentminded. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.6.4	A monk who has another five qualities may live without formal support. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.6.5	He has faith, conscience, moral prudence, energy, and mindfulness. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.7.1	“A monk who has another five qualities shouldn’t live without formal support. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.7.2	He has failed in the higher morality; he has failed in conduct; he has failed in view; he’s ignorant; he’s foolish. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.7.4	A monk who has another five qualities may live without formal support. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.7.5	He hasn’t failed in the higher morality; he hasn’t failed in conduct; he hasn’t failed in view; he’s learned; he’s wise. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.8.1	“A monk who has another five qualities shouldn’t live without formal support.

pli-tv-kd1:53.8.4	A monk who has another five qualities may live without formal support. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.8.5	He knows the offenses; he knows the non-offenses; he knows which offenses are light; he knows which offenses are heavy; he’s properly learned both Monastic Codes in detail, and he’s analyzed them well, thoroughly mastered them, and investigated them well, both in terms of the rules and their detailed exposition. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.9.1	“A monk who has another five qualities shouldn’t live without formal support. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.9.2	He doesn’t know the offenses; he doesn’t know the non-offenses; he doesn’t know which offenses are light; he doesn’t know which offenses are heavy; he has less than five years of seniority. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.9.4	A monk who has another five qualities may live without formal support. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.9.5	He knows the offenses; he knows the non-offenses; he knows which offenses are light; he knows which offenses are heavy; he has five or more years of seniority.” 
pli-tv-kd1:53.9.7	The section consisting of ten groups of five is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.10.1	“A monk who has six qualities shouldn’t live without formal support. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.10.2	He doesn’t have the virtue, stillness, wisdom, freedom, or knowledge and vision of freedom of one fully trained, and he has less than five years of seniority. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.10.4	A monk who has six qualities may live without formal support. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.10.5	He has the virtue, stillness, wisdom, freedom, and knowledge and vision of freedom of one fully trained, and he has five or more years of seniority.

pli-tv-kd1:53.11.5	He has faith, conscience, moral prudence, energy, mindfulness, and five or more years of seniority. 
pli-tv-kd1:53.12.1	“A monk who has another six qualities shouldn’t live without formal support.

pli-tv-kd1:53.13.7	The eighth section for recitation on untouchables is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:54.1.0	41. Rāhula 
pli-tv-kd1:54.1.1	After staying at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward Kapilavatthu in the Sakyan country. 
pli-tv-kd1:54.1.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd1:54.1.3	he stayed in the Banyan Tree Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd1:54.1.4	In morning the Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to Suddhodana the Sakyan’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-kd1:54.1.5	The queen, the mother of Rāhula, said to the boy, 
pli-tv-kd1:54.1.6	“Rāhula, this is your father. 
pli-tv-kd1:54.1.7	Go and ask for your inheritance.” 
pli-tv-kd1:54.2.1	Rāhula went to the Buddha, stood in front of him, and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:54.2.2	“Ascetic, your shadow is pleasant.” 
pli-tv-kd1:54.2.3	The Buddha got up from his seat and left, 
pli-tv-kd1:54.2.4	but Rāhula followed behind him, saying 
pli-tv-kd1:54.2.5	“Give me my inheritance, Ascetic, 
pli-tv-kd1:54.2.6	give me my inheritance.” 
pli-tv-kd1:54.2.7	The Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta, 
pli-tv-kd1:54.2.8	“Well then, Sāriputta, give Rāhula the going forth.” 
pli-tv-kd1:54.2.9	“But how, Sir?” 
pli-tv-kd1:54.3.1	The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:54.3.2	“The going forth as a novice monk should be given through the taking of the three refuges. 
pli-tv-kd1:54.3.3	And it should be done like this. 
pli-tv-kd1:54.3.4	First the candidate should shave off his hair and beard and put on ocher robes. He should then put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the monks, squat on his heels, and raise his joined palms. He should then be told to say this: 
pli-tv-kd1:54.3.5	ʻI take refuge in the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:54.3.6	I take refuge in the Teaching, 
pli-tv-kd1:54.3.7	I take refuge in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd1:54.3.8	For the second time I take refuge in the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:54.3.9	For the second time I take refuge in the Teaching, 
pli-tv-kd1:54.3.10	For the second time I take refuge in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd1:54.3.11	For the third time I take refuge in the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd1:54.3.12	For the third time I take refuge in the Teaching, 
pli-tv-kd1:54.3.13	For the third time I take refuge in the Sangha.’” 
pli-tv-kd1:54.4.1	And Sāriputta gave Rāhula the going forth. 
pli-tv-kd1:54.4.2	Soon afterwards Suddhodana went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd1:54.4.3	and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:54.4.4	“Sir, may I ask for a favor?” 
pli-tv-kd1:54.4.5	“Buddhas don’t grant favors, Gotama.” 
pli-tv-kd1:54.4.6	“It’s allowable and blameless.” 
pli-tv-kd1:54.4.7	“Well then, please say what it is.” 
pli-tv-kd1:54.5.1	“When the Buddha went forth, it was very painful for me, and the same when Nanda went forth. With Rāhula, it’s even worse. 
pli-tv-kd1:54.5.2	Affection for a child cuts through the outer and inner skin; it cuts the flesh, the sinews, and the bones, and it reaches all the way to the bone-marrow. 
pli-tv-kd1:54.5.3	It would be good if the venerables didn’t give the going forth to a child without the parents’ permission.” 
pli-tv-kd1:54.6.1	The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, 
pli-tv-kd1:54.6.2	after which Suddhodana got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd1:54.6.3	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:54.6.4	“You should not give the going forth to a child without the parents’ permission. 
pli-tv-kd1:54.6.5	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:55.1.1	After staying at Kapilavatthu for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd1:55.1.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd1:55.1.3	he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd1:55.1.4	At this time a family that was supporting Sāriputta sent him a boy with this message: 
pli-tv-kd1:55.1.5	“Please give the going forth to this boy.” 
pli-tv-kd1:55.1.6	Sāriputta thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:55.1.7	“The Buddha has laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd1:55.1.8	that a monk shouldn’t have two novices attend on him. 
pli-tv-kd1:55.1.9	I already have the novice Rāhula. 
pli-tv-kd1:55.1.10	So what should I do now?” 
pli-tv-kd1:55.1.11	He told the Buddha of what had happened. The Buddha said, 
pli-tv-kd1:55.1.12	“I allow a competent and capable monk to have two novice monks attend on him, or however many he’s able to teach and instruct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:56.1.0	42. Discussion of the training rules 
pli-tv-kd1:56.1.1	Soon afterwards the novices thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:56.1.2	“How many training rules do we have that we should train in?” 
pli-tv-kd1:56.1.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:56.1.4	“There are ten training rules for the novice monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:56.1.5	Abstention from killing living beings; 
pli-tv-kd1:56.1.6	Abstention from stealing; 
pli-tv-kd1:56.1.7	Abstention from sexual activity; 
pli-tv-kd1:56.1.8	Abstention from lying; 
pli-tv-kd1:56.1.9	Abstention from alcoholic drinks that cause heedlessness; 
pli-tv-kd1:56.1.10	Abstention from eating at the wrong time; 
pli-tv-kd1:56.1.11	Abstention from dancing, singing, music, and seeing shows; 
pli-tv-kd1:56.1.12	Abstention from wearing garlands and using scents and cosmetics; 
pli-tv-kd1:56.1.13	Abstention from high and luxurious resting places; 
pli-tv-kd1:56.1.14	Abstention from receiving gold, silver, or money.” 
pli-tv-kd1:57.1.0	43. Penalties 
pli-tv-kd1:57.1.1	Soon the novice monks were being disrespectful, undeferential, and rude toward the monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:57.1.2	The monks complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd1:57.1.3	“How can the novices behave like this?” 
pli-tv-kd1:57.1.4	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:57.1.5	“I allow you to penalize a novice monk who has five qualities: 
pli-tv-kd1:57.1.6	He’s trying to stop monks from acquiring material gains; 
pli-tv-kd1:57.1.7	He’s trying to harm monks; 
pli-tv-kd1:57.1.8	He’s trying to get monks to lose their place of residence; 
pli-tv-kd1:57.1.9	He abuses and reviles monks; 
pli-tv-kd1:57.1.10	He causes division between monks.” 
pli-tv-kd1:57.2.1	The monks didn’t know 
pli-tv-kd1:57.2.2	how they should be penalized. 
pli-tv-kd1:57.2.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:57.2.4	“I allow you to place restrictions on the novice monks.” 
pli-tv-kd1:57.2.5	The monks then restricted the novices from the whole monastery. 
pli-tv-kd1:57.2.6	Because they were unable to enter the monastery, the novices left, disrobed, and joined the monastics of other religions. 
pli-tv-kd1:57.2.7	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:57.2.8	“You should not make a whole monastery off limits. 
pli-tv-kd1:57.2.9	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd1:57.2.10	I allow you to make the place you’re staying in and its access areas off limits.” 
pli-tv-kd1:57.3.1	The monks placed restrictions on the novices’ food. 
pli-tv-kd1:57.3.2	People making rice porridge and meals for the Sangha said to the novices, 
pli-tv-kd1:57.3.3	“Come, Venerables, and drink rice porridge. 
pli-tv-kd1:57.3.4	Come and eat a meal.” 
pli-tv-kd1:57.3.5	The novices replied, 
pli-tv-kd1:57.3.6	“We can’t. 
pli-tv-kd1:57.3.7	The monks have placed a restriction on us.” 
pli-tv-kd1:57.3.8	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd1:57.3.9	“How can the venerables restrict the novices’ food?” 
pli-tv-kd1:57.3.10	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:57.3.11	“You should not place restrictions on food. 
pli-tv-kd1:57.3.12	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:57.3.13	The account of penalties is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:58.1.0	44. Prohibiting without asking permission 
pli-tv-kd1:58.1.1	On one occasion the monks from the group of six placed restrictions on novices without asking permission of their preceptors. 
pli-tv-kd1:58.1.2	The preceptors 
pli-tv-kd1:58.1.3	could not find their novices. 
pli-tv-kd1:58.1.4	When other monks 
pli-tv-kd1:58.1.5	told them what had happened, 
pli-tv-kd1:58.1.6	the preceptors complained and criticized those monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:58.1.7	“How can the monks from the group of six place restrictions on our novices without asking us for permission?” 
pli-tv-kd1:58.1.8	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:58.1.9	“You should not place a restriction without asking permission of the preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:58.1.10	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:59.1.0	45. Luring away 
pli-tv-kd1:59.1.1	At one time the monks from the group of six lured away the novices from the senior monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:59.1.2	The senior monks had to get their own tooth cleaners and water for rinsing the mouth, and as a result they became tired. 
pli-tv-kd1:59.1.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:59.1.4	“You should not lure away another’s followers. 
pli-tv-kd1:59.1.5	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:60.1.0	46. The novice Kaṇṭaka 
pli-tv-kd1:60.1.1	At that time Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had a novice called Kaṇṭaka who raped the nun Kaṇṭaki. 
pli-tv-kd1:60.1.2	The monks complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd1:60.1.3	“How can a novice monk misbehave in such a way?” 
pli-tv-kd1:60.1.4	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:60.1.5	“I allow you to expel a novice monk who has ten qualities: 
pli-tv-kd1:60.1.6	He kills living beings; 
pli-tv-kd1:60.1.7	He steals; 
pli-tv-kd1:60.1.8	He’s not celibate; 
pli-tv-kd1:60.1.9	He lies; 
pli-tv-kd1:60.1.10	He drinks alcoholic drinks; 
pli-tv-kd1:60.1.11	He disparages the Buddha; 
pli-tv-kd1:60.1.12	He disparages the Teaching; 
pli-tv-kd1:60.1.13	He disparages the Sangha; 
pli-tv-kd1:60.1.14	He has wrong view; 
pli-tv-kd1:60.1.15	He has raped a nun.” 
pli-tv-kd1:61.1.0	47. _Paṇḍakas_ 
pli-tv-kd1:61.1.1	At one time a certain _paṇḍaka_ had gone forth as a monk. 
pli-tv-kd1:61.1.2	He went to the young monks and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:61.1.3	“Venerables, come and have sex with me.” 
pli-tv-kd1:61.1.4	The monks dismissed him, 
pli-tv-kd1:61.1.5	“Go away, _paṇḍaka_. Who wants you?” 
pli-tv-kd1:61.1.6	He went to the big and fat novices, 
pli-tv-kd1:61.1.7	said the same thing, 
pli-tv-kd1:61.1.9	and got the same response. 
pli-tv-kd1:61.1.10	He then went to the elephant keepers and horse keepers, 
pli-tv-kd1:61.1.11	and once again he said the same thing. 
pli-tv-kd1:61.1.12	And they had sex with him. 
pli-tv-kd1:61.1.13	They complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd1:61.1.14	“These Sakyan monastics are _paṇḍakas_. 
pli-tv-kd1:61.1.15	And those who are not have sex with them. 
pli-tv-kd1:61.1.16	None of them is celibate.” 
pli-tv-kd1:61.1.17	The monks heard their complaints. 
pli-tv-kd1:61.1.18	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:61.1.19	“A _paṇḍaka_ should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled.” 
pli-tv-kd1:62.1.0	48. The one living in the community by theft 
pli-tv-kd1:62.1.1	At that time there was a certain man from a good family who had been brought up in comfort, but whose entire family had died. 
pli-tv-kd1:62.1.2	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:62.1.3	“I’ve been brought up in comfort and I’m not able to make any money. 
pli-tv-kd1:62.1.4	How can I live happily without exhausting myself?” 
pli-tv-kd1:62.1.5	And it occurred to him, 
pli-tv-kd1:62.1.6	“These Sakyan monastics have pleasant habits and a happy life. After eating nice food, they sleep in beds sheltered from the wind. 
pli-tv-kd1:62.1.7	Why donʼt I just get myself a bowl and robes, shave off my hair and beard, put on ocher robes, and then go to the monastery and live with the monks?” And he did just that. 
pli-tv-kd1:62.2.1	When he came to the monastery, he bowed down to the monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:62.2.2	The monks asked him, 
pli-tv-kd1:62.2.3	“How many rains do you have?” 
pli-tv-kd1:62.2.4	He said, “What does ʻHow many rains’ mean?” 
pli-tv-kd1:62.2.5	“Who’s your preceptor?” 
pli-tv-kd1:62.2.6	“What’s a preceptor?” 
pli-tv-kd1:62.2.7	The monks said to Venerable Upāli, 
pli-tv-kd1:62.2.8	“Upāli, please examine this person.” 
pli-tv-kd1:62.3.1	That man then told Upāli what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd1:62.3.2	Upāli told the monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:62.3.3	who in turn told the Buddha. He said, 
pli-tv-kd1:62.3.4	“Anyone living in the community by theft should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled. 
pli-tv-kd1:62.3.5	Anyone who has previously left to join the monastics of another religion should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled.” 
pli-tv-kd1:63.1.0	49. Animals 
pli-tv-kd1:63.1.1	At one time there was a certain dragon who was troubled, ashamed, and disgusted with his existence as a dragon. 
pli-tv-kd1:63.1.2	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:63.1.3	“How can I get released from existence as a dragon and quickly become human?” 
pli-tv-kd1:63.1.4	And it occurred to him, 
pli-tv-kd1:63.1.5	“These Sakyan monastics live according to the Truth. They’re celibate and their conduct is good, and they’re truthful, moral, and have a good character. 
pli-tv-kd1:63.1.6	If I was to go forth with them, I would be released from existence as a dragon and quickly become human.” 
pli-tv-kd1:63.2.1	Then, taking on the appearance of a young brahmin, that dragon went to the monks and asked for the going forth. 
pli-tv-kd1:63.2.2	The monks gave him the going forth and the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:63.2.3	Soon afterwards that dragon was sharing the outermost dwelling with a certain monk. 
pli-tv-kd1:63.2.4	After getting up early one morning, that monk walked back and forth outside. 
pli-tv-kd1:63.2.5	When the monk had left, the dragon relaxed and fell asleep, 
pli-tv-kd1:63.2.6	as a result of which the serpent filled the whole dwelling, its coils even coming out of the windows. 
pli-tv-kd1:63.3.1	Just then that monk decided to go back inside. When he opened the door, he saw the serpent filling the whole dwelling, and being terrified, he screamed. 
pli-tv-kd1:63.3.2	Monks came running to and asked him, 
pli-tv-kd1:63.3.3	“Why are you screaming?” 
pli-tv-kd1:63.3.4	And he told them. 
pli-tv-kd1:63.3.5	The dragon woke up from the noise and sat down on his seat. 
pli-tv-kd1:63.3.6	The monks asked him 
pli-tv-kd1:63.3.7	who he was. 
pli-tv-kd1:63.3.8	He replied, “I’m a dragon.” 
pli-tv-kd1:63.3.9	“Why did you do this?” 
pli-tv-kd1:63.3.10	And the dragon told them what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd1:63.3.11	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd1:63.4.1	He then had the Sangha of monks gathered and said to the dragon, 
pli-tv-kd1:63.4.2	“You dragons are unable to make progress on this spiritual path. 
pli-tv-kd1:63.4.3	Go, dragon, and keep the observance days of the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth of the lunar half-month. In this way you’ll be released from existence as a dragon and quickly become human.” 
pli-tv-kd1:63.4.4	When he heard this, the dragon wept. Sad and miserable he cried out in distress and left. 
pli-tv-kd1:63.5.1	And the Buddha addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd1:63.5.2	“There are two occasions when dragons appear in their own form: 
pli-tv-kd1:63.5.3	when they have sexual intercourse with each other, and when they relax and fall asleep. 
pli-tv-kd1:63.5.5	Monks, an animal should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, it should be expelled.” 
pli-tv-kd1:64.1.0	50. Matricides 
pli-tv-kd1:64.1.1	At one time there was a young brahmin who had murdered his mother. 
pli-tv-kd1:64.1.2	He was troubled, ashamed, and disgusted by that bad deed, 
pli-tv-kd1:64.1.3	and he thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:64.1.4	“How can I escape from this bad action?” 
pli-tv-kd1:64.1.5	And it occurred to him, 
pli-tv-kd1:64.1.6	“These Sakyan monastics live according to the Truth. They’re celibate and their conduct is good, and they’re truthful, moral, and have a good character. 
pli-tv-kd1:64.1.7	If I was to go forth with them, I would be released from this bad action.” 
pli-tv-kd1:64.2.1	He then went to the monks and asked for the going forth. 
pli-tv-kd1:64.2.2	The monks said to Upāli, 
pli-tv-kd1:64.2.3	“Previously a dragon in the appearance of a young brahmin asked the monks for the going forth. 
pli-tv-kd1:64.2.4	Upāli, please examine this young brahmin.” 
pli-tv-kd1:64.2.5	That young brahmin told Upāli what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd1:64.2.6	Upāli told the monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:64.2.7	who in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:64.2.8	“Anyone who has murdered his mother should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled.” 
pli-tv-kd1:65.1.0	51. Patricides 
pli-tv-kd1:65.1.1	At one time there was a young brahmin who had murdered his father. 
pli-tv-kd1:65.1.2	He was troubled, ashamed, and disgusted by that bad deed, 
pli-tv-kd1:65.1.3	and he thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:65.1.4	“How can I escape from this bad action?” 
pli-tv-kd1:65.1.5	And it occurred to him, 
pli-tv-kd1:65.1.6	“These Sakyan monastics live according to the Truth. They’re celibate and their conduct is good, and they’re truthful, moral, and have a good character. If I was to go forth with them, I would be released from this bad action.” 
pli-tv-kd1:65.1.7	He then went to the monks and asked for the going forth. 
pli-tv-kd1:65.1.8	The monks said to Upāli, 
pli-tv-kd1:65.1.9	“Previously a dragon in the appearance of a young brahmin asked the monks for the going forth. 
pli-tv-kd1:65.1.10	Upāli, please examine this young brahmin.” 
pli-tv-kd1:65.1.11	That young brahmin told Upāli what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd1:65.1.12	Upāli told the monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:65.1.13	who in turn told the Buddha. He said, 
pli-tv-kd1:65.1.14	“Anyone who has murdered his father should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled.” 
pli-tv-kd1:66.1.0	52. Murderers of perfected ones 
pli-tv-kd1:66.1.1	On one occasion a number of monks were traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd1:66.1.2	As they were traveling, they were attacked by gangsters. Some of the monks were robbed and others were killed. 
pli-tv-kd1:66.1.3	The King’s men came out from Sāvatthī. They caught some of the bandits, but others ran away. 
pli-tv-kd1:66.1.4	Those who ran away went forth with the monks, but those who were caught were taken to be executed. 
pli-tv-kd1:66.2.1	Those who had run away and gone forth saw the other bandits being led to execution. They said, 
pli-tv-kd1:66.2.2	“It’s good that we ran away. Had we been caught, we would’ve been executed too.” 
pli-tv-kd1:66.2.3	The monks asked, 
pli-tv-kd1:66.2.4	“But what have you done?” 
pli-tv-kd1:66.2.5	And they told the monks what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd1:66.2.6	The monks then told the Buddha, who said, 
pli-tv-kd1:66.2.7	“Those monks were perfected ones. 
pli-tv-kd1:66.2.8	Anyone who has murdered a perfected one should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled.” 
pli-tv-kd1:67.1.0	53. Rapists of nuns 
pli-tv-kd1:67.1.1	On one occasion a number of nuns were traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd1:67.1.2	As they were traveling, they were attack by gangsters. Some of the nuns were robbed, others were raped. 
pli-tv-kd1:67.1.3	The King’s men came out from Sāvatthī. They caught some of the bandits, but others ran away. 
pli-tv-kd1:67.1.4	Those who ran away went forth as monks, 
pli-tv-kd1:67.1.5	but those who were caught were taken to be executed. 
pli-tv-kd1:67.1.6	Those who had run away and gone forth saw the other bandits being led to execution. They said, 
pli-tv-kd1:67.1.7	“It’s good that we ran away. Had we been caught, we would’ve been executed, too.” 
pli-tv-kd1:67.1.8	The monks asked, 
pli-tv-kd1:67.1.9	“But what have you done?” 
pli-tv-kd1:67.1.10	And they told the monks what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd1:67.1.11	The monks then told the Buddha, who said, 
pli-tv-kd1:67.1.12	“Anyone who has raped a nun should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled. 
pli-tv-kd1:67.1.13	Anyone who has created a schism in the Sangha should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled. 
pli-tv-kd1:67.1.14	Anyone who has caused the Buddha to bleed should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled.”

pli-tv-kd1:68.1.1	At one time a hermaphrodite had gone forth as a monk. 
pli-tv-kd1:68.1.2	He had sex and made others have it. 
pli-tv-kd1:68.1.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:68.1.4	“A hermaphrodite should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled.”

pli-tv-kd1:69.1.1	On one occasion the monks gave the full ordination to someone without a preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:69.1.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:69.1.3	“You should not give the full ordination to anyone without a preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:69.1.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:69.2.1	On one occasion the monks gave the full ordination with the Sangha as preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:69.2.2	They told the Buddha and he said,

pli-tv-kd1:70.5.3	He then walked naked for almsfood. 
pli-tv-kd1:70.5.4	People complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd1:70.5.5	“He’s just like the monastics of other religions.” 
pli-tv-kd1:70.5.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:70.5.7	“You should not give the full ordination to anyone with borrowed robes. 
pli-tv-kd1:70.5.8	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:70.6.1	On one occasion the monks gave the full ordination to someone with a borrowed almsbowl and borrowed robes. 
pli-tv-kd1:70.6.2	When he had been ordained, the bowl and the robes had to be returned. 
pli-tv-kd1:70.6.3	He then walked naked for almsfood and received it in his hands. 
pli-tv-kd1:70.6.4	People complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd1:70.6.5	“He’s just like the monastics of other religions.” 
pli-tv-kd1:70.6.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:70.6.7	“You should not give the full ordination to anyone with a borrowed almsbowl and borrowed robes. 
pli-tv-kd1:70.6.8	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:70.6.9	The section consisting of twenty-one cases when the full ordination is not to be given is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:71.1.0	57. The section consisting of thirty-two cases when the going forth is not to be given 
pli-tv-kd1:71.1.1	On one occasion the monks gave the going forth to someone without a hand … 
pli-tv-kd1:71.1.2	to someone without a foot …

pli-tv-kd1:71.1.32	to someone blind, mute, and deaf. 
pli-tv-kd1:71.1.33	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and said, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.1	“You should not give the going forth to someone without a hand, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.2	to someone without a foot, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.3	to someone without a hand and a foot, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.4	to someone without an ear, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.5	to someone without nose, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.6	to someone without an ear and nose, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.7	to someone without a finger or toe, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.9	to someone without a tendon, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.10	to someone with joined fingers,

pli-tv-kd1:71.2.12	to a dwarf, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.13	to someone with goiter, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.14	to someone who has been branded, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.15	to someone who has been whipped, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.16	to a wanted criminal, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.17	to someone with elephantiasis, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.18	to someone with a serious sickness, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.19	to someone with abnormal appearance, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.20	to someone blind in one eye, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.21	to someone with a crooked limb, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.22	to someone lame, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.23	to someone paralyzed on one side, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.24	to someone crippled, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.25	to someone weak from old age, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.26	to someone blind, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.27	to a mute, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.28	to someone deaf, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.29	to someone blind and mute, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.30	to someone blind and deaf, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.31	to someone mute and deaf, 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.32	or to someone blind, mute, and deaf. 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.33	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.34	The section consisting of thirty-two cases when the going forth is not to be given is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:71.2.35	The ninth section for recitation on inheritance is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:72.1.0	58. Formal support for those who are shameless 
pli-tv-kd1:72.1.1	At that time the monks from the group of six gave formal support to those who were shameless. 
pli-tv-kd1:72.1.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:72.1.3	“You should not give formal support to those who are shameless. 
pli-tv-kd1:72.1.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:72.1.5	At that time monks lived with formal support from those who were shameless. 
pli-tv-kd1:72.1.6	Soon they too became shameless and bad. 
pli-tv-kd1:72.1.7	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:72.1.8	“You should not live with formal support from those who are shameless. 
pli-tv-kd1:72.1.9	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:72.1.10	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:72.1.11	“The Buddha has laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd1:72.1.12	that one should not give formal support to those who are shameless and that one shouldn’t live with such support from those who are shameless. 
pli-tv-kd1:72.1.13	But how do we know who is shameless and who is not?” 
pli-tv-kd1:72.1.14	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:72.1.15	“I allow you to wait for four or five days to find out if the other person is compatible with the monks.” 
pli-tv-kd1:73.1.0	59. Formal support for those who are traveling, etc. 
pli-tv-kd1:73.1.1	On one occasion a certain monk was traveling in the country of Kosala. 
pli-tv-kd1:73.1.2	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:73.1.3	“The Buddha has laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd1:73.1.4	that someone like me shouldn’t live without formal support. 
pli-tv-kd1:73.1.5	But I’m traveling, so what should I do?” 
pli-tv-kd1:73.1.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:73.1.7	“If you are traveling and unable to obtain formal support, I allow you to live without.” 
pli-tv-kd1:73.2.1	On one occasion two monks were traveling in the country of Kosala, 
pli-tv-kd1:73.2.2	when they arrived at a certain monastery. 
pli-tv-kd1:73.2.3	Just then one of them got sick. 
pli-tv-kd1:73.2.4	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:73.2.5	“The Buddha has laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd1:73.2.6	that someone like me shouldn’t live without formal support. 
pli-tv-kd1:73.2.7	But I’m sick, so what should I do?” 
pli-tv-kd1:73.2.8	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:73.2.9	“If you are sick and unable to obtain formal support, I allow you to live without.” 
pli-tv-kd1:73.3.1	Then the monk who was nursing him thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:73.3.2	“The Buddha has laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd1:73.3.3	that someone like me shouldn’t live without formal support. 
pli-tv-kd1:73.3.4	But this monk is sick, so what should I do?” 
pli-tv-kd1:73.3.5	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:73.3.6	“If you have been asked to nurse someone who is sick and you are unable to obtain formal support, I allow you to live without.” 
pli-tv-kd1:73.4.1	At one time there was a certain monk who was staying in the wilderness 
pli-tv-kd1:73.4.2	and who was at ease in his dwelling. 
pli-tv-kd1:73.4.3	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:73.4.4	“The Buddha has laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd1:73.4.5	that someone like me shouldn’t live without formal support. 
pli-tv-kd1:73.4.6	But I’m staying in the wilderness and I’m at ease in this dwelling, so what should I do?” 
pli-tv-kd1:73.4.7	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:73.4.8	“If you are staying in the wilderness and observe that you are at ease, and you are unable to obtain formal support, I allow you to live without. 
pli-tv-kd1:73.4.9	But when a suitable support-giver comes, you should live with formal support from him.” 
pli-tv-kd1:74.1.0	60. The allowance to make proclamations using the family name 
pli-tv-kd1:74.1.1	At one time someone wanted the full ordination with Venerable Mahākassapa. 
pli-tv-kd1:74.1.2	Mahākassapa sent a message to Venerable Ānanda: 
pli-tv-kd1:74.1.3	“Please come, Ānanda, and do the proclamation.” 
pli-tv-kd1:74.1.4	Ānanda thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:74.1.5	“Because I respect the elder so much, I’m unable to say his name.” 
pli-tv-kd1:74.1.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:74.1.7	“I allow you to do the proclamation using family name, too.” 
pli-tv-kd1:74.2.0	61. The two people seeking the full ordination, etc. 
pli-tv-kd1:74.2.1	At one time two people wanted the full ordination with Mahākassapa. 
pli-tv-kd1:74.2.2	They argued with each other 
pli-tv-kd1:74.2.3	about who should be ordained first. 
pli-tv-kd1:74.2.4	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:74.2.5	“I allow you to give the full ordination to two people with a single proclamation.” 
pli-tv-kd1:74.3.1	At one time a number of people wanted the full ordination with several senior monks. 
pli-tv-kd1:74.3.2	They argued with one another 
pli-tv-kd1:74.3.3	about who should be ordained first. 
pli-tv-kd1:74.3.4	The senior monks said, 
pli-tv-kd1:74.3.5	“Well then, let’s ordain all of them with a single proclamation.” 
pli-tv-kd1:74.3.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:74.3.7	“I allow you to give the full ordination to two or three people with a single proclamation, but only with a single preceptor, not with many.” 
pli-tv-kd1:75.1.0	62. The allowance to be fully ordained when one is twenty years old since appearing in the womb 
pli-tv-kd1:75.1.1	At that time Venerable Kumārakassapa had been given the full ordination twenty years after he appeared in the womb. 
pli-tv-kd1:75.1.2	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd1:75.1.3	“The Buddha has laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd1:75.1.4	that a person less than twenty years old shouldn’t be given the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:75.1.5	I was ordained twenty years after being in the womb. 
pli-tv-kd1:75.1.6	So, have I been ordained or not?” 
pli-tv-kd1:75.1.7	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:75.1.8	“When the mind first appears in the mother’s womb, when the consciousness first manifests, that’s a person’s birth. 
pli-tv-kd1:75.1.9	I allow you to give the full ordination to someone who is twenty years old since appearing in the womb.” 
pli-tv-kd1:76.1.0	63. The process for the full ordination 
pli-tv-kd1:76.1.1	At that time the full ordination had been given to people who had leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, and epilepsy. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.1.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:76.1.3	“The one who is giving the full ordination should ask about the thirteen obstructions. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.1.4	And it should be done like this: 
pli-tv-kd1:76.1.5	ʻDo you have any of these diseases: 
pli-tv-kd1:76.1.6	leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, or epilepsy? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.1.7	Are you human? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.1.8	Are you a man? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.1.9	Are you a free man? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.1.10	Are you free from debt? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.1.11	Are you employed by the King? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.1.12	Do you have permission from your parents? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.1.13	Are you twenty years old? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.1.14	Do you have a full set of bowl and robes? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.1.15	What is your name? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.1.16	What is the name of your preceptor?’” 
pli-tv-kd1:76.2.1	Soon afterwards they asked those seeking the full ordination about the obstructions without first instructing them. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.2.2	They were embarrassed, humiliated, and unable to respond. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.2.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:76.2.4	“You should instruct first and then ask about the obstructions. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.3.1	They instructed them right there in the midst of the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.3.2	Once more those seeking the full ordination were embarrassed, humiliated, and unable to respond. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.3.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:76.3.4	“You should instruct them to one side and then ask about the obstructions in the midst of the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.3.5	And it should be done like this. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.3.6	First they should be told to choose a preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.3.7	Their bowl and robes should then be pointed out to them: 
pli-tv-kd1:76.3.8	ʻThis is your bowl, this your outer robe, this your upper robe, and this your sarong. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.3.9	Now please go and stand over there.’” 
pli-tv-kd1:76.4.1	They were instructed by monks who were ignorant and incompetent. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.4.2	And because they were badly instructed, they were once again embarrassed, humiliated, and unable to respond. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.4.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:76.4.4	“A monk who is ignorant and incompetent should not instruct. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.4.5	If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.4.6	A monk who is competent and capable should instruct.” 
pli-tv-kd1:76.5.1	They instructed without having been appointed. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.5.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:76.5.3	“A monk should not instruct if he hasn’t been appointed to do so. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.5.4	If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.5.5	A monk should instruct when he’s been appointed to do so. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.5.6	And it should be done like this: 
pli-tv-kd1:76.5.7	either one should be appointed through oneself or one should be appointed through another. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.5.8	And how is one appointed through oneself? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.5.9	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd1:76.5.10	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.5.11	So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.5.12	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will instruct so-and-so.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:76.5.13	In this way one is appointed through oneself. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.6.1	And how is one appointed through another? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.6.2	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd1:76.6.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.6.4	So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.6.5	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, so-and-so will instruct so-and-so.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:76.6.6	In this way one is appointed through another. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.7.1	The monk who has been appointed should go to the one who is seeking the full ordination and say this: 
pli-tv-kd1:76.7.2	ʻListen, so-and-so. Now is the time for you to tell the truth. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.7.3	When asked in the midst of the Sangha about various matters, you should say, “Yes,” if it’s true and, “No,” if it’s not. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.7.4	Don’t be embarrassed or humiliated. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.7.5	This is what they will ask you: 
pli-tv-kd1:76.7.6	“Do you have any of these diseases: 
pli-tv-kd1:76.7.7	leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, or epilepsy? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.7.8	Are you human? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.7.9	Are you a man? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.7.10	Are you a free man? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.7.11	Are you free from debt? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.7.12	Are you employed by the King? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.7.13	Do you have permission from your parents? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.7.14	Are you twenty years old? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.7.15	Do you have a full set of bowl and robes? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.7.16	What is your name? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.7.17	What is the name of your preceptor?”’” 
pli-tv-kd1:76.8.1	They then returned to the Sangha together. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.8.2	The Buddha said, “They should not return together. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.8.3	The instructor should return first and inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd1:76.8.4	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.8.5	So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.8.6	He’s been instructed by me. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.8.7	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, so-and-so should come.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:76.8.8	And he should be told to come. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.8.9	He should then put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the monks, squat on his heels, and raise his joined palms. He should then ask for ordination: 
pli-tv-kd1:76.8.10	‘Venerables, I ask the Sangha for the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.8.11	May the Sangha lift me up out of compassion. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.8.12	For the second time, Venerables, I ask the Sangha for the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.8.13	May the Sangha lift me up out of compassion. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.8.14	For the third time, Venerables, I ask the Sangha for the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.8.15	May the Sangha lift me up out of compassion.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:76.9.1	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd1:76.9.2	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.9.3	So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.9.4	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will ask so-and-so about the obstructions. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.9.5	Listen, so-and-so. Now is the time for you to tell the truth. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.9.6	I will ask you about various matters. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.9.7	If something is true, you should say, “Yes,” and if it’s not, you should say, “No.” 
pli-tv-kd1:76.9.8	Do you have any of these diseases: 
pli-tv-kd1:76.9.9	leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, or epilepsy? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.9.10	Are you human? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.9.11	Are you a man? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.9.12	Are you a free man? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.9.13	Are you free from debt? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.9.14	Are you employed by the King? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.9.15	Do you have permission from your parents? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.9.16	Are you twenty years old? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.9.17	Do you have a full set of bowl and robes? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.9.18	What is your name? 
pli-tv-kd1:76.9.19	What is the name of your preceptor?’ 
pli-tv-kd1:76.10.1	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd1:76.10.2	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.10.3	So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. He is free from obstructions and his bowl and robes are complete. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.10.4	So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination with so-and-so as his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.10.5	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.10.6	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.11.1	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.11.2	So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. He is free from obstructions and his bowl and robes are complete. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.11.3	So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination with so-and-so as his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.11.4	The Sangha gives the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.11.5	Any monk who approves of giving the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.11.6	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.12.1	For the second time I speak on this matter. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.12.2	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.12.3	So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. He is free from obstructions and his bowl and robes are complete. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.12.4	So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination with so-and-so as his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.12.5	The Sangha gives the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.12.6	Any monk who approves of giving the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.12.7	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.12.8	For the third time I speak on this matter. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.12.9	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.12.10	So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. He is free from obstructions and his bowl and robes are complete. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.12.11	So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination with so-and-so as his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.12.12	The Sangha gives the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.12.13	Any monk who approves of giving the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.12.14	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.12.15	The Sangha has given the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd1:76.12.16	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd1:76.12.17	The procedure of full ordination is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:77.1.0	64. The four supports 
pli-tv-kd1:77.1.1	“Straightaway the time should be noted and the date should be pointed out. These should be declared jointly to everyone. And the four supports should be pointed out to him: 
pli-tv-kd1:77.1.2	ʻOne gone forth is supported by almsfood. 
pli-tv-kd1:77.1.3	You should persevere with this for life. 
pli-tv-kd1:77.1.4	These are the extra allowances: 
pli-tv-kd1:77.1.5	a meal for the Sangha, a meal for designated monks, an invitational meal, a meal for which lots are drawn, a half-monthly meal, a meal on the observance day, and a meal on the day after the observance day. 
pli-tv-kd1:77.1.6	One gone forth is supported by rag-robes. 
pli-tv-kd1:77.1.7	You should persevere with this for life. 
pli-tv-kd1:77.1.8	These are the extra allowances: 
pli-tv-kd1:77.1.9	linen, cotton, silk, wool, sunn hemp, and hemp. 
pli-tv-kd1:77.1.10	One gone forth is supported by the foot of a tree as resting place. 
pli-tv-kd1:77.1.11	You should persevere with this for life. 
pli-tv-kd1:77.1.12	These are the extra allowances: 
pli-tv-kd1:77.1.13	a dwelling, a stilt house, and a cave. 
pli-tv-kd1:77.1.14	One gone forth is supported by medicine of fermented urine. 
pli-tv-kd1:77.1.15	You should persevere with this for life. 
pli-tv-kd1:77.1.16	These are the extra allowances: 
pli-tv-kd1:77.1.17	ghee, butter, oil, honey, and syrup.ʼ” 
pli-tv-kd1:77.1.18	The four supports are finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:78.1.0	65. The four things not to be done 
pli-tv-kd1:78.1.1	On one occasion after giving the full ordination to someone, the monks left. 
pli-tv-kd1:78.1.2	The newly ordained monk lagged behind, walking by himself. On the way he met his old wife. 
pli-tv-kd1:78.1.3	She said, 
pli-tv-kd1:78.1.4	“Have you just gone forth?” 
pli-tv-kd1:78.1.5	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd1:78.1.6	“It’s difficult for those gone forth to get sex. 
pli-tv-kd1:78.1.7	Come, let’s have intercourse.” 
pli-tv-kd1:78.1.8	And he had intercourse with her. 
pli-tv-kd1:78.1.9	It took him a long time to catch up with the other monks. They asked him 
pli-tv-kd1:78.1.10	why it had taken him so long 
pli-tv-kd1:78.2.1	and he told them what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd1:78.2.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:78.2.3	“When you have given the full ordination to someone, you should give him a companion and point out the four things not to be done: 
pli-tv-kd1:78.2.4	A monk who is fully ordained should not have sexual intercourse, even with an animal. 
pli-tv-kd1:78.2.5	If he has sexual intercourse, he’s not an ascetic, not a Sakyan monastic. 
pli-tv-kd1:78.2.6	Just as a man with his head cut off is unable to continue living by reconnecting it to the body, 
pli-tv-kd1:78.2.7	so too is a monk who has had sexual intercourse not an ascetic, not a Sakyan monastic. 
pli-tv-kd1:78.2.8	You shouldn’t do this for as long as you live. 
pli-tv-kd1:78.3.1	A monk who is fully ordained should not steal, even a straw. 
pli-tv-kd1:78.3.2	If he steals a _pāda_ coin, the worth of a _pāda_, or more than a _pāda_, he’s not an ascetic, not a Sakyan monastic. 
pli-tv-kd1:78.3.3	Just as a fallen, withered leaf is incapable of becoming green again, 
pli-tv-kd1:78.3.4	so too is a monk who, intending to steal, takes an ungiven _pāda_ coin, the worth of a _pāda_, or more than a _pāda_ not an ascetic, not a Sakyan monastic.
pli-tv-kd1:78.3.5	You shouldn’t do this for as long as you live. 
pli-tv-kd1:78.4.1	A monk who is fully ordained should not intentionally kill a living being, even a small insect. 
pli-tv-kd1:78.4.2	If he intentionally kills a human being, even just causing an abortion, he’s not an ascetic, not a Sakyan monastic. 
pli-tv-kd1:78.4.3	Just as an ordinary stone that has broken in half cannot be put back together again, 
pli-tv-kd1:78.4.4	so too is a monk who has intentionally killed a human being not an ascetic, not a Sakyan monastic. 
pli-tv-kd1:78.4.5	You shouldn’t do this for as long as you live. 
pli-tv-kd1:78.5.1	A monk who is fully ordained should not claim a superhuman quality, even just saying, ʻI delight in solitude.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:78.5.2	If, because he has bad desires and is overcome by desire, he claims to have a non-existent superhuman quality—whether absorption, release, stillness, attainment, path, or fruit—he’s not an ascetic, not a Sakyan monastic. 
pli-tv-kd1:78.5.3	Just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth, 
pli-tv-kd1:78.5.4	so too is a monk with bad desires, overcome by desire, who claims to have non-existent superhuman quality not an ascetic, not a Sakyan monastic. 
pli-tv-kd1:78.5.5	You shouldn’t do this for as long as you live.” 
pli-tv-kd1:78.5.6	The four things not to be done are finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:79.1.0	66. The one ejected for not recognizing an offense 
pli-tv-kd1:79.1.1	At one time a certain monk disrobed after being ejected for not recognizing an offense. 
pli-tv-kd1:79.1.2	He then returned and asked the monks for the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:79.1.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.1.4	“When a monk disrobes after being ejected for not recognizing an offense, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.1.5	but then returns and asks the monks for the full ordination, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.1.6	he should be asked, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.1.7	ʻWill you recognize that offense?’ 
pli-tv-kd1:79.1.8	If he says, ʻI will,’ he should be given the going forth, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.1.9	but if he says, ʻI won’t,’ he should not be given the going forth. 
pli-tv-kd1:79.1.10	After he’s been given the going forth, he should be asked again, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.1.11	ʻWill you recognize that offense?’ 
pli-tv-kd1:79.1.12	If he says, ʻI will,’ he should be given the full ordination, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.1.13	but if he says, ʻI won’t,’ he should not be given the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:79.2.1	After he’s been given the full ordination, he should be asked again, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.2.2	ʻWill you recognize that offense?’ 
pli-tv-kd1:79.2.3	If he says, ʻI will,’ he should be reinstated, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.2.4	but if he says, ʻI won’t,’ he should not be reinstated. 
pli-tv-kd1:79.2.5	After he’s been reinstated, he should be asked again, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.2.6	ʻDo you recognize that offense?’ 
pli-tv-kd1:79.2.7	If he recognizes it, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd1:79.2.8	If he doesn’t recognize it, then if you are unanimous, he should be ejected once more. 
pli-tv-kd1:79.2.9	If you are not unanimous, there is no offense in living together with him or in doing formal meetings of the community together. 
pli-tv-kd1:79.3.1	“When a monk disrobes after being ejected for not making amends for an offense, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.3.2	but then returns and asks the monks for the full ordination, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.3.3	he should be asked, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.3.4	ʻWill you make amends for that offense?’ 
pli-tv-kd1:79.3.5	If he says, ʻI will,’ he should be given the going forth, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.3.6	but if he says, ʻI won’t,’ he should not be given the going forth. 
pli-tv-kd1:79.3.7	After he’s been given the going forth, he should be asked again, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.3.8	ʻWill you make amends for that offense?’ 
pli-tv-kd1:79.3.9	If he says, ʻI will,’ he should be given the full ordination, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.3.10	but if he says, ʻI won’t,’ he should not be given the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd1:79.3.11	After he’s been given the full ordination, he should be asked again, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.3.12	ʻWill you make amends for that offense?’ 
pli-tv-kd1:79.3.13	If he says, ʻI will,’ he should be reinstated, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.3.14	but if he says, ʻI won’t,’ he should not be reinstated. 
pli-tv-kd1:79.3.15	After he’s been reinstated, he should be told, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.3.16	ʻMake amends for that offense.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:79.3.17	If he does, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd1:79.3.18	If he doesn’t, then if you are unanimous, he should be ejected once more. 
pli-tv-kd1:79.3.19	If you are not unanimous, there is no offense in living together with him or in doing formal meetings of the community together. 
pli-tv-kd1:79.4.1	“When a monk disrobes after being ejected for not giving up a bad view, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.4.2	but then returns and asks the monks for the full ordination, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.4.3	he should be asked, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.4.4	ʻWill you give up that bad view?’ 
pli-tv-kd1:79.4.5	If he says, ʻI will,’ he should be given the going forth, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.4.6	but if he says, ʻI won’t,’ he should not be given the going forth. 
pli-tv-kd1:79.4.7	After he’s been given the going forth, he should be asked again, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.4.8	ʻWill you give up that bad view?’

pli-tv-kd1:79.4.15	After he’s been reinstated, he should be told, 
pli-tv-kd1:79.4.16	ʻGive up that bad view.’ 
pli-tv-kd1:79.4.17	If he does, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd1:79.4.18	If he doesn’t, then if you are unanimous, he should be ejected once more. 
pli-tv-kd1:79.4.19	If you are not unanimous, there is no offense in living together with him or in doing formal meetings of the community together.” 
pli-tv-kd1:79.4.20	The long chapter, the first, is finished. 
pli-tv-kd1:79.4.130	In this chapter there are one hundred and seventy-two topics. 
pli-tv-kd1:79.4.131	The long chapter is finished.
pli-tv-kd20:0.1	Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law 
pli-tv-kd20:0.2	The Short Division 
pli-tv-kd20:0.3	The chapter on nuns 
pli-tv-kd20:0.4	1. The account of Mahāpajāpati Gotamī 
pli-tv-kd20:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country in Banyan Tree Monastery at Kapilavatthu. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.1.2	At this time Mahāpajāpati Gotamī went to the Buddha, bowed down to him, 
pli-tv-kd20:1.1.3	and said, 
pli-tv-kd20:1.1.4	“It would be good, Venerable Sir, if women were allowed to go forth from home to homelessness on the spiritual path made known by the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd20:1.1.5	“Let it be, Gotami, don’t pursue this.” 
pli-tv-kd20:1.1.6	A second time 
pli-tv-kd20:1.1.7	and a third time she asked 
pli-tv-kd20:1.1.8	the same question 
pli-tv-kd20:1.1.9	and got the same reply. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.1.10	She thought, 
pli-tv-kd20:1.1.11	“The Buddha doesn’t allow women to go forth,” 
pli-tv-kd20:1.1.12	and sad and tearful she bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.2.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Kapilavatthu for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Vesālī. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.2.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd20:1.2.3	he stayed in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.2.4	In the meantime Mahāpajāpati had her hair cut off, put on ocher robes, and set out for Vesālī together with a number of Sakyan women. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.2.5	When she eventually arrived, she went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.2.6	And she stood outside the gateway, sad and tearful, covered in dust and her feet swollen. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.2.7	Venerable Ānanda saw her there 
pli-tv-kd20:1.2.8	and said to her, 
pli-tv-kd20:1.2.9	“Why are you standing outside the gateway like this?” 
pli-tv-kd20:1.2.10	“Because, Venerable Ānanda, the Buddha doesn’t allow women to go forth.” 
pli-tv-kd20:1.2.11	“Well then, Gotamī, please wait here for a moment, while I ask the Buddha to allow women to go forth.” 
pli-tv-kd20:1.3.1	Venerable Ānanda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd20:1.3.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd20:1.3.3	“Sir, Mahāpajāpati Gotamī is standing outside the gateway, sad and tearful, covered in dust and her feet swollen. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.3.4	She says you won’t allow women to go forth. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.3.5	It would be good if women were allowed to go forth.” 
pli-tv-kd20:1.3.6	“Let it be, Ānanda, don’t pursue this.” 
pli-tv-kd20:1.3.7	A second time 
pli-tv-kd20:1.3.8	and a third time he asked 
pli-tv-kd20:1.3.9	the same question 
pli-tv-kd20:1.3.10	and got the same reply. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.3.11	Ānanda thought, 
pli-tv-kd20:1.3.12	“The Buddha doesn’t allow women to go forth. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.3.13	Let me ask him in another way.” 
pli-tv-kd20:1.3.14	He then said, 
pli-tv-kd20:1.3.15	“If women were allowed to go forth, would they be capable of realizing the fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of non-returning, and the fruit of perfection?” 
pli-tv-kd20:1.3.16	“Yes, they would.” 
pli-tv-kd20:1.3.17	“If that’s so, Sir, 
pli-tv-kd20:1.3.18	and considering that Mahāpajāpati has been very helpful to you—she is your aunt who nurtured you, brought you up, and breastfed you when your own mother died—
pli-tv-kd20:1.3.19	it would be good if women were allowed to go forth.” 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.0	2. The eight important principles 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.1	“Ānanda, if Mahāpajāpati accepts these eight important principles, 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.2	that will be her full ordination: 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.3	A nun who has been fully ordained for a hundred years should bow down to a monk who was given the full ordination on that very day, and she should stand up for him, raise her joined palms to him, and do acts of respect toward him. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.4	This rule is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.5	A nun should not spend the rainy-season residence in a monastery without monks. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.6	This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.7	Every half-month a nun should seek two things from the Sangha of monks: 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.8	asking it about the observance day and going to it for the instruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.9	This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.10	A nun who has completed the rainy-season residence should invite correction from both Sanghas in regard to three things: 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.11	what has been seen, what has been heard, and what has been suspected. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.12	This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.13	A nun who has committed a heavy offense must undertake a trial period for a half-month toward both Sanghas. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.14	This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.15	A trainee nun who has trained in the six rules for two years may seek for full ordination in both Sanghas. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.16	This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.17	A nun may not in any way abuse or revile a monk. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.18	This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.19	From today onwards, nuns may not correct monks, but monks may correct nuns. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.20	This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.4.21	Ānanda, if Mahāpajāpati accepts these eight important principles, that will be her full ordination.” 
pli-tv-kd20:1.5.1	After learning these eight important principles from the Buddha, Ānanda went to Mahāpajāpati and said, 
pli-tv-kd20:1.5.2	“If you accept eight important principles, Gotami, that will be your full ordination.” 
pli-tv-kd20:1.5.3	And he told her the rules. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.5.22	She replied, “Just as a young woman or man—someone fond of adornments, who had just washed her hair—would receive a garland of lotuses, a garland of sandan flowers, or a garland of jasmine with both hands and place it on her head, 
pli-tv-kd20:1.5.23	so too, do I receive these eight important principles, not to be breached for life.” 
pli-tv-kd20:1.6.1	Ānanda then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd20:1.6.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd20:1.6.3	“Sir, Mahāpajāpati has accepted the eight important principles. Your aunt has been ordained.” 
pli-tv-kd20:1.6.4	“Ānanda, if women had not been allowed to go forth on this spiritual path made known by the Buddha, the spiritual life would have lasted a long time—the true Teaching would have lasted a thousand years. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.6.5	But since women have been allowed to go forth, the spiritual life won’t last long—
pli-tv-kd20:1.6.6	now the true Teaching will only last five hundred years. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.6.7	Just as families with many women and few men are easily robbed by thieves, 
pli-tv-kd20:1.6.8	so too, the spiritual life doesn’t last long on a spiritual path where women are allowed to go forth. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.6.9	Just as a ripe rice-field affected by whiteheads won’t last long, 
pli-tv-kd20:1.6.10	so too, the spiritual life doesn’t last long on a spiritual path where women are allowed to go forth. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.6.11	Just as a ripe field of sugarcane attacked by red rot won’t last long, 
pli-tv-kd20:1.6.12	so too, the spiritual life doesn’t last long on a spiritual path where women are allowed to go forth. 
pli-tv-kd20:1.6.13	Just as a man might, as a safeguard, surround a large pool with an embankment, so that the water won’t overflow, 
pli-tv-kd20:1.6.14	so too, have I, as a safeguard, laid down the eight important principles, not to be breached for life.” 
pli-tv-kd20:1.6.15	The eight important principles for nuns are finished. 
pli-tv-kd20:2.1.0	3. The allowance for the full ordination of nuns 
pli-tv-kd20:2.1.1	Mahāpajāpati went to the Buddha, bowed down, 
pli-tv-kd20:2.1.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd20:2.1.3	“Venerable Sir, what should I do with these Sakyan women?” 
pli-tv-kd20:2.1.4	The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching, 
pli-tv-kd20:2.1.5	after which she bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd20:2.1.6	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a Teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd20:2.1.7	“I allow you to give the full ordination to nuns.” 
pli-tv-kd20:2.2.1	Soon afterwards those nuns said to Mahāpajāpati, 
pli-tv-kd20:2.2.2	“We’re ordained, but you’re not, 
pli-tv-kd20:2.2.3	for the Buddha has laid down that the monks should give the full ordination to nuns.” 
pli-tv-kd20:2.2.4	Mahāpajāpati then went to Venerable Ānanda, bowed down, 
pli-tv-kd20:2.2.5	and told him 
pli-tv-kd20:2.2.6	what the Sakyan women had said. 
pli-tv-kd20:2.2.9	Ānanda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd20:2.2.10	and told him 
pli-tv-kd20:2.2.11	what Mahāpajāpati had said. 
pli-tv-kd20:2.2.15	The Buddha replied, “Mahāpajāpati was ordained from the time she accepted the eight important principles.” 
pli-tv-kd20:3.1.1	On another occasion Mahāpajāpati went to Venerable Ānanda, bowed down, 
pli-tv-kd20:3.1.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd20:3.1.3	“Venerable Ānanda, I wish to ask the Buddha for a favor. 
pli-tv-kd20:3.1.4	It would be good if the Buddha allowed the monks and nuns to bow down to one another according to seniority, and likewise to rise up for one another, raise their joined palms to one another, and do acts of respect toward one another according to seniority.” 
pli-tv-kd20:3.1.5	Venerable Ānanda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd20:3.1.6	and told the Buddha 
pli-tv-kd20:3.1.7	what Mahāpajāpati had said. 
pli-tv-kd20:3.1.10	The Buddha replied, “It is impossible, Ānanda, that I would allow bowing down to a woman, and likewise rising up for, raising one’s joined palms to, and doing acts of respect toward a woman. 
pli-tv-kd20:3.1.11	Even the monastics of other religions with their flawed teachings don’t bow down to women, or rise up for them, raise their joined palms to them, or do acts of respect toward them. 
pli-tv-kd20:3.1.12	So how then could I allow these things?” 
pli-tv-kd20:3.1.13	The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd20:3.1.14	“You should not bow down to a woman, or rise up for, raise your joined palms to, or do acts of respect toward a woman. 
pli-tv-kd20:3.1.15	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:4.1.1	On another occasion Mahāpajāpati went to the Buddha, bowed down, 
pli-tv-kd20:4.1.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd20:4.1.3	“Venerable Sir, how should we practice those training rules that the nuns have in common with the monks?” 
pli-tv-kd20:4.1.4	“You should practice them in the same way as the monks do.” 
pli-tv-kd20:4.1.5	“And how should we practice those training rules that the nuns don’t have in common with the monks?” 
pli-tv-kd20:4.1.6	“You should practice them as they have been laid down.” 
pli-tv-kd20:5.1.1	On another occasion Mahāpajāpati went to the Buddha, bowed down, 
pli-tv-kd20:5.1.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd20:5.1.3	“It would be good, Venerable Sir, if you would give me a teaching in brief. I could then stay by myself, secluded, heedful, energetic, and diligent.” 
pli-tv-kd20:5.1.4	“Those things, Gotami, that you know 
pli-tv-kd20:5.1.5	lead to passion, not to dispassion; to bondage, not to freedom from bondage; to an increase in things, not to a reduction in things; to great desires, not to fewness of wishes; to discontent, not to contentment; to socializing, not to seclusion; to laziness, not to being energetic; to being difficult to support, not to being easy to support—
pli-tv-kd20:5.1.6	you should definitely regard them 
pli-tv-kd20:5.1.7	as not the Teaching, not the training, not the Teacher’s instruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:5.1.8	But those things that you know 
pli-tv-kd20:5.1.9	lead to dispassion, not to passion; to freedom from bondage, not to bondage; to a reduction in things, not to an increase in things; to fewness of wishes, not to great desires; to contentment, not to discontent; to seclusion, not to socializing; to being energetic, not to laziness; to being easy to support, not to being difficult to support—
pli-tv-kd20:5.1.10	you should definitely regard them 
pli-tv-kd20:5.1.11	as the Teaching, the training, the Teacher’s instruction.” 
pli-tv-kd20:6.1.1	At that time the Monastic Code was not being recited to the nuns. 
pli-tv-kd20:6.1.2	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and said, 
pli-tv-kd20:6.1.3	“The Monastic Code should be recited to the nuns.” 
pli-tv-kd20:6.1.4	The nuns thought, 
pli-tv-kd20:6.1.5	“Who should recite the Monastic Code to the nuns?” 
pli-tv-kd20:6.1.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:6.1.7	“The monks should recite the Monastic Code to the nuns.” 
pli-tv-kd20:6.1.8	Soon afterwards the monks went to the nuns’ dwelling place to recite the Monastic Code. 
pli-tv-kd20:6.1.9	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd20:6.1.10	“They are their wives! They are their mistresses! Now they are going to enjoy themselves together.” 
pli-tv-kd20:6.1.11	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:6.1.12	“Monks, you should not recite the Monastic Code to the nuns. 
pli-tv-kd20:6.1.13	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:6.1.14	The nuns should recite the Monastic Code to the nuns.” 
pli-tv-kd20:6.1.15	The nuns did not know 
pli-tv-kd20:6.1.16	how to recite it. 
pli-tv-kd20:6.1.17	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:6.1.18	“The monks should tell the nuns 
pli-tv-kd20:6.1.19	how to recite the Monastic Code.” 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.1	At that time the nuns did not make amends for their offenses. 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.3	“A nun should make amends for her offenses. 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.4	If she doesn’t, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.5	The nuns did not know 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.6	how to make amends. 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.7	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.8	“The monks should tell the nuns 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.9	how to make amends for an offense.” 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.10	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.11	“Who should receive confessions from the nuns?” 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.12	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.13	“The monks should receive the confession of offenses from the nuns.” 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.14	Soon afterwards, when the nuns saw a monk on a street, in a cul-de-sac, or at an intersection, they would put down their bowl, put their upper robe over one shoulder, squat on their heels, raise their joined palms, and make amends for their offenses. 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.15	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.16	“They are their wives! They are their mistresses! Having offended them at night, they now ask for forgiveness.” 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.17	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.18	“Monks, you should not receive confessions from the nuns. 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.19	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.20	The nuns should receive the confession of offenses from the nuns.” 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.21	The nuns did not know 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.22	how to receive confessions. 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.23	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.24	“The monks should tell the nuns 
pli-tv-kd20:6.2.25	how to receive offenses.” 
pli-tv-kd20:6.3.1	At that time the nuns’ legal procedures were not being done. 
pli-tv-kd20:6.3.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:6.3.3	“Monks, I allow the doing of legal procedures for the nuns.” 
pli-tv-kd20:6.3.4	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd20:6.3.5	“Who should do the nuns’ procedures?” 
pli-tv-kd20:6.3.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:6.3.7	“The monks should do the nuns’ procedures.” 
pli-tv-kd20:6.3.8	Soon afterwards, when nuns who had had a legal procedure done against them saw a monk on a street, in a cul-de-sac, or at an intersection, they would put down their bowl, put their upper robe over one shoulder, squat on their heels, raise their joined palms, and ask for forgiveness, thinking, “This is the way to do it.” 
pli-tv-kd20:6.3.9	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd20:6.3.10	“They are their wives! They are their mistresses! Having offended them at night, they now ask for forgiveness.” 
pli-tv-kd20:6.3.11	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:6.3.12	“Monks, you should not do the nuns’ legal procedures. 
pli-tv-kd20:6.3.13	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:6.3.14	The nuns should do the nuns’ legal procedures.” 
pli-tv-kd20:6.3.15	The nuns did not know 
pli-tv-kd20:6.3.16	how to do procedures. 
pli-tv-kd20:6.3.17	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:6.3.18	“The monks should tell the nuns 
pli-tv-kd20:6.3.19	how to do legal procedures.” 
pli-tv-kd20:7.1.1	On one occasion the nuns were arguing and disputing in the midst of the Sangha, attacking one another verbally, 
pli-tv-kd20:7.1.2	and they were not able to resolve that legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd20:7.1.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:7.1.4	“I allow the monks to resolve the nuns’ legal issues.” 
pli-tv-kd20:7.1.5	Soon afterwards the monks were resolving a legal issue for the nuns. 
pli-tv-kd20:7.1.6	While they were deliberating on the issue, there were nuns who needed a legal procedure to be done and who were guilty of an offense 
pli-tv-kd20:7.1.7	The nuns said, 
pli-tv-kd20:7.1.8	“It would be good, Venerables, if you would do the procedure for the nuns and receive their confession of offenses, 
pli-tv-kd20:7.1.9	for the Buddha has laid down that the nuns’ legal issues should be resolved by the monks.” 
pli-tv-kd20:7.1.10	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:7.1.11	“Monks, I allow you to determine the nature of the nuns’ legal procedure, before handing over to the nuns for them to do it. 
pli-tv-kd20:7.1.12	And I allow you to charge a nun with an offense, before handing over to the nuns for them to receive the confession.” 
pli-tv-kd20:8.1.1	At that time a nun who was a pupil of the nun Uppalavaṇṇā had followed the Buddha around for seven years to learn the Monastic Law. 
pli-tv-kd20:8.1.2	But because of her absentmindedness, she repeatedly forgot what she had learned. 
pli-tv-kd20:8.1.3	When she heard 
pli-tv-kd20:8.1.4	that the Buddha wanted to go to Sāvatthī, 
pli-tv-kd20:8.1.5	she reflected 
pli-tv-kd20:8.1.7	on her absentmindedness and thought, 
pli-tv-kd20:8.1.8	“It’s hard for a woman to follow the Teacher around all her life. 
pli-tv-kd20:8.1.9	So what should I do?” 
pli-tv-kd20:8.1.10	She told the nuns what she had thought, 
pli-tv-kd20:8.1.11	who in turn told the monks, 
pli-tv-kd20:8.1.12	who then told the Buddha. The Buddha said, 
pli-tv-kd20:8.1.13	“I allow the monks to teach the Monastic Law to the nuns.” 
pli-tv-kd20:8.1.14	The first section for recitation is finished. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Vesālī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.3	he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.4	At that time the monks from the group of six tried to attract the nuns by splashing them with muddy water. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.7	“Monks, you should not splash the nuns with muddy water. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.8	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.9	I allow the nuns to penalize a monk who acts like this.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.10	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.11	“What sort of penalty should they impose?” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.12	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.13	“The Sangha of nuns should not pay respect to such a monk.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.14	Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six tried to attract the nuns by exposing their bodies to them, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.15	by exposing their thighs to them, and by exposing their genitals to them. And they spoke indecently to the nuns and associated inappropriately with them. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.17	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.18	“Monks, you should not expose your body to the nuns; you should not expose your thighs to the nuns; you should not expose your genitals to the nuns; you should not speak indecently to the nuns; and you should not associate inappropriately with the nuns. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.19	If you associate inappropriately with the nuns, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.20	I allow the nuns to penalize a monk who acts like this.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.21	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.22	“What sort of penalty can they impose?” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.23	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.1.24	“The Sangha of nuns should not pay respect to such a monk.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.1	Soon afterwards the nuns from the group of six tried to attract a monk by splashing him with muddy water. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.4	“A nun should not splash a monk with muddy water. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.5	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.6	I allow you to penalize such a nun.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.7	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.8	“What sort of penalty can we impose?” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.9	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.10	“I allow you to place restrictions on her.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.11	She did not adhere to the restrictions. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.12	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.13	“I allow you cancel the half-monthly instruction.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.14	At that time the nuns from the group of six tried to attract the monks by exposing their bodies to them, by exposing their breasts to them, by exposing their thighs to them, and by exposing their genitals to them. And they spoke indecently to the monks and associated inappropriately with them. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.16	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.17	“A nun should not expose her body to the monks; 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.18	she should not expose her breasts to the monks; she should not expose her thighs to the monks; she should not expose her genitals to the monks; she should not speak indecently to the monks; and she should not associate inappropriately with the monks. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.19	If she associates inappropriately with the monks, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.20	I allow the monks to penalize such a nun.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.21	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.22	“What sort of penalty can we impose?” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.23	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.24	“I allow you to place restrictions on her.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.25	She did not adhere to the restrictions. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.26	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.2.27	“I allow you cancel the half-monthly instruction.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.1	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.2	“Is it allowable or not to do the observance-day procedure with a nun whose half-monthly instruction has been canceled?” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.4	“Until that legal issue has been settled it’s not allowable to do the observance-day procedure with a nun whose half-monthly instruction has been canceled.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.5	On one occasion Venerable Udāyī canceled the half-monthly instruction and then set out wandering. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.6	The nuns complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.7	“How could Venerable Udāyī do this?” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.8	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.9	“Monks, you should not cancel the half-monthly instruction and then set out wandering. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.10	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.11	At that time even the monks who were ignorant and incompetent canceled the half-monthly instruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.12	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.13	“A monk who is ignorant and incompetent should not cancel the half-monthly instruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.14	If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.15	At that time the monks canceled the half-monthly instruction without reason. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.16	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.17	“A monk should not cancel the half-monthly instruction without reason. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.18	If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.19	At that time the monks did not deliberate after canceling the half-monthly instruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.20	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.21	“You should deliberate after canceling the half-monthly instruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.3.22	If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.1	At that time the nuns did not go to the half-monthly instruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.3	“A nun should go to the half-monthly instruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.4	If she doesn’t, she should be dealt with according to the rule. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.5	At that time the entire Sangha of nuns went to the half-monthly instruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.6	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.7	“They are their wives! They are their mistresses! Now they are going to enjoy themselves together.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.8	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.9	“The whole sangha of nuns should not go to the half-monthly instruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.10	If it does, there is an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.11	Four or five nuns should go to the instruction.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.12	Soon afterwards four or five nuns went to the half-monthly instruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.13	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.14	“They are their wives! They are their mistresses! Now they are going to enjoy themselves together.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.15	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.16	“Four or five nuns should not go to the half-monthly instruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.17	If they do, there is an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.18	Two or three nuns should go to the instruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.19	They should go to a monk, put their upper robe over one shoulder, bow down at his feet, squat on their heels, raise their joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.20	‘Venerable, the Sangha of nuns bows down at the feet of the Sangha of monks and asks to come for the half-monthly instruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.21	Please allow the Sangha of nuns to come for the instruction.’ 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.22	That monk should go to the reciter of the Monastic Code and tell him 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.23	of the nuns’ request. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.25	The reciter should say, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.26	‘Is there anyone who has been appointed as instructor of the nuns?’ 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.27	If there is, the reciter should say, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.28	‘Monk so-and-so has been appointed. The Sangha of nuns should approach him.’ 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.29	If there isn’t, the reciter should say, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.30	‘Who is able to instruct the nuns?’ 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.31	If there is someone who is able and who has the eight required qualities, he should be appointed. The reciter should then say, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.32	‘Monk so-and-so has been appointed. The Sangha of nuns should approach him.’ 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.33	If no one is able to instruct the nuns, the reciter of the Monastic Code should say, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.4.34	‘No monk has been appointed as instructor of the nuns. The Sangha of nuns should carry on with serenity.’” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.1	On one occasion the monks did not agree to give the half-monthly instruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.3	“You should agree to give the half-monthly instruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.4	If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.5	On one occasion the nuns went to a monk who was ignorant 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.6	and said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.7	“Venerable, please agree to give the half-monthly instruction.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.8	“But I’m ignorant, sisters. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.9	How can I agree to give the instruction?” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.10	“Please agree to give the instruction, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.11	for the Buddha has laid down 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.12	that a monk should agree to give the instruction to the nuns.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.13	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.14	“Except if you are ignorant, you should agree to give the half-monthly instruction.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.15	On one occasion the nuns went to a monk who was sick 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.16	and said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.17	“Venerable, please agree to give the half-monthly instruction.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.18	“But I’m sick, sisters. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.19	How can I agree to give the instruction?” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.20	“Please agree to give the instruction, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.21	for the Buddha has laid down 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.22	that a monk should agree to give the instruction to the nuns, except if he is ignorant.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.23	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.24	“Except if you are ignorant or sick, you should agree to give the half-monthly instruction.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.25	On one occasion the nuns went to a monk who was about to depart 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.26	and said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.27	“Venerable, please agree to give the half-monthly instruction.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.28	“But I’m about to depart, sisters. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.29	How can I agree to give the instruction?” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.30	“Please agree to give the instruction, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.31	for the Buddha has laid down 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.32	that a monk should agree to give the instruction to the nuns, except if he is ignorant or sick.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.33	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.34	“Except if you are ignorant, sick, or about to depart, you should agree to give the half-monthly instruction.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.35	On one occasion the nuns went to a monk who was staying in the wilderness 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.36	and said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.37	“Venerable, please agree to give the half-monthly instruction.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.38	“But I’m staying in the wilderness, sisters. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.39	How can I agree to give the instruction?” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.40	“Please agree to give the instruction,

pli-tv-kd20:9.5.42	that a monk should agree to give the instruction to the nuns, except if he is ignorant, sick, or about to depart.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.43	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.44	“If you are staying in the wilderness, you should agree to give the half-monthly instruction. You should make an appointment, saying, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.45	‘I’ll return here.’” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.46	At that time the monks agreed to give the half-monthly instruction without telling the reciter of the Monastic Code. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.47	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.48	“When you have agreed to give the half-monthly instruction, you should inform the reciter of the Monastic Code. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.49	If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.50	At that time the monks who had agreed to give the half-monthly instruction did not return to give it. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.51	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.52	“You should return to give the half-monthly instruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.53	If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.54	On one occasion the nuns did not go to the appointment. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.55	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.56	“A nun should go to the appointment. 
pli-tv-kd20:9.5.57	If she doesn’t, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.1	The nuns wore long belts that they fixed into ribs. 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.2	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.3	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.4	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.5	“A nun should not wear a long belt. 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.6	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.7	I allow a nun to wear a belt that goes once around the body, and she should not fix it into ribs. 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.8	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.9	The nuns fixed strips of split bamboo into ribs, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.10	strips of leather into ribs, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.11	strips of fabric into ribs, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.12	interlaced fabric into ribs, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.13	rolled-up fabric into ribs, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.14	strips of cloth into ribs, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.15	interlaced cloth into ribs, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.16	rolled-up cloth into ribs, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.17	interlaced strings into ribs, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.18	and rolled-up strings into ribs. 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.19	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.20	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.21	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.22	“A nun should not fix strips of split bamboo, strips of leather, strips of fabric, interlaced fabric, rolled-up fabric, strips of cloth, interlaced cloth, rolled-up cloth, interlaced strings, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.23	or rolled-up strings into ribs. 
pli-tv-kd20:10.1.24	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:10.2.1	The nuns had their loins rubbed with bones, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.2.2	their loins tapped with a cow’s jaw bone, their palms tapped, the back of their hands tapped, the soles of their feet tapped, the top of their feet tapped, their thighs tapped, their faces tapped, and their gums tapped with a cow’s jaw bone. 
pli-tv-kd20:10.2.3	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.2.4	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd20:10.2.5	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.2.6	“A nun should not have her loins rubbed with bones, her loins tapped with a cow’s jaw bone, her palms tapped, the back of her hands tapped, the soles of her feet tapped, the top of her feet tapped, her thighs tapped, her face tapped, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.2.7	or her gums tapped with a cow’s jaw bone. 
pli-tv-kd20:10.2.8	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:10.3.1	The nuns from the group of six used facial ointments, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.3.2	applied creams, powdered their face, applied rouge to their face, wore cosmetics on their body, wore cosmetics on their face, and wore cosmetics on their body and face. 
pli-tv-kd20:10.3.3	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.3.4	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd20:10.3.5	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.3.6	“A nun should not use facial ointments, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.3.7	apply creams, powder her face, apply rouge to her face, wear cosmetics on her body, wear cosmetics on her face, or wear cosmetics on her body and face. 
pli-tv-kd20:10.3.8	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:10.4.1	The nuns from the group of six made up their eyes, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.4.2	painted dots on their forehead, stared out the windows, exposed themselves to view, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.4.3	organized dancing, organized prostitutes, set up bars, set up slaughterhouses, set up shops, made loans, engaged in trade, were attended on by slaves, were attended on by servants, were attended on by animals, traded in raw and cooked greens, and wore felt. 
pli-tv-kd20:10.4.4	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.4.5	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd20:10.4.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.4.7	“A nun should not make up her eyes, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.4.8	paint dots on her forehead, stare out the windows, expose herself to view, organize dancing, organize prostitutes, set up bars, set up slaughterhouses, set up shops, make loans, engage in trade, be attended on by slaves, be attended on by servants, be attended on by animals, trade in raw and cooked greens, or wear felt. 
pli-tv-kd20:10.4.9	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:10.5.1	The nuns from the group of six wore entirely blue robes, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.5.2	entirely yellow robes, entirely red robes, entirely magenta robes, entirely black robes, entirely orange robes, entirely beige robes, robes with borders made from a single piece of cloth, robes with long borders, robes with floral borders, robes with borders decorated with snakes’ hoods, close-fitting jackets, and lodh tree robes. 
pli-tv-kd20:10.5.3	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.5.4	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd20:10.5.5	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.5.6	“A nun should not wear entirely blue robes, entirely yellow robes, entirely red robes, entirely magenta robes, entirely black robes, entirely orange robes, entirely beige robes, robes with borders made from a single piece of cloth, robes with long borders, robes with floral borders, robes with borders decorated with fruit designs, close-fitting jackets, 
pli-tv-kd20:10.5.7	or lodh tree robes. 
pli-tv-kd20:10.5.8	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:11.1.1	On one occasion a nun who was dying said, 
pli-tv-kd20:11.1.2	“When I’m dead, give my requisites to the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-kd20:11.1.3	The monks and the nuns argued with one another, saying 
pli-tv-kd20:11.1.4	it belonged to their Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd20:11.1.5	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:11.1.6	“If a dying nun, 
pli-tv-kd20:11.1.8	a dying trainee nun, 
pli-tv-kd20:11.1.9	or a dying novice nun says, 
pli-tv-kd20:11.1.10	‘When I’m dead, give my requisites to the Sangha,’ then they are for the Sangha of nuns, not for the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd20:11.1.11	But if a dying monk, 
pli-tv-kd20:11.1.13	a dying novice monk, 
pli-tv-kd20:11.1.14	a dying male lay follower, 
pli-tv-kd20:11.1.15	a dying female lay follower, 
pli-tv-kd20:11.1.16	or anyone else who is dying says, 
pli-tv-kd20:11.1.17	‘When I’m dead, give my requisites to the Sangha,’ then they are for the Sangha of monks, not for the Sangha of nuns.” 
pli-tv-kd20:12.1.1	At one time a woman who had been a wrestler went forth as a nun. 
pli-tv-kd20:12.1.2	Seeing a weak monk on a street, she struck him with her shoulder. He fell over. 
pli-tv-kd20:12.1.3	The monks complained and criticized her, 
pli-tv-kd20:12.1.4	“How can a nun hit a monk?” 
pli-tv-kd20:12.1.5	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:12.1.6	“A nun should not hit a monk. 
pli-tv-kd20:12.1.7	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:12.1.8	When a nun sees a monk coming, she should make way for him by stepping off the path.” 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.1	At one time a certain woman became pregnant by a lover while her husband was away. 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.2	After having an abortion, she said to the nun who was associating with her family, 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.3	“Venerable, please take this fetus away in your almsbowl.” 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.4	The nun did as asked, hid her bowl under her upper robe, and left. 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.5	At that time a certain alms-collecting monk had resolved 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.6	not to eat without giving the first almsfood he got to another monk or nun. 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.7	He saw that nun and said, 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.8	“Sister, please accept some almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.9	“There is no need, Venerable.” 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.10	He repeated his request a second 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.11	and a third time, 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.12	“Sister, please accept some almsfood”, 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.13	but received the same reply. 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.14	He then told her about 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.15	his resolution 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.16	and again requested her to accept some almsfood. 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.17	Being pressured by that monk, the nun brought out her bowl and showed it to him, saying, 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.18	“See, there is a fetus in my bowl. 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.19	Please don’t tell anyone.” 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.20	But he complained and criticized her, 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.21	“How can a nun take a fetus away in her bowl?” 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.22	And he told the monks. 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.23	The monks of few desires complained and criticized her, 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.24	“How can a nun take a fetus away in her bowl?” 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.25	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.26	“A nun should not take a fetus away in her bowl. 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.27	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:13.1.28	When a nun sees a monk, she should bring out her almsbowl and show it to him.” 
pli-tv-kd20:13.2.1	Soon afterwards, when they saw a monk, the nuns from the group of six turned their bowls upside down and showed him the bottom. 
pli-tv-kd20:13.2.2	The monks complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd20:13.2.3	“How can the nuns from the group of six do this?” 
pli-tv-kd20:13.2.4	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:13.2.5	“When she sees a monk, a nun should not turn her almsbowl upside down and show him the bottom. 
pli-tv-kd20:13.2.6	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:13.2.7	When a nun sees a monk, she should turn her bowl upright and then show it to him. 
pli-tv-kd20:13.2.8	And she should offer whatever food is in her bowl to that monk.” 
pli-tv-kd20:14.1.1	On one occasion a penis had been thrown out on a street in Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd20:14.1.2	The nuns stared at it. 
pli-tv-kd20:14.1.3	People jeered at them 
pli-tv-kd20:14.1.4	and the nuns felt humiliated. 
pli-tv-kd20:14.1.5	When they had returned to the nuns’ dwelling place, they told the nuns what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd20:14.1.6	The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd20:14.1.7	“How can the nuns stare at a penis?” 
pli-tv-kd20:14.1.8	They told the monks, 
pli-tv-kd20:14.1.9	who in turn told the Buddha. He said, 
pli-tv-kd20:14.1.10	“A nun should not stare at a penis. 
pli-tv-kd20:14.1.11	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:15.1.1	On one occasion people gave requisites to the monks 
pli-tv-kd20:15.1.2	and the monks gave them to the nuns. 
pli-tv-kd20:15.1.3	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd20:15.1.4	“How can the venerables give away to others what has been given to them for their own use? 
pli-tv-kd20:15.1.5	Do we not know how to give?” 
pli-tv-kd20:15.1.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:15.1.7	“Monks, you should not give away to others what has been given to you for your own use. 
pli-tv-kd20:15.1.8	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:15.1.9	On one occasion the monks had an abundance of requisites. 
pli-tv-kd20:15.1.10	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:15.1.11	“I allow you to give to a sangha.” 
pli-tv-kd20:15.1.12	The abundance became even greater. 
pli-tv-kd20:15.1.13	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:15.1.14	“I allow individuals to give away what belongs to them.” 
pli-tv-kd20:15.1.15	On one occasion the monks had an abundance of requisites stored up. 
pli-tv-kd20:15.1.16	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:15.1.17	“I allow what is stored by the monks to be received by the nuns and then used by them.” 
pli-tv-kd20:15.2.1	On one occasion people gave requisites to the nuns 
pli-tv-kd20:15.2.2	and the nuns gave them to the monks. 
pli-tv-kd20:15.2.3	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd20:15.2.4	“How can the nuns give away to others what has been given to them for their own use? 
pli-tv-kd20:15.2.5	Do we not know how to give?” 
pli-tv-kd20:15.2.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:15.2.7	“A nun should not give away to others what has been given to her for her own use. 
pli-tv-kd20:15.2.8	If she does, scommits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:15.2.9	On one occasion the nuns had an abundance of requisites. 
pli-tv-kd20:15.2.10	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:15.2.11	“I allow a nun to give to the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-kd20:15.2.12	The abundance became even greater. 
pli-tv-kd20:15.2.13	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:15.2.14	“I allow individuals to give away what belongs to them.” 
pli-tv-kd20:15.2.15	On one occasion the nuns had an abundance of requisites stored up. 
pli-tv-kd20:15.2.16	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:15.2.17	“I allow what is stored by the nuns to be received by the monks and then used by them.” 
pli-tv-kd20:16.1.1	On one occasion the monks had an abundance of dwellings, but the nuns were lacking. 
pli-tv-kd20:16.1.2	The nuns sent a message to the monks, saying, 
pli-tv-kd20:16.1.3	“It would be good, Venerables, if you would lend us some dwellings.” 
pli-tv-kd20:16.1.4	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:16.1.5	“I allow you to lend dwellings to the nuns.” 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.1	Menstruating nuns sat down and lay down on upholstered beds and benches. 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.2	The furniture was stained with blood. 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.4	“A nun should not sit down or lay down on upholstered beds or benches. 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.5	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.6	I allow a monastery robe.” 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.7	The monastery robe became stained with blood. 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.8	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.9	“I allow a menstruation pad .” 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.10	The pad fell off. 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.11	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.12	“I allow the nuns to attach a string and then bind it to the thigh.” 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.13	The string snapped. 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.14	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.15	“I allow a loin cloth and a girdle.” 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.16	Soon afterwards the nuns from the group of six wore girdles all the time. 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.17	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.18	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.19	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.20	“A nun should not wear a girdle all the time. 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.21	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.22	I allow a nun to wear a girdle while she is menstruating.” 
pli-tv-kd20:16.2.23	The second section for recitation is finished. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.1.1	At that time the full ordination had been given to 
pli-tv-kd20:17.1.2	women who lacked genitals, who had incomplete genitals, who did not menstruate, who menstruated continuously, who always wore menstruation pads, who were incontinent, who had genital prolapse, who lacked sexual organs, who were manlike, who had fistula, who were hermaphrodites. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.1.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:17.1.4	“The nun who is giving the full ordination should ask about the twenty-four impediments. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.1.5	And it should be done like this: 
pli-tv-kd20:17.1.6	ʻDo you lack genitals? Are your genitals incomplete? Are you without menstruation? Do you menstruate continuously? Do you always wear a menstruation pad? Are you incontinent? Do you have genital prolapse? Do you lack sexual organs? Are you manlike? Do you have fistula? Are you a hermaphrodite? 
pli-tv-kd20:17.1.7	Do you have any of these diseases: 
pli-tv-kd20:17.1.8	leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, or epilepsy? 
pli-tv-kd20:17.1.9	Are you human? Are you a woman? Are you a free woman? Are you free from debt? Are you employed by the King? 
pli-tv-kd20:17.1.10	Do you have permission from your parents and husband? 
pli-tv-kd20:17.1.11	Are you twenty years old? Do you have a full set of bowl and robes? What is your name? What is the name of your mentor?’” 
pli-tv-kd20:17.2.1	Soon afterwards the monks asked the nuns about the impediments. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.2.2	Those seeking the full ordination were embarrassed, humiliated, and unable to respond. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.2.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:17.2.4	“Only when a woman who is free from impediments has been fully ordained on one side in the Sangha of nuns, should you give her the full ordination in the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd20:17.2.5	The nuns asked those seeking the full ordination about the impediments without first instructing them. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.2.6	They were embarrassed, humiliated, and unable to respond. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.2.7	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:17.2.8	“The nuns should instruct first and then ask about the impediments.” 
pli-tv-kd20:17.2.9	They instructed them right there in the midst of the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.2.10	Once again those seeking the full ordination were embarrassed, humiliated, and unable to respond. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.2.11	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:17.2.12	“The nuns should instruct them to one side and then ask about the impediments in the midst of the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.2.13	And it should be done like this. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.2.14	First the candidate should be told to choose a preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.2.15	Her bowl and robes should then be pointed out to her: 
pli-tv-kd20:17.2.16	ʻThis is your bowl, this your outer robe, this your upper robe, this your sarong, this is your chest wrap, and this is your bathing robe. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.2.17	Now please go and stand over there.’” 
pli-tv-kd20:17.3.1	They were instructed by nuns who were ignorant and incompetent. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.3.2	And because they were badly instructed, they were once again embarrassed, humiliated, and unable to respond. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.3.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:17.3.4	“A nun who is ignorant and incompetent should not instruct. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.3.5	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.3.6	A nun who is competent and capable should instruct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:17.4.1	They instructed without having been appointed. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.4.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:17.4.3	“A nun should not instruct if she hasn’t been appointed to do so. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.4.4	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.4.5	I allow a nun to instruct if she’s been appointed to do so. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.4.6	And it should be done like this: 
pli-tv-kd20:17.4.7	either one should be appointed through oneself or one should be appointed through another. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.4.8	And how is one appointed through oneself? 
pli-tv-kd20:17.4.9	A competent and capable nun should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd20:17.4.10	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.4.11	So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.4.12	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will instruct so-and-so.’ 
pli-tv-kd20:17.4.13	In this way one is appointed through oneself. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.4.14	And how is one appointed through another? 
pli-tv-kd20:17.4.15	A competent and capable nun should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd20:17.4.16	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.4.17	So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.4.18	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, so-and-so will instruct so-and-so.’ 
pli-tv-kd20:17.4.19	In this way one is appointed through another. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.1	The appointed nun should go to the one seeking the full ordination and say this: 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.2	ʻListen, so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.3	Now is the time for you to tell the truth. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.4	When asked in the midst of the Sangha about various matters, you should say, “Yes,” if it’s true and, “No,” if it’s not. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.5	Don’t be embarrassed or humiliated. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.6	This is what they will ask you: 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.7	“Do you lack genitals? Are your genitals incomplete? Are you without menstruation? Do you menstruate continuously? Do you always wear a menstruation pad? Are you incontinent? Do you have genital prolapse? Do you lack sexual organs? Are you manlike? Do you have fistula? Are you a hermaphrodite? 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.8	Do you have any of these diseases: 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.9	leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, or epilepsy? 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.10	Are you human? Are you a woman? Are you a free woman? Are you free from debt? Are you employed by the King? 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.11	Do you have permission from your parents and husband? 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.12	Are you twenty years old? Do you have a full set of bowl and robes? What is your name? What is the name of your mentor?”’” 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.13	They then returned to the Sangha together. The Buddha said, 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.14	“They should not return together. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.15	The instructor should return first and inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.16	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.17	So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.18	She’s been instructed by me. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.19	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, so-and-so should come.’ 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.20	And she should be told to come. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.21	She should then put her upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the nuns, squat on her heels, and raise her joined palms. She should then ask for the full ordination: 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.22	‘Venerables, I ask the Sangha for the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.23	May the Sangha lift me up out of compassion. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.24	For the second time, Venerables, I ask the Sangha for the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.25	May the Sangha lift me up out of compassion. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.26	For the third time, Venerables, I ask the Sangha for the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.5.27	May the Sangha lift me up out of compassion.’ 
pli-tv-kd20:17.6.1	A competent and capable nun should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd20:17.6.2	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.6.3	So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.6.4	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will ask so-and-so about the impediments. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.6.5	Listen, so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.6.6	Now is the time for you to tell the truth. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.6.7	I will ask you about various matters. If something is true, you should say, “Yes,” and if it’s not, you should say, “No.” 
pli-tv-kd20:17.6.8	So: Do you lack genitals? Are your genitals incomplete? Are you without menstruation? Do you menstruate continuously? Do you always wear a menstruation pad? Are you incontinent? Do you have genital prolapse? Do you lack sexual organs? Are you manlike? Do you have fistula? Are you a hermaphrodite? Do you have any of these diseases: leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, or epilepsy? Are you human? Are you a woman? Are you a free woman? Are you free from debt? Are you employed by the King? Do you have permission from your parents and husband? Are you twenty years old? Do you have a full set of bowl and robes? 
pli-tv-kd20:17.6.9	What is your name? What is the name of your mentor?’ 
pli-tv-kd20:17.7.1	A competent and capable nun should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd20:17.7.2	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.7.3	So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.7.4	She is free from obstructions and her bowl and robes are complete. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.7.5	So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination with so-and-so as her mentor. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.7.6	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as her mentor. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.7.7	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.7.8	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.7.9	So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.

pli-tv-kd20:17.7.12	The Sangha gives the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as her mentor. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.7.13	Any nun who approves of giving the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as her mentor should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.7.14	Any nun who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.7.15	For the second time I speak on this matter. Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. She is free from obstructions and her bowl and robes are complete. So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination with so-and-so as her preceptor. The Sangha gives the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as her preceptor. Any nun who approves of giving the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as her preceptor should remain silent. Any nun who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.7.16	For the third time I speak on this matter. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.7.17	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.

pli-tv-kd20:17.7.25	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’ 
pli-tv-kd20:17.8.1	“Straightaway she should be taken to the Sangha of monks. She should put her upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the monks, squat on her heels, and raise her joined palms. She should then ask for ordination: 
pli-tv-kd20:17.8.2	‘Venerables, I’m seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.

pli-tv-kd20:17.8.38	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd20:17.8.39	Straightaway the time should be noted and the date should be pointed out. These should be declared jointly to everyone. 
pli-tv-kd20:17.8.40	The nuns should be told to point out the three supports and the eight things not to be done to the newly ordained nun. 
pli-tv-kd20:18.1.1	On one occasion the right time for eating passed while the nuns were trying to find the right seats in the dining hall. 
pli-tv-kd20:18.1.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:18.1.3	“I allow eight nuns to be seated according to seniority, but the rest according to their time of arrival.” 
pli-tv-kd20:18.1.4	When they knew about 
pli-tv-kd20:18.1.5	the Buddha’s allowance, 
pli-tv-kd20:18.1.6	eight nuns reserved places everywhere according to seniority, the rest getting places according to their time of arrival. 
pli-tv-kd20:18.1.7	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:18.1.8	“I allow eight nuns to be seated in the dining hall according to seniority and the rest according to their time of arrival, 
pli-tv-kd20:18.1.9	but not anywhere else. 
pli-tv-kd20:18.1.10	If a nun makes a reservation anywhere apart from the dining hall, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:19.1.1	At that time the nuns did not do the invitation procedure. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.1.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:19.1.3	“A nun should do the invitation procedure. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.1.4	If she doesn’t, she should be dealt with according to the rule.” 
pli-tv-kd20:19.1.5	At that time the nuns did the invitation procedure among themselves, but not with the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.1.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:19.1.7	“After doing the invitation procedure among the nuns, a nun should do the invitation procedure with the monks. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.1.8	If she doesn’t, she should be dealt with according to the rule.” 
pli-tv-kd20:19.1.9	All the nuns together did the invitation procedure with monks. They made a racket. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.1.10	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:19.1.11	“The nuns should not do the invitation procedure all together. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.1.12	Any nun who does commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:19.1.13	On one occasion when the nuns did the invitation procedure before the meal, they did not finish until after the time for eating. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.1.14	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:19.1.15	“I allow the nuns to do the invitation procedure after the meal.” 
pli-tv-kd20:19.1.16	Doing the invitation procedure after the meal, they did not finish until it was too late to eat. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.1.17	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:19.1.18	“I allow the nuns to do the invitation procedure among themselves on one day and with the monks on the following day.” 
pli-tv-kd20:19.2.1	At that time the whole Sangha of nuns did the invitation procedure. They made a racket. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.2.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:19.2.3	“I allow the nuns to appoint one capable and competent nun 
pli-tv-kd20:19.2.4	to do the invitation procedure with the Sangha of monks on behalf of the Sangha of nuns. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.2.5	She should be appointed like this. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.2.6	First a nun should be asked, and then a competent and capable nun should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd20:19.2.7	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.2.8	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint nun so-and-so to do the invitation procedure with the Sangha of monks on behalf of the Sangha of nuns. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.2.9	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.2.10	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.2.11	The Sangha appoints nun so-and-so to do the invitation procedure with the Sangha of monks on behalf of the Sangha of nuns. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.2.12	Any nun who approves of appointing nun so-and-so to do the invitation procedure with the Sangha of monks on behalf of the Sangha of nuns should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.2.13	Any nun who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.2.14	The Sangha has appointed nun so-and-so to do the invitation procedure with the Sangha of monks on behalf of the Sangha of nuns. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.2.15	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd20:19.3.1	The appointed nun should take the Sangha of nuns to the Sangha of monks. She should then put her upper robe over one shoulder, squat on her heels, raise her joined palms, and say: 
pli-tv-kd20:19.3.2	ʻVenerables, the Sangha of nuns invites the Sangha of monks to correct it concerning 
pli-tv-kd20:19.3.3	what you have seen, what you have heard, or what you suspect. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.3.4	Please correct the Sangha of nuns, Venerables, out of compassion. If the Sangha of nuns sees a fault, it will make amends. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.3.5	For the second time the Sangha of nuns invites the Sangha of monks to correct it concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, or what you suspect. Please correct the Sangha of nuns, Venerables, out of compassion. If the Sangha of nuns sees a fault, it will make amends. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.3.6	For the third time the Sangha of nuns invites the Sangha of monks to correct it concerning 
pli-tv-kd20:19.3.7	what you have seen, what you have heard, or what you suspect. 
pli-tv-kd20:19.3.8	Please correct the Sangha of nuns, Venerables, out of compassion. If the Sangha of nuns sees a fault, it will make amends.’” 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.1	At that time the nuns canceled the monks’ observance-day procedure and their invitation procedure; they spoke to them to initiate a legal process against them; they made accusations against them, asked them for permission to accuse them of offenses, accused them of offenses, and reminded them of offenses. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.3	“A nun should not cancel the observance-day procedure of a monk. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.4	If she does cancel it, it’s not actually canceled, 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.5	and she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.6	A nun should not cancel the invitation procedure of a monk. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.7	If she does cancel it, it’s not actually canceled, 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.8	and she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.9	A nun should not speak to a monk to initiate a legal process against him. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.10	If she does, it’s not actually done, 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.11	and she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.12	A nun should not make accusations against a monk. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.13	If she does, it’s not actually done, 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.14	and she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.15	A nun should not ask a monk for permission to accuse him of an offense. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.16	If she does, it’s not actually done, 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.17	and she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.18	A nun should not accuse a monk of an offense. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.19	If she does, it’s not actually done, 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.20	and she commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.21	A nun should not remind a monk of an offense. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.22	If she does, it’s not actually done, 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.23	and she commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.24	At that time the monks canceled the nuns’ observance-day procedure and their invitation procedure; they spoke to them to initiate a legal process against them; they made accusations against them, asked them for permission to accuse them of offenses, accused them of offenses, and reminded them of offenses. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.25	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.26	“A monk may cancel the observance-day procedure of a nun. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.27	If he cancels it, it is properly canceled, 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.28	and there is no offense for him. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.29	A monk may cancel the invitation procedure of a nun. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.30	If he cancels it, it is properly canceled, 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.31	and there is no offense for him. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.32	A monk may speak to a nun to initiate a legal process against her. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.33	If he does, it is properly done, 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.34	and there is no offense for him. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.35	A monk may make accusations against a nun. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.36	If he does, it is properly done, 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.37	and there is no offense for him. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.38	A monk may ask a nun for permission to accuse her of an offense. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.39	If he does, it is properly done, 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.40	and there is no offense for him. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.41	A monk may accuse a nun of an offense. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.42	If he does, it is properly done, 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.43	and there is no offense for him. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.44	A monk may remind a nun of an offense. 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.45	If he does, it is properly done, 
pli-tv-kd20:20.1.46	and there is no offense for him.” 
pli-tv-kd20:21.1.1	At that time the nuns from the group of six traveled in vehicles, 
pli-tv-kd20:21.1.2	sometimes pulled by women with men inside, at other times pulled by men with women inside. 
pli-tv-kd20:21.1.3	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd20:21.1.4	“It’s as if they’re at the Ganges festival.” 
pli-tv-kd20:21.1.5	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:21.1.6	“A nun should not travel in a vehicle. 
pli-tv-kd20:21.1.7	If she does, she should be dealt with according to the rule.” 
pli-tv-kd20:21.1.8	Soon afterwards there was a sick nun who was not able to go on foot. 
pli-tv-kd20:21.1.9	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:21.1.10	“I allow a vehicle for one who is sick.” 
pli-tv-kd20:21.1.11	The nuns thought, 
pli-tv-kd20:21.1.12	“A vehicle pulled by women or by men?” 
pli-tv-kd20:21.1.13	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:21.1.14	“I allow a rickshaw pulled either by men or by women.” 
pli-tv-kd20:21.1.15	Soon afterwards a certain nun was even more uncomfortable when jolted around in a vehicle. 
pli-tv-kd20:21.1.16	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:21.1.17	“I allow a palanquin and a litter.” 
pli-tv-kd20:22.1.1	At that time the courtesan Aḍḍhakāsī had gone forth with the nuns. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.1.2	She wanted to go to Sāvatthī 
pli-tv-kd20:22.1.3	to get the full ordination in the presence of the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.1.4	Some scoundrels heard 
pli-tv-kd20:22.1.5	about this 
pli-tv-kd20:22.1.6	and they infested the road. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.1.7	When Aḍḍhakāsī heard 
pli-tv-kd20:22.1.8	that scoundrels had infested the road, 
pli-tv-kd20:22.1.9	she sent a message to the Buddha, saying, 
pli-tv-kd20:22.1.10	“I want the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.1.11	What should I do?” 
pli-tv-kd20:22.1.12	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd20:22.1.13	“I allow you to give the full ordination also by messenger.” 
pli-tv-kd20:22.2.1	They ordained with a monk as messenger. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.2.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:22.2.3	“You should not give the full ordination with a monk as messenger. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.2.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:22.2.5	They ordained with a trainee nun as messenger … 
pli-tv-kd20:22.2.6	They ordained with a novice monk as messenger … 
pli-tv-kd20:22.2.7	They ordained with a novice nun as messenger … 
pli-tv-kd20:22.2.8	They ordained with an ignorant and incompetent nun as messenger. The Buddha said, 
pli-tv-kd20:22.2.9	“You should not give the full ordination with an ignorant and incompetent nun as messenger. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.2.10	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.2.11	You should give the full ordination with a capable and competent nun as messenger. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.1	That messenger nun should go to the Sangha, put her upper robe over one shoulder, bow down at the feet of the monks, squat on her heels, raise her joined palms, and say: 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.2	‘Venerables, so-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.3	She is free from impediments and has been fully ordained on one side in the Sangha of nuns. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.4	She hasn’t come because of an obstruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.5	She asks the Sangha for the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.6	May the Sangha lift her up out of compassion. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.7	Venerables, so-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.8	She is free from impediments and has been fully ordained on one side in the Sangha of nuns. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.9	She hasn’t come because of an obstruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.10	For the second time she asks the Sangha for the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.11	May the Sangha lift her up out of compassion. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.12	Venerables, so-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.13	She is free from impediments and has been fully ordained on one side in the Sangha of nuns. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.14	She hasn’t come because of an obstruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.15	For the third time she asks the Sangha for the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.16	May the Sangha lift her up out of compassion.’ 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.17	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.18	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.19	So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.20	She is free from impediments and has been fully ordained on one side in the Sangha of nuns. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.21	She hasn’t come because of an obstruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.22	So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination with so-and-so as her mentor. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.23	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give her the full ordination with so-and-so as her mentor. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.24	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.25	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.26	So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.27	She is free from impediments and has been fully ordained on one side in the Sangha of nuns. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.28	She hasn’t come because of an obstruction. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.29	So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination with so-and-so as her mentor. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.30	The Sangha gives her the full ordination with so-and-so as her mentor. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.31	Any monk who approves of giving so-and-so the full ordination with so-and-so as her mentor should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.32	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.33	For the second time I speak on this matter. Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. She is free from impediments and has been fully ordained on one side in the Sangha of nuns. She hasn’t come because of an obstruction. So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination with so-and-so as her preceptor. The Sangha gives her the full ordination with so-and-so as her preceptor. Any monk who approves of giving so-and-so the full ordination with so-and-so as her preceptor should remain silent. Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.34	For the third time I speak on this matter. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.35	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.36	So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.37	She is free from impediments and has been fully ordained on one side in the Sangha of nuns.

pli-tv-kd20:22.3.39	So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination with so-and-so as her mentor. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.40	The Sangha gives her the full ordination with so-and-so as her mentor. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.41	Any monk who approves of giving so-and-so the full ordination with so-and-so as her mentor should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.42	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.43	The Sangha has given so-and-so the full ordination with so-and-so as her mentor. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.44	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.45	Straightaway the time should be noted and the date should be pointed out. These should be declared jointly to everyone. 
pli-tv-kd20:22.3.46	The nuns should be told to point out the three supports and the eight things not to be done to the newly ordained nun. 
pli-tv-kd20:23.1.1	At that time the nuns were living in the wilderness. 
pli-tv-kd20:23.1.2	Scoundrels raped them. 
pli-tv-kd20:23.1.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:23.1.4	“A nun should not live in the wilderness. 
pli-tv-kd20:23.1.5	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:24.1.1	On one occasion a lay follower gave a storehouse to the Sangha of nuns. 
pli-tv-kd20:24.1.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:24.1.3	“I allow a storehouse.” 
pli-tv-kd20:24.1.4	The storehouse was insufficient. 
pli-tv-kd20:24.1.5	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:24.1.6	“I allow a dwelling place.” 
pli-tv-kd20:24.1.7	The dwelling place was insufficient. 
pli-tv-kd20:24.1.8	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:24.1.9	“I allow building work.” 
pli-tv-kd20:24.1.10	The building work was insufficient. 
pli-tv-kd20:24.1.11	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:24.1.12	“I allow you to build for individuals.” 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.1	At one time a pregnant woman went forth as a nun. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.2	After giving birth, 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.3	she asked the nuns 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.4	what she should do with the baby boy. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.5	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.6	“I allow you to rear him until he becomes self-reliant.” 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.7	That nun thought, 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.8	“I’m not allowed to stay by myself and other nuns are not allowed to stay with a male child. What should I do?” 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.9	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.10	“The nuns should appoint one nun as a companion to that nun. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.11	And she should be appointed like this. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.12	First a nun should be asked, and then a capable and competent nun should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.13	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.14	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint nun so-and-so as a companion to nun so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.15	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.16	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.17	The Sangha appoints nun so-and-so as a companion to nun so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.18	Any nun who approves of appointing nun so-and-so as a companion to nun so-and-so should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.19	Any nun who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.20	The Sangha has appointed nun so-and-so as a companion to nun so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.1.21	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd20:25.2.1	That companion nun thought, 
pli-tv-kd20:25.2.2	“How should I act in regard to this boy?” 
pli-tv-kd20:25.2.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:25.2.4	“Apart from staying in the same dwelling, the companion nun should act toward him as she would toward any other male.” 
pli-tv-kd20:25.3.1	On one occasion a nun who had committed a heavy offense was undertaking the trial period. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.3.2	She thought, 
pli-tv-kd20:25.3.3	“I’m not allowed to stay by myself and other nuns are not allowed to stay with me. What should I do?” 
pli-tv-kd20:25.3.4	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:25.3.5	“You should appoint one nun as a companion to that nun. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.3.6	And she should be appointed like this. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.3.7	First a nun should be asked, and then a capable and competent nun should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd20:25.3.8	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.3.9	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint nun so-and-so as a companion to nun so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.3.10	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.3.11	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.3.12	The Sangha appoints nun so-and-so as a companion to nun so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.3.13	Any nun who approves of appointing nun so-and-so as a companion to nun so-and-so should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.3.14	Any nun who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.3.15	The Sangha has appointed nun so-and-so as a companion to nun so-and-so. 
pli-tv-kd20:25.3.16	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd20:26.1.1	On one occasion a nun verbally renounced the training and disrobed. 
pli-tv-kd20:26.1.2	Later she returned and asked the nuns for the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd20:26.1.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:26.1.4	“A nun can’t verbally renounce the training. 
pli-tv-kd20:26.1.5	When she disrobes, she is no longer a nun.” 
pli-tv-kd20:26.2.1	On one occasion a nun joined another religious community while still wearing her robes. 
pli-tv-kd20:26.2.2	Later she returned and asked the nuns for the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd20:26.2.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:26.2.4	“If a nun goes over to another religious community while still wearing her robes, then if she returns, she should not be given the full ordination again.” 
pli-tv-kd20:27.1.1	At that time the nuns, being afraid of wrongdoing, did not consent to men bowing down to them, or to men shaving their heads, cutting their nails, or treating their sores. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.1.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:27.1.3	“I allow you to consent.” 
pli-tv-kd20:27.2.1	At that time the nuns were sitting cross-legged, enjoying the touch of their heals. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.2.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:27.2.3	“A nun should not sit cross-legged. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.2.4	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:27.2.5	On one occasion there was a sick nun 
pli-tv-kd20:27.2.6	who was not comfortable without sitting cross-legged. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.2.7	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:27.2.8	“I allow a nun to sit semi-cross-legged.” 
pli-tv-kd20:27.3.1	At that time the nuns were defecating in a restroom. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.3.2	And the nuns from the group of six performed abortions there. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.3.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:27.3.4	“A nun should not defecate in a restroom. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.3.5	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.3.6	I allow nuns to defecate in a place that is open underneath but concealed on top.” 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.1	At that time the nuns were bathing with bath powder. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.2	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.3	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.4	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.5	“A nun should not bathe with bath powder. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.6	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.7	I allow bran and clay.” 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.8	At that time the nuns were bathing with scented clay. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.9	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.10	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.11	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.12	“A nun should not bathe with scented clay. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.13	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.14	I allow ordinary clay.” 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.15	On one occasion when the nuns were bathing in a sauna, they made a racket. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.16	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.17	“A nun should not bathe in a sauna. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.18	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.19	On one occasion the nuns were bathing against the stream, consenting to the touch of the current. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.20	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.21	“A nun should not bathe against the stream. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.22	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.23	On one occasion the nuns bathed away from a ford. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.24	Scoundrels raped them. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.25	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.26	“A nun should not bathe away from a ford. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.27	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.28	On one occasion the nuns bathed at a ford for men. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.29	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.30	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.31	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.32	“A nun should not bathe at a ford for men. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.33	If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.34	A nun should bathe at a ford for women.” 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.35	The third section for recitation is finished. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.36	The tenth chapter on nuns is finished. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.37	In this chapter there are one hundred topics. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.189	Mahāgotamī asked, 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.190	And so did Ānanda wisely. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.191	There are four assemblies, 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.192	Gone forth in the instruction of the Conqueror. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.193	For the purpose of seeing the urgency, 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.194	For the purpose of growth in the true Teaching, 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.195	Like medicine for the sick, 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.196	So it was taught by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.197	Thus trained in the true Teaching,
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.198	Women and others too, 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.199	Go to that which is free from death, 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.200	Where there is no sorrow. 
pli-tv-kd20:27.4.201	The chapter on nuns is finished.
pli-tv-kd21:0.1	Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law 
pli-tv-kd21:0.2	The Short Division 
pli-tv-kd21:0.3	The chapter on the group of five hundred 
pli-tv-kd21:0.4	1. The origin account of the communal recitation 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.1	Then Venerable Mahākassapa addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.2	“On one occasion I was traveling from Pāvā to Kusināra with a large sangha of five hundred monks. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.3	And I left the road and sat down at the foot of a tree. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.4	Just then a follower of the Ājīvakas was traveling toward Pāvā on the same road, holding a coral-tree flower that he had picked up in Kusināra. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.5	When I saw him coming, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.6	I asked him, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.7	‘Do you know anything about our Teacher?’ 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.8	‘I do. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.9	Today it’s seven days since the ascetic Gotama attained final extinguishment. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.10	That’s why I carry this coral-tree flower.’ 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.11	Some of the monks there who were not yet free from desire threw up their arms and cried, collapsed on the ground, and rolled back and forth, lamenting, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.12	‘The Buddha, the Accomplished One, has attained final extinguishment too soon; too soon has the eye of the world been put out.’ 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.13	But the monks there who were free from desire bore it patiently with mindfulness and full awareness, saying, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.14	‘All phenomena are impermanent. How could it be any different?’ 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.15	I said, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.16	‘Please stop grieving, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.17	stop lamenting. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.18	Didn’t the Buddha warn us 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.19	that we must be separated from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to us? 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.20	How could that which is born, become, made up, and of a nature to fall apart, not fall apart? 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.21	That’s impossible.’ 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.22	On that occasion a monk called Subhadda, who had gone forth when old, was part of that group. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.23	He said to the monks, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.24	‘Please stop grieving, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.25	stop lamenting. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.26	It’s good that we are freed from that great ascetic. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.27	We were oppressed, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.28	always being told what’s allowable and what isn’t. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.29	Now we can do what we like and not do what we don’t like.’ 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.30	So then, let’s recite the Teaching and the Monastic Law together—
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.31	before what is contrary to the Teaching shines forth and the Teaching is obstructed; 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.32	before what is contrary to the Monastic Law shines forth and the Monastic Law is obstructed; 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.33	before those who speak contrary to the Teaching become strong and those who speak in accordance with it become weak; 
pli-tv-kd21:1.1.34	before those who speak contrary to the Monastic Law become strong and those who speak in accordance with it become weak.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.2.1	“Well then, Venerable, please select the monks.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.2.2	Mahākassapa then selected four hundred and ninety-nine perfected ones. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.2.3	The monks said to him, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.2.4	“There is Venerable Ānanda who, although still a trainee, is incapable of acting out of desire, ill will, confusion, or fear. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.2.5	He’s learned many teachings and much Monastic Law in the presence of the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.2.6	Please invite him as well.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.2.7	And he did. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.3.1	The senior monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.3.2	“Where should we recite the Teaching and the Monastic Law together?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.3.3	And it occurred to them, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.3.4	“Rājagaha has much almsfood and many dwellings. Let’s spend the rainy season at Rājagaha and recite the Teaching and the Monastic Law together there. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.3.5	No other monk should enter the rainy-season residence at Rājagaha.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.4.1	And Venerable Mahākassapa informed the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd21:1.4.2	“Please, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.4.3	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint these five hundred monks 
pli-tv-kd21:1.4.4	to spend the rainy season at Rājagaha and to recite the Teaching and the Monastic Law together there. No other monk should enter the rainy-season residence at Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.4.5	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.4.6	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.4.7	The Sangha appoints these five hundred monks 
pli-tv-kd21:1.4.8	to spend the rainy season at Rājagaha and to recite the Teaching and the Monastic Law together there. No other monk should enter the rainy-season residence at Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.4.9	Any monk who approves 
pli-tv-kd21:1.4.10	of this 
pli-tv-kd21:1.4.11	should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.4.12	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.4.13	The Sangha has appointed these five hundred monks to spend the rainy season at Rājagaha and to recite the Teaching and the Monastic Law together there. No other monk should enter the rainy-season residence at Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.4.14	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.5.1	The senior monks then went to Rājagaha to recite the Teaching and the Monastic Law. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.5.2	They thought, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.5.3	“The Buddha has praised repairing what’s defective and broken. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.5.4	Well then, let’s spend the first month doing repairs, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.5.5	and then gather for the middle month to recite the Teaching and the Monastic Law.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.5.6	They then spent the first month doing repairs. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.6.1	Venerable Ānanda thought, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.6.2	It would not be proper for me to go to the assembly tomorrow if I’m still a trainee.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.6.3	And after spending most of the night with mindfulness directed to the body, early in the morning he bent over to lie down. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.6.4	In the interval between his feet coming off the ground and his head hitting the pillow 
pli-tv-kd21:1.6.5	his mind was freed from the corruptions without grasping. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.6.6	And Venerable Ānanda went to the assembly as a perfected one. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.1	Venerable Mahākassapa informed the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.2	“Please, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.3	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will ask Upāli about the Monastic Law.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.4	Venerable Upāli informed the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.5	“Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.6	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will reply when asked by Venerable Mahākassapa about the Monastic Law.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.7	And Mahākassapa asked Upāli, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.8	“Where was the first offense entailing expulsion laid down?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.9	“At Vesālī.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.10	“Who is it about?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.11	“Sudinna the Kalandian.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.12	“What is it about?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.13	“Sexual intercourse.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.14	Mahākassapa asked Upāli about the topic of the first offense entailing expulsion, about the origin story, about the person, about the rule, about the additions to the rule, about the offense, and about the non-offenses. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.15	“And where was the second offense entailing expulsion laid down?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.16	“At Rājagaha.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.17	“Who is it about?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.18	“Dhaniya the potter.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.19	“What is it about?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.20	“Stealing.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.21	Mahākassapa asked Upāli about the topic of the second offense entailing expulsion, about the origin story, about the person, about the rule, about the additions to the rule, about the offense, and about the non-offenses. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.22	“And where was the third offense entailing expulsion laid down?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.23	“At Vesālī.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.24	“Who is it about?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.25	“A number of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.26	“What is it about?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.27	“Human beings.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.28	Mahākassapa asked Upāli about the topic of the third offense entailing expulsion, about the origin story, about the person, about the rule, about the additions to the rule, about the offense, and about the non-offenses. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.29	“And where was the fourth offense entailing expulsion laid down?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.30	“At Vesālī.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.31	“Who is it about?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.32	“The monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.33	“What is it about?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.34	“Superhuman qualities.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.35	Mahākassapa asked Upāli about the topic of the fourth offense entailing expulsion, about the origin story, about the person, about the rule, about the additions to the rule, about the offense, and about the non-offenses. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.36	In this way he asked about the analyses of both Monastic Codes. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.7.37	And Upāli was able to reply to every question. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.8.1	Venerable Mahākassapa informed the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd21:1.8.2	“Please, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.8.3	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will ask Ānanda about the Teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.8.4	Venerable Ānanda informed the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd21:1.8.5	“Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.8.6	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will reply when asked by Venerable Mahākassapa about the Teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.8.7	And Mahākassapa asked Ānanda, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.8.8	“Where was the Prime Net spoken?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.8.9	“At the royal rest-house at Ambalaṭṭhikā, between Rājagaha and Nāḷanda.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.8.10	“Who is it about?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.8.11	“The wanderer Suppiya and the young brahmin Brahmadatta.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.8.12	And Mahākassapa asked Ānanda about the origin story of the Prime Net and about the person. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.8.13	“Where was the Fruits of the Monastic Life spoken?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.8.14	“In Jīvaka’s mango grove at Rājagaha.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.8.15	“Who is it with?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.8.16	“Ajātasattu of Videha.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.8.17	And Mahākassapa asked Ānanda about the origin story of the Fruits of the Monastic Life and about the person. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.8.18	In this way he asked about the five collections. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.8.19	And Ānanda was able to reply to every question. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.0	2. Discussion of the lesser training rules 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.1	Ānanda said to the senior monks, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.2	“At the time of his final extinguishment, the Buddha said to me, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.3	‘After my passing away, Ānanda, if the Sangha wishes, it may abolish the lesser training rules.’” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.4	“But, Ānanda, did you ask the Buddha 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.5	which are the lesser training rules?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.6	“No, I didn’t.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.8	Some senior monks said, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.9	“Apart from the four rules entailing expulsion, the rest are the lesser training rules.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.10	Others said, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.11	“Apart from the four rules entailing expulsion and the thirteen rules entailing suspension, the rest are the lesser training rules.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.12	Still others said, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.13	“Apart from the four rules entailing expulsion, the thirteen rules entailing suspension, and the two undetermined rules, the rest are the lesser training rules.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.14	Still others said, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.15	“Apart from the four rules entailing expulsion, the thirteen rules entailing suspension, the two undetermined rules, and the thirty rules entailing relinquishment and confession, the rest are the lesser training rules.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.16	Still others said, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.17	“Apart from the four rules entailing expulsion, the thirteen rules entailing suspension, the two undetermined rules, the thirty rules entailing relinquishment and confession, and the ninety-two rules entailing confession, the rest are the lesser training rules.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.18	Still others said, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.19	“Apart from the four rules entailing expulsion, the thirteen rules entailing suspension, the two undetermined rules, the thirty rules entailing relinquishment and confession, the ninety-two rules entailing confession, and the four rules entailing acknowledgment, the rest are the lesser training rules.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.20	Then Venerable Mahākassapa informed the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.21	“Please, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.22	We have training rules that relate to householders. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.23	The householders know 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.24	what is allowable for us and what is not. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.25	If we abolish the lesser training rules, some people will say, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.26	‘The ascetic Gotama laid down training rules for his disciples until the time of his death. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.27	But they practice the training rules only as long as their teacher is alive. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.28	Since their teacher has now attained final extinguishment, they no longer practice the training rules.’ 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.29	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should not lay down new rules, nor get rid of the existing ones, and it should undertake to practice the training rules as they are. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.30	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.31	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.32	We have training rules that relate to householders. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.33	The householders know 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.34	what is allowable for us and what is not. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.35	If we abolish the lesser training rules, some people will say, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.36	‘The ascetic Gotama laid down training rules for his disciples until the time of his death. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.37	But they practice the training rules only as long as their teacher is alive. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.38	Since their teacher has now attained final extinguishment, they no longer practice the training rules.’ 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.39	The Sangha doesn’t lay down new rules, nor gets rid of the existing ones, and it undertakes to practice the training rules as they are. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.40	Any monk who approves of not laying down new rules, nor abolishing the old ones, and of undertaking to practice them as they are should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.41	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.42	The Sangha doesn’t lay down new rules, nor gets rid of the existing ones, and it undertakes to practice the training rules as they are. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.9.43	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.1	The senior monks said, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.2	“You have committed an act of wrong conduct, Ānanda, in that you didn’t ask the Buddha which are the lesser training rules. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.3	Confess that wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.4	“It was because of lack of mindfulness that I didn’t ask which are the lesser training rules. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.5	I can’t see that I have committed any wrong conduct, but I’ll confess it out of faith in the venerables.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.6	“You have also committed an act of wrong conduct in that you stepped on the Buddha’s rainy-season robe when you were sewing it. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.7	Confess that wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.8	“I didn’t step on it because of disrespect. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.9	I can’t see that I’ve committed any wrong conduct, but I’ll confess it out of faith in the venerables.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.10	“You have also committed an act of wrong conduct in that you had women pay respect to the Buddha’s dead body first. They soiled the Buddha’s body with tears. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.11	Confess that wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.12	“I did this so that it wouldn’t get too late for them. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.13	I can’t see that I’ve committed any wrong conduct, but I’ll confess it out of faith in the venerables.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.14	“You have also committed an act of wrong conduct in that you didn’t, even when he gave you a broad hint, ask the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.15	‘Please live on for an eon—for the benefit and happiness of the general population, out of compassion for the world, for the good, the benefit, and the happiness of gods and humans.’ 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.16	Confess that wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.17	“I didn’t ask because my mind was possessed by the Lord of Death. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.19	I can’t see that I’ve committed any wrong conduct, but I’ll confess it out of faith in the venerables.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.20	“You have also committed an act of wrong conduct in that you made an effort for women to be given the going forth on the spiritual path proclaimed by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.21	Confess that wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.22	“I made this effort because Mahāpajāpati Gotamī was the Buddha’s aunt who nurtured him, brought him up, and breastfed him when his own mother died. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.10.23	I can’t see that I’ve committed any wrong conduct, but I’ll confess it out of faith in the venerables.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.11.1	At that time Venerable Purāṇa was wandering in the Southern Hills with a large sangha of five hundred monks. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.11.2	When the senior monks had concluded the communal recitation of the Teaching and the Monastic Law, and when Purāṇa had stayed in the Southern Hills for as long as he liked, he went to the Bamboo Grove at Rājagaha. There he went up to the senior monks, exchanged pleasantries with them, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.11.3	And they said to him, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.11.4	“Purāṇa, the senior monks have jointly recited the Teaching and the Monastic Law. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.11.5	Please accept that communal recitation.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.11.6	“The Teaching and the Monastic Law have been well-recited by the senior monks. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.11.7	Nevertheless, I’ll remember what I myself have received in the presence of the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.12.0	3. Discussion of the supreme penalty 
pli-tv-kd21:1.12.1	And Venerable Ānanda said to the senior monks, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.12.2	“At the time of his final extinguishment, the Buddha said to me, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.12.3	‘After my passing away, Ānanda, the Sangha should impose the supreme penalty on the monk Channa.’” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.12.4	“Did you ask the Buddha 
pli-tv-kd21:1.12.5	what the supreme penalty is?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.12.6	“I did, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.12.8	and he replied, ‘Whatever Channa says, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.12.9	the monks should not correct him, instruct him, or teach him.’” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.12.10	“Well then, Ānanda, impose the supreme penalty on Channa.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.12.11	“But how should I do it? Channa is violent and harsh.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.12.12	“Go together with many monks.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.12.13	Saying, “Yes, Venerables,” he traveled by boat upstream to Kosambī with a large sangha of five hundred monks. After disembarking, he sat down at the foot of a tree not far from King Udena’s park. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.13.1	Just then King Udena was enjoying himself in the park together with his harem. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.13.2	The harem women had heard 
pli-tv-kd21:1.13.3	that their teacher, Venerable Ānanda, was seated at the foot of a tree not far from the park. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.13.4	They told the King, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.13.6	adding, “Sir, we would like to see Venerable Ānanda.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.13.7	“Well then, go ahead.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.13.8	The harem women then went to Ānanda, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.13.9	And Ānanda instructed, inspired, and gladdened them with a teaching, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.13.10	at the end of which they gave him five hundred upper robes. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.13.11	After rejoicing and expressing their appreciation for his teaching, they got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated him with their right side toward him, and went to King Udena. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.1	When King Udena saw them coming, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.2	he said to them, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.3	“Did you see the ascetic Ānanda?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.4	“We did.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.5	“Did you give him anything?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.6	“We gave him five hundred upper robes.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.7	King Udena complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.8	“How can the ascetic Ānanda receive so many robes? 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.9	Is he starting up as cloth merchant or setting up shop?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.10	King Udena then went to Ānanda, exchanged pleasantries with him, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.11	sat down, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.12	and said, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.13	“Sir Ānanda, did our harem women come here?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.14	“They did.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.15	“Did they give you anything?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.16	“They gave me five hundred upper robes.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.17	“But what will you do with five hundred robes?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.18	“I’ll share them with those monks whose robes are worn.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.19	“And what will you do with the worn robes?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.20	“We’ll make them into bedspreads.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.21	“And what will you do with the old bedspreads?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.22	“We’ll make them into mattress covers.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.23	“And what will you do with the old mattress covers?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.24	“We’ll make them into floor covers.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.25	“And what will you do with the old floor covers?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.26	“We’ll make them into doormats.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.27	“And what will you do with the old doormats?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.28	“We’ll make them into dustcloths.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.29	“And what will you do with the old dustcloths?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.30	“We’ll cut them up, mix them with mud, and smear the floors.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.31	King Udena thought, “These Sakyan monastics are clever at putting things to use; nothing is wasted,” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.32	and he gave another five hundred pieces of cloth to Ānanda. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.14.33	Together with the first offering of robes, Ānanda was given a total of a thousand robes. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.15.1	Ānanda then went to Ghosita’s Monastery, where he sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.15.2	Venerable Channa went up to Ānanda, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.15.3	And Ānanda said, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.15.4	“Channa, the Sangha has imposed the supreme penalty on you.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.15.5	“What’s the supreme penalty?” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.15.6	“Whatever you say to the monks, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.15.7	the monks should not correct you, instruct you, or teach you.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.15.8	Saying, “I’m ruined!” he fainted on the spot. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.15.9	Being troubled, ashamed, and disgusted by the supreme penalty, Channa stayed by himself, secluded, heedful, energetic, and diligent. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.15.10	And in this very life, he soon realized with his own insight the supreme goal of the spiritual life for which people from good families rightly go forth from home to homelessness. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.15.12	He understood that birth had come to an end, that the spiritual life had been lived, that the job had been done, that there was no further state of existence. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.15.13	And Venerable Channa became one of the perfected ones. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.15.14	He then went to Ānanda and said, 
pli-tv-kd21:1.15.15	“Venerable Ānanda, please lift the supreme penalty.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.15.16	“The moment you realized perfection, the supreme penalty was lifted.” 
pli-tv-kd21:1.16.1	At this communal recitation of the Monastic Law there were five hundred monks, neither more nor less. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.16.2	For this reason this communal recitation is called “The group of five hundred”. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.16.3	The eleventh chapter on the group of five hundred is finished. In this chapter there are twenty-three topics. 
pli-tv-kd21:1.16.39	The chapter on the group of five hundred is finished.
pli-tv-kd22:0.1	Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law 
pli-tv-kd22:0.2	The Short Division 
pli-tv-kd22:0.3	The chapter on the group of seven hundred 
pli-tv-kd22:1.1.1	One hundred years after the Buddha had attained final extinguishment, the Vajjian monks of Vesālī proclaimed ten practices as allowable: 
pli-tv-kd22:1.1.2	the salt-in-horn practice; the two fingerbreadths practice; the next-village practice; the many-monasteries practice; the consent practice; customary practices; the unchurned practice; palm-juice drinking; sitting mats without borders; and gold, silver, and money. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.1.3	At that time Venerable Yasa of Kākaṇḍa was wandering in the Vajjian country, when he arrived at Vesālī. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.1.4	There he stayed in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.1.5	Soon afterwards, on the day of the observance procedure, the Vajjian monks of Vesālī filled a bronze bowl with water and placed it in the midst of the Sangha of monks. Whenever a lay follower of Vesālī came, they said, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.1.6	“Give a _kahāpaṇa_ coin to the Sangha, or half a _kahāpaṇa_, or a _pāda_, or a _māsaka_. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.1.7	The Sangha needs requisites.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.1.8	But Yaso said to the lay followers, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.1.9	“Don’t give a _kahāpaṇa_ to the Sangha, or half a _kahāpaṇa_, or a _pāda_, or a _māsaka_. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.1.10	Gold, silver, and money are not allowable for the Sakyan monastics. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.1.11	They neither accept 
pli-tv-kd22:1.1.12	nor receive gold, silver, and money. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.1.13	The Sakyan monastics have given up gems and gold, and live without gold, silver, and money.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.1.14	But although Yasa said this, the lay followers continued to give money to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.1.15	The next morning the Vajjian monks shared out the money evenly. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.1.16	And they said to Yasa, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.1.17	“Here is your share, Yasa.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.1.18	“There is no share for me. I don’t accept money.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.2.1	The Vajjian monks said to one another, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.2.2	“Yasa is abusing and reviling the lay followers who have faith and confidence. He’s destroying their confidence. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.2.3	Let’s do a legal procedure of reconciliation against him.” And they did just that. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.2.4	Yasa said to them, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.2.5	“The Buddha has laid down 
pli-tv-kd22:1.2.6	that a monk who has had a legal procedure of reconciliation done against himself should be given a monk as companion messenger. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.2.7	Please give me a companion monk.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.2.8	They appointed one monk and gave him to Yasa as companion messenger. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.2.9	Yasa entered Vesālī with his companion and said to the lay followers there, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.2.10	“It seems that I’m abusing and reviling the venerable lay followers who have faith and confidence, and that I’m destroying their confidence, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.2.11	since I speak of what is contrary to the Teaching as contrary to the Teaching and of the Teaching as the Teaching, and since I speak of what is contrary to the Monastic Law as contrary to the Monastic Law and of the Monastic Law as the Monastic Law. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.1	“On one occasion the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.2	There he addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.3	‘There are these four defilements of the sun and the moon that stop them from shining and radiating: 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.4	clouds; 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.5	snow; 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.6	smoke and dust; 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.7	and an eclipse by Rāhu, the ruler of the antigods. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.9	In the same way, there are these four defilements of monastics and brahmins that stop them from shining and radiating: 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.11	drinking alcohol; 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.13	having sexual intercourse; 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.15	accepting gold, silver, and money; 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.17	and making a living through wrong livelihood.’ 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.22	Having said this, the Teacher added: 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.23	‘Defiled by desire and ill will, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.24	Some monastics and brahmins, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.25	Those hindered by delusion, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.26	Delight in what seems lovely. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.27	Some monastics and brahmins—
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.28	Deluded, they drink alcohol, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.29	Have sexual intercourse, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.30	Accept gold, silver, and money, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.31	And make a living 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.32	Through wrong livelihood. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.33	These are called defilements by the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.34	The Kinsman of the Sun. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.35	Those monastics and brahmins 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.36	Who are defiled by these 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.37	Do not shine and radiate; 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.38	They are impure, dirty, and low. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.39	Enveloped in darkness, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.40	Slaves to craving that leads them on, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.41	Filling the dreaded cemeteries, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.42	They receive another life.’ 
pli-tv-kd22:1.3.43	It’s by speaking like this, it seems, that I’m abusing and reviling the venerable lay followers who have faith and confidence, and that I’m destroying their confidence. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.1	“At one time when the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.2	the royal court was seated together in the royal compound, having the following conversation, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.3	‘Gold, silver, and money are allowable for the Sakyan monastics; 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.4	they accept 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.5	and receive gold, silver, and money.’ 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.6	On that occasion the chief Maṇicūlaka was sitting in that gathering. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.7	He said, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.8	‘No, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.9	gold, silver, and money are not allowable for the Sakyan monastics. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.10	They neither accept 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.11	nor receive gold, silver, or money. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.12	The Sakyan monastics have given up gems and gold, and live without gold, silver, and money.’ 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.13	And he was able to persuade the gathering. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.14	Soon afterwards Maṇicūlaka went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.15	and told him what had happened, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.27	adding, ‘Venerable Sir, have I explained in accordance with the Teaching so that I can’t be legitimately criticized or censured?’ 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.28	‘You certainly have. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.30	For gold, silver, and money are not allowable for the Sakyan monastics. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.31	They neither accept 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.32	nor receive gold, silver, or money. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.33	The Sakyan monastics have given up gems and gold, and live without gold, silver, and money. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.34	Whoever is allowed gold, silver, and money is also allowed the pleasures of the world. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.35	And you should know that anyone who is allowed the pleasures of the world 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.36	does not have the qualities of an ascetic, the qualities of a Sakyan monastic. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.37	Still, I say that anyone who needs grass may look for it, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.38	likewise timber, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.39	a cart, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.40	or a worker. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.41	But under no circumstances should they accept or look for gold, silver, or money.’ 
pli-tv-kd22:1.4.42	It’s by speaking like this, it seems, that I’m abusing and reviling the venerable lay followers who have faith and confidence, and that I’m destroying their confidence. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.5.1	“On one occasion at Rājagaha the Buddha prohibited gold, silver, and money and laid down a training rule because of Venerable Upananda the Sakyan. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.5.2	It’s by speaking like this, it seems, that I’m abusing and reviling the venerable lay followers who have faith and confidence, and that I’m destroying their confidence, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.5.3	since I speak of what is contrary to the Teaching as contrary to the Teaching and of the Teaching as the Teaching, and since I speak of what is contrary to the Monastic Law as contrary to the Monastic Law and of the Monastic Law as the Monastic Law.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.6.1	And the lay followers of Vesālī said to Yasa, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.6.2	“Venerable, you’re the only Sakyan monastic; 
pli-tv-kd22:1.6.3	none of these others is. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.6.4	Please stay at Vesālī. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.6.5	We’ll do our best to supply you with robes, almsfood, a dwelling, and medicines.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.6.6	Having persuaded the lay followers of Vesālī, Yasa returned to the monastery together with his companion messenger. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.7.1	Soon afterwards the Vajjian monks asked the monk who had been the companion messenger, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.7.2	“Did Yasa ask the lay followers for forgiveness?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.7.3	“The lay followers have acted badly toward us. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.7.4	They now regard Yasa as the only Sakyan a monastic, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.7.5	but none of us.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.7.6	The Vajjian monks said, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.7.7	“Yasa has informed the householders without our approval. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.7.8	Let’s do a legal procedure of ejection against him.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.7.9	But when they gathered together to do the procedure against him, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.7.10	Yasa rose up into the air and reappeared at Kosambī. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.7.11	Yasa then sent a message to the monks at Pāvā and to the monks in Avantī in the southern region: 
pli-tv-kd22:1.7.12	“Please come, Venerables. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.7.13	Let’s raise this legal issue—
pli-tv-kd22:1.7.14	before what is contrary to the Teaching shines forth and the Teaching is obstructed; 
pli-tv-kd22:1.7.15	before what is contrary to the Monastic Law shines forth and the Monastic Law is obstructed; 
pli-tv-kd22:1.7.16	before those who speak contrary to the Teaching become strong and those who speak in accordance with it become weak; 
pli-tv-kd22:1.7.17	before those who speak contrary to the Monastic Law become strong and those who speak in accordance with it become weak.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.8.1	Yasa then traveled to Venerable Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī who was staying on the Ahogaṅga mountain. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.8.2	He bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.8.3	and said, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.8.4	“Venerable, the Vajjian monks of Vesālī proclaim these ten practices as allowable: 
pli-tv-kd22:1.8.5	the salt-in-horn practice; the two fingerbreadths practice; the next-village practice; the many-monasteries practice; the consent practice; customary practices; the unchurned practice; palm-juice drinking; sitting mats without borders; and gold, silver, and money. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.8.6	Let’s raise this legal issue—
pli-tv-kd22:1.8.7	before what is contrary to the Teaching shines forth and the Teaching is obstructed; 
pli-tv-kd22:1.8.8	before what is contrary to the Monastic Law shines forth and the Monastic Law is obstructed; 
pli-tv-kd22:1.8.9	before those who speak contrary to the Teaching become strong and those who speak in accordance with it become weak; 
pli-tv-kd22:1.8.10	before those who speak contrary to the Monastic Law become strong and those who speak in accordance with it become weak.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.8.11	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.8.12	Soon afterwards, sixty monks from Pāvā—
pli-tv-kd22:1.8.13	all of them wilderness-dwellers, almsfood-only eaters, rag-robe wearers, three-robe owners, and perfected—
pli-tv-kd22:1.8.14	gathered on mount Ahogaṅga. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.8.15	And eighty-eight monks from Avantī in the southern region—
pli-tv-kd22:1.8.16	some of them wilderness-dwellers, some almsfood-only eaters, some rag-robe wearers, some three-robe owners, but all perfected—
pli-tv-kd22:1.8.17	gathered on mount Ahogaṅga. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.1	Then, as the senior monks were consulting one another, it occurred to them, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.2	“This legal issue is going to be contentious and difficult. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.3	How can we get supporters, so that we will be stronger?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.4	At this time Venerable Revata was staying at Soreyya. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.5	He was learned and a master of the tradition; he was an expert on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; he was knowledgeable and competent, had a sense of conscience, and was afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.6	The senior monks considered this 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.9	and said, “If we get Revata as a supporter, we’ll be stronger.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.10	Revata heard this conversation between the senior monks 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.11	by means of clairaudience, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.13	and he thought, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.14	“This legal issue is going to be contentious and difficult. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.15	It would not be appropriate for me to stay away from such a legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.16	But now these monks are coming, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.17	and I won’t be at ease when they crowd me in. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.18	Let me leave before they arrive.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.19	And he went from Soreyya to Saṅkassa. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.20	The senior monks went to Soreyya 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.21	and asked where Revata was. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.22	They were told 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.23	that he had gone to Saṅkassa. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.24	Revata then went from Saṅkassa to Kaṇṇakujja. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.25	When the senior monks went to Saṅkassa 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.26	and asked where Revata was, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.27	they were told 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.28	he had gone to Kaṇṇakujja. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.29	And Revata went from Kaṇṇakujja to Udumbara. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.30	When the senior monks went to Kaṇṇakujja 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.31	and asked where Revata was, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.32	they were told 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.33	he had gone to Udumbara. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.34	And Revata went from Udumbara to Aggaḷapura. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.35	When the senior monks went to Udumbara 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.36	and asked where Revata was, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.37	they were told 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.38	he had gone to Aggaḷapura. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.39	And Revata went from Aggaḷapura to Sahajāti. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.40	When the senior monks went to Aggaḷapura 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.41	and asked where Revata was, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.42	they were told 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.43	he had gone to Sahajāti. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.9.44	Finally the senior monks caught up with Revata at Sahajāti. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.1	Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī then said to Yasa, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.2	“Revata is learned and a master of the tradition; he is an expert on the Teaching, on the Monastic Law, and on the summaries; he is knowledgeable and competent, has a sense of conscience, and is afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.3	If we ask Revata a question, he would be capable of spending the whole night answering just that one. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.4	Now, soon he will ask a pupil monk to chant. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.5	Once the chanting is finished, go up to Revata and ask him about these ten practices.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.6	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.8	Soon afterwards, when the chanting was finished, Yasa went up to Revata, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.9	and said, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.10	“Is the salt-in-horn practice allowable?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.11	“What is the salt-in-horn practice?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.12	“Is it allowable to carry salt in a horn 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.13	and then eat it whenever the food is unsalted?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.14	“No, it’s not allowable.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.15	“Is the two fingerbreadths practice allowable?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.16	“What is the two fingerbreadths practice?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.17	“Is it allowable to eat at the wrong time, so long as the shadow of the sundial is within two fingerbreadths of midday?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.18	“No.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.19	“Is the next-village practice allowable?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.20	“What is the next-village practice?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.21	“When you have finished your meal and refused an invitation to eat more, is it allowable to eat non-leftover food if you intend to go to the next village?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.22	“No.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.23	“Is the many-monasteries practice allowable?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.24	“What is the many-monasteries practice?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.25	“When there are a number of monasteries within the same monastic boundary, is it allowable for them to do the observance-day procedure separately?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.26	“No.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.27	“Is the consent practice allowable?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.28	“What is the consent practice?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.29	“Is it allowable to do a legal procedure with an incomplete Sangha, 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.30	with the intention of getting consent from the absent monks afterwards?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.31	“No.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.32	“Are customary practices allowable?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.33	“What are customary practices?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.34	“Is it allowable to follow the practices of one’s preceptors or teachers?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.35	“Sometimes it is, sometimes it’s not.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.36	“Is the unchurned practice allowable?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.37	“What is the unchurned practice?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.38	“When you have finished your meal and refused an invitation to eat more, is it allowable to drink that which is halfway between milk and curd, if it’s not leftover?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.39	“No.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.40	“Is palm-juice drinking allowable?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.41	“What is palm juice?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.42	“Is it allowable to drink that which has started to ferment, but which hasn’t yet become a proper alcoholic drink?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.43	“No.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.44	“Are sitting mats without borders allowable?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.45	“No.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.46	“Are gold, silver, and money allowable?” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.47	“No.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.48	“The Vajjian monks of Vesālī proclaim these ten practices. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.49	Venerable, let’s raise this legal issue—
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.50	before what is contrary to the Teaching shines forth and the Teaching is obstructed; 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.51	before what is contrary to the Monastic Law shines forth and the Monastic Law is obstructed; 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.52	before those who speak contrary to the Teaching become strong and those who speak in accordance with it become weak; 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.53	before those who speak contrary to the Monastic Law become strong and those who speak in accordance with it become weak.” 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.54	Saying, “Yes,” he consented to Yasa’s request. 
pli-tv-kd22:1.10.55	The first section for recitation is finished. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.1.1	The Vajjian monks of Vesālī heard, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.1.2	“It seems Yasa wants to raise this legal issue and is looking for supporters. And it seems he is gaining support.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.1.3	They said, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.1.4	“This legal issue is going to be contentious and difficult. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.1.5	How can we get supporters, so that we will be stronger?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.1.6	And it occurred to them, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.1.7	“Venerable Revata is learned and a master of the tradition; he is an expert on the Teaching, on the Monastic Law, and on the summaries; he is knowledgeable and competent, has a sense of conscience, and is afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.1.8	If we get Revata as a supporter, we’ll be stronger.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.1.9	They prepared many monastic requisites: 
pli-tv-kd22:2.1.10	a bowl, a robe, a sitting mat, a needle case, a belt, a water filter, and a water strainer. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.1.11	Taking those requisites, they traveled by boat upstream to Sahajāti. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.1.12	After disembarking, they had a meal at the foot of a tree. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.2.1	Just then Venerable Sāḷha was in seclusion, wondering, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.2.2	“Who speak in accordance with the Teaching, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.2.3	the monks from the east or the monks from Pāvā?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.2.4	Reflecting on the Teaching and the Monastic Law, it occurred to him, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.2.5	“The monks from the east speak contrary to the Teaching, but the monks from Pāvā don’t.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.2.6	A god from the pure abodes read Sāḷha’s mind. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.2.7	Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch his arm, so too he disappeared from pure abodes and appeared in front of Sāḷha. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.2.8	And he said to Sāḷha, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.2.9	“You’re right, Venerable Sāḷha. The monks from the east speak contrary to the Teaching, but the monks from Pāvā don’t. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.2.10	So then, take a stand in accordance with the Teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.2.11	“Both previously and now do I take a stand in accordance with the Teaching. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.2.12	But I won’t reveal my view in case I’m appointed to deal with this legal issue.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.1	The Vajjian monks then went to Revata and said, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.2	“Venerable, please accept these monastic requisites.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.4	Not wanting to accept them, he replied, “There is no need. My bowl and robes are complete.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.5	At this time a monk called Uttara, who had twenty years of seniority, was Revata’s attendant. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.6	The Vajjian monks then went to him and said, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.7	“Please accept these monastic requisites.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.9	Not wanting to accept them, he replied, “There is no need. My bowl and robes are complete.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.10	“People brought monastic requisites to the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.11	If the Buddha received them, they were pleased. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.12	If he didn’t, they brought them to Venerable Ānanda instead, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.13	saying, ‘Venerable, please accept these monastic requisites. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.14	It will be as if they’re received by the Buddha himself.’ 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.15	So please accept these monastic requisites. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.16	It will be as if they’re received by the elder himself.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.17	Because he was pressured, Uttara received one robe. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.18	And he said, “Please say what you want.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.19	“Please say this to the elder, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.20	‘Sir, please say this in the midst of the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.21	“Buddhas appear in the eastern countries. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.22	The monks from the east speak in accordance with the Teaching, not so the monks from Pāvā.”’” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.23	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.24	He then went to Revata 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.25	and told him what he had been asked to say. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.28	Revata replied, “You’re urging me to act contrary to the Teaching,” and he dismissed Uttara. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.29	Soon afterwards the Vajjian monks asked Uttara, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.30	“What did he say?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.31	“We have acted badly. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.32	Saying, ‘You’re urging me to act contrary to the Teaching’, the elder dismissed me.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.33	“Are you not a senior monk of twenty years’ standing?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.3.34	“Yes. Nevertheless, I live with formal support from him because I respect him.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.4.1	The Sangha then gathered to deliberate on that legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.4.2	Revata informed the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd22:2.4.3	“Please, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.4.4	If we were to resolve this legal issue here, it might be that the monks who started the ten practices would reopen it. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.4.5	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should resolve this legal issue in the place where it arose.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.4.6	The senior monks then went to Vesālī 
pli-tv-kd22:2.4.7	to deliberate on that legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.4.8	At that time there was a monk called Sabbakāmī who had been ordained for one hundred and twenty years and was the most senior monk in the world. He had been a student of Venerable Ānanda and was now staying at Vesālī. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.4.9	Revata said to Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.4.10	“I’ll be staying in Sabbakāmī’s dwelling. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.4.11	Please go to Sabbakāmī at the appropriate time and ask about these ten practices.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.4.12	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.4.13	Revata then entered Sabbakāmī’s dwelling. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.4.14	And Sabbakāmī had his resting place prepared in the room, whereas Revata had his prepared in the entryway. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.4.15	When Revata saw 
pli-tv-kd22:2.4.16	that the old monk did not lie down, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.4.17	he too did not lie down. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.4.18	And when Sabbakāmī saw 
pli-tv-kd22:2.4.19	that the tired monk who had just arrived did not lie down, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.4.20	he too did not lie down. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.5.1	Getting up early in the morning, Sabbakāmī said to Revata, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.5.2	“My friend, what’s your main meditation?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.5.3	“My main meditation, Sir, is good will.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.5.4	“Your meditation is noble, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.5.5	for good will is a noble meditation.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.5.6	“In the past, too, when I was a householder, I habitually practiced good will, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.5.7	and now it’s my main meditation. Besides, I attained perfection long ago. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.5.8	But what’s your main meditation?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.5.9	“My main meditation is emptiness.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.5.10	“Your meditation is that of a great man, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.5.11	for emptiness is the meditation of a great man.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.5.12	“In the past, too, when I was a householder, I habitually practiced emptiness, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.5.13	and now it’s my main meditation. Besides, I attained perfection long ago.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.6.1	At that moment the conversation between the senior monks was interrupted because Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī arrived. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.6.2	Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī went up to Sabbakāmī, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.6.3	and said, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.6.4	“Venerable, the Vajjian monks of Vesālī proclaim ten practices as allowable: 
pli-tv-kd22:2.6.5	the salt-in-horn practice; the two fingerbreadths practice; the next-village practice; the many-monasteries practice; the consent practice; customary practices; the unchurned practice; palm-juice drinking; sitting mats without borders; and gold, silver, and money. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.6.6	Now you have learned much, both of the Teaching and the Monastic Law, at the feet of your preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.6.7	When you reflect on the Teaching and the Monastic Law, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.6.8	who speaks in accordance with the Teaching, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.6.9	the monks from the east or the monks from Pāvā?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.6.10	“You too have learned much, both of the Teaching and the Monastic Law, at the feet of your preceptor. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.6.11	When you reflect on the Teaching and the Monastic Law, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.6.12	who speaks in accordance with the Teaching, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.6.13	the monks from the east or the monks from Pāvā?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.6.14	“When I reflect like this, it occurs to me 
pli-tv-kd22:2.6.15	that the monks from the east speak contrary to the Teaching, but the monks from Pāvā don’t. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.6.16	But I won’t reveal my view in case I’m appointed to deal with this legal issue.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.6.17	“And when I reflect like this, it occurs to me too 
pli-tv-kd22:2.6.18	that the monks from the east speak contrary to the Teaching, but the monks from Pāvā don’t. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.6.19	And I too won’t reveal my view in case I’m appointed to deal with this legal issue.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.1	Then the Sangha gathered to deliberate on that legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.2	While they were deliberating, there was endless talk, but not a single statement that could be understood. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.3	Revata then informed the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.4	“Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.5	While we were deliberating, there was endless talk, but not a single statement that could be understood. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.6	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should resolve this legal issue by means of a committee.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.7	The Sangha then selected four monks from the east—
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.9	Venerable Sabbakāmī, Venerable Sāḷha, Venerable Khujjasobhita, and Venerable Vāsabhagāmika—
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.10	and four monks from Pāvā—
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.11	Venerable Revata, Venerable Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī, Venerable Yasa of Kākaṇḍa, and Venerable Sumana. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.12	Revata then informed the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.13	“Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.14	While we were deliberating, there was endless talk, but not a single statement that could be understood. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.15	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint four monks from the east and four from Pāvā to resolve this legal issue by means of a committee. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.16	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.17	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.18	While we were deliberating, there was endless talk, but not a single statement that could be understood. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.19	The Sangha appoints four monks from the east and four from Pāvā to resolve this legal issue by means of a committee. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.20	Any monk who approves of appointing four monks from the east and four from Pāvā to resolve this legal issue by means of a committee should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.21	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.22	The Sangha has appointed four monks from the east and four from Pāvā to resolve this legal issue by means of a committee. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.23	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.24	At that time there was a monk called Ajita who had ten years of seniority and was the Sangha’s reciter of the Monastic Code. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.25	The Sangha appointed him 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.26	to assign seats to the senior monks. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.27	The senior monks said, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.28	“Where should we resolve this legal issue?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.29	It occurred to them, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.30	“There is the Vālika Monastery, which is delightful, quiet, and free from chatter. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.31	Let’s resolve this legal issue there.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.32	And they went to the Vālika Monastery 
pli-tv-kd22:2.7.33	to deliberate on that legal issue. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.1	Revata then informed the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.2	“Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.3	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will question Venerable Sabbakāmī on the Monastic Law.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.4	And Sabbakāmī informed the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.5	“Please, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.6	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will reply when asked by Revata about the Monastic Law.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.7	Revata said to Sabbakāmī, 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.8	“Sir, is the salt-in-horn practice allowable?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.9	“What is the salt-in-horn practice?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.10	“Is it allowable to carry salt in a horn 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.11	and then eat it whenever the food is unsalted?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.12	“No, it’s not allowable.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.13	“Where was it prohibited?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.14	“At Sāvatthī, in the analysis of the Monastic Code.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.15	“What was committed?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.16	“An offense entailing confession for eating what has been stored.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.17	“Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.18	The Sangha has decided on the first practice. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.19	This practice is contrary to the Teaching, contrary to the Monastic Law, and a departure from the Teacher’s instruction. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.20	I make a note of the first decision.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.21	“Is the two fingerbreadths practice allowable?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.22	“What is the two fingerbreadths practice?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.23	“Is it allowable to eat at the wrong time, so long as the shadow of the sundial is within two fingerbreadths of midday?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.24	“No.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.25	“Where was it prohibited?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.26	“At Rājagaha, in the analysis of the Monastic Code.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.27	“What was committed?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.28	“An offense entailing confession for eating at the wrong time.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.29	“Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.30	The Sangha has decided on the second practice. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.31	This practice is contrary to the Teaching, contrary to the Monastic Law, and a departure from the Teacher’s instruction.

pli-tv-kd22:2.8.36	“No.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.37	“Where was it prohibited?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.38	“At Sāvatthī, in the analysis of the Monastic Code.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.39	“What was committed?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.40	“An offense entailing confession for eating what is not left over.”

pli-tv-kd22:2.8.43	This practice is contrary to the Teaching, contrary to the Monastic Law, and a departure from the Teacher’s instruction. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.44	I make a note of the third decision.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.45	“Is the many-monasteries practice allowable?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.46	“What is the many-monasteries practice?”

pli-tv-kd22:2.8.48	“No.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.49	“Where was it prohibited?”

pli-tv-kd22:2.8.60	with the intention of getting consent from the absent monks afterwards?” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.61	“No.”

pli-tv-kd22:2.8.128	Nevertheless, for the purpose of convincing the other monks, you should ask me about these ten practices also in the midst of the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.129	Revata then asked Sabbakāmī about these ten practices in the midst of the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.8.130	And Sabbakāmī was able to reply to every question. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.9.1	At this communal recitation of the Monastic Law there were seven hundred monks, neither more nor less. For this reason this communal recitation is called “The group of seven hundred”. 
pli-tv-kd22:2.9.2	The twelfth chapter on the group of seven hundred is finished. In this chapter there are twenty-five topics.

pli-tv-kd2:0.2	The Long Division 
pli-tv-kd2:0.3	The chapter on the observance day 
pli-tv-kd2:0.4	1. The instruction to gather together 
pli-tv-kd2:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha on the Vulture Peak. 
pli-tv-kd2:1.1.2	At that time, on the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth day of the lunar half-month, the wanderers of other religions gathered and gave teachings. 
pli-tv-kd2:1.1.3	People went to listen to those teachings, 
pli-tv-kd2:1.1.4	and they acquired affection for and confidence in those wanderers. And the wanderers gained a following. 
pli-tv-kd2:1.2.1	While King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was alone, he reflected on this, 
pli-tv-kd2:1.2.5	and he thought, “Why don’t the venerables, too, gather on the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth day of the lunar half-month?” 
pli-tv-kd2:1.3.1	He then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd2:1.3.2	and told him what he had thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:1.3.7	adding, “It would be good, Venerable Sir, if the venerables, too, gathered on the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth day of the lunar half-month.” 
pli-tv-kd2:1.4.1	The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching. 
pli-tv-kd2:1.4.2	When the Buddha was finished, the King got up from his seat, bowed, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd2:1.4.3	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd2:1.4.4	“You should gather on the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth day of the lunar half-month.” 
pli-tv-kd2:2.1.1	When the monks knew 
pli-tv-kd2:2.1.2	what the Buddha had said, 
pli-tv-kd2:2.1.3	they started gathering on those days. 
pli-tv-kd2:2.1.4	People came to hear a teaching, but the monks sat in silence. 
pli-tv-kd2:2.1.5	The people complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd2:2.1.6	“How can the Sakyan monastics gather on the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth day of the lunar half-month, but then sit in silence like dumb pigs? 
pli-tv-kd2:2.1.7	Shouldn’t they give a teaching when they gather together?” 
pli-tv-kd2:2.1.8	The monks heard the complaints of those people 
pli-tv-kd2:2.1.9	and they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd2:2.1.10	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd2:2.1.11	“When you gather on the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth day of the lunar half-month, you should give a teaching.” 
pli-tv-kd2:3.1.0	2. The instruction to recite the Monastic Code 
pli-tv-kd2:3.1.1	While the Buddha was in seclusion, he thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:3.1.2	“Let me instruct the monks to recite a monastic code, consisting of those training rules that I have laid down for them. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.1.3	That will be their procedure for the observance day.” 
pli-tv-kd2:3.2.1	In the evening, when the Buddha had come out from seclusion, he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.2.2	telling them what he had thought and adding: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.2.4	“You should recite the Monastic Code. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.3.1	And it should be done like this. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.3.2	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.3.3	ʻPlease, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.3.4	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should do the observance-day procedure, it should recite the Monastic Code. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.3.5	What is the preliminary duty of the Sangha? 
pli-tv-kd2:3.3.6	The venerables should declare their purity, 
pli-tv-kd2:3.3.7	and I will recite the Monastic Code. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.3.8	Everyone present should listen and attend carefully. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.3.9	Anyone who has committed an offense should reveal it. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.3.10	If you haven’t committed any offense, you should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.3.11	If you are silent, I will regard you as pure. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.3.12	Just as one who is asked individually responds, so too, the announcement is made up to three times in this kind of gathering. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.3.13	If a monk remembers an offense but doesn’t reveal it when an announcement is made up to the third time, he is lying in full awareness. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.3.14	Lying in full awareness is called an obstacle by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.3.15	A monk who remembers an offense and is seeking purification should therefore reveal it. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.3.16	When it’s revealed, he will be at ease.’” 
pli-tv-kd2:3.4.0	Definitions 
pli-tv-kd2:3.4.1	Monastic code: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.4.2	this is at the beginning, this is at the front, this is at the head in wholesome qualities—therefore it is called “Monastic Code”. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.4.3	Venerables: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.4.4	this is a term of affection, a term of respect; this is an expression of respect and deference, that is, “Venerables”. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.4.5	I will recite: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.4.6	I will make known, I will teach, I will declare, I will set forth, I will reveal, I will analyze, I will make plain, I will manifest. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.4.9	Everyone present: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.4.10	to whatever extent there are senior monks, junior monks, and monks of middle standing in that gathering—these are called “everyone present”. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.4.11	Should listen carefully: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.4.12	should be attentive, should pay attention, should apply their whole mind. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.4.13	Should attend: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.4.14	should listen with a one-pointed mind, with an undistracted mind, with a non-wandering mind. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.5.1	Anyone who has committed an offense: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.5.2	a senior monk, a monk of middle standing, or a junior monk who has committed a particular offense among the five classes of offenses or a particular offense among the seven classes of offenses. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.5.3	Should reveal it: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.5.4	should confess it, should disclose it, should make it plain, should make it known—either in the midst of the Sangha, in the midst of a group, or to an individual. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.5.5	If you haven’t committed any offense: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.5.6	if you have not committed any offense or you have cleared yourself after committing one. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.5.7	You should remain silent: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.5.8	you should be patient; you should not say anything. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.5.9	I will regard you as pure: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.5.10	I will know; I will remember. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.6.1	Just as one who is asked individually responds: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.6.2	just as one who is asked by an individual would respond, so too, one should know of that gathering that “It’s asking me.” 
pli-tv-kd2:3.6.3	This kind of gathering: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.6.4	a gathering of monks is what is meant. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.6.5	When the announcement is made up to three times: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.6.6	when the announcement is made once, when the announcement is made for the second time, and also when the announcement is made for the third time. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.6.7	Remembers: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.6.8	who knows, who perceives. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.6.9	An offense: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.6.10	one that has been committed or one that has not been cleared after being committed. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.6.11	But doesn’t reveal it: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.6.12	does not confess it, does not disclose it, does not make it plain, does not make it known—either in the midst of the Sangha, in the midst of a group, or to an individual. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.7.1	He’s lying in full awareness: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.7.2	what is there for lying in full awareness? 
pli-tv-kd2:3.7.3	There is an act of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.7.4	Is called an obstacle by the Buddha: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.7.5	an obstacle for what? 
pli-tv-kd2:3.7.6	It is an obstacle for reaching the first absorption, the second absorption, the third absorption, the fourth absorption; an obstacle for reaching the wholesome qualities of absorption, release, stillness, attainment, renunciation, escape, seclusion. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.7.7	Therefore: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.7.8	for that reason. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.7.9	Who remembers: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.7.10	who knows, who perceives. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.7.11	Is seeking purification: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.7.12	Is seeking to be cleared, is seeking purity. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.8.1	An offense: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.8.2	one that has been committed or one that has not been cleared after being committed. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.8.3	Should reveal it: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.8.4	should reveal it either in the midst of the Sangha, in the midst of a group, or to an individual. 
pli-tv-kd2:3.8.5	When it’s revealed, he will be at ease: 
pli-tv-kd2:3.8.6	at ease for what? 
pli-tv-kd2:3.8.7	He will be at ease for reaching the first absorption, the second absorption, the third absorption, the forth absorption; at ease for reaching the wholesome qualities of absorption, release, stillness, attainment, renunciation, escape, seclusion. 
pli-tv-kd2:4.1.1	When they knew 
pli-tv-kd2:4.1.2	that the Buddha had allowed the recitation of the Monastic Code, 
pli-tv-kd2:4.1.3	some monks recited it daily. 
pli-tv-kd2:4.1.4	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd2:4.1.5	“You should not recite the Monastic Code every day. 
pli-tv-kd2:4.1.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:4.1.7	You should recite the Monastic Code on the observance day.” 
pli-tv-kd2:4.2.1	When they knew 
pli-tv-kd2:4.2.2	that the Buddha had allowed the recitation of the Monastic Code on the observance day, 
pli-tv-kd2:4.2.3	some monks recited it three times per half-month: on the fourteenth, on the fifteenth, and on the eighth day. 
pli-tv-kd2:4.2.5	“You should not recite the Monastic Code three times per half-month. 
pli-tv-kd2:4.2.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:4.2.7	You should recite the Monastic Code once every half-month: on the fourteenth day or on the fifteenth day.” 
pli-tv-kd2:5.1.1	On one occasion the monks from the group of six recited the Monastic Code separately, each to his own followers. 
pli-tv-kd2:5.1.3	“You should not recite the Monastic Code separately, each to your own followers. 
pli-tv-kd2:5.1.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:5.1.5	You should do the observance-day procedure in a complete assembly.” 
pli-tv-kd2:5.2.1	When they knew 
pli-tv-kd2:5.2.2	that the Buddha had laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd2:5.2.3	that the observance-day procedure should be done in a complete assembly, 
pli-tv-kd2:5.2.4	the monks thought, “How far does a complete assembly extend? As far as one monastery or as far as the entire earth?” 
pli-tv-kd2:5.2.6	“A complete assembly extends as far as one monastery.” 
pli-tv-kd2:5.3.0	3. Mahākappina 
pli-tv-kd2:5.3.1	At that time Venerable Mahākappina was staying at Rājagaha in the deer park at Maddakucchi. 
pli-tv-kd2:5.3.2	On one occasion, while he was in seclusion, he thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:5.3.3	“Should I or shouldn’t I go to the observance-day procedure? Should I or should I not go to the legal procedures of the Sangha? Regardless, I’ve reached the highest purity.” 
pli-tv-kd2:5.4.1	The Buddha read his mind. 
pli-tv-kd2:5.4.2	Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch his arm, so too the Buddha disappeared from the Vulture Peak and reappeared in front of Mahākappina, 
pli-tv-kd2:5.4.3	where he sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-kd2:5.4.4	Mahākappina bowed and sat down, 
pli-tv-kd2:5.5.1	and the Buddha said to him: 
pli-tv-kd2:5.5.2	“Isn’t it the case, Kappina, 
pli-tv-kd2:5.5.3	that you were wondering whether or not you should go to the observance-day procedure and the legal procedures of the Sangha?” 
pli-tv-kd2:5.5.4	“Yes, Venerable Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd2:5.5.5	“If you brahmins don’t honor and revere the observance day, then who will? 
pli-tv-kd2:5.5.6	Go to the observance-day procedure, brahmin, 
pli-tv-kd2:5.5.7	and go to the legal procedures of the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-kd2:5.5.8	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd2:5.6.1	The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching. 
pli-tv-kd2:5.6.2	Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch his arm, so too the Buddha disappeared from the presence of Mahākappina and reappeared on the Vulture Peak. 
pli-tv-kd2:6.1.0	4. The allowance for monastic boundaries 
pli-tv-kd2:6.1.1	When they knew 
pli-tv-kd2:6.1.2	that the Buddha had laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd2:6.1.3	that a complete assembly extends as far as one monastery, the monks thought, “How far does a single monastery extend?” 
pli-tv-kd2:6.1.4	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd2:6.1.5	“I allow you to establish a monastic boundary. 
pli-tv-kd2:6.1.6	And it should be established like this. 
pli-tv-kd2:6.1.7	First the boundary markers should be announced: 
pli-tv-kd2:6.1.8	a hill, a rock, a forest grove, a tree, a path, an anthill, a river, a lake. 
pli-tv-kd2:6.1.9	Then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd2:6.1.10	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:6.1.11	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, then based on the boundary markers that have been announced, 
pli-tv-kd2:6.1.12	the Sangha should establish a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together. 
pli-tv-kd2:6.1.13	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd2:6.2.1	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:6.2.2	Based on the boundary markers that have been announced, 
pli-tv-kd2:6.2.3	the Sangha establishes a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together. 
pli-tv-kd2:6.2.4	Any monk who approves of establishing, based on these boundary markers, a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd2:6.2.5	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd2:6.2.6	The Sangha has established, based on these boundary markers, a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together. 
pli-tv-kd2:6.2.7	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd2:7.1.1	When they knew 
pli-tv-kd2:7.1.2	that the Buddha had given the allowance to establish a boundary, 
pli-tv-kd2:7.1.3	the monks from the group of six established boundaries that were too extensive: 50, 65, and even 80 kilometers. 
pli-tv-kd2:7.1.4	Monks going to the observance-day procedure arrived while the Monastic Code was being recited or just after it had been recited, and they had to stay overnight on the way. 
pli-tv-kd2:7.1.6	“You should not establish a boundary that is too extensive, either 50, 65, or 80 kilometers. 
pli-tv-kd2:7.1.7	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:7.1.8	You should establish a boundary that is 40 kilometers at the most.” 
pli-tv-kd2:7.2.1	At one time the monks from the group of six had established a boundary that crossed a river. 
pli-tv-kd2:7.2.2	Monks who were coming to the observance-day procedure were swept away by the current, as were their bowls and robes. 
pli-tv-kd2:7.2.4	“You should not establish a boundary that crosses a river. 
pli-tv-kd2:7.2.5	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct 
pli-tv-kd2:7.2.6	I allow you to establish a boundary that crosses a river only if there is a permanent bridge or a ferry connection.” 
pli-tv-kd2:8.1.0	5. Discussion of the observance-day hall 
pli-tv-kd2:8.1.1	At that time the monks recited the Monastic Code in one precincts after another without making a prior appointment. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.1.2	Newly arrived monks did not know 
pli-tv-kd2:8.1.3	where the observance-day procedure was to be held. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.1.4	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd2:8.1.5	“You should not recite the Monastic Code in one precincts after another without making a prior appointment. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.1.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.1.7	I allow you to designate an observance day hall—whether a dwelling, a stilt house, or a cave—for the observance-day procedure. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.1.8	And it should be designated like this. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.2.1	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd2:8.2.2	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.2.3	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should designate such-and-such a dwelling as the observance-day hall. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.2.4	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.2.5	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.2.6	The Sangha designates such-and-such a dwelling as the observance-day hall. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.2.7	Any monk who approves of designating such-and-such a dwelling as the observance-day hall should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.2.8	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.2.9	The Sangha has designated such-and-such a dwelling as the observance-day hall. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.2.10	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd2:8.3.1	Soon afterwards in a certain monastery, they designated two different observance-day halls. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.3.2	Monks gathered in both places, 
pli-tv-kd2:8.3.3	each group thinking, “The observance-day procedure will be done here.” 
pli-tv-kd2:8.3.4	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd2:8.3.5	“You should not designate two different observance-day halls within the same monastery. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.3.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.3.7	You should abolish one of them and do the observance-day procedure in one place. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.4.1	And it should be abolished like this. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.4.2	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd2:8.4.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.4.4	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should abolish such-and-such an observance-day hall. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.4.5	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.4.6	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.4.7	The Sangha abolishes such-and-such an observance-day hall. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.4.8	Any monk who approves of abolishing such-and-such an observance-day hall should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.4.9	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.4.10	The Sangha has abolished such-and-such an observance-day hall. 
pli-tv-kd2:8.4.11	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd2:9.1.0	6. The allowance for an observance-day forecourt 
pli-tv-kd2:9.1.1	At one time in a certain monastery, they had designated an observance-day hall that was too small. On the observance day a large sangha of monks gathered there. 
pli-tv-kd2:9.1.2	Some monks listened to the recitation of the Monastic Code while sitting on the ground outside the designated area. 
pli-tv-kd2:9.1.3	They knew 
pli-tv-kd2:9.1.4	that the Buddha had laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd2:9.1.5	that the observance-day procedure should be done after designating an observance-day hall, and they wondered, “Have we done the observance-day procedure, or have we not?” 
pli-tv-kd2:9.1.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd2:9.1.7	“Whether you listen to the recitation of the Monastic Code while seated within or outside the ground that has been designated, in either case you have done the observance-day procedure. 
pli-tv-kd2:9.2.1	Nevertheless, the Sangha may designate an observance-day forecourt that is as large as you like. 
pli-tv-kd2:9.2.2	And it should be designated like this. 
pli-tv-kd2:9.2.3	First the boundary markers should be announced. 
pli-tv-kd2:9.2.4	Then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd2:9.2.5	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:9.2.6	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, 
pli-tv-kd2:9.2.7	then based on the boundary markers that have been announced, the Sangha should designate an observance-day forecourt. 
pli-tv-kd2:9.2.8	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd2:9.2.9	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:9.2.10	Based on the boundary markers that have been announced, 
pli-tv-kd2:9.2.11	the Sangha designates an observance-day forecourt. 
pli-tv-kd2:9.2.12	Any monk who approves of designating, based on these boundary markers, an observance-day forecourt should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd2:9.2.13	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd2:9.2.14	The Sangha has designated, based on these boundary markers, an observance-day forecourt. 
pli-tv-kd2:9.2.15	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd2:10.1.1	At that time, on the observance day in a certain monastery, the junior monks had gathered first. They thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:10.1.2	“There’s no need to be here until the senior monks arrive,” 
pli-tv-kd2:10.1.3	and they left. 
pli-tv-kd2:10.1.4	As a consequence, the observance-day procedure was done at the wrong time. 
pli-tv-kd2:10.1.6	“On the observance day the senior monks should arrive first.” 
pli-tv-kd2:11.1.1	At that time at Rājagaha, there was a number of monasteries within the same monastic boundary. 
pli-tv-kd2:11.1.2	The monks argued 
pli-tv-kd2:11.1.3	about in which monastery the observance-day procedure should be done. 
pli-tv-kd2:11.1.5	“When there are a number of monasteries within the same boundary 
pli-tv-kd2:11.1.6	and the monks are arguing 
pli-tv-kd2:11.1.7	about where the observance-day procedure should be done, 
pli-tv-kd2:11.1.8	those monks should all gather in one place and do the observance-day procedure there. 
pli-tv-kd2:11.1.9	Or, they should gather wherever the most senior monk is staying. 
pli-tv-kd2:11.1.10	You should not do the observance-day procedure with an incomplete Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd2:11.1.11	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd2:12.1.0	7. The allowance for a may-stay-apart boundary 
pli-tv-kd2:12.1.1	On one occasion Venerable Mahākassapa was coming from Andhakavinda to Rājagaha for the observance-day procedure. As he was crossing a river on the way, he briefly got carried away by the current and his robes got wet. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.1.2	The monks asked him 
pli-tv-kd2:12.1.3	why his robes were wet, 
pli-tv-kd2:12.1.4	and he told them what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.1.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd2:12.1.7	“When the Sangha has established a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together, the Sangha may designate that same boundary as delimiting a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.2.1	And it should be designated like this. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.2.2	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd2:12.2.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.2.4	The Sangha has established a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together. If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha may designate that same boundary as delimiting a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.2.5	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.2.6	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.2.7	The Sangha has established a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together. The Sangha designates that same boundary as delimiting a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.2.8	Any monk who approves of designating this boundary as delimiting a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.2.9	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.2.10	The Sangha has designated this boundary as delimiting a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.2.11	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd2:12.3.1	When they knew that the Buddha had allowed the designation of a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area, monks stored their robes in inhabited areas. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.3.2	The robes were lost, burnt, or eaten by rats. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.3.3	As a consequence, their robes became shabby. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.3.4	Other monks asked them 
pli-tv-kd2:12.3.5	why they were so poorly dressed, 
pli-tv-kd2:12.3.6	and they told them what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.3.8	They then told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd2:12.3.9	“When the Sangha has established a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together, the Sangha may designate that same boundary as delimiting a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area, leaving out inhabited areas and the vicinity of inhabited areas. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.4.1	And it should be designated like this. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.4.2	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd2:12.4.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.4.4	The Sangha has established a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together. If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha may designate that same boundary as delimiting a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area, leaving out inhabited areas and the vicinity of inhabited areas. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.4.5	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.4.6	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.4.7	The Sangha has established a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together. The Sangha designates that same boundary as delimiting a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area, leaving out inhabited areas and the vicinity of inhabited areas. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.4.8	Any monk who approves of designating this boundary as delimiting a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.4.9	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.4.10	The Sangha has designated this boundary as delimiting a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area, leaving out inhabited areas and the vicinity of inhabited areas. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.4.11	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:12.5.0	8. The abolishing of boundaries 
pli-tv-kd2:12.5.1	“Monks, when you’re establishing a boundary, the boundary that defines who belongs to the same community should be established first. Afterwards you may designate the may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.5.2	And when you’re abolishing a boundary, the may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area should be abolished first. Afterwards you may abolish the boundary that defines who belongs to the same community. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.5.3	And the may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area should be abolished like this. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.5.4	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd2:12.5.5	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.5.6	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should abolish the existing designation of a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.5.7	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.5.8	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.5.9	The Sangha abolishes the existing designation of a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.5.10	Any monk who approves of abolishing this area should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.5.11	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.5.12	The Sangha has abolished the may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.5.13	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:12.6.1	And a boundary should be abolished like this. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.6.2	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd2:12.6.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.6.4	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should abolish the established monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.6.5	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.6.6	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.6.7	The Sangha abolishes the established monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.6.8	Any monk who approves of abolishing this boundary should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.6.9	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.6.10	The Sangha has abolished the monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.6.11	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:12.7.0	9. Boundaries for inhabited areas, etc. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.7.1	“There are monks who live supported by inhabited areas where no boundary has been established. In these cases, the boundary of the inhabited area defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.7.2	If it is an uninhabited area in the wilderness, a distance of 80 meters on all sides defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.7.3	A river, 
pli-tv-kd2:12.7.4	an ocean, 
pli-tv-kd2:12.7.5	or a lake cannot form a complete boundary on its own. 
pli-tv-kd2:12.7.6	In a river, in the ocean, and in a lake, the area that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together is the distance an average man can splash water in all directions.” 
pli-tv-kd2:13.1.1	At one time the monks from the group of six created a boundary that crossed an existing boundary. 
pli-tv-kd2:13.1.3	“The establishment of the first boundary is a legitimate legal procedure that is irreversible and fit to stand. 
pli-tv-kd2:13.1.4	The establishment of the subsequent boundary is an illegitimate legal procedure that is reversible and unfit to stand. 
pli-tv-kd2:13.1.5	You should not create boundaries that cross existing boundaries. 
pli-tv-kd2:13.1.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd2:13.2.1	At one time the monks from the group of six enclosed one boundary within another. 
pli-tv-kd2:13.2.3	“The establishment of the first boundary is a legitimate legal procedure that is irreversible and fit to stand. 
pli-tv-kd2:13.2.4	The establishment of the subsequent boundary is an illegitimate legal procedure that is reversible and unfit to stand. 
pli-tv-kd2:13.2.5	You should not create boundaries that enclose existing boundaries. 
pli-tv-kd2:13.2.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:13.2.7	When you establish a boundary, you should leave a gap to any existing boundary.” 
pli-tv-kd2:14.1.0	10. Breach of the observance-day procedure, etc. 
pli-tv-kd2:14.1.1	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:14.1.2	“How many observance days are there?” 
pli-tv-kd2:14.1.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd2:14.1.4	“There are two observance days: the fourteenth and the fifteenth day of the month.” 
pli-tv-kd2:14.2.1	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:14.2.2	“How many observance-day procedures are there?” 
pli-tv-kd2:14.2.4	“There are these four observance-day procedures: 
pli-tv-kd2:14.2.5	The observance-day procedure that is illegitimate and has an incomplete assembly; 
pli-tv-kd2:14.2.6	The observance-day procedure that is illegitimate but has a complete assembly; 
pli-tv-kd2:14.2.7	The observance-day procedure that is legitimate but has an incomplete assembly; 
pli-tv-kd2:14.2.8	The observance-day procedure that is legitimate and has a complete assembly. 
pli-tv-kd2:14.2.9	The first, 
pli-tv-kd2:14.3.1	second, 
pli-tv-kd2:14.3.3	and third of these should not be done; 
pli-tv-kd2:14.3.4	I haven’t allowed such procedures. 
pli-tv-kd2:14.3.5	The fourth should be done; I have allowed such procedures. 
pli-tv-kd2:14.3.6	Therefore, monks, you should train like this: 
pli-tv-kd2:14.3.7	ʻWe will do observance-day ceremonies that are legitimate and have a complete assembly.’” 
pli-tv-kd2:15.1.0	11. The recitation of the Monastic Code in brief, etc. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.1.1	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:15.1.2	“How many ways of reciting the Monastic Code are there?” 
pli-tv-kd2:15.1.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd2:15.1.4	“There are these five ways of reciting the Monastic Code: 
pli-tv-kd2:15.1.5	After reciting the introduction, the rest is announced as if heard. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.1.6	This is the first way of reciting the Monastic Code. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.1.7	After reciting the introduction and the four rules entailing expulsion, the rest is announced as if heard. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.1.8	This is the second way of reciting the Monastic Code. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.1.9	After reciting the introduction, the four rules entailing expulsion, and the thirteen rules entailing suspension, the rest is announced as if heard. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.1.10	This is the third way of reciting the Monastic Code. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.1.11	After reciting the introduction, the four rules entailing expulsion, the thirteen rules entailing suspension, and the two undetermined rules, the rest is announced as if heard. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.1.12	This is the fourth way of reciting the Monastic Code. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.1.13	In full is the fifth.” 
pli-tv-kd2:15.2.1	When they knew 
pli-tv-kd2:15.2.2	that the Buddha had allowed the recitation of the Monastic Code in brief, 
pli-tv-kd2:15.2.3	some monks recited it in brief all the time. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.2.5	“You should not recite the Monastic Code in brief. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.2.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd2:15.3.1	At that time, on the observance day in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country, there was danger from savages. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.3.2	The monks were not able to recite the Monastic Code in full. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.3.4	“I allow you to recite the Monastic Code in brief when there are dangers.” 
pli-tv-kd2:15.4.1	But the monks from the group of six recited the Monastic Code in brief even when there were no dangers. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.4.3	“You should not recite the Monastic Code in brief when there are no dangers. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.4.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.4.5	I allow you to recite the Monastic Code in brief when there are any of these dangers: 
pli-tv-kd2:15.4.7	danger from kings, danger from bandits, danger from fire, danger from floods, danger from people, danger from spirits, danger from predatory animals, danger from snakes, a life-threatening danger, a danger to living the spiritual life.” 
pli-tv-kd2:15.5.1	On one occasion the monks from the group of six gave teachings in the midst of the Sangha without being requested. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.5.3	“You should not give teachings in the midst of the Sangha without being requested. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.5.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.5.5	I allow the most senior monk either to give a teaching himself or to request another.” 
pli-tv-kd2:15.6.0	12. Discussion of questioning on the Monastic Law 
pli-tv-kd2:15.6.1	On one occasion the monks from the group of six questioned others on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha without being approved. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.6.3	“You should not question others on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha without being approved. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.6.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.6.5	I allow you to question others on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha after being approved. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.6.6	And you should be approved like this: 
pli-tv-kd2:15.6.7	either you should be approved through yourself or you should be approved through another. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.7.1	And how are you approved through yourself? 
pli-tv-kd2:15.7.2	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd2:15.7.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.7.4	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will question so-and-so on the Monastic Law.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:15.7.5	In this way you are approved through yourself. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.7.6	And how are you approved through another? 
pli-tv-kd2:15.7.7	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd2:15.7.8	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.7.9	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, so-and-so will question so-and-so on the Monastic Law.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:15.7.10	In this way you are approved through another.” 
pli-tv-kd2:15.8.1	Soon good monks asked questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha after being approved. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.8.2	The monks from the group of six became angry and bitter, and they made threats of violence. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.8.4	“The monk who has been approved should first survey the gathering and evaluate the individuals and then ask questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-kd2:15.9.0	13. Discussion of replying to questions on the Monastic Law 
pli-tv-kd2:15.9.1	On one occasion the monks from the group of six replied to questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha without being approved. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.9.3	“You should not reply to questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha without being approved. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.9.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.9.5	I allow you to reply to questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha after being approved. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.9.6	And one should be approved like this: 
pli-tv-kd2:15.9.7	either you should be approved through yourself or you should be approved through another. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.10.1	And how are you approved through yourself? 
pli-tv-kd2:15.10.2	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd2:15.10.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.10.4	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will reply when asked by so-and-so on the Monastic Law.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:15.10.5	In this way you are approved through yourself. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.10.6	And how are you approved through another? 
pli-tv-kd2:15.10.7	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd2:15.10.8	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.10.9	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, so-and-so will reply when asked by so-and-so on the Monastic Law.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:15.10.10	In this way you are approved through another.” 
pli-tv-kd2:15.11.1	Soon good monks replied to questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha after being approved. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.11.2	The monks from the group of six became angry and bitter, and they made threats of violence. 
pli-tv-kd2:15.11.4	“The monk who has been approved should first survey the gathering and evaluate the individuals and then reply to questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-kd2:16.1.0	14. Discussion of accusing 
pli-tv-kd2:16.1.1	At one time the monks from the group of six accused a monk of an offense without first getting his permission to do so. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.1.3	“You should not accuse a monk of an offense without first getting his permission to do so. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.1.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.1.5	You should only accuse someone of an offense after getting their permission: 
pli-tv-kd2:16.1.6	ʻVenerable, I wish to speak to you; please give me permission.’” 
pli-tv-kd2:16.2.1	Soon, after getting their permission, good monks accused the monks from the group of six of an offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.2.2	The monks from the group of six became angry and bitter, and they made threats of violence. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.2.4	“Even when you have their permission, you should first evaluate the individual and then accuse them of an offense.” 
pli-tv-kd2:16.3.1	At this time the monks from the group of six—thinking to act before the good monks asked them for permission, but having no grounds or reasons—got permission from pure monks who had not committed any offenses. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.3.3	“When you have no grounds or reasons, you should not get permission from pure monks who haven’t committed any offenses. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.3.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.3.5	And you should give permission only after evaluating the individual.” 
pli-tv-kd2:16.4.0	15. Objecting to an illegitimate legal procedure, etc. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.4.1	On one occasion the monks from the group of six did an illegitimate legal procedure in the midst of the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.4.3	“You should not do illegitimate legal procedures. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.4.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd2:16.4.5	They still did illegitimate procedures. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.4.7	“You should object when an illegitimate legal procedure is being done.” 
pli-tv-kd2:16.5.1	Soon afterwards good monks objected when the monks from the group of six did an illegitimate procedure. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.5.2	The monks from the group of six became angry and bitter, and they made threats of violence. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.5.4	“I allow you to just state your view.” 
pli-tv-kd2:16.5.5	They did so. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.5.6	Once again the monks from the group of six became angry and bitter, and they made threats of violence. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.5.8	“A group of four or five should object, a group of two or three may state their view, and a single person may make a silent determination: 
pli-tv-kd2:16.5.9	ʻI don’t approve of this.’” 
pli-tv-kd2:16.6.1	On one occasion when the monks from the group of six were reciting the Monastic Code in the midst of the Sangha, they deliberately made themselves inaudible. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.6.3	“When reciting the Monastic Code, you should not deliberately make yourselves inaudible. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.6.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd2:16.7.1	At one time Venerable Udāyī was the Sangha’s reciter of the Monastic Code, but he had a hoarse voice. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.7.2	He knew 
pli-tv-kd2:16.7.3	that the Buddha had laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd2:16.7.4	that the reciter of the Monastic Code should make themselves heard, and he thought, ʻI have a hoarse voice, so what should I do?’ 
pli-tv-kd2:16.7.6	“The reciter of the Monastic Code should make an effort 
pli-tv-kd2:16.7.7	to be heard. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.7.8	If you make an effort, there’s no offense.” 
pli-tv-kd2:16.8.1	On one occasion Devadatta recited the Monastic Code in a gathering that included lay people. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.8.3	“You should not recite the Monastic Code in a gathering that includes lay people. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.8.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd2:16.9.1	On one occasion the monks from the group of six recited the Monastic Code in the midst of the Sangha without being requested. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.9.3	“You should not recite the Monastic Code in the midst of the Sangha without first being requested to do so. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.9.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:16.9.5	The most senior monk should be in charge of the recitation of the Monastic Code.” 
pli-tv-kd2:16.9.6	The first section for recitation on monastics of other religions is finished. 
pli-tv-kd2:17.1.0	16. Requesting the recitation of the Monastic Code, etc. 
pli-tv-kd2:17.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Codanāvatthu. 
pli-tv-kd2:17.1.2	When he eventually arrived, he stayed there. 
pli-tv-kd2:17.1.3	On that occasion a number of monks were staying in a certain monastery 
pli-tv-kd2:17.1.4	where the most senior monk was ignorant and incompetent. 
pli-tv-kd2:17.1.5	He did not know about the observance-day or the observance-day procedure, nor about the Monastic Code or its recitation. 
pli-tv-kd2:17.2.1	The other monks knew 
pli-tv-kd2:17.2.2	that the Buddha had laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd2:17.2.3	that the most senior monk should be in charge of the recitation of the Monastic Code, 
pli-tv-kd2:17.2.4	and so they wondered what to do. 
pli-tv-kd2:17.2.5	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd2:17.2.6	“In such a case a competent and capable monk should be in charge of the recitation of the Monastic Code.” 
pli-tv-kd2:17.3.1	On one occasion on the observance day, a number of ignorant and incompetent monks were staying in a certain monastery. 
pli-tv-kd2:17.3.2	They did not know about the observance-day or the observance-day procedure, nor about the Monastic Code or its recitation. 
pli-tv-kd2:17.3.3	They requested the most senior monk 
pli-tv-kd2:17.3.4	to recite the Monastic Code, 
pli-tv-kd2:17.3.5	but he replied 
pli-tv-kd2:17.3.6	that he could not. 
pli-tv-kd2:17.3.7	They asked the same question of the second-most 
pli-tv-kd2:17.3.11	and third-most senior monks, 
pli-tv-kd2:17.3.13	and on both occasions 
pli-tv-kd2:17.3.14	received the same reply. 
pli-tv-kd2:17.3.15	In the same way they then requested 
pli-tv-kd2:17.3.16	each monk in turn until they reached the most junior monk. 
pli-tv-kd2:17.3.17	And they all gave the same reply. 
pli-tv-kd2:17.4.3	“When all the monks in a monastery are ignorant and incompetent, 
pli-tv-kd2:17.4.4	and none of them is able to recite the Monastic Code, 
pli-tv-kd2:17.5.1	they should straightaway send one monk to a neighboring monastery 
pli-tv-kd2:17.5.2	to learn the Monastic Code, either in brief or in full.” 
pli-tv-kd2:17.6.1	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:17.6.2	“Who is responsible for sending someone?” 
pli-tv-kd2:17.6.4	“I allow the most senior monk to tell a junior monk to go.” 
pli-tv-kd2:17.6.5	When told by the most senior monk, the junior monks did not go. 
pli-tv-kd2:17.6.7	“If a monk isn’t sick and he’s told by the most senior monk to go, he should go. 
pli-tv-kd2:17.6.8	If he doesn’t, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd2:18.1.0	17. The instruction to learn the number of the lunar half-month, etc. 
pli-tv-kd2:18.1.1	When he had stayed at Codanāvatthu for as long as he liked, the Buddha returned to Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd2:18.1.2	Then, while the monks were walking for almsfood, people asked them, 
pli-tv-kd2:18.1.3	“Venerables, which half-month is it?” 
pli-tv-kd2:18.1.4	The monks replied 
pli-tv-kd2:18.1.5	that they did not know. 
pli-tv-kd2:18.1.6	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd2:18.1.7	“These Sakyan monastics don’t even know the number of the lunar half-month. How then could they know anything truly useful?” 
pli-tv-kd2:18.1.8	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd2:18.1.9	“You should learn the counting of the lunar half-months.” 
pli-tv-kd2:18.2.1	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:18.2.2	“Who should learn the counting of the lunar half-months?” 
pli-tv-kd2:18.2.4	“You should all learn the counting of the lunar half-months.” 
pli-tv-kd2:18.3.1	On another occasion, while the monks were walking for almsfood, people asked them, 
pli-tv-kd2:18.3.2	“Venerables, how many monks are there?” 
pli-tv-kd2:18.3.3	The monks replied 
pli-tv-kd2:18.3.4	that they did not know. 
pli-tv-kd2:18.3.5	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd2:18.3.6	“These Sakyan monastics don’t even know about one another. How then could they know anything truly useful?” 
pli-tv-kd2:18.3.8	“You should count the monks.” 
pli-tv-kd2:18.4.1	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:18.4.2	“When should we count the monks?” 
pli-tv-kd2:18.4.4	“You should count the monks on the observance day, either by name or by distributing tickets.” 
pli-tv-kd2:19.1.1	On one occasion, not knowing that it was the observance day, monks walked for almsfood in a faraway village. 
pli-tv-kd2:19.1.2	They arrived back while the Monastic Code was being recited or even just after it had been recited. 
pli-tv-kd2:19.1.4	“You should announce, ʻToday is the observance day.’” 
pli-tv-kd2:19.1.5	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:19.1.6	“Who should make the announcement?” 
pli-tv-kd2:19.1.8	“The most senior monk should make the announcement early in the morning.” 
pli-tv-kd2:19.1.9	Soon afterwards the senior monk forgot to make the announcement early in the morning. 
pli-tv-kd2:19.1.11	“I allow him to make the announcement at the mealtime, too.” 
pli-tv-kd2:19.1.12	He forgot to make the announcement at the mealtime, too. 
pli-tv-kd2:19.1.14	“I allow him to make the announcement whenever he remembers.” 
pli-tv-kd2:20.1.0	18. The instruction to do the prior duties 
pli-tv-kd2:20.1.1	At one time in a certain monastery, the observance-day hall was dirty. 
pli-tv-kd2:20.1.2	Newly arrived monks complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd2:20.1.3	“How can the resident monks not sweep the hall?” 
pli-tv-kd2:20.1.4	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd2:20.1.5	“You should sweep the observance-day hall.” 
pli-tv-kd2:20.2.1	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:20.2.2	“Who should sweep the hall?” 
pli-tv-kd2:20.2.4	“I allow the most senior monk to tell a junior monk.” 
pli-tv-kd2:20.2.5	When told by the senior monk, the junior monks did not sweep. 
pli-tv-kd2:20.2.7	“If a monk isn’t sick and he’s told by the senior monk to sweep, he should sweep. 
pli-tv-kd2:20.2.8	If he doesn’t, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd2:20.3.1	On one occasion seats were not prepared in the observance-day hall. 
pli-tv-kd2:20.3.2	The monks sat on the ground. They became dirty, as did their robes. 
pli-tv-kd2:20.3.4	“You should prepare seats in the observance-day hall.” 
pli-tv-kd2:20.3.5	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:20.3.6	“Who should prepare the seats in the hall?” 
pli-tv-kd2:20.3.8	“I allow the most senior monk to tell a junior monk.” 
pli-tv-kd2:20.3.9	When told by the senior monk, the junior monks did not prepare them. 
pli-tv-kd2:20.3.11	“If a monk isn’t sick and he’s told by the senior monk to prepare the seats, he should do so. 
pli-tv-kd2:20.3.12	If he doesn’t, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd2:20.4.1	On one occasion there was no lamp in the observance-day hall. 
pli-tv-kd2:20.4.2	Because it was dark, the monks stepped on one another and on one another’s robes. 
pli-tv-kd2:20.4.4	“You should light a lamp in the observance-day hall.” 
pli-tv-kd2:20.4.5	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:20.4.6	“Who should light the lamp in the hall?” 
pli-tv-kd2:20.4.8	“I allow the most senior monk to tell a junior monk.” 
pli-tv-kd2:20.4.9	When told by the senior monk, the junior monks did not light a lamp. 
pli-tv-kd2:20.4.11	“If a monk isn’t sick and he’s told by the senior monk to light a lamp, he should do so. 
pli-tv-kd2:20.4.12	If he doesn’t, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd2:20.5.1	On one occasion in a certain monastery, the resident monks neither set out water for drinking nor water for washing. 
pli-tv-kd2:20.5.2	Newly arrived monks complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd2:20.5.3	“How can the resident monks neither set out water for drinking nor water for washing?” 
pli-tv-kd2:20.5.5	“You should set out water for drinking and water for washing.” 
pli-tv-kd2:20.6.1	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:20.6.2	“Who should set them out?” 
pli-tv-kd2:20.6.4	“I allow the most senior monk to tell a junior monk.” 
pli-tv-kd2:20.6.5	When told by the senior monk, the junior monks did not set them out. 
pli-tv-kd2:20.6.7	“If a monk isn’t sick and he’s told by the senior monk to set them out, he should do so. 
pli-tv-kd2:20.6.8	If he doesn’t, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd2:21.1.0	19. Those going to the districts, etc. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.1.1	On one occasion a number of ignorant and incompetent monks asked permission of their teachers and preceptors to go to the districts. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.1.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd2:21.1.3	“It may happen that a number of ignorant and incompetent monks ask permission of their teachers and preceptors to go to the districts. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.1.4	The teachers and preceptors should then ask them 
pli-tv-kd2:21.1.5	where they’re going and who they’re going with. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.1.6	If they’re going with others who are ignorant and incompetent, the teachers and preceptors shouldn’t give them permission. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.1.7	If they do, they commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.1.8	And if the students go without the permission of their teachers and preceptors, they commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.2.1	“It may happen that a number of ignorant and incompetent monks are staying in a certain monastery. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.2.2	They don’t know about the observance-day or the observance-day procedure, nor about the Monastic Code or its recitation. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.2.3	Then a monk arrives who is learned and a master of the tradition; who is an expert on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; who is knowledgeable and competent, has a sense of conscience, and is afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.2.4	Those monks should treat that learned monk with kindness; they should assist him and support him, and they should attend on him with bath powder, soap, tooth cleaner, and water for rinsing the mouth. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.2.5	If they don’t look after him in this way, they commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.3.1	“On the observance day it may happen that a number of ignorant and incompetent monks are staying in a certain monastery. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.3.2	They don’t know about the observance-day or the observance-day procedure, nor about the Monastic Code or its recitation. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.3.3	They should straightaway send one monk to a neighboring monastery 
pli-tv-kd2:21.3.4	to learn the Monastic Code, either in brief or in full. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.3.5	If he’s able to do so, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.3.6	If not, then those monks should all go to a monastery where the monks know about the observance-day and the observance-day procedure, about the Monastic Code and its recitation. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.3.7	If they don’t go, they commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.4.1	“It may happen that a number of ignorant and incompetent monks are spending the rainy-season residence in a certain monastery. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.4.2	They don’t know about the observance-day or the observance-day procedure, nor about the Monastic Code or its recitation. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.4.3	They should straightaway send one monk to a neighboring monastery 
pli-tv-kd2:21.4.4	to learn the Monastic Code, either in brief or in full. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.4.5	If he’s able to do so, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.4.6	If not, then one monk should be sent under the seven-day allowance 
pli-tv-kd2:21.4.7	to learn the Monastic Code, either in brief or in full. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.4.8	If he’s able to do so, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.4.9	If not, then those monks should not spend the rainy-season residence in that monastery. 
pli-tv-kd2:21.4.10	If they do, they commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd2:22.1.0	20. Discussion of the passing on of purity 
pli-tv-kd2:22.1.1	Then the Buddha addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd2:22.1.2	“Gather, monks, for the Sangha to do the observance-day procedure.” 
pli-tv-kd2:22.1.3	A monk said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.1.4	“Venerable Sir, there’s a sick monk. He hasn’t come.” 
pli-tv-kd2:22.1.5	“I allow a sick monk to pass on his purity. 
pli-tv-kd2:22.1.6	And it should be passed on like this. 
pli-tv-kd2:22.1.7	The sick monk should approach a monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, and squat on his heels. He should then raise his joined palms and say, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.1.8	ʻI pass on my purity; please convey my purity; please announce my purity.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:22.1.9	If he makes this understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then the purity has been passed on. 
pli-tv-kd2:22.1.10	If he doesn’t make this understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then the purity hasn’t been passed on. 
pli-tv-kd2:22.2.1	If he’s able to do this, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd2:22.2.2	If not, then the sick monk should be brought into the midst of the Sangha together with his bed or bench. They can then do the observance-day procedure. 
pli-tv-kd2:22.2.3	But if the one who is nursing the sick monk says, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.2.4	ʻIf we move him, his illness will get worse, or he’ll die,’ then the sick monk shouldn’t be moved. 
pli-tv-kd2:22.2.5	The Sangha should go to where the sick monk is and do the observance-day procedure there. 
pli-tv-kd2:22.2.6	But you should not do the observance-day procedure with an incomplete Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd2:22.2.7	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.1	“If, after the purity has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the purity departs right there, then the purity should be passed on to another. 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.2	If, after the purity has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the purity disrobes right there, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.3	dies right there, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.4	admits right there that he’s a novice monk, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.5	admits right there that he’s renounced the training, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.6	admits right there that he’s committed the worst kind of offense, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.7	admits right there that he’s insane, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.8	admits right there that he’s deranged, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.9	admits right there that he’s overwhelmed by pain, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.10	admits right there that he’s been ejected for not recognizing an offense, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.11	admits right there that he’s been ejected for not making amends for an offense, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.12	admits right there that he’s been ejected for not giving up a bad view, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.13	admits right there that he’s a _paṇḍaka_, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.14	admits right there that he’s living in the community by theft, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.15	admits right there that he’s previously left to join the monastics of another religion, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.16	admits right there that he’s an animal, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.17	admits right there that he’s a matricide, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.18	admits right there that he’s a patricide, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.19	admits right there that he’s a murderer of a perfected one, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.20	admits right there that he’s raped a nun, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.21	admits right there that he’s caused a schism in the Sangha, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.22	admits right there that he’s caused the Buddha to bleed, 
pli-tv-kd2:22.3.23	or admits right there that he’s a hermaphrodite, then the purity should be passed on to another. 
pli-tv-kd2:22.4.1	If, after the purity has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the purity departs while on his way to the observance-day procedure, then the purity hasn’t been brought. 
pli-tv-kd2:22.4.2	If, after the purity has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the purity disrobes while on his way to the observance-day procedure … 
pli-tv-kd2:22.4.3	admits that he’s a hermaphrodite while on his way to the observance-day procedure, then the purity hasn’t been brought. 
pli-tv-kd2:22.4.4	But even if, after the purity has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the purity departs after reaching the Sangha, then the purity has been brought. 
pli-tv-kd2:22.4.5	And even if, after the purity has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the purity disrobes after reaching the Sangha … 
pli-tv-kd2:22.4.6	admits that he’s a hermaphrodite after reaching the Sangha, then the purity has been brought. 
pli-tv-kd2:22.4.7	And even if, after the purity has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the purity reaches the Sangha, but doesn’t announce the purity because he falls asleep or is heedless or gains a meditation attainment, then the purity has been brought. 
pli-tv-kd2:22.4.8	And there’s no offense for the one who is conveying the purity. 
pli-tv-kd2:22.4.9	And even if, after the purity has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the purity reaches the Sangha, but deliberately doesn’t announce the purity, then the purity has been brought. 
pli-tv-kd2:22.4.10	But there’s an offense of wrong conduct for the one who is conveying the purity.” 
pli-tv-kd2:23.1.0	21. Discussion on giving consent 
pli-tv-kd2:23.1.1	Then the Buddha addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd2:23.1.2	“Gather, monks, for the Sangha to do a legal procedure.” 
pli-tv-kd2:23.1.3	A monk said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd2:23.1.4	“Sir, there’s a sick monk. He hasn’t come.” 
pli-tv-kd2:23.1.5	“I allow a sick monk to give his consent. 
pli-tv-kd2:23.1.6	And it should be given like this. 
pli-tv-kd2:23.1.7	The sick monk should approach a monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, and squat on his heels. He should then raise his joined palms and say, 
pli-tv-kd2:23.1.8	ʻI give my consent; please convey my consent; please announce my consent.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:23.1.9	If he makes this understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then the consent has been given. 
pli-tv-kd2:23.1.10	If he doesn’t make this understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then the consent hasn’t been given. 
pli-tv-kd2:23.2.1	If he’s able to do this, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd2:23.2.2	If not, then the sick monk should be brought into the midst of the Sangha together with his bed or bench, and the procedure can then be done. 
pli-tv-kd2:23.2.3	But if the one who is nursing the sick monk says, 
pli-tv-kd2:23.2.4	ʻIf we move him, his illness will get worse, or he’ll die,’ then the sick monk shouldn’t be moved. 
pli-tv-kd2:23.2.5	The Sangha should go to where the sick monk is and do the procedure there. 
pli-tv-kd2:23.2.6	But you should not do a legal procedure with an incomplete Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd2:23.2.7	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.1	“If, after the consent has been given to him, the monk who is conveying the consent departs right there, then the consent should be given to another. 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.2	If, after the consent has been given to him, the monk who is conveying the consent disrobes right there, 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.3	dies right there, 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.4	admits right there that he’s a novice monk, 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.5	admits right there that he’s renounced the training, 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.6	admits right there that he’s committed the worst kind of offense, 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.7	admits right there that he’s insane,

pli-tv-kd2:23.3.11	admits right there that he’s been ejected for not making amends for an offense, 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.12	admits right there that he’s been ejected for not giving up a bad view, 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.13	admits right there that he’s a _paṇḍaka_,

pli-tv-kd2:23.3.22	admits right there that he’s caused the Buddha to bleed, 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.23	or admits right there that he’s a hermaphrodite, then the consent should be given to another. 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.24	If, after the consent has been given to him, the monk who is conveying the consent departs while on his way to the legal procedure, then the consent hasn’t been brought. 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.25	If, after the consent has been given to him, the monk who is conveying the consent disrobes while on his way to the legal procedure … 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.26	or admits that he’s a hermaphrodite while on his way to the legal procedure, then the consent hasn’t been brought. 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.27	And even if, after the consent has been given to him, the monk who is conveying the consent departs after reaching the Sangha, then the consent has been brought. 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.28	And even if, after the consent has been given to him, the monk who is conveying the consent disrobes after reaching the Sangha … 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.29	admits that he’s a hermaphrodite after reaching the Sangha, then the consent has been brought. 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.30	And even if, after the consent has been given to him, the monk who is conveying the consent reaches the Sangha, but doesn’t announce the consent because he falls asleep or is heedless or gains a meditation attainment, then the consent has been brought. 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.31	And there’s no offense for the one who is conveying the consent. 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.32	And even if, after the consent has been given to him, the monk who is conveying the consent reaches the Sangha, but deliberately doesn’t announce the consent, then the consent has been brought. 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.33	But there is an offense of wrong conduct for the one who is conveying the consent. 
pli-tv-kd2:23.3.34	On the observance day, if the Sangha has business to be done, then anyone passing on his purity should also give his consent.” 
pli-tv-kd2:24.1.0	22. Discussion of being seized by relatives, etc. 
pli-tv-kd2:24.1.1	On one occasion on the observance day, a certain monk was seized by his relatives. 
pli-tv-kd2:24.1.3	“If on the observance day a monk is seized by his relatives, 
pli-tv-kd2:24.1.4	other monks should say to those relatives, 
pli-tv-kd2:24.1.5	ʻPlease release this monk for a short time, so that he can take part in the observance-day procedure.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:24.2.1	If they’re able to do this, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd2:24.2.2	If not, they should say to those relatives, 
pli-tv-kd2:24.2.3	ʻPlease step to one side for a moment while this monk passes on his purity.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:24.2.4	If they’re able to do this, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd2:24.2.5	If not, they should say to those relatives, 
pli-tv-kd2:24.2.6	ʻPlease take this monk outside the monastic boundary for a short time while the Sangha does the observance-day procedure.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:24.2.7	If they’re able to do this, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd2:24.2.8	If not, you should not do the observance-day procedure with an incomplete Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd2:24.2.9	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:24.3.1	If on the observance day a monk is seized by kings, 
pli-tv-kd2:24.3.2	by bandits, 
pli-tv-kd2:24.3.3	by scoundrels, 
pli-tv-kd2:24.3.4	or by enemies of monks, other monks should say to those enemies, 
pli-tv-kd2:24.3.5	ʻPlease release this monk for a short time, so that he can take part in the observance-day procedure.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:24.3.6	If they’re able to do this, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd2:24.3.7	If not, they should say to those enemies, 
pli-tv-kd2:24.3.8	ʻPlease step to one side for a moment while this monk passes on his purity.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:24.3.9	If they’re able to do this, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd2:24.3.10	If not, they should say to those enemies,

pli-tv-kd2:24.3.12	If they’re able to do this, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd2:24.3.13	If not, you should not do the observance-day procedure with an incomplete Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd2:24.3.14	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd2:25.1.0	23. Approval in regard to insanity 
pli-tv-kd2:25.1.1	Then the Buddha addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd2:25.1.2	“Gather, monks, there’s business for the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-kd2:25.1.3	A monk said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd2:25.1.4	“Venerable Sir, there’s a monk called Gagga who is insane. He hasn’t come.” 
pli-tv-kd2:25.1.5	“Monks, there are two kinds of insane monks: 
pli-tv-kd2:25.1.6	there is the insane monk who sometimes remembers the observance-day and sometimes doesn’t, who sometimes remembers the legal procedures of the Sangha and sometimes doesn’t, 
pli-tv-kd2:25.1.7	who sometimes goes to the observance-day procedure and sometimes doesn’t, who sometimes goes to the legal procedures of the Sangha and sometimes doesn’t; and there’s the insane monk who never remembers any of this. 
pli-tv-kd2:25.2.1	For the first one of these two, I allow you to give approval in regard to insanity. 
pli-tv-kd2:25.3.1	And it should be given like this. 
pli-tv-kd2:25.3.2	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd2:25.3.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:25.3.4	The monk Gagga is insane. 
pli-tv-kd2:25.3.5	Sometimes he remembers the observance-day and sometimes he does not; sometimes he remembers the legal procedures of the Sangha and sometimes he does not; sometimes he goes to the observance-day procedure and sometimes he does not; sometimes he goes to the legal procedures of the Sangha and sometimes he does not. 
pli-tv-kd2:25.3.6	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should agree on the following in regard to the insanity of the monk Gagga: 
pli-tv-kd2:25.3.7	whether or not Gagga remembers either the observance-day or the legal procedures of the Sangha, whether or not he comes to either, the Sangha should do the observance-day procedure, it should do the legal procedures of the Sangha, with or without Gagga. 
pli-tv-kd2:25.3.8	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd2:25.4.1	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:25.4.2	The monk Gagga is insane. 
pli-tv-kd2:25.4.3	Sometimes he remembers the observance-day procedure and sometimes he does not; sometimes he remembers the legal procedures of the Sangha and sometimes he does not; sometimes he goes to the observance-day procedure and sometimes he does not; sometimes he goes to the legal procedures of the Sangha and sometimes he does not. 
pli-tv-kd2:25.4.4	The Sangha agrees on the following in regard to the insanity of the monk Gagga: 
pli-tv-kd2:25.4.5	whether or not Gagga remembers either the observance-day procedure or the legal procedures of the Sangha, whether or not he comes to either, the Sangha should do the observance-day procedure, it should do the legal procedures of the Sangha, with or without Gagga. 
pli-tv-kd2:25.4.6	Any monk who approves of this agreement 
pli-tv-kd2:25.4.7	should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd2:25.4.8	Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd2:25.4.9	The Sangha has agreed in regard to the insanity of the monk Gagga. 
pli-tv-kd2:25.4.11	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd2:26.1.0	24. Various kinds of observance days for the Sangha, etc. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.1.1	At one time on the observance day, there were four monks staying in a certain monastery. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.1.2	They thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:26.1.3	“The Buddha has laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd2:26.1.4	that the observance-day procedure should be done. But there’s only four of us. How should we do the observance-day procedure?” 
pli-tv-kd2:26.1.5	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd2:26.1.6	“When there are four of you, you should recite the Monastic Code.” 
pli-tv-kd2:26.2.1	At one time on the observance day, there were three monks staying in a certain monastery. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.2.2	They thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:26.2.3	“The Buddha has instructed that the Monastic Code should be recited when there are four. But there’s only three of us. How should we do the observance-day procedure?” 
pli-tv-kd2:26.2.5	“When there are three of you, you should do the observance-day procedure by declaring your purity. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.3.1	And it should be done like this. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.3.2	A competent and capable monk should inform those monks: 
pli-tv-kd2:26.3.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.3.4	Today is the observance day, the fifteenth. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.3.5	If it seems appropriate to the venerables, we should do the observance-day procedure by declaring purity to one another.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:26.3.6	The most senior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the other monks: 
pli-tv-kd2:26.3.7	ʻI’m pure; 
pli-tv-kd2:26.3.8	please remember me as pure.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:26.3.9	And he should repeat this two more times. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.4.1	A junior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the other monks: 
pli-tv-kd2:26.4.2	ʻI’m pure, Venerable; 
pli-tv-kd2:26.4.3	please remember me as pure.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:26.4.4	And he should repeat this two more times.” 
pli-tv-kd2:26.5.1	At one time on the observance day, there were two monks staying in a certain monastery. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.5.2	They thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:26.5.3	“The Buddha has instructed that the Monastic Code should be recited when there are four and that the observance-day procedure should be done by declaring purity when there are three. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.5.4	But there’s only two of us. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.5.5	How should we do the observance-day procedure?” 
pli-tv-kd2:26.5.7	“When there are two of you, you should do the observance-day procedure by declaring your purity. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.6.1	And it should be done like this: 
pli-tv-kd2:26.6.2	The most senior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the junior monk: 
pli-tv-kd2:26.6.3	ʻI’m pure; 
pli-tv-kd2:26.6.4	please remember me as pure.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:26.6.5	And he should repeat this two more times. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.7.1	The junior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the senior monk: 
pli-tv-kd2:26.7.2	ʻI’m pure, Venerable; 
pli-tv-kd2:26.7.3	please remember me as pure.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:26.7.4	And he should repeat this two more times.” 
pli-tv-kd2:26.8.1	At one time on the observance day, a monk was staying in a certain monastery by himself. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.8.2	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:26.8.3	“The Buddha has instructed that the Monastic Code should be recited when there are four and that the observance-day procedure should be done by declaring purity when there are two or three. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.8.4	But I’m here by myself. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.8.5	How should I do the observance-day procedure?” 
pli-tv-kd2:26.9.1	“On the observance day it may happen that a monk is staying by himself in a certain monastery. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.9.2	That monk should sweep whatever place the monks normally go to: whether the assembly hall, under a roof-cover, or at the foot of a tree. He should set out water for drinking and water for washing, should prepare a seat, light a lamp, and sit down. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.9.3	If other monks come, he should do the observance-day procedure with them. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.9.4	If not, he should determine: ʻToday is my observance day.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:26.9.5	If he doesn’t make a determination, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.10.1	“Wherever four monks are staying together, three shouldn’t recite the Monastic Code while one sends his purity. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.10.2	If you do recite it in this way, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.10.3	Wherever three monks are staying together, two shouldn’t do the observance-day procedure by declaring purity while one sends his purity. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.10.4	If you do it in this way, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.10.5	Wherever two monks are staying together, one shouldn’t makes a determination while one sends his purity. 
pli-tv-kd2:26.10.6	If you do make determination in this way, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd2:27.1.0	25. The process for making amends for an offense 
pli-tv-kd2:27.1.1	At one time on the observance day, a certain monk had committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.1.2	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:27.1.3	“The Buddha has laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd2:27.1.4	that one shouldn’t do the observance-day procedure if one has an offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.1.5	But I’ve committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.1.6	So what should I do?” 
pli-tv-kd2:27.1.7	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd2:27.1.8	“On the observance day it may happen that a monk has committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.1.9	He should approach a single monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-kd2:27.1.10	‘I have committed such-and-such an offense. I confess it.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:27.1.11	The other should say, 
pli-tv-kd2:27.1.12	‘Do you recognize the offense?’ —
pli-tv-kd2:27.1.13	‘Yes, I recognize it.’ —
pli-tv-kd2:27.1.14	‘You should restrain yourself in the future.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:27.2.1	On the observance day it may happen that a monk is unsure if he’s committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.2.2	He should approach a single monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-kd2:27.2.3	‘I’m unsure if I’ve committed such-and-such an offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.2.4	I’ll make amends for it when I’m sure.’ He can then take part in the observance-day procedure by listening to the recitation of the Monastic Code. You shouldn’t allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the observance-day procedure.” 
pli-tv-kd2:27.3.1	On one occasion the monks from the group of six confessed shared offenses to one another. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.3.3	“You should not confess shared offenses to one another. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.3.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd2:27.3.5	On one occasion the monks from the group of six received the confession of shared offenses from one another. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.3.7	“You should not receive the confession of shared offenses from one another. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.3.8	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd2:27.4.0	26. The process for revealing an offense 
pli-tv-kd2:27.4.1	At one time a certain monk remembered an offense while the Monastic Code was being recited. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.4.2	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:27.4.3	“The Buddha has laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd2:27.4.4	that one shouldn’t do the observance-day procedure if one has an offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.4.5	But I’ve committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.4.6	So what should I do?” 
pli-tv-kd2:27.4.8	“It may happen that a monk remembers an offense while the Monastic Code is being recited. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.4.9	He should say to a monk sitting next to him, 
pli-tv-kd2:27.4.10	ʻI’ve committed such-and-such an offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.4.11	Once this meeting is finished, I’ll make amends for it.’ They can then continue the observance-day procedure by listening to the recitation of the Monastic Code. You shouldn’t allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the observance-day procedure. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.5.1	It may happen, while the Monastic Code is being recited, that a monk becomes unsure if he’s committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.5.2	He should say to a monk sitting next to him, 
pli-tv-kd2:27.5.3	ʻI’m unsure if I’ve committed such-and-such an offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.5.4	I’ll make amends for it when I’m sure.’ They can then continue the observance-day procedure by listening to the recitation of the Monastic Code. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.5.5	You shouldn’t allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the observance-day procedure.” 
pli-tv-kd2:27.6.0	27. The process for making amends for a shared offense 
pli-tv-kd2:27.6.1	At one time on the observance day, the whole sangha in a certain monastery had committed the same offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.6.2	Those monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd2:27.6.3	“The Buddha has laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd2:27.6.4	that one shouldn’t confess or receive the confession of shared offenses. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.6.5	But here the whole sangha has committed the same offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.6.6	So what should we do?” 
pli-tv-kd2:27.6.8	“On the observance day it may happen that the whole sangha in a certain monastery has committed the same offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.6.9	Those monks should straightaway send one monk to a neighboring monastery: 
pli-tv-kd2:27.6.10	ʻGo and make amends for this offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.6.11	When you return, we’ll make amends for it in your presence.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:27.7.1	If he’s able to do so, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.7.2	If not, then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd2:27.7.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.7.4	This whole sangha has committed the same offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.7.5	When the Sangha sees another monk who is pure and free from offenses, it should make amends for this offense in his presence.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:27.7.6	Once this has been said, they can do the observance-day procedure by listening to the recitation of the Monastic Code. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.7.7	You shouldn’t allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the observance-day procedure. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.8.1	“On the observance day it may happen that the whole sangha in a certain monastery is unsure if it has committed the same offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.8.2	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd2:27.8.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.8.4	This whole Sangha is unsure if it has committed the same offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.8.5	When the Sangha is sure, it should make amends for this offense.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:27.8.6	Once this has been said, they can do the observance-day procedure by listening to the recitation of the Monastic Code. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.8.7	You shouldn’t allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the observance-day procedure. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.9.1	“When a sangha has entered the rainy-season residence in a certain monastery, it may happen that the whole sangha has committed the same offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.9.2	Those monks should straightaway send one monk to a neighboring monastery: 
pli-tv-kd2:27.9.3	ʻGo and make amends for this offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.9.4	When you return, we’ll make amends for it in your presence.’ 
pli-tv-kd2:27.9.5	If he’s able to do so, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.9.6	If not, they should send one monk using the seven-day allowance: 
pli-tv-kd2:27.9.7	ʻGo and make amends for this offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.9.8	When you return, we’ll make amends for it in your presence.’” 
pli-tv-kd2:27.10.1	Soon afterwards the whole sangha in a certain monastery had committed the same offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.10.2	They did not know the name or the class of that offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.10.3	Then a monk arrived who was learned and a master of the tradition; who was an expert on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; who was knowledgeable and competent, had a sense of conscience, and was afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.10.4	One monk went up to him and asked, 
pli-tv-kd2:27.10.5	“When someone does such-and-such, what’s the name of the offense he’s committed?” 
pli-tv-kd2:27.11.1	The learned monk replied, 
pli-tv-kd2:27.11.2	“When someone does such-and-such, he’s committed an offense with this name. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.11.3	If you have committed this offense, 
pli-tv-kd2:27.11.4	you should make amends for it.” 
pli-tv-kd2:27.11.5	The other monk then said, 
pli-tv-kd2:27.11.6	“It’s not just I alone who have committed this offense, 
pli-tv-kd2:27.11.7	but this whole sangha has committed it.” 
pli-tv-kd2:27.11.8	The learned monk said, 
pli-tv-kd2:27.11.9	“What does it matter to you whether others have or haven’t committed an offense? 
pli-tv-kd2:27.11.10	Please clear yourself of your own offense.” 
pli-tv-kd2:27.12.1	Then, because of what the learned monk had said, the other monk made amends for that offense. He then went to the other monks and said, 
pli-tv-kd2:27.12.2	“When someone does such-and-such, he’s committed an offense with this name. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.12.3	This is the offense that you have committed, 
pli-tv-kd2:27.12.4	and you should make amends for it.” 
pli-tv-kd2:27.12.5	But in spite of what he had said, those monks did not want to make amends for that offense. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.12.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd2:27.13.1	“In a case such as this, 
pli-tv-kd2:27.15.1	if those monks do make amends for that offense because of what that monk has said, then this is good. 
pli-tv-kd2:27.15.2	If they don’t, then that monk doesn’t need not correct them, if he doesn’t want to.” 
pli-tv-kd2:27.15.3	The second section for recitation on the grounds for accusations is finished. 
pli-tv-kd2:28.1.0	28. The group of fifteen on non-offenses 
pli-tv-kd2:28.1.1	At one time on the observance day four or more resident monks had gathered in a certain monastery. 
pli-tv-kd2:28.1.2	They did not know 
pli-tv-kd2:28.1.3	that there were other resident monks who had not arrived. 
pli-tv-kd2:28.1.4	Perceiving that they were acting according to the Teaching and the Monastic Law, perceiving that the assembly was complete although it was not, they did the observance-day procedure by reciting the Monastic Code. 
pli-tv-kd2:28.1.5	While they were doing so, a greater number of resident monks arrived. 
pli-tv-kd2:28.1.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd2:28.2.1	“On the observance day it may happen that four or more resident monks have gathered in a certain monastery. 
pli-tv-kd2:28.2.2	They don’t know 
pli-tv-kd2:28.2.3	that there are other resident monks who haven’t arrived.

pli-tv-kd2:28.2.5	While they’re doing so, a greater number of resident monks arrive. 
pli-tv-kd2:28.2.6	In such a case those monks should recite the Monastic Code once more. 
pli-tv-kd2:28.2.7	And there’s no offense for the reciters.

pli-tv-kd2:28.3.6	In such a case, what has been recited is valid, and the remainder should be listened to.

pli-tv-kd2:28.3.12	While they’re doing so, other resident monks arrive who are fewer in number. 
pli-tv-kd2:28.3.13	In such a case, what has been recited is valid, and the remainder should be listened to.

pli-tv-kd3:0.4	1. The instruction to enter the rainy-season residence 
pli-tv-kd3:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. 
pli-tv-kd3:1.1.2	At that time the Buddha had not yet laid down the rainy-season residence for the monks. 
pli-tv-kd3:1.1.3	And so the monks were wandering about in the winter, in the summer, and also during the rainy season. 
pli-tv-kd3:1.2.1	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd3:1.2.2	“How can the Sakyan monastics go wandering in the winter, in the summer, and even during the rainy season? They are trampling down the green grass, oppressing one-sensed life, and destroying many small creatures. 
pli-tv-kd3:1.2.3	Even the monastics of other religions, with their flawed teachings, settle down for the rainy-season. 
pli-tv-kd3:1.2.4	Even birds make a nest in the top of a tree and settle down for the rainy-season. 
pli-tv-kd3:1.2.5	But not so the Sakyan monastics.” 
pli-tv-kd3:1.3.1	The monks heard the complaints of those people 
pli-tv-kd3:1.3.2	and they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd3:1.3.3	Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd3:1.3.4	“You should enter the rainy-season residence.” 
pli-tv-kd3:2.1.1	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd3:2.1.2	“When should we enter the rains residence?” 
pli-tv-kd3:2.1.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd3:2.1.4	“You should enter the rainy-season residence during the rainy season.” 
pli-tv-kd3:2.2.1	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd3:2.2.2	“How many entries to the rains residence are there?” 
pli-tv-kd3:2.2.4	“There are two entries to the rainy-season residence: 
pli-tv-kd3:2.2.5	the first and the second. 
pli-tv-kd3:2.2.6	You should enter the first on the day after the full moon of July and the second one month after the full moon of July.” 
pli-tv-kd3:3.1.0	2. The prohibition against wandering during the rainy season, etc. 
pli-tv-kd3:3.1.1	Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six entered the rains residence and then went wandering during the rainy season.

pli-tv-kd4:0.1	Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law 
pli-tv-kd4:0.2	The Long Division 
pli-tv-kd4:0.3	The chapter on the invitation procedure 
pli-tv-kd4:0.4	1. Abiding in discomfort 
pli-tv-kd4:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.1.2	At that time in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country a number of monks who were friends had entered rainy-season residence together. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.1.3	They thought, 
pli-tv-kd4:1.1.4	“How can we live in concord and harmony, have a comfortable rains residence, and get almsfood without trouble?” 
pli-tv-kd4:1.2.1	Then it occurred to them, 
pli-tv-kd4:1.2.2	“Let’s not talk to one another. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.2.3	Whoever returns first from almsround in the village should prepare the seats and set out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, and water for washing the feet. He should clean the bowl for leftovers and set it out, and put out water for drinking and water for washing. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.3.1	Whoever returns last from almsround may eat whatever is leftover, or he should discard it where there are no cultivated plants or in water without life. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.3.2	He should put away the seats and also the foot-stool, the foot-scraper, and the water for washing the feet. He should clean the bowl for leftovers and put it away, put away the water for drinking and the water for washing, and sweep the dining hall. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.4.1	Whoever sees that the pot for drinking water, the pot for washing water, or the waterpot in the restroom is empty should fill it. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.4.2	If he can’t do it by himself, he should call someone over by hand signal and they should fill it together. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.4.3	He should not speak because of that. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.4.4	In this way we’ll live in concord and harmony, have a comfortable rains residence, and get almsfood without trouble.” 
pli-tv-kd4:1.5.1	And they did just that. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.8.1	Now it was the custom for monks who had completed the rainy-season residence to go and visit the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.8.2	And so, when the three months were over and they had completed the rains residence, those monks put their dwellings in order, took their bowls and robes, and set out for Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.8.3	When they eventually arrived, they went to the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. There they approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.8.4	Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, 
pli-tv-kd4:1.9.1	the Buddha said to them, 
pli-tv-kd4:1.9.2	“I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re getting by. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.9.3	I hope you had a comfortable rains residence, living in concord and harmony, and that you had no trouble getting almsfood?” 
pli-tv-kd4:1.9.4	“We’re keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re getting by. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.9.5	We had a comfortable rains residence, living in concord and harmony, without dispute, and we had no trouble getting almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd4:1.10.1	When Buddhas know what is going on, sometimes they ask and sometimes not. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.10.2	They know the right time to ask and when not to ask. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.10.3	Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, otherwise not, 
pli-tv-kd4:1.10.4	for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.10.5	Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.10.6	And the Buddha said to those monks, “In what way, monks, did you have a comfortable rains residence, without having any trouble getting almsfood?” 
pli-tv-kd4:1.12.1	When they had told him, the Buddha addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd4:1.12.2	“While they dwelt in discomfort these foolish men claim they were dwelling in comfort. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.12.3	While they dwelt together like animals, they claim they were dwelling in comfort. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.12.4	While they dwelt together like sheep, they claim they were dwelling in comfort. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.12.5	While they dwelt together like enemies, they claim they were dwelling in comfort. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.12.6	How can these foolish men take a vow of silence, as do the monastics of other religions? 
pli-tv-kd4:1.13.1	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd4:1.13.2	after criticizing them and giving a teaching, he addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd4:1.13.3	“You should not take a vow of silence, as do the monastics of other religions. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.13.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.13.5	When you have completed the rainy-season residence, you should invite the monks to correct you in regard to three things: 
pli-tv-kd4:1.13.6	what has been seen, what has been heard, or what is suspected. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.13.7	This will help you live with one another in the proper way, help you clear yourself of offenses, and help you give priority to the training. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.1	And you should do the invitation procedure like this. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.2	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.3	ʻPlease, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.4	Today is the invitation procedure. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.5	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should do the invitation procedure.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.6	The most senior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.7	ʻI invite the Sangha to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.8	Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.9	If I see a fault, I will make amends. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.10	For the second time, I invite the Sangha to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.11	Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.12	If I see a fault, I will make amends. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.13	For the third time, I invite the Sangha to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.14	Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.15	If I see a fault, I will make amends.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.16	A junior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.17	ʻI invite the Sangha to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.18	Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.19	If I see a fault, I will make amends. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.20	For the second time I invite the Sangha to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.21	For the third time I invite the Sangha to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.22	Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. 
pli-tv-kd4:1.14.23	If I see a fault, I will make amends.’” 
pli-tv-kd4:2.1.1	Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six remained seated while the senior monks were inviting correction, squatting on their heels. 
pli-tv-kd4:2.1.2	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd4:2.1.3	“How can the monks from the group of six act like this?” 
pli-tv-kd4:2.1.4	They told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd4:2.1.5	“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six were acting like this?” 
pli-tv-kd4:2.1.6	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd4:2.1.7	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-kd4:2.1.8	“How can those foolish men remain seated while the senior monks are inviting correction, squatting on their heels?” 
pli-tv-kd4:2.1.9	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd4:2.1.10	and after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd4:2.1.11	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd4:2.1.12	“You should not remain seated while the senior monks are inviting correction, squatting on their heels. 
pli-tv-kd4:2.1.13	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd4:2.1.14	Everyone should squat on their heels during the invitation procedure.” 
pli-tv-kd4:2.2.1	On one occasion, while squatting on his heels and waiting for everyone to invite correction, a senior monk who was weak from old age fainted and fell over. 
pli-tv-kd4:2.2.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd4:2.2.3	“You should squat on your heels until you have invited correction. Once you have invited, you may sit down.” 
pli-tv-kd4:3.1.0	2. Breach of the invitation procedure 
pli-tv-kd4:3.1.1	And the monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.1.2	“How many invitation days are there?” 
pli-tv-kd4:3.1.4	“There are two invitation days: 
pli-tv-kd4:3.1.5	the fourteenth and the fifteenth.” 
pli-tv-kd4:3.2.1	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.2.2	“How many invitation procedures are there?” 
pli-tv-kd4:3.2.4	“There are these four invitation procedures: 
pli-tv-kd4:3.2.5	The invitation procedure that is illegitimate and has an incomplete assembly; 
pli-tv-kd4:3.2.6	The invitation procedure that is illegitimate but has a complete assembly; 
pli-tv-kd4:3.2.7	The invitation procedure that is legitimate but has an incomplete assembly; 
pli-tv-kd4:3.2.8	The invitation procedure that is legitimate and has a complete assembly. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.2.9	The first, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.2.11	second, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.2.13	and third of these should not be done; 
pli-tv-kd4:3.2.14	I haven’t allowed such procedures. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.2.15	The fourth should be done; 
pli-tv-kd4:3.2.16	I have allowed such a procedure. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.2.17	Therefore, monks, you should train like this: ʻWe will do invitation procedures that are legitimate and have a complete assembly.’” 
pli-tv-kd4:3.3.0	3. The allowance to pass on the invitation 
pli-tv-kd4:3.3.1	And the Buddha addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd4:3.3.2	“Gather, monks, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.3.3	for the Sangha to invite correction.” 
pli-tv-kd4:3.3.4	A monk said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.3.5	“Sir, there’s a sick monk. He hasn’t come.” 
pli-tv-kd4:3.3.6	“I allow a sick monk to pass on his invitation. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.3.7	And it should be passed on like this. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.3.8	The sick monk should approach a monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, and squat on his heels. He should then raise his joined palms and say, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.3.9	ʻI pass on my invitation; please convey my invitation; please announce my invitation; please invite correction on my behalf.’ If he makes this understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then the invitation has been passed on. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.3.10	If he doesn’t make this understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then the invitation hasn’t been passed on. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.4.1	If he’s able to do this, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.4.2	If not, then the sick monk should be brought into the midst of the Sangha together with his bed or bench. They can then do the invitation procedure. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.4.3	But if the one who is nursing the sick monk says, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.4.4	ʻIf we move him, his illness will get worse, or he’ll die,’ then the sick monk shouldn’t be moved. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.4.5	The Sangha should go to where the sick monk is and do the invitation procedure there. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.4.6	But you should not do the invitation procedure with an incomplete Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.4.7	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.1	“If, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation departs right there, then the invitation should be passed on to another. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.2	If, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation disrobes right there, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.3	dies right there, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.4	admits right there that he’s a novice monk, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.5	admits right there that he’s renounced the training, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.6	admits right there that he’s committed the worst kind of offense, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.7	admits right there that he’s insane, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.8	admits right there that he’s deranged, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.9	admits right there that he’s overwhelmed by pain, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.10	admits right there that he’s been ejected for not recognizing an offense, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.11	admits right there that he’s been ejected for not making amends for an offense, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.12	admits right there that he’s been ejected for not giving up a bad view, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.13	admits right there that he’s a _paṇḍaka_, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.14	admits right there that he’s living in the community by theft, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.15	admits right there that he’s previously left to join the monastics of another religion, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.16	admits right there that he’s an animal, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.17	admits right there that he’s a matricide, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.18	admits right there that he’s a patricide, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.19	admits right there that he’s a murderer of a perfected one, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.20	admits right there that he’s raped a nun … 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.21	admits right there that he’s caused a schism in the Sangha, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.22	admits right there that he’s caused the Buddha to bleed, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.23	or admits right there that he’s a hermaphrodite, then the invitation should be passed on to another. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.24	If, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation departs while on his way to the invitation procedure, then the invitation hasn’t been brought. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.25	If, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation disrobes, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.26	dies, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.27	admits that he’s a novice monk, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.28	admits that he’s renounced the training, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.29	admits that he’s committed the worst kind of offense, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.30	admits that he’s insane, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.31	admits that he’s deranged,

pli-tv-kd4:3.5.37	admits that he’s living in the community by theft, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.38	admits that he’s previously left to join the monastics of another religion, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.39	admits that he’s an animal, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.40	admits that he’s a matricide, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.41	admits that he’s a patricide, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.42	admits that he’s a murderer of a perfected one, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.43	admits that he’s raped a nun, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.44	admits that he’s caused a schism in the Sangha, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.45	admits that he’s caused the Buddha to bleed, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.46	or admits that he’s a hermaphrodite while on his way to the invitation procedure, then the invitation hasn’t been brought. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.47	“But even if, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation departs after reaching the Sangha, then the invitation has been brought. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.48	And even if, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation disrobes, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.49	dies, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.50	admits that he’s a novice monk, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.51	admits that he’s renounced the training, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.52	admits that he’s committed the worst kind of offense, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.53	admits that he’s insane, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.54	admits that he’s deranged, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.55	admits that he’s overwhelmed by pain, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.56	admits that he’s been ejected for not recognizing an offense, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.57	admits that he’s been ejected for not making amends for an offense,

pli-tv-kd4:3.5.62	admits that he’s an animal, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.63	admits that he’s a matricide, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.64	admits that he’s a patricide, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.65	admits that he’s a murderer of a perfected one, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.66	admits that he’s raped a nun, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.67	admits that he’s caused a schism in the Sangha, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.68	admits that he’s caused the Buddha to bleed, 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.69	or admits that he’s a hermaphrodite after reaching the Sangha, then the invitation has been brought. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.70	And even if, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation reaches the Sangha, but doesn’t announce the invitation because he falls asleep, then the invitation has been brought. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.71	And there’s no offense for the one who is conveying the invitation. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.72	And even if, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation reaches the Sangha, but doesn’t announce the invitation because he is heedless 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.73	or because he gains a meditation attainment, then the invitation has been brought. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.74	And there’s no offense for the one who is conveying the invitation. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.75	“And even if, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation reaches the Sangha, but deliberately doesn’t announce the invitation, then the invitation has been brought. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.76	But there’s an offense of wrong conduct for the one who is conveying the invitation. 
pli-tv-kd4:3.5.77	On the invitation day, if the Sangha has business to be done, then anyone passing on his invitation should also give his consent.” 
pli-tv-kd4:4.1.0	4. Discussion of being seized by relatives, etc. 
pli-tv-kd4:4.1.1	At one time on the invitation day a certain monk was seized by his relatives. 
pli-tv-kd4:4.1.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd4:4.1.3	“If on the invitation day a monk is seized by his relatives, 
pli-tv-kd4:4.1.4	other monks should say to those relatives, 
pli-tv-kd4:4.1.5	ʻPlease release this monk for a short time, so that he can take part in the invitation procedure.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:4.2.1	If they’re able to do this, it’s good.

pli-tv-kd4:4.2.4	If they’re able to do this, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd4:4.2.5	If not, they should say to those relatives, 
pli-tv-kd4:4.2.6	ʻPlease take this monk outside the monastic boundary for a short time while the Sangha does the invitation procedure.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:4.2.7	If they’re able to do this, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd4:4.2.8	If not, you should not do the invitation procedure with an incomplete Sangha.

pli-tv-kd4:4.3.3	by scoundrels, 
pli-tv-kd4:4.3.4	or by enemies of monks,

pli-tv-kd4:4.3.6	ʻPlease release this monk for a short time, so that he can take part in the invitation procedure.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:4.3.7	If they’re able to do this, it’s good.

pli-tv-kd4:5.1.0	5. Various kinds of invitation ceremonies for the Sangha, etc. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.1.1	At one time on the invitation day there were five monks staying in a certain monastery. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.1.2	They thought, 
pli-tv-kd4:5.1.3	“The Buddha has laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd4:5.1.4	that the invitation procedure should be done with a sangha. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.1.5	Now there’s five of us. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.1.6	How should we do the invitation procedure?” 
pli-tv-kd4:5.1.7	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd4:5.1.8	“When there are five of you, you should do the invitation procedure in the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-kd4:5.2.1	At one time on the invitation day there were four monks staying in a certain monastery. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.2.2	They thought, 
pli-tv-kd4:5.2.3	“The Buddha has instructed that the invitation procedure should be done in the Sangha when there are five monks. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.2.4	But there’s only four of us. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.2.5	How should we do the invitation procedure?” 
pli-tv-kd4:5.2.7	“When there are four of you, you should do the invitation procedure with one another. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.3.1	And it should be done like this. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.3.2	A competent and capable monk should inform those monks: 
pli-tv-kd4:5.3.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.3.4	Today is the invitation procedure. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.3.5	If it seems appropriate to the venerables, we should do the invitation procedure with one another.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:5.3.6	The most senior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the other monks: 
pli-tv-kd4:5.3.7	ʻI invite you to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.3.8	Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion.

pli-tv-kd4:5.3.13	If I see a fault, I will make amends.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:5.3.14	A junior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the other monks:

pli-tv-kd4:5.4.1	At one time on the invitation day there were three monks staying in a certain monastery.

pli-tv-kd4:5.5.1	At one time on the invitation day there were two monks staying in a certain monastery. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.5.2	They thought, 
pli-tv-kd4:5.5.3	“The Buddha has instructed that the invitation procedure should be done in the Sangha when there are five monks and with one another when there are three or four. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.5.4	But there’s only two of us.

pli-tv-kd4:5.5.7	“When there are two of you, you should do the invitation procedure with each other.

pli-tv-kd4:5.6.17	If I see a fault, I will make amends.’” 
pli-tv-kd4:5.7.1	At one time on the invitation day a monk was staying in a certain monastery by himself. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.7.2	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd4:5.7.3	“The Buddha has instructed that the invitation procedure should be done in the Sangha when there are five monks and with one another when there are two, three, or four. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.7.4	But I’m here by myself. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.7.5	How should I do the invitation procedure?” 
pli-tv-kd4:5.8.1	“On the invitation day it may happen that a monk is staying by himself in a certain monastery. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.8.2	That monk should sweep whatever place the monks normally go to: whether the assembly hall, under a roof-cover, or at the foot of a tree. He should set out water for drinking and water for washing, should prepare a seat, light a lamp, and sit down. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.8.3	If other monks come, he should do the invitation procedure with them. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.8.4	If not, he should determine: ʻToday is my invitation procedure.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:5.8.5	If he doesn’t make a determination, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.9.1	Wherever five monks are staying together, four shouldn’t do the invitation procedure in the Sangha while bringing the invitation of one. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.9.2	If you do it in this way, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.9.3	Wherever four monks are staying together, three shouldn’t do the invitation procedure with one another while bringing the invitation of one. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.9.4	If you do it in this way, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.9.5	Wherever three monks are staying together, two shouldn’t do the invitation procedure with each other while bringing the invitation of one. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.9.6	If you do it in this way, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.9.7	Wherever two monks are staying together, one shouldn’t make a determination while bringing the invitation of one. 
pli-tv-kd4:5.9.8	If you make a determination in this way, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd4:6.1.0	6. The process for making amends for an offense 
pli-tv-kd4:6.1.1	At one time on the invitation day a certain monk had committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.1.2	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd4:6.1.3	“The Buddha has laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd4:6.1.4	that one shouldn’t invite correction if one has an offense. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.1.5	And I’ve committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.1.6	So what should I do?” 
pli-tv-kd4:6.1.7	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd4:6.1.8	“On the invitation day it may happen that a monk has committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.1.9	He should approach a single monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-kd4:6.1.10	ʻI have committed such-and-such an offense. I confess it.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:6.1.11	The other should say, 
pli-tv-kd4:6.1.12	‘Do you recognize the offense?’ —
pli-tv-kd4:6.1.13	‘Yes, I recognize it.’ —
pli-tv-kd4:6.1.14	‘You should restrain yourself in the future.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:6.1.15	On the invitation day it may happen that a monk is unsure if he’s committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.1.16	He should approach a single monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-kd4:6.1.17	ʻI’m unsure if I’ve committed such-and-such an offense. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.1.18	I will make amends for it when I’m sure.’ They can then do the invitation procedure. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.1.19	You shouldn’t allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the invitation procedure.” 
pli-tv-kd4:6.2.0	7. The process for revealing an offense 
pli-tv-kd4:6.2.1	At one time a certain monk remembered an offense during the invitation procedure. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.2.2	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd4:6.2.3	“The Buddha has laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd4:6.2.4	that one shouldn’t invite correction if one has an offense. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.2.5	But I’ve committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.2.6	So what should I do?” 
pli-tv-kd4:6.2.7	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd4:6.2.8	“It may happen that a monk remembers an offense during the invitation procedure. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.2.9	He should say to a monk sitting next to him, 
pli-tv-kd4:6.2.10	ʻI’ve committed such-and-such an offense. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.2.11	Once this meeting is finished, I’ll make amends for it.’ They can then continue the invitation procedure. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.2.12	You shouldn’t allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the invitation procedure. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.1	It may happen during the invitation procedure that a monk becomes unsure if he’s committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.2	He should say to a monk sitting next to him, 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.3	ʻI’m unsure if I’ve committed such-and-such an offense. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.4	I’ll make amends for it when I’m sure.’ They can then continue the invitation procedure. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.5	You shouldn’t allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the invitation procedure.” 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.6.0	8. The process for making amends for a shared offense 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.6.1	At one time on the invitation day the whole sangha in a certain monastery had committed the same offense. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.7	Those monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.8	“The Buddha has laid down a rule 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.9	that one shouldn’t confess or receive the confession of shared offenses. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.10	But here the whole sangha has committed the same offense. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.11	So what should we do?” 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.13	“On the invitation day it may happen that the whole sangha in a certain monastery has committed the same offense. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.14	Those monks should straightaway send one monk to a neighboring monastery: 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.15	ʻGo and make amends for this offense. When you return, we’ll make amends for it in your presence.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.16	If he’s able to do so, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.17	If not, then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.18	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.19	This whole sangha has committed the same offense. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.20	When the Sangha sees another monk who is pure and free from offenses, it should make amends for this offense in his presence.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.21	Once this has been said, they can do the invitation procedure. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.22	You shouldn’t allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the invitation procedure. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.23	“On the invitation day it may happen that the whole sangha in a certain monastery is unsure if it has committed the same offense. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.24	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.25	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.26	This whole Sangha is unsure if it has committed the same offense. 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.27	When the Sangha is sure, it should make amends for this offense.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.28	Once this has been said, they can do the invitation procedure. You shouldn’t allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the invitation procedure.” 
pli-tv-kd4:6.3.29	The first section for recitation is finished. 
pli-tv-kd4:7.1.0	9. The group of fifteen on non-offenses 
pli-tv-kd4:7.1.1	At one time on the invitation day five or more resident monks had gathered in a certain monastery. 
pli-tv-kd4:7.1.2	They did not know 
pli-tv-kd4:7.1.3	that there were other resident monks who had not arrived. 
pli-tv-kd4:7.1.4	Perceiving that they were acting according to the Teaching and the Monastic Law, perceiving that the assembly was complete although it was not, they did the invitation procedure. 
pli-tv-kd4:7.1.5	During the procedure a greater number of resident monks arrived. 
pli-tv-kd4:7.1.6	They told the Buddha and he said,

pli-tv-kd4:7.3.12	During the procedure other resident monks arrive who are fewer in number. 
pli-tv-kd4:7.3.13	In such a case the invitations of those who already have invited are valid, but the others should invite.

pli-tv-kd4:15.4.10	Most of the night has been used up by monks arguing. 
pli-tv-kd4:15.4.11	If the Sangha does the invitation procedure by means of three statements, it will not be finished before dawn. 
pli-tv-kd4:15.4.12	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do the invitation procedure by means of two statements or by means of one statement or in groups according to year of seniority.’” 
pli-tv-kd4:15.5.1	At one time on the invitation day in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country a large sangha of monks had gathered. A storm was approaching, but they only had a small area that was sheltered. 
pli-tv-kd4:15.5.2	The monks considered this 
pli-tv-kd4:15.5.4	and thought, “If the Sangha does the invitation procedure by means of three statements, we won’t be finished before it starts raining. 
pli-tv-kd4:15.5.5	What should we do?” 
pli-tv-kd4:15.5.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd4:15.6.1	“In such a case 
pli-tv-kd4:15.6.5	a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd4:15.6.6	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd4:15.6.7	This large Sangha of monks has gathered. A storm is approaching, but we only have a small area that’s sheltered. 
pli-tv-kd4:15.6.8	If the Sangha does the invitation procedure by means of three statements, it will not be finished before it starts raining. 
pli-tv-kd4:15.6.9	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do the invitation procedure by means of two statements or by means of one statement or in groups according to year of seniority.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:15.7.1	“It may happen on the invitation day in a certain monastery that there is danger from kings, 
pli-tv-kd4:15.7.2	from bandits, 
pli-tv-kd4:15.7.3	from fire, 
pli-tv-kd4:15.7.4	from water, 
pli-tv-kd4:15.7.5	from humans, 
pli-tv-kd4:15.7.6	from spirits, 
pli-tv-kd4:15.7.7	from predatory animals, 
pli-tv-kd4:15.7.8	or from creeping animals; 
pli-tv-kd4:15.7.9	or there is a life-threatening danger 
pli-tv-kd4:15.7.10	or a danger to living the spiritual life. 
pli-tv-kd4:15.7.11	If the monks consider this 
pli-tv-kd4:15.7.13	and think, ‘This is a danger to living the spiritual life. If the Sangha does the invitation procedure by means of three statements, we won’t be finished before the danger manifests,’ then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd4:15.7.14	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd4:15.7.15	This is a danger to living the spiritual life. 
pli-tv-kd4:15.7.16	If the Sangha does the invitation procedure by means of three statements, it will not be finished before the danger manifests. 
pli-tv-kd4:15.7.17	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do the invitation procedure by means of two statements or by means of one statement or in groups according to year of seniority.’” 
pli-tv-kd4:16.1.0	22. The cancellation of the invitation 
pli-tv-kd4:16.1.1	At that time the monks from the group of six invited correction while having uncleared offenses. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.1.3	“You should not invite correction if you have uncleared offenses. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.1.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.1.5	If anyone invites correction with uncleared offenses, you should get their permission and then accuse them of an offense.” 
pli-tv-kd4:16.2.1	Soon afterwards, when asked for permission to be corrected, the monks from the group of six did not wish to give it. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.2.3	“If anyone doesn’t give their permission to be corrected, you should cancel their invitation. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.2.4	And it should be canceled like this. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.2.5	On the invitation day, whether the fourteenth or the fifteenth, in the middle of the Sangha and in the presence of that person, you should announce: 
pli-tv-kd4:16.2.6	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.2.7	Such-and-such a person has uncleared offenses. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.2.8	I cancel their invitation. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.2.9	The invitation procedure should not be done in their presence.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:16.2.10	Their invitation has then been canceled.” 
pli-tv-kd4:16.3.1	On one occasion the monks from the group of six—
pli-tv-kd4:16.3.2	thinking to act before the good monks canceled their invitation, 
pli-tv-kd4:16.3.3	but having no grounds or reasons—canceled the invitation of pure monks who had not committed any offenses. They also canceled the invitation of those who already had invited. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.3.5	“When there are no grounds or reasons, you should not cancel the invitation of pure monks who haven’t committed any offenses. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.3.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.3.7	And you should not cancel the invitation of those who already have invited. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.3.8	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.4.1	“And this is how the invitation is canceled and how it isn’t canceled. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.4.3	If the invitation is canceled after a three-statement invitation has been spoken and concluded, then it’s not canceled. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.4.4	If the invitation is canceled after a two-statement invitation … 
pli-tv-kd4:16.4.5	after a one-statement invitation … 
pli-tv-kd4:16.4.6	after an invitation done in groups according to the year of seniority has been spoken and concluded, then it’s not canceled. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.5.1	If the invitation is canceled when a three-statement invitation hasn’t yet been concluded, then it’s canceled. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.5.2	If the invitation is canceled when a two-statement invitation … 
pli-tv-kd4:16.5.3	when a one-statement invitation … 
pli-tv-kd4:16.5.4	when an invitation done in groups according to the year of seniority hasn’t yet been concluded, then it’s canceled. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.6.1	“It may happen on the invitation day that a monk cancels a second monk’s invitation. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.6.2	If other monks know about the first monk: 
pli-tv-kd4:16.6.3	‘This venerable is impure in bodily conduct, verbal conduct, and livelihood; he’s ignorant and incompetent, incapable of answering properly when questioned,’ then they should press him by saying, ‘Enough. No more arguing and disputing,’ and the Sangha should then do the invitation procedure. 
pli-tv-kd4:16.7.1	It may happen on the invitation day that a monk cancels a second monk’s invitation.

pli-tv-kd4:16.9.1	It may happen on the invitation day that a monk cancels a second monk’s invitation.

pli-tv-kd4:17.1.0	25. Creators of quarrels, etc. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.1.1	On one occasion in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country, a number of monks who were friends had entered the rainy-season residence together. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.1.2	Other monks who were quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Sangha had entered the rains residence nearby. These monks said to one another, 
pli-tv-kd4:17.1.3	“At the invitation procedure, when those monks have completed the rains residence, we’ll cancel their invitation.” 
pli-tv-kd4:17.1.4	The monks who were friends heard about this 
pli-tv-kd4:17.1.7	and thought, “What should we do?” 
pli-tv-kd4:17.1.8	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd4:17.2.1	“In such a case 
pli-tv-kd4:17.2.4	I allow those monks to do two or three observance-day ceremonies on the fourteenth 
pli-tv-kd4:17.2.5	with the aim of having their invitation procedure before the other monks. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.2.6	“If those quarrelsome and argumentative monks are on their way to the other monastery, the resident monks should gather quickly and do the invitation procedure. When it has been done, they should say to the other monks, 
pli-tv-kd4:17.2.7	‘Venerables, we have completed the invitation procedure; 
pli-tv-kd4:17.2.8	please do whatever you think is appropriate.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:17.3.1	If those quarrelsome and argumentative monks arrive without prior notice, the resident monks should prepare seats and set out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, and water for washing the feet. They should then go out to meet those monks, receive their bowl and robe, and ask if they want water to drink. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.3.2	Then, having distracted them, they should go outside the monastic boundary and do the invitation procedure there. When it has been done, they should say to the other monks, 
pli-tv-kd4:17.3.3	‘Venerables, we have completed the invitation procedure; 
pli-tv-kd4:17.3.4	please do whatever you think is appropriate.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:17.4.1	“If they’re able to do this, it’s good. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.4.2	If not, then a resident monk who is competent and capable should inform the resident monks: 
pli-tv-kd4:17.4.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the resident monks to listen. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.4.4	If it seems appropriate to the venerables, we will now do the observance-day procedure by reciting the Monastic Code, and we will do the invitation procedure at the next new moon.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:17.4.5	If the quarrelsome and argumentative monks say, 
pli-tv-kd4:17.4.6	‘It would be good if you would do the invitation procedure with us now,’ they should be told, 
pli-tv-kd4:17.4.7	‘You have no authority over our invitation procedure. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.4.8	We won’t do the procedure for the time being.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:17.5.1	If the quarrelsome and argumentative monks stay on until the new moon, then a resident monk who is competent and capable should inform the resident monks: 
pli-tv-kd4:17.5.2	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the resident monks to listen. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.5.3	If it seems appropriate to the venerables, we will now do the observance-day procedure by reciting the Monastic Code, and we will do the invitation procedure at the next full moon.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:17.5.4	If the quarrelsome and argumentative monks say, 
pli-tv-kd4:17.5.5	‘It would be good if you would do the invitation procedure with us now,’ they should be told, 
pli-tv-kd4:17.5.6	‘You have no authority over our invitation procedure. We won’t do the procedure for the time being.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:17.6.1	If the quarrelsome and argumentative monks stay on even until the next full moon, then all the monks have no choice but to do the invitation procedure on the day of Komudī, the fourth full moon of the rainy season. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.7.1	“If, while you’re doing the invitation procedure, a sick monk cancels the invitation of a healthy monk, you should tell him, 
pli-tv-kd4:17.7.2	‘You’re sick. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.7.3	The Buddha has said that a sick monk can’t endure being questioned. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.7.4	Please wait until you’re healthy. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.7.5	If you then wish, you may accuse him.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:17.7.6	If, in spite of this, he still accuses the other, he commits an offense entailing confession for disrespect. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.8.1	If, while you’re doing the invitation procedure, a healthy monk cancels the invitation of a sick monk, you should tell him, 
pli-tv-kd4:17.8.2	‘This monk is sick. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.8.3	The Buddha has said that a sick monk can’t endure being questioned. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.8.4	Please wait until he’s healthy. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.8.5	If you then wish, you may accuse him.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:17.8.6	If, in spite of this, he still accuses the other, he commits an offense entailing confession for disrespect. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.9.1	If, while you’re doing the invitation procedure, a sick monk cancels the invitation of a sick monk, you should tell him, 
pli-tv-kd4:17.9.2	‘You’re both sick. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.9.3	The Buddha has said that a sick monk can’t endure being questioned. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.9.4	Please wait until you’re both healthy. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.9.5	If you then wish, you may accuse him.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:17.9.6	If, in spite of this, he still accuses the other, he commits an offense entailing confession for disrespect. 
pli-tv-kd4:17.10.1	If, while you’re doing the invitation procedure, a healthy monk cancels the invitation of a healthy monk, you should question and examine both and deal with them according to the rule. The Sangha should then continue the invitation procedure.” 
pli-tv-kd4:18.1.0	26. Agreement about the invitation procedure 
pli-tv-kd4:18.1.1	On one occasion in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country, a number of monks who were friends had entered the rainy-season residence together. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.1.2	While living in concord and harmony, they attained a certain pleasant state of meditation. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.1.3	They considered this 
pli-tv-kd4:18.1.5	and thought, “If we do the invitation procedure now, the monks might leave to go wandering. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.1.6	We will then have lost this pleasant abiding. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.1.7	What should we do?” 
pli-tv-kd4:18.1.8	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd4:18.2.1	“In such a case 
pli-tv-kd4:18.2.7	I allow those monks to make an agreement about the invitation procedure. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.3.1	And it should be made like this. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.3.2	Everyone should gather in one place. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.3.3	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd4:18.3.4	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.3.5	While living in concord and harmony, we have attained a certain pleasant state of meditation. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.3.6	If we do the invitation procedure now, the monks might leave to go wandering. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.3.7	We will then have lost this pleasant abiding. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.3.8	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should make an agreement about the invitation procedure: we will now do the observance-day procedure by reciting the Monastic Code, and we will do the invitation procedure on the day of Komudī, the fourth full moon of the rainy season. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.3.9	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.4.1	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.4.2	While living in concord and harmony, we have attained a certain pleasant state of meditation. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.4.3	If we do the invitation procedure now, the monks might leave to go wandering. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.4.4	We will then have lost this pleasant abiding. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.4.5	The Sangha makes an agreement about the invitation procedure: we will now do the observance-day procedure by reciting the Monastic Code, and we will do the invitation procedure on the day of Komudī, the fourth full moon of the rainy season. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.4.6	Any monk who approves of making this agreement about the invitation procedure—that we will now do the observance-day procedure by reciting the Monastic Code and that we will do the invitation procedure on the day of Komudī, the fourth full moon of the rainy season—should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.4.7	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.4.8	The Sangha has made an agreement about the invitation procedure: we will now do the observance-day procedure by reciting the Monastic Code, and we will do the invitation procedure on the day of Komudī, the fourth full moon of the rainy season. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.4.9	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:18.5.1	“If, when those monks have made an agreement about the invitation procedure, a monk says, 
pli-tv-kd4:18.5.2	‘I wish to go wandering the country; 
pli-tv-kd4:18.5.3	I have something to do there,’ they should tell him, 
pli-tv-kd4:18.5.4	‘That’s fine, but you have to do the invitation first.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:18.5.5	If, while that monk is doing the invitation, he cancels the invitation of another monk, the other monk should tell him, 
pli-tv-kd4:18.5.6	‘You have no authority over my invitation until I invite.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:18.5.7	If, while that monk is doing the invitation, another monk cancels his invitation, the monks should question and examine both and deal with them according to the rule. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.6.1	“It may be that that monk finishes his business in the country and returns to that monastery before the full-moon day of Komudī. If, while the monks are doing the invitation procedure, a monk cancels the invitation of the monk who has returned, the monk who has returned should tell him, 
pli-tv-kd4:18.6.2	‘You have no authority over my invitation; 
pli-tv-kd4:18.6.3	I have already completed it.’ 
pli-tv-kd4:18.6.4	If, while the monks are doing the invitation procedure, the monk who has returned cancels the invitation of another monk, the monks should question and examine both and deal with them according to the rule. The Sangha should then continue the invitation procedure.” 
pli-tv-kd4:18.6.5	The fourth chapter on the invitation procedure is finished. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.6.33	In this chapter there are forty-six topics. 
pli-tv-kd4:18.6.34	The chapter on the invitation procedure is finished.
pli-tv-kd5:0.1	Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law 
pli-tv-kd5:0.2	The Long Division 
pli-tv-kd5:0.3	The chapter on skins 
pli-tv-kd5:0.4	1. The account of Soṇa Koḷivisa 
pli-tv-kd5:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha on the Vulture Peak. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.1.2	At that time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha ruled over eighty thousand villages. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.1.3	And at Campā there was a wealthy merchant who had a son called Soṇa Koḷivisa. He had been raised in great comfort 
pli-tv-kd5:1.1.4	and even had hairs growing on the soles of his feet. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.1.5	On one occasion, because of some business, King Bimbisāra had the chiefs of those eighty thousand villages gathered. He then sent a message to Soṇa, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.1.6	asking him to come. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.2.1	Soṇa’s parents said, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.2.2	“Soṇa, the king wishes to see your feet, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.2.3	but don’t point your feet at the King. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.2.4	If you just sit down cross-legged in front of the King, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.2.5	he’ll be able to see them.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.2.6	And they sent him away on a palanquin. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.2.7	Soṇa then went to King Bimbisāra, bowed, and sat down cross-legged in front of him. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.2.8	And the King saw the hairs growing on the soles of his feet. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.3.1	Then, after instructing those eighty thousand chiefs in worldly matters, the King dismissed them, saying, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.3.2	“I’ve instructed you in worldly matters. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.3.3	Now go and visit the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.3.4	He will instruct us about the afterlife.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.3.5	Those eighty thousand chiefs then went to the Vulture Peak. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.4.1	There they approached Venerable Sāgata, who at that time was the Buddha’s attendant. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.4.2	And they said to him, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.4.3	“Venerable, these eighty thousand chiefs have come to visit the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.4.4	May we please see him.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.4.5	“Well then, please wait here for a moment, while I announce you to the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.5.1	Then, while those eighty thousand chiefs were watching, he sunk into the stone slab he was standing on and emerged in front of the Buddha. And he said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.5.2	“Venerable Sir, eighty thousand chiefs have come to visit you. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.5.3	Please do whatever is convenient.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.5.4	“Well then, Sāgata, please prepare a seat in the shade of the dwelling.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.6.1	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.6.2	He took a stool, sunk down in front of the Buddha, and as those eighty thousand chiefs were watching, he once more emerged from that stone slab. He then prepared a seat in the shade of the dwelling, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.6.3	and the Buddha came out and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.7.1	Those eighty thousand chiefs approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.7.2	But they were preoccupied with Sāgata, not with the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.7.3	After reading the minds of those eighty thousand chiefs, the Buddha said to Sāgata, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.7.4	“Well then, Sāgata, show us more superhuman abilities, more wonders of supernormal power.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.7.5	Saying, “Yes, Sir,” he rose up into the air, walked back and forth in space, and he stood, sat down, and lay down there. He emitted smoke and fire, and then disappeared. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.8.1	After this display of supernormal powers, he bowed down at the feet of the Buddha, and said, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.8.2	“Venerable Sir, you’re my teacher; 
pli-tv-kd5:1.8.3	I’m your disciple.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.8.6	Those eighty thousand chiefs thought, “It’s astonishing and amazing 
pli-tv-kd5:1.8.7	that even a disciple should be so powerful and mighty. Imagine what the teacher must be like!” And now they paid attention to the Buddha, not to Sāgata. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.9.1	Having read their minds, the Buddha gave those eighty thousand chiefs a progressive teaching: 
pli-tv-kd5:1.9.2	talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.9.3	When the Buddha knew that their minds were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: 
pli-tv-kd5:1.9.4	suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.9.5	And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.9.6	so too, while they were sitting right there, those eighty thousand chiefs experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: 
pli-tv-kd5:1.9.7	“Anything that has a beginning has an end.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.10.1	They had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; they had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. They then said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.10.2	“Wonderful, Venerable Sir, wonderful! 
pli-tv-kd5:1.10.3	Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that 
pli-tv-kd5:1.10.4	those with eyes might see what’s there—
pli-tv-kd5:1.10.5	just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.10.6	We go for refuge to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.10.7	to the Teaching, and to the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.10.8	Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.11.0	1.1 The going forth of Soṇa Koḷivisa 
pli-tv-kd5:1.11.1	But Soṇa thought, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.11.2	“The way I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, it’s not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure as a polished conch shell. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.11.3	Why don’t I cut off my hair and beard, put on the ocher robes, and go forth from home into homelessness?” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.11.4	When those eighty-four thousand chiefs had rejoiced and expressed their appreciation for the Buddha’s teaching, they got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with their right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.12.1	Soon after they had left, Soṇa approached the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.12.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.12.3	“Sir, the way I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, it’s not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure as a polished conch shell. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.12.4	I want to cut off my hair and beard, put on the ocher robes, and go forth from home into homelessness. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.12.5	Please give me the going forth.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.12.6	And Soṇa received the going forth and the full ordination in the Buddha’s presence. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.12.7	Soon after his ordination, while staying in Cool Grove, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.13.1	Venerable Soṇa walked up and down with so much energy that his feet cracked. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.13.2	His walking-path was soaked in blood, as if a slaughterhouse. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.13.3	Then, while he was in seclusion, he thought, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.13.4	“I’m one of the Buddha’s energetic disciples, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.13.5	yet my mind isn’t freed from the corruptions without grasping. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.13.6	But my family is wealthy. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.13.8	Why don’t I return to the lower life, enjoy wealth, and make merit?” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.14.1	Just then the Buddha read Soṇa’s mind. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.14.2	And, as a strong man might bend or stretch his arm, so the Buddha disappeared from the Vulture Peak and appeared in Cool Grove. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.14.3	Soon afterwards as the Buddha and a number of monks were walking about the dwellings, they came to Soṇa’s walking-path. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.14.4	The Buddha looked at it and asked the monks, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.14.5	“Whose walking-path is this? It’s soaked in blood, as if a slaughterhouse.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.14.6	And they told him what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.15.1	The Buddha then went up to Soṇa’s dwelling and sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.15.2	Soṇa bowed and sat down, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.15.3	and the Buddha said to him, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.15.4	“Soṇa, when you were in seclusion, didn’t you think, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.15.5	ʻI’m one of the Buddha’s energetic disciples, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.15.6	yet my mind isn’t freed from the corruptions without grasping. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.15.7	But my family is wealthy. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.15.9	Why don’t I return to the lower life, enjoy wealth, and make merit’?” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.15.10	“Yes, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.15.11	“Think about it, Soṇa. When you were previously a householder, weren’t you a skilled lute player?” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.15.12	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.15.13	“When the strings were too tight, was the lute melodious and easy to play?” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.15.14	“No.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.16.1	“When the strings were too loose, was the lute melodious and easy to play?” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.16.2	“No.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.16.3	“But when the strings were neither too tight nor too loose, but set to a balanced tension, was the lute then melodious and easy to play?” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.16.4	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.16.5	“Just so, Soṇa, too much energy leads to restlessness and too little to laziness. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.17.1	So exert a balanced energy and discover an evenness of the spiritual faculties. And that is where you should take up the meditation object.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.17.2	“Yes, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.17.3	Then, as a strong man might bend or stretch his arm, so too the Buddha disappeared from the presence of Soṇa in Cool Grove and appeared on the Vulture Peak. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.18.1	After some time, Soṇa exerted a balanced energy, discovered an evenness of the spiritual faculties, and that is where he took up his meditation object. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.18.2	He then stayed by himself, secluded, heedful, energetic, and diligent. And in this very life, he soon realized with his own insight the supreme goal of the spiritual life for which people from good families rightly go forth from home to homelessness. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.18.3	He understood that birth had come to an end, that the spiritual life had been lived, that the job had been done, that there was no further state of existence. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.18.4	And Venerable Soṇa became one of the perfected ones. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.19.1	After attaining perfection, Soṇa thought, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.19.2	“Let me declare perfect insight in the presence of the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.19.3	He then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.19.4	and said, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.20.1	“Venerable Sir, a monk who is a perfected one—who has ended the corruptions, lived the spiritual life, done the job, put down the burden, realized the true goal, cut the bond to existence, gained release by right insight—he is committed to six things: 
pli-tv-kd5:1.20.2	to renunciation, seclusion, harmlessness, the end of grasping, the end of craving, and non-confusion. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.21.1	Some venerable here might think, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.21.2	ʻNo doubt this venerable is committed to renunciation because of confidence.’ But this is the wrong way to look at it. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.21.3	The monk who has ended the corruptions, who has lived the spiritual life and done the job, doesn’t see anything to be done in himself or anything to be added to what has already been done. He is committed to renunciation because of the ending of sensual desire, because he is without sensual desire. He is committed to renunciation because of the ending of ill will, because he is without ill will. He is committed to renunciation because of the ending of confusion, because he is without confusion. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.22.1	Some venerable here might think, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.22.2	ʻNo doubt this venerable is committed to seclusion because he desires gain, honor, and fame.’ 
pli-tv-kd5:1.22.3	But this is the wrong way to look at it. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.22.4	The monk who has ended the corruptions, who has lived the spiritual life and done the job, doesn’t see anything to be done in himself or anything to be added to what has already been done. He is committed to seclusion because of the ending of sensual desire, because he is without sensual desire. He is committed to seclusion because of the ending of ill will, because he is without ill will. He is committed to seclusion because of the ending of confusion, because he is without confusion. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.23.1	Some venerable here might think, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.23.2	ʻNo doubt this venerable is committed to non-harming because he’s fallen back on adhering to conduct and vows as the essence of the spiritual life.’ 
pli-tv-kd5:1.23.3	But this is the wrong way to look at it. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.23.4	The monk who has ended the corruptions, who has lived the spiritual life and done the job, doesn’t see anything to be done in himself or anything to be added to what has already been done. He is committed to harmlessness because of the ending of sensual desire, because he is without sensual desire. He is committed to harmlessness because of the ending of ill will, because he is without ill will. He is committed to harmlessness because of the ending of confusion, because he is without confusion. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.24.1	He is committed to the end of grasping, to the end of craving, and to non-confusion because of the ending of sensual desire, because he is without sensual desire. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.24.2	He is committed to the end of grasping, to the end of craving, and to non-confusion because of the ending of ill will, because he is without ill will. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.24.3	He is committed to the end of grasping, to the end of craving, and to non-confusion because of the ending of confusion, because he is without confusion. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.25.1	Sir, for a monk who is fully freed in this way, even if he sees compelling visual objects, his mind is not overpowered by them. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.25.2	It remains unaffected, steady, and unshakable, and he observes its disappearance. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.25.3	Even if he hears compelling sounds, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.25.4	smells compelling odors, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.25.5	tastes compelling flavors, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.25.6	touches compelling material objects, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.25.7	or experiences compelling mental phenomena, his mind is not overpowered by them. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.25.8	It remains unaffected, steady, and unshakable, and he observes its disappearance. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.26.1	It’s just like a granite mountain, a single solid mass without cracks. It doesn’t shake or tremble when powerful rainstorms arrive from any direction. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.26.5	The mind of the monk who is fully freed in this way is just like that. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.27.1	For the one committed to renunciation 
pli-tv-kd5:1.27.2	And to seclusion of the mind, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.27.3	For the one committed to harmlessness 
pli-tv-kd5:1.27.4	And to the end of grasping, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.27.5	For the one committed to the end of craving 
pli-tv-kd5:1.27.6	And to non-confusion of the mind, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.27.7	Having seen the arising of the senses, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.27.8	Their mind is fully freed. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.27.9	For the one who is fully freed, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.27.10	The monastic with a peaceful mind, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.27.11	There is nothing more to add 
pli-tv-kd5:1.27.12	And nothing that needs to be done. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.27.13	Just as a single solid rock, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.27.14	Is unshaken by the wind, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.27.15	So too, all visual objects, and sounds, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.27.16	Smells, tastes, and material objects, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.27.17	And mental objects, good and bad, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.27.18	Cannot move that kind of person. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.27.19	Their mind is free and steady, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.27.20	And they observe it as it disappears.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.28.0	2. The prohibition against sandals with double-layered soles, etc. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.28.1	Then the Buddha addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd5:1.28.2	“It’s in this way that someone from a good family declares perfect insight. The matter is spoken of, but the person isn’t mentioned. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.28.3	And still some foolish men here seem to declare perfect insight just for fun. Afterward they experience distress because of that.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.29.1	The Buddha then said to Soṇa, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.29.2	“Soṇa, you were brought up in great comfort. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.29.3	I allow you to use sandals with single-layered soles.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.29.4	“When I went forth into homelessness, Sir, I left behind eighty cartloads of gold coins and a group of seven elephants. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.29.5	If I was to walk around in sandals with single-layered soles, some people would say, ʻSoṇa left all this behind when he went forth 
pli-tv-kd5:1.29.6	and now he’s attached to sandals with single-layered soles.’ 
pli-tv-kd5:1.30.1	If you allow them to the Sangha of monks, I too will use them. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.30.2	If not, I won’t use them either.” 
pli-tv-kd5:1.30.3	The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd5:1.30.4	“I allow sandals with single-layered soles. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.30.5	But you should not wear sandals with double-layered soles, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.30.6	with triple-layered soles, 
pli-tv-kd5:1.30.7	or with multi-layered soles. 
pli-tv-kd5:1.30.8	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd5:2.1.0	3. The prohibition against what is entirely blue, etc. 
pli-tv-kd5:2.1.1	Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six wore entirely blue sandals, 
pli-tv-kd5:2.1.2	entirely yellow sandals, 
pli-tv-kd5:2.1.3	entirely red sandals,

pli-tv-kd5:2.1.5	entirely black sandals, 
pli-tv-kd5:2.1.6	entirely orange sandals, 
pli-tv-kd5:2.1.7	and entirely beige sandals. 
pli-tv-kd5:2.1.8	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd5:2.1.9	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd5:2.1.10	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd5:2.1.11	“You should not wear sandals that are entirely blue, 
pli-tv-kd5:2.1.12	entirely yellow, entirely red, entirely magenta, entirely black, entirely orange, or entirely beige. 
pli-tv-kd5:2.1.13	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd5:2.2.1	At that time the monks from the group of six wore sandals with blue straps, 
pli-tv-kd5:2.2.2	yellow straps, red straps, magenta straps, black straps, orange straps, and beige straps. 
pli-tv-kd5:2.2.3	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd5:2.2.4	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd5:2.2.6	“You should not wear sandals with blue straps, yellow straps, red straps, magenta straps, black straps, orange straps, or beige straps. 
pli-tv-kd5:2.2.7	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd5:2.3.1	At that time the monks from the group of six wore sandals containing leather, enclosing the shin and the foot, enclosing the foot, stuffed with cotton, looking like partridge feathers, having strap fasteners made of ram-horn, having strap fasteners made of goat-horn, decorated with scorpion claws, decorated with a peacock’s tail-feather, and decorated in various ways. 
pli-tv-kd5:2.3.2	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd5:2.3.3	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd5:2.3.5	“You should not wear sandals containing leather, 
pli-tv-kd5:2.3.6	enclosing the shin and the foot, enclosing the foot, stuffed with cotton, looking like partridge feathers, having straps fastened with ram-horn, having straps fastened with goat-horn, having straps like scorpion claws, sewn with thread like a peacock’s tail-feather, or decorated in various ways. 
pli-tv-kd5:2.3.7	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd5:2.4.1	At that time the monks from the group of six wore sandals decorated with lion-skin, tiger-skin, leopard-skin, deer-skin, otter-skin, cat-skin, squirrel-skin, and bat-skin. 
pli-tv-kd5:2.4.2	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd5:2.4.3	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures! 
pli-tv-kd5:2.4.5	“You should not wear sandals decorated with lion-skin, 
pli-tv-kd5:2.4.6	tiger-skin, leopard-skin, deer-skin, otter-skin, cat-skin, squirrel-skin, or bat-skin. 
pli-tv-kd5:2.4.7	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd5:3.1.0	4. The allowance for second-hand sandals with multi-layered soles 
pli-tv-kd5:3.1.1	After robing up one morning, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and entered Rājagaha for almsfood together with an attendant monk. 
pli-tv-kd5:3.1.2	As he was following behind the Buddha, that monk was limping. 
pli-tv-kd5:3.1.3	A certain lay follower wearing sandals with multi-layered soles saw the Buddha coming. 
pli-tv-kd5:3.1.4	He removed his sandals, approached the Buddha, and bowed. 
pli-tv-kd5:3.1.5	He then bowed to the attendant monk and asked him, 
pli-tv-kd5:3.2.1	“Venerable, why are you limping?” 
pli-tv-kd5:3.2.2	“My feet are cracked.” 
pli-tv-kd5:3.2.3	“Well then, take these sandals.” 
pli-tv-kd5:3.2.4	“Thanks, but the Buddha has prohibited sandals with multi-layered soles.” 
pli-tv-kd5:3.2.5	But the Buddha said, “Please take the sandals.” 
pli-tv-kd5:3.2.6	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd5:3.2.7	“I allow second-hand sandals with multi-layered soles. 
pli-tv-kd5:3.2.8	But you should not wear new sandals with multi-layered soles. 
pli-tv-kd5:3.2.9	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd5:4.1.0	5. The prohibition against sandals inside a monastery 
pli-tv-kd5:4.1.1	On one occasion the Buddha walked up and down outside without sandals. 
pli-tv-kd5:4.1.3	The senior monks followed his example, 
pli-tv-kd5:4.1.4	but not the monks from the group of six. 
pli-tv-kd5:4.1.5	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd5:4.1.6	“How can the monks from the group of six walk up and down with sandals when the Teacher and the senior monks do it without?” 
pli-tv-kd5:4.2.1	They told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd5:4.2.2	“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are acting like this?” 
pli-tv-kd5:4.2.3	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd5:4.2.4	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-kd5:4.2.5	“How can those foolish men walk up and down with sandals when the Teacher and the senior monks do it without? 
pli-tv-kd5:4.2.6	Even the householders who wear white are respectful and deferential toward their teachers for teaching them the profession by which they make a living. 
pli-tv-kd5:4.3.1	But you who have gone forth on such a well-proclaimed spiritual path will become notorious if you are not respectful and deferential toward your teachers, your preceptors, or those of an equivalent standing. 
pli-tv-kd5:4.3.2	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd5:4.3.3	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd5:4.3.4	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd5:4.3.5	“You should not walk up and down with sandals when your teachers, your preceptors, or those of equivalent standing do it without. 
pli-tv-kd5:4.3.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd5:4.3.7	And you should not wear sandals within a monastery. 
pli-tv-kd5:4.3.8	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd5:5.1.1	Soon afterwards a certain monk was afflicted with corns on his feet. 
pli-tv-kd5:5.1.2	The monks had to hold him while he urinated and defecated. 
pli-tv-kd5:5.1.3	Just then as the Buddha was walking about the dwellings, he saw this. He went up to those monks and said to them, 
pli-tv-kd5:5.2.1	“What illness does this monk have?” 
pli-tv-kd5:5.2.2	“He has corns on his feet, Sir. 
pli-tv-kd5:5.2.3	That’s why we do this for him.” 
pli-tv-kd5:5.2.4	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd5:5.2.5	“I allow you to wear sandals if your feet are painful or cracked, or you have corns on your feet.” 
pli-tv-kd5:6.1.1	The monks used beds and benches with dirty feet. 
pli-tv-kd5:6.1.2	Their robes and the furniture became dirty. 
pli-tv-kd5:6.1.4	“When you know that you are about to use a bed or bench, I allow you to wear sandals.” 
pli-tv-kd5:6.2.1	When monks were going to the observance hall or a meeting in the dark of night, they stepped on stumps and thorns, hurting their feet. 
pli-tv-kd5:6.2.3	“I allow you to wear sandals within a monastery, and also to use a torch, a lamp, and a walking stick.” 
pli-tv-kd5:6.3.0	6. The prohibition against wooden shoes, etc. 
pli-tv-kd5:6.3.1	At one time the monks from the group of six got up early in the morning, put on wooden shoes, and walked up and down outside. They made a loud clacking noise. And they talked about all sorts of pointless things: 
pli-tv-kd5:6.3.2	about kings, gangsters, and officials; about armies, dangers, and battles; about food, drink, clothes, and beds; about garlands and perfumes; about relatives, vehicles, villages, towns, and countries; about women and heroes; gossip; about the departed; about various trivialities; about the world and the sea; about being this or that. 
pli-tv-kd5:6.3.3	They stepped on and killed insects, and they roused the monks from the stillness of meditation. 
pli-tv-kd5:6.4.1	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd5:6.4.2	“How can the monks from the group of six act like this?” 
pli-tv-kd5:6.4.5	They told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd5:6.4.6	“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are acting like this?” 
pli-tv-kd5:6.4.9	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd5:6.4.10	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd5:6.4.11	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd5:6.4.12	“You should not wear wooden shoes. 
pli-tv-kd5:6.4.13	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd5:7.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Benares. 
pli-tv-kd5:7.1.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd5:7.1.3	he stayed in the deer park at Isipatana. 
pli-tv-kd5:7.1.4	When the monks from the group of six knew that 
pli-tv-kd5:7.1.5	the Buddha had prohibited wooden shoes, 
pli-tv-kd5:7.1.6	they had cuttings made from young palm trees and wore shoes made of palm leaves. 
pli-tv-kd5:7.1.7	Those young palm trees withered. 
pli-tv-kd5:7.1.8	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd5:7.1.9	“How can the Sakyan monastics act like this? 
pli-tv-kd5:7.1.11	They are harming one-sensed life.” 
pli-tv-kd5:7.2.1	The monks heard the complaints of those people 
pli-tv-kd5:7.2.2	and they told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd5:7.2.3	“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are acting like this?” 
pli-tv-kd5:7.2.5	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd5:7.2.6	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-kd5:7.2.7	“How can those foolish men have cuttings made from young palm trees and wear shoes made of palm leaves, 
pli-tv-kd5:7.2.8	when those young palm trees wither as a consequence? 
pli-tv-kd5:7.2.9	People regard trees as conscious. 
pli-tv-kd5:7.2.10	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd5:7.2.11	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd5:7.2.12	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd5:7.2.13	“You should not wear shoes made of palm leaves. 
pli-tv-kd5:7.2.14	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd5:7.3.1	When they knew that 
pli-tv-kd5:7.3.2	the Buddha had prohibited shoes made of palm leaves, 
pli-tv-kd5:7.3.3	the monks from the group of six had cuttings made from young bamboo plants and wore shoes made of bamboo leaves. 
pli-tv-kd5:7.3.4	Those young bamboo plants withered. 
pli-tv-kd5:7.3.5	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd5:7.3.6	“How can the Sakyan monastics act like this? 
pli-tv-kd5:7.3.8	They are harming one-sensed life.” 
pli-tv-kd5:7.3.9	The monks heard the complaints of those people 
pli-tv-kd5:7.3.10	and they told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd5:7.3.11	“… People regard trees as conscious … 
pli-tv-kd5:7.3.12	You should not wear shoes made of bamboo leaves. 
pli-tv-kd5:7.3.13	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd5:8.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Benares for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Bhaddiya. 
pli-tv-kd5:8.1.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd5:8.1.3	he stayed in the Jātiyā Grove. 
pli-tv-kd5:8.1.4	At that time the monks in Bhaddiya were fond of various kinds of nice shoes. They made shoes of grass, fishtail-palm leaves, and wool, and they had them made. As a consequence, they neglected recitation, questioning, the higher morality, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom. 
pli-tv-kd5:8.2.1	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd5:8.2.2	“How can the monks in Bhaddiya do this?” 
pli-tv-kd5:8.2.3	They told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd5:8.2.4	“Is it true, monks, that the monks in Bhaddiya do this?” 
pli-tv-kd5:8.2.6	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd5:8.2.7	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-kd5:8.2.8	“How can those foolish men be fond of various kinds of nice shoes … 
pli-tv-kd5:8.2.9	and neglect recitation, questioning, the higher morality, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom? 
pli-tv-kd5:8.3.1	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd5:8.3.2	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd5:8.3.3	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd5:8.3.4	“You should not wear shoes made of grass, reed, fishtail-palm leaves, or wool; or shoes made with gold, silver, gems, beryl, crystal, bronze, glass, tin, lead, or copper. 
pli-tv-kd5:8.3.5	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd5:8.3.6	And you should not use shoes for walking. 
pli-tv-kd5:8.3.7	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd5:8.3.8	I allow three kinds of foot-stands that are fixed in place and immobile: 
pli-tv-kd5:8.3.9	foot-stands for defecating, foot-stands for urinating, foot-stands for restroom rinsing.” 
pli-tv-kd5:9.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Bhaddiya for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd5:9.1.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd5:9.1.3	he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd5:9.1.4	At this time, when cattle were crossing the Aciravatī river, the monks from the group of six would grab them by the horns, the ears, the neck, and the tail, and they mounted their backs, and motivated by lust, they touched their genitals. They even killed a calf by submerging it. 
pli-tv-kd5:9.2.1	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd5:9.2.2	“How can the Sakyan monastics act like this? 
pli-tv-kd5:9.2.3	They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd5:9.2.4	The monks heard the complaints of those people 
pli-tv-kd5:9.2.5	and they told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd5:9.2.6	“Is it true, monks …” 
pli-tv-kd5:9.3.1	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd5:9.3.2	after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd5:9.3.3	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd5:9.3.4	“You should not grab cattle by the horns, the ears, the neck, or the tail, and you should not mount their backs. 
pli-tv-kd5:9.3.5	If you do mount their backs, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd5:9.3.6	And you should not touch their genitals motivated by lust. 
pli-tv-kd5:9.3.7	If you do, you commit a serious offense. 
pli-tv-kd5:9.3.8	And you should not kill a calf. 
pli-tv-kd5:9.3.9	If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule.” 
pli-tv-kd5:9.4.0	7. The prohibition against vehicles, etc. 
pli-tv-kd5:9.4.1	At that time the monks from the group of six traveled in vehicles, sometimes pulled by women with men inside, at other times pulled by men with women inside. 
pli-tv-kd5:9.4.2	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd5:9.4.3	“It’s as if they’re at the Ganges festival.” 
pli-tv-kd5:9.4.4	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd5:9.4.5	“You should not travel in a vehicle. 
pli-tv-kd5:9.4.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd5:10.1.1	Soon afterwards a monk who was traveling through the Kosalan country on his way to visit the Buddha at Sāvatthī became sick. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.1.2	He stepped off the path and sat down at the foot of a tree. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.1.3	People saw him and said to him, 
pli-tv-kd5:10.1.4	“Venerable, where are you going?” 
pli-tv-kd5:10.1.5	“I’m going to Sāvatthī to visit the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd5:10.2.1	“Please come with us.” 
pli-tv-kd5:10.2.2	“I can’t; I’m sick.” 
pli-tv-kd5:10.2.3	“Then please mount the vehicle.” 
pli-tv-kd5:10.2.4	“Thanks, but the Buddha has prohibited us from traveling in vehicles.” And being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not accept. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.2.5	When he arrived at Sāvatthī, he told the monks what had happened, 
pli-tv-kd5:10.2.6	who in turn told the Buddha. He said, 
pli-tv-kd5:10.2.7	“I allow a vehicle when you’re sick.” 
pli-tv-kd5:10.3.1	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd5:10.3.2	“A vehicle pulled by women or by men?” 
pli-tv-kd5:10.3.4	“I allow a rickshaw pulled by men.” 
pli-tv-kd5:10.3.5	Soon afterwards a certain monk was even more uncomfortable when jolted around in a vehicle. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.3.7	“I allow a palanquin and a litter.” 
pli-tv-kd5:10.4.0	8. The prohibition against high and luxurious resting places 
pli-tv-kd5:10.4.1	At that time the monks from the group of six used high and luxurious resting places, such as: 
pli-tv-kd5:10.4.2	a high couch, a luxurious couch, a long-fleeced woolen rug, a multi-colored woolen rug, a white woolen rug, a red woolen rug, a quilt filled with cotton down, a woolen rug decorated with the images of wild animals, a woolen rug with long fleece on one side, a woolen rug with long fleece on both side, a sheet of silk embroidered with gems, a silken sheet, a woolen rug like a dancers’ rug, an elephant-back rug, a horse-back rug, a carriage-seat rug, a rug made of black antelope hide, an excellent rug made of _kadalī_-deer hide, a bed with a canopy, a bed with red cushions at each end. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.4.3	When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd5:10.4.4	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd5:10.4.5	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd5:10.5.1	“You should not use high and luxurious resting places, such as: 
pli-tv-kd5:10.5.2	a high couch, a luxurious couch, a long-fleeced woolen rug, a multi-colored woolen rug, a white woolen rug, a red woolen rug, a quilt filled with cotton down, a woolen rug decorated with the images of wild animals, a woolen rug with long fleece on one side, a woolen rug with long fleece on both side, a sheet of silk embroidered with gems, a silken sheet, a woolen rug like a dancers’ rug, an elephant-back rug, a horse-back rug, a carriage-seat rug, a rug made of black antelope hide, an excellent sheet made of _kadalī_-deer hide, a bed with a canopy, or a bed with red cushions at each end. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.5.3	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd5:10.6.0	9. The prohibition against all skins 
pli-tv-kd5:10.6.1	Soon afterwards when the monks from the group of six knew that 
pli-tv-kd5:10.6.2	the Buddha had prohibited high and luxurious resting places, 
pli-tv-kd5:10.6.3	they used luxurious skins: lion skins, tiger skins, and leopard skins. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.6.4	They cut them to fit their beds and benches, and used them both there and elsewhere. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.6.5	When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd5:10.6.6	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd5:10.6.7	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd5:10.6.8	“You should not use luxurious skins: lion skins, tiger skins, or leopard skins. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.6.9	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd5:10.7.1	Soon afterwards when the monks from the group of six knew that 
pli-tv-kd5:10.7.2	the Buddha had prohibited luxurious skins, 
pli-tv-kd5:10.7.3	they used cattle hides. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.7.4	They cut them to fit their beds and benches, and used them both there and elsewhere. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.7.5	At this time a certain bad monk was associating with the family of a bad lay follower. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.7.6	One morning that monk robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to that lay follower’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.7.7	That lay follower approached the monk, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.8.1	At that time that lay follower had a beautiful young calf with variegated hide, just like a young leopard. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.8.2	The bad monk stared at that calf 
pli-tv-kd5:10.8.3	and the lay follower asked him why. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.8.5	He replied, “I want the skin of that calf.” 
pli-tv-kd5:10.8.6	The bad lay follower then slaughtered the calf, skinned it, and gave the skin to the bad monk. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.8.7	The monk hid the skin under his upper robe and left. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.9.1	The mother-cow, longing for her calf, followed behind him. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.9.2	When the monks asked him 
pli-tv-kd5:10.9.3	why the cow was following him, 
pli-tv-kd5:10.9.4	he replied he did not know. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.9.5	But his upper robe was smeared with blood 
pli-tv-kd5:10.9.6	and so the monks said, 
pli-tv-kd5:10.9.7	“What happened to your upper robe?” 
pli-tv-kd5:10.9.8	When he had told them what had happened, 
pli-tv-kd5:10.9.9	they said, “So did you encourage someone to kill?” 
pli-tv-kd5:10.9.10	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd5:10.9.11	The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd5:10.9.12	“How can a monk encourage someone to kill? Hasn’t the Buddha in many ways criticized killing and praised the abstention from killing?” 
pli-tv-kd5:10.9.13	And they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.10.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned that bad monk: 
pli-tv-kd5:10.10.2	“Is it true, monk, that you encouraged someone to kill?” 
pli-tv-kd5:10.10.3	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd5:10.10.4	“Foolish man, how can you encourage someone to kill? Haven’t I in many ways criticized killing and praised the abstention from killing? 
pli-tv-kd5:10.10.5	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd5:10.10.6	after rebuking him, the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd5:10.10.7	“You should not make others killing. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.10.8	If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.10.9	And you should not use cattle hide. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.10.10	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.10.11	And you should not use any kind of skin. 
pli-tv-kd5:10.10.12	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd5:11.1.0	10. The allowance regarding the belongings of a householder, etc. 
pli-tv-kd5:11.1.1	At that time people’s beds and benches were upholstered and covered with skin. 
pli-tv-kd5:11.1.2	Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not sit on them. 
pli-tv-kd5:11.1.4	“I allow you to sit down on what belongs to a householder, but not to lie down on it.” 
pli-tv-kd5:11.1.5	But then the dwellings were held together by straps of leather. 
pli-tv-kd5:11.1.6	Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not sit down. 
pli-tv-kd5:11.1.8	“I allow you to sit down against a mere binding made of skin.” 
pli-tv-kd5:12.1.1	At that time the monks from the group of six entered the village wearing sandals. 
pli-tv-kd5:12.1.2	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd5:12.1.3	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd5:12.1.4	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd5:12.1.5	“You should not enter the village wearing sandals. 
pli-tv-kd5:12.1.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd5:12.1.7	Soon afterwards a certain sick monk was not able to enter the village without his sandals. 
pli-tv-kd5:12.1.9	“I allow sick monks to enter the village while wearing sandals.” 
pli-tv-kd5:13.1.0	11. The account of Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa 
pli-tv-kd5:13.1.1	At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying in Avantī on Papataka Hill at Kuraraghara. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.1.2	At that time the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa was his supporter. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.1.3	On one occasion Soṇa went to Mahākaccāna, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd5:13.1.4	and said, 
pli-tv-kd5:13.1.5	“Venerable, the way I understand your teaching, it’s not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure as a polished conch shell. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.1.6	I wish to cut off my hair and beard, put on the ocher robes, and go forth from home into homelessness. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.1.7	Please give me the going forth.” 
pli-tv-kd5:13.2.1	“It’s difficult, Soṇa, to live the spiritual life all one’s life, eating one meal a day and sleeping by oneself. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.2.2	So follow the instruction of the Buddhas while remaining as a householder, and at suitable times you may eat one meal a day, sleep by yourself, and practice celibacy.” 
pli-tv-kd5:13.2.3	As a result, Soṇa’s intention to go forth died down. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.2.4	A second time Soṇa asked Mahākaccāna for the going forth, but got the same response. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.2.5	A third time he asked for the going forth 
pli-tv-kd5:13.2.10	and Mahākaccāna finally relented. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.2.11	At that time in the southern region of Avantī, there were few monks. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.2.12	Only after three years, with much trouble and difficulty, was Mahākaccāna able to gather a sangha of ten monks from here and there to give the full ordination to Venerable Soṇa. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.3.0	12. The making known of the five favors for Mahākaccāna 
pli-tv-kd5:13.3.1	While he was in seclusion after completing the rainy-season residence, Soṇa thought, 
pli-tv-kd5:13.3.2	“I’ve heard that the Buddha is like this and like that, but I haven’t seen this for myself. If my preceptor allows me, I shall go and visit the Buddha, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One.” 
pli-tv-kd5:13.3.3	When he had come out from seclusion, Soṇa went to Mahākaccāna, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd5:13.4.1	and told him 
pli-tv-kd5:13.4.2	what he had been thinking. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.4.5	Mahākaccāna said, “Well considered, Soṇa! 
pli-tv-kd5:13.4.6	Please go and visit the Buddha, the perfected and fully awakened one. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.5.1	You will see him—pleasing to the eye and inspiring confidence; peaceful in mind and faculties; attained to the supreme subduing and calm; tamed, guarded, and restrained in his senses; a great being. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.5.2	Then, Soṇa, in my name, pay respect with your head at the Buddha’s feet and say, ʻ 
pli-tv-kd5:13.5.3	Venerable Sir, my preceptor, Venerable Mahākaccāna, pays respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet.’ 
pli-tv-kd5:13.5.4	And then say this: 
pli-tv-kd5:13.5.5	ʻIn the southern region of Avantī, Sir, there are few monks. Only after three years, with much trouble and difficulty, was it possible to gather a sangha of ten monks from here and there to give me the full ordination. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.5.6	Perhaps the Buddha will allow a smaller group of monks to give the full ordination in Avantī. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.6.1	In Avantī the ground is dark and hard, made rough by the hooves of cattle. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.6.2	Perhaps the Buddha will allow sandals with multi-layered soles in Avantī. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.6.3	In Avantī people value bathing and cleanliness. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.6.4	Perhaps the Buddha will allow unrestricted bathing in Avantī. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.6.5	In Avantī sheep-skins, goat-skins, and deer-skins are used as rugs, 
pli-tv-kd5:13.6.6	just as are _eragu_-grass, chaff-flower grass, _majjāru_-grass, and _jantu_-grass in the central Ganges plain. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.6.8	Perhaps the Buddha will allow sheep-skins, goat-skins, and deer-skins as rugs in Avantī. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.7.1	At present people give robes to monks who are outside the monastic boundary, saying, 
pli-tv-kd5:13.7.2	“We give this robe to so-and-so.” 
pli-tv-kd5:13.7.3	When those monks return to the monastery, they are told, 
pli-tv-kd5:13.7.4	“Such-and-such people have given you a robe.” But being afraid of wrongdoing, they don’t accept, thinking, 
pli-tv-kd5:13.7.5	“We might commit an offense entailing relinquishment.” 
pli-tv-kd5:13.7.6	Perhaps the Buddha will point out a way to deal with robes.’” 
pli-tv-kd5:13.7.7	Soṇa replied, “Yes, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd5:13.7.8	He got up from his seat, bowed down, and circumambulated Mahākāccāna with his right side toward him. He then put his dwelling in order, took his bowl and robe, and set out for Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.8.1	When he eventually arrived, he went to the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, where he approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.8.2	The Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda, 
pli-tv-kd5:13.8.3	“Ānanda, please prepare a resting place for this newly arrived monk.” 
pli-tv-kd5:13.8.4	Ānanda thought, 
pli-tv-kd5:13.8.5	“When the Buddha says this, it means he wishes to stay in the same dwelling as Venerable Soṇa.” 
pli-tv-kd5:13.8.6	And he prepared a resting place for Soṇa in the Buddha’s dwelling. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.9.1	Then, after spending much of the night outside, the Buddha entered the dwelling, 
pli-tv-kd5:13.9.2	as did Soṇa. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.9.3	Rising early in the morning, the Buddha said to Soṇa, 
pli-tv-kd5:13.9.4	“Recite a teaching, monk.” 
pli-tv-kd5:13.9.5	Saying, “Yes, Sir,” he chanted the entire Chapter of Eights. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.9.6	When he was finished, the Buddha said, 
pli-tv-kd5:13.9.7	“Well done, Soṇa, well done. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.9.8	You have learned the Chapter Eights well; you have remembered it well. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.9.9	And you have a good voice—it’s clear, articulate, and gets the meaning across. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.9.10	How long have you been a monk?” 
pli-tv-kd5:13.9.11	“One year.” 
pli-tv-kd5:13.10.1	“Why did it take you so long to go forth?” 
pli-tv-kd5:13.10.2	“I have long seen the danger in worldly pleasures. Still, because household life is crowded and very busy, I was not able to leave.” 
pli-tv-kd5:13.10.3	Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha exclaimed this inspired utterance: 
pli-tv-kd5:13.10.4	“Having seen the danger in the world, 
pli-tv-kd5:13.10.5	Knowing the Truth beyond ownership, 
pli-tv-kd5:13.10.6	The noble one doesn’t delight in what’s bad; 
pli-tv-kd5:13.10.7	In the bad, the pure one doesn’t delight.” 
pli-tv-kd5:13.11.1	Soṇa thought, 
pli-tv-kd5:13.11.2	“The Buddha approves of me. This is the time to bring up what my preceptor said.” 
pli-tv-kd5:13.11.3	He got up from his seat, put his upper robe over one shoulder, bowed down at the Buddha’s feet, and said, 
pli-tv-kd5:13.11.4	“Sir, my preceptor, Venerable Mahākaccāna, pays respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet.” He then repeated everything Mahākaccāna had asked him to say. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.11.20	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd5:13.11.21	“In the southern region of Avantī there are few monks. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.11.22	In all outlying countries, I allow the full ordination to be given by a group of five, including one expert on the Monastic Law. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.12.1	In this regard, the following are the outlying countries: 
pli-tv-kd5:13.12.2	In the eastern direction there is a town called _Gajaṅgala_, with another town called _Mahāsālā_ on the other side of it. Beyond that are the outlying countries. On the near side are the middle countries. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.12.3	In the south-eastern direction there is a river called _Sallavatī_. Beyond that are the outlying countries. On the near side are the middle countries. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.12.4	In the southern direction there is a town called _Setakaṇṇika_. Beyond that are the outlying countries. On the near side are the middle countries. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.12.5	In the western direction there is a brahmin village called _Thūṇa_. Beyond that are the outlying countries. On the near side are the middle countries. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.12.6	In the northern direction there is a mountain called _Usīraddhaja_. Beyond that are the outlying countries. On the near side are the middle countries. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.13.1	In Avantī the ground is dark and hard, made rough by the hooves of cattle. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.13.2	In all outlying countries, I allow sandals with multi-layered soles. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.13.3	In Avantī people value bathing and cleanliness. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.13.4	In all outlying countries, I allow unrestricted bathing. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.13.5	In Avantī sheep-skins, goat-skins, and deer-skins are used as rugs, 
pli-tv-kd5:13.13.6	just as are _eragu_-grass, chaff-flower grass, _majjāru_-grass, and _jantu_-grass in the central Ganges plain. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.13.8	In all outlying countries, I allow rugs of sheep-skin, goat-skin, and deer-skin. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.13.9	And it may happen that people give robes to monks who are outside the monastic boundary, saying, ʻ 
pli-tv-kd5:13.13.10	We give this robe to so-and-so.’ 
pli-tv-kd5:13.13.11	I allow you to accept it and not start counting the days until you have the robe in your hand.” 
pli-tv-kd5:13.13.12	The fifth chapter on skins is finished. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.13.52	In this chapter there are sixty-three topics. 
pli-tv-kd5:13.13.53	The chapter on skins is finished.
pli-tv-kd6:0.1	Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law 
pli-tv-kd6:0.2	The Long Division 
pli-tv-kd6:0.3	The chapter on medicines 
pli-tv-kd6:0.4	1. Discussion of the five tonics 
pli-tv-kd6:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd6:1.1.2	At that time the monks were afflicted with autumn illness, and they could not keep down either rice porridge or other food. 
pli-tv-kd6:1.1.3	Because of that they became thin, haggard, and pale, with veins protruding all over their body. 
pli-tv-kd6:1.1.4	The Buddha saw them and asked Venerable Ānanda 
pli-tv-kd6:1.1.5	why they were looking so sickly. 
pli-tv-kd6:1.1.6	And Ānanda told him. 
pli-tv-kd6:1.2.1	When the Buddha was in seclusion, he considered this and thought, 
pli-tv-kd6:1.2.4	“What tonics might I allow the monks that are generally regarded as tonics, would serve the purpose of nourishment, but aren’t considered as substantial food?” 
pli-tv-kd6:1.2.5	It then occurred to him, 
pli-tv-kd6:1.2.6	“There are these five tonics—
pli-tv-kd6:1.2.7	ghee, butter, oil, honey, and syrup—
pli-tv-kd6:1.2.8	that are generally regarded as tonics, serve the purpose of nourishment, but are not considered as substantial food. 
pli-tv-kd6:1.2.9	Why don’t I allow them these five tonics, to be received and consumed before midday?” 
pli-tv-kd6:1.3.1	In the evening, when the Buddha had come out from seclusion, he gave a teaching and then told the monks what he had thought, adding: 
pli-tv-kd6:1.3.11	“I allow these five tonics to be received and consumed before midday.” 
pli-tv-kd6:1.4.1	The monks then received and consumed those five tonics before midday. 
pli-tv-kd6:1.4.2	But even ordinary food did not agree with them, let alone greasy food. 
pli-tv-kd6:1.4.3	As result of both the autumn illness and the food not agreeing with them, they became even more thin, haggard, and pale. 
pli-tv-kd6:1.4.4	The Buddha saw them and asked Venerable Ānanda 
pli-tv-kd6:1.4.5	why they were looking even worse. 
pli-tv-kd6:1.5.1	And Ānanda told him. 
pli-tv-kd6:1.5.4	The Buddha then gave a teaching, and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:1.5.5	“I allow the five tonics to be received and consumed both before and after midday.” 
pli-tv-kd6:2.1.1	At that time sick monks needed fat as a tonic. 
pli-tv-kd6:2.1.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd6:2.1.3	“I allow these fats as tonics: 
pli-tv-kd6:2.1.4	bear fat, fish fat, alligator fat, pig fat, and donkey fat. 
pli-tv-kd6:2.1.5	They should be received, melted, and mixed with oil before midday, and then used. 
pli-tv-kd6:2.2.1	If you receive, melt, and mix them with oil after midday, and then use them, you commit three offenses of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd6:2.2.2	If you receive them before midday, but melt and mix them with oil after midday, and then use them, you commit two offenses of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd6:2.2.3	If you receive and melt them before midday, but mix them with oil after midday, and then use them, you commit one offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd6:2.2.4	If you receive, melt, and mix them with oil before midday, and then use them, there is no offense.” 
pli-tv-kd6:3.1.0	2. Discussion of root medicines, etc. 
pli-tv-kd6:3.1.1	At that time sick monks needed medicinal roots. 
pli-tv-kd6:3.1.3	“I allow these medicinal roots: 
pli-tv-kd6:3.1.4	turmeric, ginger, sweet flag, white sweet flag, atis root, black hellebore, khus root, nutgrass, and whatever other medicinal roots there are that don’t serve as fresh or cooked food. 
pli-tv-kd6:3.1.5	After receiving them, you may keep them for life 
pli-tv-kd6:3.1.6	and use them when there is a reason. 
pli-tv-kd6:3.1.7	If you use them when there is no reason, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd6:3.2.1	Soon afterwards the sick monks needed medicinal root flour. 
pli-tv-kd6:3.2.3	“I allow a grinding stone.” 
pli-tv-kd6:4.1.1	The sick monks needed bitter medicines. 
pli-tv-kd6:4.1.3	“I allow bitter medicines from these plants: 
pli-tv-kd6:4.1.4	neem tree, the arctic snow, pointed gourd, rumph’s fig, Indian beech, and whatever other bitter medicines there are that don’t serve as fresh or cooked food. 
pli-tv-kd6:4.1.5	After receiving them, you may keep them for life 
pli-tv-kd6:4.1.6	and use them when there is a reason. 
pli-tv-kd6:4.1.7	If you use them when there is no reason, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd6:5.1.1	The sick monks needed medicinal leaves. 
pli-tv-kd6:5.1.3	“I allow medicinal leaves from these plants: 
pli-tv-kd6:5.1.4	neem tree, the arctic snow, golden rumph’s fig, holy basil, cotton-plant, and whatever other leaf medicines there are that don’t serve as fresh or cooked food. 
pli-tv-kd6:5.1.5	After receiving them, you may keep them for life and use them when there is a reason. If you use them when there is no reason, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd6:6.1.1	The sick monks needed medicinal fruits. 
pli-tv-kd6:6.1.3	“I allow medicinal fruits from these plants: 
pli-tv-kd6:6.1.4	false pepper, long pepper, black pepper, chebulic myrobalan, belleric myrobalan, emblic myrobalan, crepe ginger, and whatever other medicinal fruits there are that don’t serve as fresh or cooked food. 
pli-tv-kd6:6.1.5	After receiving them, you may keep them for life and use them when there is a reason. If you use them when there is no reason, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd6:7.1.1	The sick monks needed medicinal gum. 
pli-tv-kd6:7.1.3	“I allow the following medicinal gums: 
pli-tv-kd6:7.1.4	gum exuded from the asafoetida shrub, gum from the twigs and leaves of the asafoetida shrub, gum from the leaves of the asafoetida shrub, _taka_ gum, _taka_-leaf gum, gum from heated _taka_ foliage, resin, and whatever other medicinal gums there are that don’t serve as fresh or cooked food. 
pli-tv-kd6:7.1.5	After receiving them, you may keep them for life and use them when there is a reason. If you use them when there is no reason, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd6:8.1.1	The sick monks needed medicinal salts. 
pli-tv-kd6:8.1.3	“I allow the following medicinal salts: 
pli-tv-kd6:8.1.4	sea salt, black salt, hill salt, soil salt, red salt, and whatever other medicinal salts there are that don’t serve as fresh or cooked food. 
pli-tv-kd6:8.1.5	After receiving them, you may keep them for life 
pli-tv-kd6:8.1.6	and use them when there is a reason. 
pli-tv-kd6:8.1.7	If you use them when there is no reason, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd6:9.1.1	At one time Venerable Ānanda’s preceptor, Venerable Belaṭṭhasīsa, had carbuncles, 
pli-tv-kd6:9.1.2	and the pus caused his robes to adhere to his body. The monks kept on wetting his robes to remove the pus. 
pli-tv-kd6:9.1.3	As the Buddha was walking about the dwellings, he saw them doing this. He went up to them and said, 
pli-tv-kd6:9.1.4	“What sickness does this monk have?” 
pli-tv-kd6:9.1.5	“He has carbuncles, Sir. That’s why we’re doing this.” 
pli-tv-kd6:9.2.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:9.2.2	“For anyone who has an itch, a boil, a running sore, a carbuncle, or whose body smells, I allow medicinal powders. 
pli-tv-kd6:9.2.3	If you’re not sick, I allow detergent, soap, and cleaning agents. 
pli-tv-kd6:9.2.4	And I allow a mortar and pestle.” 
pli-tv-kd6:10.1.1	Soon afterwards the sick monks needed strained medicinal powders. 
pli-tv-kd6:10.1.3	“I allow a powder sieve.” 
pli-tv-kd6:10.1.4	And they needed finely sifted powder. 
pli-tv-kd6:10.1.6	“I allow a cloth sieve.” 
pli-tv-kd6:10.2.1	On one occasion a monk was possessed by spirits. 
pli-tv-kd6:10.2.2	His teacher and preceptor who were nursing him were not able to cure him. 
pli-tv-kd6:10.2.3	He then went to a pigs’ slaughterhouse, where he ate raw meat and drank blood. 
pli-tv-kd6:10.2.4	As a result, he became well. 
pli-tv-kd6:10.2.5	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd6:10.2.6	“For one who is possessed, I allow raw meat and raw blood.” 
pli-tv-kd6:11.1.1	At one time a monk was afflicted with an eye-disease. 
pli-tv-kd6:11.1.2	The monks had to hold him while he urinated and defecated. 
pli-tv-kd6:11.1.3	Just then the Buddha was walking about the dwellings and he saw this. He then went up to those monks and said to them, 
pli-tv-kd6:11.1.4	“What sickness does this monk have?” 
pli-tv-kd6:11.2.1	“He has an eye-disease, Sir. 
pli-tv-kd6:11.2.2	That’s why we do this for him.” 
pli-tv-kd6:11.2.3	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:11.2.4	“I allow these ointments: 
pli-tv-kd6:11.2.5	black ointment, mixed ointment, river ointment, red ocher, soot.” 
pli-tv-kd6:11.2.6	They needed scented ointments. 
pli-tv-kd6:11.2.8	“I allow sandal, crape jasmine, Indian valerian, coffee plum, and nutgrass.” 
pli-tv-kd6:12.1.1	At that time the monks put their ointment in pots and scoops. 
pli-tv-kd6:12.1.2	The ointment was contaminated with grass, dust, and dirt. 
pli-tv-kd6:12.1.4	“I allow an ointment box.” 
pli-tv-kd6:12.1.5	Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six used luxurious ointment boxes 
pli-tv-kd6:12.1.6	made of gold or silver. 
pli-tv-kd6:12.1.7	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd6:12.1.8	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd6:12.1.9	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd6:12.1.10	“You should not use luxurious ointment boxes. 
pli-tv-kd6:12.1.11	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd6:12.1.12	I allow ointment boxes made of bone, ivory, horn, reed, bamboo, wood, resin, fruit, metal, and shell.” 
pli-tv-kd6:12.2.1	At that time the ointment boxes were not covered. The ointment was contaminated with grass, dust, and dirt. 
pli-tv-kd6:12.2.3	“I allow a lid.” 
pli-tv-kd6:12.2.4	The lids fell off. 
pli-tv-kd6:12.2.6	“I allow you to tie it onto the ointment box with a string.” 
pli-tv-kd6:12.2.7	The ointment boxes split. 
pli-tv-kd6:12.2.9	“I allow you to sew it together with a thread.” 
pli-tv-kd6:12.3.1	At that time the monks put the ointment on with their fingers, and as a result their eyes hurt. 
pli-tv-kd6:12.3.3	“I allow an ointment stick.” 
pli-tv-kd6:12.3.4	Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six used luxurious ointment sticks 
pli-tv-kd6:12.3.5	made of gold or silver. 
pli-tv-kd6:12.3.6	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd6:12.3.7	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd6:12.3.8	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd6:12.3.9	“You should not use luxurious ointment sticks. 
pli-tv-kd6:12.3.10	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd6:12.3.11	I allow ointment sticks made of bone, ivory, horn, reed, bamboo, wood, resin, fruit, metal, and shell.” 
pli-tv-kd6:12.4.1	The monks dropped the ointment sticks on the ground, and they became rough. 
pli-tv-kd6:12.4.3	“I allow a case for the ointment stick.” 
pli-tv-kd6:12.4.4	The monks carried the ointment boxes and ointment sticks in their hands. 
pli-tv-kd6:12.4.6	“I allow a bag for the ointment box.” 
pli-tv-kd6:12.4.7	They did not have shoulder straps. 
pli-tv-kd6:12.4.9	“I allow a shoulder strap and a string for tying it.” 
pli-tv-kd6:13.1.1	At one time Venerable Pilindavaccha had a headache. 
pli-tv-kd6:13.1.3	“I allow oil for the head.” 
pli-tv-kd6:13.1.4	He did not get better. 
pli-tv-kd6:13.1.6	“I allow treatment through the nose.” 
pli-tv-kd6:13.1.7	The oil dripped from the nose. 
pli-tv-kd6:13.1.9	“I allow a nose dropper.” 
pli-tv-kd6:13.1.10	Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six used luxurious nose droppers 
pli-tv-kd6:13.1.11	made of gold or silver. 
pli-tv-kd6:13.1.12	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd6:13.1.13	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd6:13.1.14	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd6:13.1.15	“You should not use luxurious nose droppers. 
pli-tv-kd6:13.1.16	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd6:13.1.17	I allow nose droppers made of bone, ivory, horn, reed, bamboo, wood, resin, fruit, metal, 
pli-tv-kd6:13.1.18	and shell.” 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.1	The nose dropper dripped unevenly. 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.3	“I allow a double nose dropper.” 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.4	He did not get better. 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.6	“I allow you to inhale smoke.” 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.7	They just smeared the wick and inhaled the smoke. They burned their throat. 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.9	“I allow a tube.” 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.10	Soon the monks from the group of six used luxurious tubes 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.11	made of gold or silver. 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.12	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.13	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.14	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.15	“You should not use luxurious tubes. 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.16	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.17	I allow tubes made of bone, ivory, horn, reed, bamboo, wood, resin, fruit, metal, and shell.” 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.18	At that time the tubes were not covered and insects crawled inside them. 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.20	“I allow a lid.” 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.21	At that time the monks carried the tubes in their hands. 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.23	“I allow a bag for the tubes.” 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.24	The tubes scratched each other. 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.26	“I allow a bag with two compartments.” 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.27	They did not have a shoulder strap. 
pli-tv-kd6:13.2.29	“I allow a shoulder strap and a string for fastening it.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.1.1	At one time Venerable Pilindavaccha had a certain disease. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.1.2	The doctors said 
pli-tv-kd6:14.1.3	he needed a heated concoction of oil. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.1.5	“I allow a heated concoction of oil.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.1.6	They wanted to add alcohol to that concoction. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.1.8	“I allow alcohol in a heated concoction of oil.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.1.9	Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six added too much alcohol as they were heating the oil. They drank it and became drunk. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.1.11	“You should not drink heated oil with too much alcohol. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.1.12	If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.1.13	I allow you to drink heated oil if there is no discernible color, smell, or taste of alcohol.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.2.1	The monks had made much heated oil with too much alcohol. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.2.2	They did not know what to do with it. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.2.4	“I allow you to determine it for external use.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.2.5	Pilindavaccha had even more heated oil, but there was no vessel for storing it. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.2.7	“I allow three kinds of vessels: 
pli-tv-kd6:14.2.8	made of metal, made of wood, made of fruit.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.3.1	At that time Pilindavaccha had arthritis of the hands and feet. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.3.3	“I allow treatment through sweating.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.3.4	He did not get better. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.3.6	“I allow sweating with herbs.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.3.7	He still did not get better. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.3.9	“I allow heavy sweating.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.3.10	He still did not get better. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.3.12	“I allow water with herbs.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.3.13	He still did not get better. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.3.15	“I allow a bathtub.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.4.1	And Pilindavaccha had arthritis. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.4.3	“I allow bloodletting.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.4.4	He did not get better. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.4.6	“I allow bloodletting and receiving it in a horn.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.4.7	And Pilindavaccha had cracked feet. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.4.9	“I allow salve for the feet.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.4.10	He did not get better. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.4.12	“I allow you to make foot-salve.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.4.13	At one time a monk was afflicted with abscesses. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.4.15	“I allow surgery.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.4.16	They needed bitter water. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.4.18	“I allow bitter water.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.4.19	They needed sesame paste. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.4.21	“I allow sesame paste.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.5.1	They needed flour paste. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.5.3	“I allow flour paste.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.5.4	They needed a dressing. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.5.6	“I allow a dressing.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.5.7	The sore was itching. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.5.9	“I allow you to sprinkle it with mustard-seed powder.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.5.10	The sore festered. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.5.12	“I allow you to fumigate it.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.5.13	The flesh was sticking out. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.5.15	“I allow you to cut it with a razor.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.5.16	The sore did not heal. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.5.18	“I allow oil for the sore.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.5.19	The oil dripped off. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.5.21	“I allow a bandage and all treatments for sores.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.6.1	On one occasion a certain monk was bitten by a snake. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.6.3	“I allow you to give him the four filthy edibles: 
pli-tv-kd6:14.6.4	feces, urine, ash, and clay.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.6.5	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd6:14.6.6	“Do they need to be received or not?” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.6.8	“They should be received if there is an attendant. If there isn’t, I allow you to take them yourself and then eat them.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.6.9	On one occasion a monk had drunk poison. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.6.11	“I allow you to give him feces to drink.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.6.12	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd6:14.6.13	“Does it need to be received or not?” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.6.15	“I allow the one who is excreting it to receive it. When he’s received it, it doesn’t need to be received again.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.7.1	On one occasion a monk was sick because he had been given a drug. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.7.3	“I allow him to drink mud from a plow.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.7.4	On one occasion a certain monk had indigestion. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.7.6	“I allow him to drink lye.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.7.7	On one occasion a certain monk suffered from jaundice. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.7.9	“I allow him to drink chebulic myrobalan soaked in cattle urine.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.7.10	On one occasion a certain monk suffered from a skin disease. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.7.12	“I allow you to make a scented ointment.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.7.13	On one occasion a monk’s body was full of impurities. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.7.15	“I allow him to drink a purgative.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.7.16	He needed clear congee. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.7.18	“I allow clear congee.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.7.19	He needed mung-bean broth. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.7.21	“I allow mung-bean broth.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.7.22	He needed oily mung-bean broth. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.7.24	“I allow oily mung-bean broth.” 
pli-tv-kd6:14.7.25	He needed meat broth. 
pli-tv-kd6:14.7.27	“I allow meat broth.” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.1.0	3. The account of Pilindavaccha 
pli-tv-kd6:15.1.1	At one time Venerable Pilindavaccha, wanting to build a shelter, was having a hillside cleared near Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.1.2	On that occasion King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha went to Pilindavaccha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd6:15.1.3	and said, 
pli-tv-kd6:15.1.4	“Venerable Elder, what are you having made?” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.1.5	“I’m clearing the hillside, great king, because I want to build a shelter.” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.1.6	“Do you need a monastery worker?” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.1.7	“The Buddha hasn’t allowed monastery workers.” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.1.8	“Well then, Venerable, please ask the Buddha and tell me the outcome.” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.1.9	“Yes, great king.” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.2.1	And Pilindavaccha instructed, inspired, and gladdened King Bimbisāra with a teaching, 
pli-tv-kd6:15.2.2	after which the King got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated Pilindavaccha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.2.3	Soon afterwards Pilindavaccha sent a message to the Buddha: 
pli-tv-kd6:15.2.4	“Venerable Sir, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha wishes to provide a monastery worker. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.2.5	What should I do?” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.2.6	The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:15.2.7	““I allow monastery workers.” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.3.1	Once again King Bimbisāra went to Pilindavaccha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd6:15.3.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd6:15.3.3	“Venerable, has the Buddha allowed monastery workers?” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.3.4	“Yes, great king.” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.3.5	“Well then, I’ll provide you with a monastery worker.” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.3.6	But after making this promise, he forgot, and only remembered after a long time. He then addressed the official in charge of all practical affairs: 
pli-tv-kd6:15.3.7	“Listen, has that monastery worker I promised been provided?” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.3.8	“No, sir, he hasn’t.” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.3.9	“How long is it since we made that promise?” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.4.1	The official counted the days and said, 
pli-tv-kd6:15.4.2	“It’s five hundred days.” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.4.3	“Well then, provide him with five hundred monastery workers.” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.4.4	“Yes, sir.” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.4.5	The official provided Pilindavaccha with five hundred monastery workers and a separate village was established. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.4.6	They called it “The Monastery Workers’ Village” and “Pilinda Village”. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.4.7	And Pilindavaccha began associating with the families in that village. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.4.8	After robing up one morning, he took his bowl and robe and entered Pilinda Village for almsfood. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.5.1	At that time they were holding a celebration in that village, 
pli-tv-kd6:15.5.2	and the children were dressed up with ornaments and garlands. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.5.3	As Pilindavaccha was walking on continuous almsround, he came to the house of a certain monastery worker, where he sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.5.4	Just then the daughter of the house had seen the other children dressed up in ornaments and garlands, and she cried, 
pli-tv-kd6:15.5.5	“Give me a garland! Give me ornaments!” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.5.6	Pilindavaccha asked her mother 
pli-tv-kd6:15.5.7	why the girl was crying. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.5.8	She told him, 
pli-tv-kd6:15.5.10	adding, “How can poor people like us afford garlands and ornaments?” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.6.1	Pilindavaccha took a pad of grass and said to the mother, 
pli-tv-kd6:15.6.2	“Here, place this pad of grass on the girl’s head.” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.6.3	She did, 
pli-tv-kd6:15.6.4	and it turned into a beautiful golden garland. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.6.5	Even the royal compound had nothing like it. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.6.6	People told King Bimbisāra, 
pli-tv-kd6:15.6.7	“Sir, in the house of a particular monastery worker there’s a beautiful golden garland. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.6.8	Even in your court, sir, there’s nothing like it. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.6.9	So how did those poor people get it? 
pli-tv-kd6:15.6.10	No doubt it was taken by theft.” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.6.11	And King Bimbisāra had that family imprisoned. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.7.1	Once again Pilindavaccha robed up in morning, took his bowl and robe, and entered Pilinda Village for almsfood. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.7.2	As he was walking on continuous almsround, he came to the house of that monastery worker. And he asked the neighbors, 
pli-tv-kd6:15.7.3	“Where is the family of this monastery worker?” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.7.4	“Venerable, the king had them imprisoned because of that golden garland.” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.7.5	Pilindavaccha then went to King Bimbisāra’s house and sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.7.6	King Bimbisāra approached Pilindavaccha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.7.7	And Pilindavaccha said, 
pli-tv-kd6:15.8.1	“Great king, why have you had the family of that monastery worker imprisoned?” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.8.2	“Venerable, in the house of that monastery worker there was a beautiful golden garland. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.8.3	Even the royal compound has nothing like it. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.8.4	So how did those poor people get it? 
pli-tv-kd6:15.8.5	No doubt it was taken by theft.” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.8.6	Pilindavaccha then focused his mind on turning King Bimbisāra’s stilt house into gold. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.8.7	As a result the whole house became gold. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.8.8	And he said, “Great king, how did you get so much gold?” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.8.9	“Understood, Sir, this is your supernormal power.” And he released that family. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.9.1	People said, 
pli-tv-kd6:15.9.2	“It seems Venerable Pilindavaccha has performed a superhuman feat, a wonder of supernormal power, for the king and his court!” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.9.3	Being delighted and gaining confidence in Pilindavaccha, they brought him the five tonics: 
pli-tv-kd6:15.9.4	ghee, butter, oil, honey, and syrup. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.9.5	Ordinarily, too, Pilindavaccha was getting the five tonics. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.9.6	Since he was getting so much, he gave it away to his followers. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.9.7	As a consequence, his followers acquired an abundance of tonics. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.9.8	After filling up basins and waterpots and setting these aside, 
pli-tv-kd6:15.9.9	they filled their water filters and bags and hung these in the windows. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.9.10	The tonics were dripping all over 
pli-tv-kd6:15.9.11	and the dwellings became infested with rats. 
pli-tv-kd6:15.9.12	When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd6:15.9.13	“These Sakyan monastics are hoarding goods indoors, just like King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha.” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.10.1	The monks heard the complaints of those people 
pli-tv-kd6:15.10.2	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, 
pli-tv-kd6:15.10.3	“How can these monks choose to live in such abundance?” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.10.4	After criticizing those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:15.10.5	“Is it true, monks, that there are monks who live like this?” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.10.6	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd6:15.10.7	after criticizing them, the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:15.10.8	“After being received, the tonics allowable for sick monks—that is, ghee, butter, oil, honey, and syrup—should be used from storage for at most seven days. If you use them beyond that, you should be dealt with according to the rule.” 
pli-tv-kd6:15.10.9	The first section for recitation on allowable medicines is finished. 
pli-tv-kd6:16.1.0	4. The allowance for sugar, etc. 
pli-tv-kd6:16.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Sāvatthī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd6:16.1.2	While they were traveling, Venerable Revata the Doubter saw a place where sugar was being prepared. He went up to that place and saw that they mixed the sugar with flour and ash. He thought, 
pli-tv-kd6:16.1.3	“Sugar mixed with food is unallowable, and so it’s unallowable to eat this sugar at the wrong time,” 
pli-tv-kd6:16.1.4	and being afraid of wrongdoing, he and his followers did not take sugar. 
pli-tv-kd6:16.1.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd6:16.1.7	“Why are they adding flour and ash to the sugar?” 
pli-tv-kd6:16.1.8	“To harden it, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd6:16.1.9	“If they add flour or ash to sugar to harden it, it’s still considered as sugar. 
pli-tv-kd6:16.1.10	I allow you to take as much sugar as you like.” 
pli-tv-kd6:16.2.1	While still traveling, Revata saw mung beans sprouting from feces. He thought, 
pli-tv-kd6:16.2.2	“Mung beans are unallowable; 
pli-tv-kd6:16.2.3	they sprout even after being digested,” 
pli-tv-kd6:16.2.4	and being afraid of wrongdoing, he and his followers did not eat mung beans. 
pli-tv-kd6:16.2.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd6:16.2.7	“Although mung beans may sprout after being digested, I allow you to eat as much of it as you like.” 
pli-tv-kd6:16.3.1	On one occasion a certain monk who had a stomach ache 
pli-tv-kd6:16.3.2	drank salty purgative 
pli-tv-kd6:16.3.3	and was cured. 
pli-tv-kd6:16.3.5	“I allow the salty purgative when you’re sick. 
pli-tv-kd6:16.3.6	If you’re not sick, I allow you to drink it mixed with water.” 
pli-tv-kd6:17.1.0	5. Discussion of the prohibition against storing indoors, etc. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.1.1	Wandering on, the Buddha eventually arrived at Rājagaha, where he stayed in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.1.2	Soon afterwards the Buddha had a stomach ache. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.1.3	Venerable Ānanda thought, “Previously, when the Buddha had a stomach ache, he was comfortable after drinking the threefold pungent rice porridge.” 
pli-tv-kd6:17.1.4	He then asked for sesame seeds, rice, and mung beans, stored them indoors, cooked them himself indoors, and brought them to the Buddha, saying, 
pli-tv-kd6:17.1.5	“Sir, please drink the threefold pungent rice porridge.” 
pli-tv-kd6:17.2.1	When Buddhas know what is going on, sometimes they ask and sometimes not. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.2.2	They know the right time to ask and when not to ask. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.2.3	Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, otherwise not, 
pli-tv-kd6:17.2.4	for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.2.5	Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.2.6	The Buddha said to Ānanda, “Ānanda, where does this rice porridge come from?” 
pli-tv-kd6:17.2.7	Ānanda told him. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.3.1	The Buddha criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd6:17.3.2	“It’s not suitable, Ānanda, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.3.3	How can you choose to live in such abundance? 
pli-tv-kd6:17.3.4	What has been stored indoors in a monastery is unallowable; 
pli-tv-kd6:17.3.5	what has been cooked indoors in a monastery is unallowable; 
pli-tv-kd6:17.3.6	what has been cooked by oneself is unallowable. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.3.7	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-kd6:17.3.8	after rebuking him, he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:17.3.9	“You should not eat what has been stored indoors in a monastery, what has been cooked indoors in a monastery, or what you have cooked yourself. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.3.10	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.4.1	If you eat what has been stored indoors in a monastery, cooked indoors in a monastery, and cooked by yourselves, you commit three offenses of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.4.2	If you eat what has been stored indoors in a monastery, cooked indoors in a monastery, but cooked by others, you commit two offenses of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.4.3	If you eat what has been stored indoors in a monastery, but cooked outside, yet cooked by yourselves, you commit two offenses of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.5.1	If you eat what has been stored outside, but cooked indoors in a monastery, and cooked by yourselves, you commit two offenses of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.5.2	If you eat what has been stored indoors in a monastery, but cooked outside, and cooked by others, you commit one offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.5.3	If you eat what has been stored outside, but cooked indoors in a monastery, yet cooked by others, you commit one offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.5.4	If you eat what has been stored outside, and cooked outside, but cooked by yourselves, you commit one offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.5.5	If you eat what has been stored outside, and cooked outside, and cooked by others, there is no offense.” 
pli-tv-kd6:17.6.1	When the monks knew 
pli-tv-kd6:17.6.2	that the Buddha had prohibited them from cooking, 
pli-tv-kd6:17.6.3	being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not reheat. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.6.5	“I allow you to reheat what has already been cooked.” 
pli-tv-kd6:17.7.1	At that time Rājagaha was short of food. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.7.2	People brought salt, oil, rice, and fresh food to the monastery. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.7.3	The monks stored it outdoors, 
pli-tv-kd6:17.7.4	but it was eaten by vermin and stolen by thieves. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.7.6	“I allow you to store food indoors.” 
pli-tv-kd6:17.7.7	The monks stored it indoors, but it was cooked outside. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.7.8	They were surrounded by beggars 
pli-tv-kd6:17.7.9	and the monks ate in fear. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.7.11	“I allow cooking indoors.” 
pli-tv-kd6:17.7.12	Because of the famine, the attendants took more for themselves and gave less to the monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.7.14	“I allow you to cook. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.7.15	I allow you to store food indoors in the monastery, to cook indoors in the monastery, and to cook.” 
pli-tv-kd6:17.8.0	6. Receiving what has been picked up 
pli-tv-kd6:17.8.1	On one occasion a number of monks who had completed the rainy-season residence in Kāsī were traveling to Rājagaha to visit the Buddha. While traveling, they did not receive sufficient food, whether fine or coarse. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.8.2	Yet there was much fruit, 
pli-tv-kd6:17.8.3	but no attendant to offer it. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.8.4	When those monks arrived at Rājagaha, they were exhausted. They went to the Bamboo Grove, approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.8.5	Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, 
pli-tv-kd6:17.8.6	he said to them, 
pli-tv-kd6:17.8.7	“I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re getting by. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.8.8	I hope you’re not tired from traveling. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.8.9	And where have you come from?” 
pli-tv-kd6:17.9.1	“We’re keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re getting by,” 
pli-tv-kd6:17.9.2	and they told him what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.9.6	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:17.9.7	“If there is no attendant, but you see fruit, I allow you to pick it up yourself. You should then carry it until you see an attendant, put it on the ground, and have it received. You may then eat it. 
pli-tv-kd6:17.9.8	I allow you to receive what you have picked up.” 
pli-tv-kd6:18.1.1	On one occasion a certain brahmin had obtained fresh sesame seed and fresh honey. 
pli-tv-kd6:18.1.2	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd6:18.1.3	“Why don’t I give this to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha?” 
pli-tv-kd6:18.1.4	He then went to the Buddha, exchanged pleasantries with him, 
pli-tv-kd6:18.1.5	and said, 
pli-tv-kd6:18.1.6	“Please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd6:18.1.7	The Buddha consented by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-kd6:18.1.8	Knowing that the Buddha had consented, the brahmin left. 
pli-tv-kd6:18.2.1	The following morning that brahmin had various kinds of fine food prepared. He then had the Buddha informed 
pli-tv-kd6:18.2.2	that the meal was ready. 
pli-tv-kd6:18.2.3	After robing up, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to that brahmin’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-kd6:18.2.4	That brahmin personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, the brahmin sat down to one side. 
pli-tv-kd6:18.2.5	The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which he got up and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:18.3.1	Soon after the Buddha had left, that brahmin thought, 
pli-tv-kd6:18.3.2	“I invited the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha to give them the fresh sesame seed and honey, but I forgot about it. 
pli-tv-kd6:18.3.3	Why don’t I take the sesame seed and honey to the monastery in basins and waterpots?” 
pli-tv-kd6:18.3.4	And he did just that. He then approached the Buddha 
pli-tv-kd6:18.3.5	and said, 
pli-tv-kd6:18.4.1	“When I invited you for a meal, I forgot to give you fresh sesame seeds and honey. 
pli-tv-kd6:18.4.2	Please accept it.” 
pli-tv-kd6:18.4.3	“Well then, brahmin, give it to the monks.” 
pli-tv-kd6:18.4.4	At this time, because food was scarce, the monks refused an invitation to eat more even after taking just a little. After reflection, they declined further food. 
pli-tv-kd6:18.4.5	Now the whole sangha was invited. Being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. 
pli-tv-kd6:18.4.6	“Accept, monks, and eat. 
pli-tv-kd6:18.4.7	I allow one who has finished his meal and refused an invitation to eat more to eat non-leftovers that have been brought out.” 
pli-tv-kd6:19.1.0	7. The allowance for what has been received, etc. 
pli-tv-kd6:19.1.1	On one occasion a family who was supporting Venerable Upananda the Sakyan sent fresh food to the Sangha, saying, 
pli-tv-kd6:19.1.2	“After showing it to Venerable Upananda, it’s to be given to the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-kd6:19.1.3	Just then Upananda had entered the village for alms. 
pli-tv-kd6:19.1.4	When those people arrived at the monastery, they asked for Upananda, 
pli-tv-kd6:19.1.6	and they were told where he was. 
pli-tv-kd6:19.1.7	They said, “Venerables, after showing it to Venerable Upananda, this fresh food is to be given to the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-kd6:19.1.8	The monks told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd6:19.1.9	“Well then, receive it and put it aside until Upananda returns.” 
pli-tv-kd6:19.2.1	But because Upananda visited families before eating, he returned late to the monastery. 
pli-tv-kd6:19.2.2	At this time, because food was scarce, the monks refused an invitation to eat more even after taking just a little. After reflection, they declined further food. Now the whole sangha was invited. 
pli-tv-kd6:19.2.3	Being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. 
pli-tv-kd6:19.2.4	“Accept, monks, and eat. 
pli-tv-kd6:19.2.5	I allow one who has finished his meal and refused an invitation to eat more to eat non-leftovers that were received before the meal.” 
pli-tv-kd6:20.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd6:20.1.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd6:20.1.3	he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd6:20.1.4	At that time Venerable Sāriputta had a fever. 
pli-tv-kd6:20.1.5	Venerable Mahāmoggallāna went to him and asked, 
pli-tv-kd6:20.1.6	“When you previously had a fever, Sāriputta, what did you do to get better?” 
pli-tv-kd6:20.1.7	“I had lotus roots and tubers.” 
pli-tv-kd6:20.1.8	Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch his arm, so too Mahāmoggallāna disappeared from the Jeta Grove and appeared on the banks of the Mandākinī lotus pond. 
pli-tv-kd6:20.2.1	An elephant saw Mahāmoggallāna coming and said to him, 
pli-tv-kd6:20.2.2	“Welcome, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, please come. 
pli-tv-kd6:20.2.3	Venerable, what do you need? 
pli-tv-kd6:20.2.4	What may I give?” 
pli-tv-kd6:20.2.5	“I need lotus roots and tubers.” 
pli-tv-kd6:20.2.6	That elephant told another elephant, 
pli-tv-kd6:20.2.7	“Listen, give as many roots and tubers as the Venerable needs.” 
pli-tv-kd6:20.2.8	It plunged into the Mandākinī lotus pond and pulled up lotus roots and tubers with his trunk. It gave them a good rinse, bound them in a bundle, and went up to Mahāmoggallāna. 
pli-tv-kd6:20.3.1	Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch his arm, so too Mahāmoggallāna disappeared from the banks of the Mandākinī lotus pond and appeared in the Jeta Grove. 
pli-tv-kd6:20.3.2	And that elephant did the same. 
pli-tv-kd6:20.3.3	It then had the roots and tubers offered to Mahāmoggallāna and returned to the Mandākinī lotus pond in the same manner. 
pli-tv-kd6:20.3.4	Mahāmoggallāna then brought those lotus roots and tubers to Sāriputta. 
pli-tv-kd6:20.3.5	When he had eaten them, his fever subsided. 
pli-tv-kd6:20.3.6	But there was much leftover. 
pli-tv-kd6:20.4.1	At this time, because food was scarce, the monks refused an invitation to eat more even after taking just a little. After reflection, they declined further food. 
pli-tv-kd6:20.4.2	Being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. 
pli-tv-kd6:20.4.3	“Accept, monks, and eat. 
pli-tv-kd6:20.4.4	I allow one who has finished his meal and refused an invitation to eat more to eat non-leftovers coming from the forest or a lotus pond.” 
pli-tv-kd6:21.1.1	On one occasion in Sāvatthī much fruit had been given but there was no attendant. 
pli-tv-kd6:21.1.2	Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not eat it. 
pli-tv-kd6:21.1.4	“I allow you to eat fruit that hasn’t been made allowable if it’s seedless or the seeds have been removed.” 
pli-tv-kd6:22.1.0	8. Discussion of the prohibition against surgery 
pli-tv-kd6:22.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Sāvatthī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd6:22.1.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd6:22.1.3	he stayed in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. 
pli-tv-kd6:22.1.4	At this time a certain monk had hemorrhoids 
pli-tv-kd6:22.1.5	and the doctor Ākāsagotta performed surgery. 
pli-tv-kd6:22.1.6	Just then, while walking about the dwellings, the Buddha came to this monk’s dwelling. 
pli-tv-kd6:22.2.1	Ākāsagotta saw the Buddha coming, and he said to him, 
pli-tv-kd6:22.2.2	“Good Gotama, please come and see this monk’s anus. It’s just like the mouth of a lizard.” 
pli-tv-kd6:22.2.3	The Buddha thought, 
pli-tv-kd6:22.2.4	“This fool is mocking me,” 
pli-tv-kd6:22.2.5	and he turned around right there. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:22.2.6	“Is there a sick monk in such-and-such a dwelling?” 
pli-tv-kd6:22.2.7	“There is, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd6:22.2.8	“What’s his illness?” 
pli-tv-kd6:22.2.9	“He has hemorrhoids and the doctor Ākāsagotta is performing surgery.” 
pli-tv-kd6:22.3.1	The Buddha criticized him, 
pli-tv-kd6:22.3.2	“It’s not suitable, monks, for that foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-kd6:22.3.3	How can he have surgery on the private parts? 
pli-tv-kd6:22.3.4	In that area the skin is delicate, sores heel with difficulty, and a scalpel is hard to wield. 
pli-tv-kd6:22.3.5	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-kd6:22.3.6	after criticizing him … 
pli-tv-kd6:22.3.7	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:22.3.8	“You should not have surgery on the private parts. 
pli-tv-kd6:22.3.9	If you do, you commit a serious offense.” 
pli-tv-kd6:22.4.1	When they knew that the Buddha had prohibited surgery, 
pli-tv-kd6:22.4.3	the monks from the group of six had enemas. 
pli-tv-kd6:22.4.4	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd6:22.4.5	“How can the monks from the group of six have enemas?” 
pli-tv-kd6:22.4.6	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd6:22.4.7	“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are having enemas?” 
pli-tv-kd6:22.4.8	“It’s true, Sir.” … 
pli-tv-kd6:22.4.9	after criticizing them, the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:22.4.10	“You should not get surgery within 3.5 centimeters of the private parts or have enemas. 
pli-tv-kd6:22.4.11	If you do, you commit a serious offense.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.1.0	9. Discussion of the prohibition against human flesh 
pli-tv-kd6:23.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Benares. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.1.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.1.3	he stayed in the dear park at Isipatana. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.1.4	At that time in Benares there were two lay-followers, Suppiya and Suppiyā, husband and wife, both with confidence in Buddhism. They were donors and benefactors, and they supported the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.1.5	On one occasion Suppiyā went to the monastery and walked from dwelling to dwelling, from precincts to precincts, asking the monks, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.1.6	“Is anyone sick? What may I bring?” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.2.1	Just then a certain monk had drunk a purgative. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.2.2	He told Suppiyā about this, adding, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.2.4	“I need meat broth.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.2.5	“No problem, I’ll organize it.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.2.6	She then returned to her house and told a servant, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.2.7	“Go and get some meat.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.2.8	Saying, “Yes, lady,” he walked around the whole of Benares, but could not find any. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.2.9	So he returned to Suppiyā and said, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.2.10	“There’s no meat. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.2.11	Today there’s no slaughtering.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.3.1	Suppiyā thought, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.3.2	“If that monk doesn’t get meat broth, his illness will get worse or he will die. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.3.3	Because I’ve already agreed to provide it, it would not be right if I didn’t.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.3.4	She then took a knife, cut flesh from her own thigh, and gave it to a slave, saying, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.3.5	“Prepare this meat and give it to the sick monk in such-and-such a dwelling. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.3.6	If anyone asks for me, tell them I’m sick.” She then wrapped her thigh in her upper robe, entered her bedroom, and lay down on the bed. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.4.1	When Suppiya returned home, he asked the slave where his wife was. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.4.3	Being told where she was, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.4.4	he went to see her, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.4.8	and she told him what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.4.9	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.4.10	“It’s astonishing and amazing 
pli-tv-kd6:23.4.11	how much faith and confidence Suppiyā has, in that she gives up even her own flesh. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.4.12	Is there anything she would not give?” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.4.13	Delighted and joyful he went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.5.1	and said, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.5.2	“Venerable Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.5.3	The Buddha consented by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.5.4	Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Suppiya got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.5.5	The following morning Suppiya had various kinds of fine food prepared. He then had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.5.6	After robing up, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and, together with the Sangha of monks, went to Suppiya’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.6.1	Suppiya approached the Buddha and bowed down to him. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.6.2	The Buddha asked him where Suppiyā was 
pli-tv-kd6:23.6.3	and he replied that she was sick. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.6.4	“Well then, please tell her to come.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.6.5	“She’s not able, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.6.6	“Well then, carry her in here.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.6.7	And they did. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.6.8	The moment Suppiyā saw the Buddha that great wound healed and was perfectly covered with skin and hairs. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.7.1	Suppiya and Suppiyā exclaimed, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.7.2	“The great power and might of the Buddha 
pli-tv-kd6:23.7.3	is truly astonishing and amazing!” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.7.4	Delighted and joyful, they personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, they sat down to one side. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.7.5	And the Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened them with a teaching, after which he got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.8.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:23.8.2	“Who asked Suppiyā for meat?” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.8.3	The monk who had done so told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.8.4	“Did you get the meat?” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.8.5	“I did, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.8.6	“Did you eat it?” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.8.7	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.8.8	“Were you circumspect about it?” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.8.9	“No.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.9.1	The Buddha rebuked him … 
pli-tv-kd6:23.9.2	“Foolish man, how can you eat meat without circumspection? 
pli-tv-kd6:23.9.3	You have eaten human flesh. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.9.4	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd6:23.9.5	after rebuking him, he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:23.9.6	“There are people who have faith and confidence, even to the point where they give up their own flesh. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.9.7	You should not eat human flesh. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.9.8	If you do, you commit a serious offense. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.9.9	You should not eat flesh without being circumspect. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.9.10	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.10.0	10. Discussion of the prohibition against elephant meat, etc. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.10.1	At one time some of the King’s elephants had died. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.10.2	Because there was a shortage of food, people ate the elephant meat. And they gave elephant meat to monks who were walking for almsfood. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.10.3	When the monks ate it, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.10.4	people complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.10.5	“How can the Sakyan monastics eat elephant meat? 
pli-tv-kd6:23.10.6	Elephants are an attribute of kingship. If the King knew, he would not be pleased with those monks.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.10.7	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.10.8	“You should not eat elephant meat. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.10.9	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.11.1	At one time some of the King’s horses had died. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.11.2	Because there was a shortage of food, people ate the horse meat. And they gave horse meat to monks who were walking for almsfood. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.11.3	When the monks ate it, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.11.4	people complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.11.5	“How can the Sakyan monastics eat horse meat? 
pli-tv-kd6:23.11.6	Horses are an attribute of kingship. If the King knew, he would not be pleased with those monks.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.11.7	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.11.8	“You should not eat horse meat. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.11.9	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.12.1	At one time when there was a shortage of food, people ate dog meat. And they gave dog meat to monks who were walking for almsfood. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.12.2	When the monks ate it, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.12.3	people complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.12.4	“How can the Sakyan monastics eat dog meat? Dogs are disgusting and repulsive.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.12.5	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.12.6	“You should not eat dog meat. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.12.7	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.13.1	At one time when there was a shortage of food, people ate snake meat. And they gave snake meat to monks who were walking for almsfood. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.13.2	When the monks ate it, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.13.3	people complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.13.4	“How can the Sakyan monastics eat snake meat? Snakes are disgusting and repulsive.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.13.5	Then even Supassa the king of dragons went to see the Buddha. He bowed down to the Buddha 
pli-tv-kd6:23.13.6	and said, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.13.7	“Sir, there are dragons without faith and confidence. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.13.8	They might harm the monks even over small matters. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.13.9	Please ask the venerables not to eat snake meat.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.13.10	The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which Supassa got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.13.11	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:23.13.12	“You should not eat snake meat. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.13.13	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.14.1	On one occasion hunters killed a lion and ate the lion meat. And they gave lion meat to monks who were walking for almsfood. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.14.2	After eating it, the monks stayed in the wilderness, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.14.3	and because of the smell of lion meat, lions attacked those monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.14.5	“You should not eat lion meat. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.14.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.15.1	On one occasion hunters killed a tiger … 
pli-tv-kd6:23.15.2	a leopard … 
pli-tv-kd6:23.15.3	a bear … 
pli-tv-kd6:23.15.4	a hyena and ate the hyena meat. And they gave hyena meat to monks who were walking for almsfood. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.15.5	After eating it, the monks stayed in the wilderness, 
pli-tv-kd6:23.15.6	and because of the smell of hyena meat, hyenas attacked those monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.15.8	“You should not eat tiger meat, leopard meat, bear meat, or hyena meat. 
pli-tv-kd6:23.15.9	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd6:23.15.10	The second section for recitation on Suppiyā is finished. 
pli-tv-kd6:24.1.0	11. The allowance for rice porridge and honey balls 
pli-tv-kd6:24.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Benares for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Andhakavinda together with a large sangha of twelve-hundred and fifty monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:24.1.2	On this occasion the country people had loaded large quantities of salt, oil, rice, and fresh food onto carts, and were following behind the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha, thinking, 
pli-tv-kd6:24.1.3	“When our turn comes, we’ll prepare a meal.” And five hundred people living on leftovers were also following along. 
pli-tv-kd6:24.1.4	Eventually the Buddha arrived at Andhakavinda and stayed there. 
pli-tv-kd6:24.2.1	Soon afterwards a certain brahmin whose turn to offer a meal had not yet come, thought, 
pli-tv-kd6:24.2.2	“I’ve been following the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha for two months waiting to offer them a meal, and I’m still waiting. Moreover, I have no companion and all my household business is being neglected. 
pli-tv-kd6:24.2.3	Let me inspect the dining hall 
pli-tv-kd6:24.2.4	and prepare whatever is lacking.” 
pli-tv-kd6:24.2.5	When he did, he saw that two things were missing: 
pli-tv-kd6:24.2.6	rice porridge and honey balls. 
pli-tv-kd6:24.3.1	He then went to Venerable Ānanda and told what he had been thinking, 
pli-tv-kd6:24.3.9	adding, “Good Ānanda, if I was to prepare rice porridge and honey balls, would Good Gotama accept it?” 
pli-tv-kd6:24.3.10	“Well, brahmin, let me ask the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd6:24.4.1	Venerable Ānanda told the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd6:24.4.2	who said, “Allow it to be prepared, Ānanda.” 
pli-tv-kd6:24.4.3	And Ānanda passed the message on to the brahmin. 
pli-tv-kd6:24.4.4	The following morning that brahmin prepared much rice porridge and many honey balls and brought it to the Buddha, saying, 
pli-tv-kd6:24.4.5	“Good Gotama, please accept the rice porridge and the honey balls.” 
pli-tv-kd6:24.4.6	“Well then, brahmin, give it to the monks.” 
pli-tv-kd6:24.4.7	But being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not accept. 
pli-tv-kd6:24.4.8	The Buddha said, “Accept, monks, and eat.” 
pli-tv-kd6:24.4.9	That brahmin then personally served much rice porridge and many honey balls to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, the brahmin sat down to one side. 
pli-tv-kd6:24.5.1	And the Buddha said this to him: 
pli-tv-kd6:24.6.1	“Brahmin, there are these ten benefits of rice porridge. 
pli-tv-kd6:24.6.3	One who gives rice porridge gives life, beauty, happiness, strength, and articulateness; drinking rice porridge stills hunger, allays thirst, gets rid of wind, cleans out the bladder, and helps the digestion of food remnants. 
pli-tv-kd6:24.6.5	One who gives rice porridge respectfully at the right time 
pli-tv-kd6:24.6.6	To the restrained ones who live on the gifts of others, 
pli-tv-kd6:24.6.7	Such a one supplies them with ten things: 
pli-tv-kd6:24.6.8	Long life, beauty, happiness, and strength, 
pli-tv-kd6:24.6.9	And articulateness, too, one gets from that; 
pli-tv-kd6:24.6.10	Hunger, thirst, and wind are removed, 
pli-tv-kd6:24.6.11	The bladder is cleaned and the food digested. 
pli-tv-kd6:24.6.12	This tonic is praised by the Accomplished One. 
pli-tv-kd6:24.6.13	Therefore, for a person looking for happiness—
pli-tv-kd6:24.6.14	One wishing for heavenly bliss 
pli-tv-kd6:24.6.15	Or one desiring human prosperity—
pli-tv-kd6:24.6.16	It’s appropriate to give rice porridge regularly.” 
pli-tv-kd6:24.7.1	The Buddha then got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:24.7.2	Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:24.7.3	“I allow rice porridge and honey balls.” 
pli-tv-kd6:25.1.0	12. The government official with recently acquired faith 
pli-tv-kd6:25.1.1	When people heard that the Buddha had allowed rice porridge and honey balls, 
pli-tv-kd6:25.1.2	they prepared thick rice porridge and honey balls early in the morning. 
pli-tv-kd6:25.1.3	After eating thick rice porridge and honey balls to their satisfaction in the morning, the monks did not eat as much as they had intended in the dining hall. 
pli-tv-kd6:25.1.4	At this time a certain government official who had recently acquired faith in Buddhism had invited the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha for the meal on the following day. 
pli-tv-kd6:25.1.5	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd6:25.1.6	“Let me prepare twelve hundred and fifty bowls of meat for the twelve hundred and fifty monks. I can then bring one bowl to each and every monk.” 
pli-tv-kd6:25.2.1	The following morning that official had various kinds of fine food prepared, as well as twelve hundred and fifty bowls of meat. He then had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready. 
pli-tv-kd6:25.2.2	After robing up, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and, together with the Sangha of monks, went to that brahmin’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-kd6:25.3.1	That official then served the monks in the dining hall. 
pli-tv-kd6:25.3.2	As he did so, the monks said, 
pli-tv-kd6:25.3.3	“Only a little, thanks.” 
pli-tv-kd6:25.3.4	“Please don’t say that because I’ve only recently acquired faith in Buddhism. 
pli-tv-kd6:25.3.5	I’ve prepared much food of various kinds, as well as twelve-hundred and fifty bowls of meat. 
pli-tv-kd6:25.3.6	I’ll bring one bowl of meat to each and every monk. 
pli-tv-kd6:25.3.7	Venerables, please accept as much as you like.” 
pli-tv-kd6:25.3.8	“We’re not receiving so little because of that, but because we ate thick rice porridge and honey balls to our satisfaction early in the morning.” 
pli-tv-kd6:25.4.1	The official complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd6:25.4.2	“When the venerables have been invited by me, how can they eat someone else’s thick rice porridge? Am I not able to give them as much as they like?” 
pli-tv-kd6:25.4.3	Angry and aiming to criticize, he walked around filling the monks’ almsbowls, saying, “Eat it or take it away.” 
pli-tv-kd6:25.4.4	When he had personally served the various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha, and the Buddha had finished his meal, the official sat down to one side. 
pli-tv-kd6:25.4.5	The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which he got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:25.5.1	Soon after the Buddha had left, that official felt anxiety and remorse, thinking, 
pli-tv-kd6:25.5.2	“It’s bad for me, truly bad, 
pli-tv-kd6:25.5.3	that I acted like this. 
pli-tv-kd6:25.5.4	I wonder, did I make much merit or demerit?” 
pli-tv-kd6:25.5.5	He then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd6:25.5.6	and told him what he had been thinking, adding, 
pli-tv-kd6:25.5.11	“How is it, Sir, did I make much merit or demerit?” 
pli-tv-kd6:25.6.1	“When you invited the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha for a meal on the following day, you made much merit. 
pli-tv-kd6:25.6.2	When each and every monk received rice from you, you made much merit. You are heading for heaven.” 
pli-tv-kd6:25.6.3	When the official heard this, 
pli-tv-kd6:25.6.4	he was joyful and elated. He got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:25.7.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:25.7.2	“Is it true, monks, that monks who had been invited for a meal ate someone else’s thick rice porridge beforehand?” 
pli-tv-kd6:25.7.3	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd6:25.7.4	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-kd6:25.7.5	“How can those foolish men eat someone else’s thick rice porridge beforehand when they have been invited for a meal? 
pli-tv-kd6:25.7.6	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd6:25.7.7	after criticizing them, he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:25.7.8	“When you have been invited to a meal, you should not eat someone else’s thick rice porridge beforehand. 
pli-tv-kd6:25.7.9	If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule.” 
pli-tv-kd6:26.1.0	13. The account of Belaṭṭha Kaccāna 
pli-tv-kd6:26.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Andhakavinda for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Rājagaha together with a large sangha of twelve-hundred and fifty monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:26.1.2	Just then Belaṭṭha Kaccāna was traveling from Rājagaha to Andhakavinda with five hundred carts, all of them filled with jars of sugar. 
pli-tv-kd6:26.1.3	When the Buddha saw Belaṭṭha Kaccāna coming, he stepped off the road and sat down at the foot of a tree. 
pli-tv-kd6:26.2.1	Belaṭṭha Kaccāna approached the Buddha, bowed, 
pli-tv-kd6:26.2.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd6:26.2.3	“Venerable Sir, I would like to give one jar of sugar to each and every monk.” 
pli-tv-kd6:26.2.4	“Well, Kaccāna, just bring one jar of sugar.” 
pli-tv-kd6:26.2.5	Saying, “Yes, sir,” he got a jar of sugar, returned to the Buddha, and said, 
pli-tv-kd6:26.2.6	“Here is the jar. 
pli-tv-kd6:26.2.7	What should I do next?” 
pli-tv-kd6:26.2.8	“Now give sugar to the monks.” 
pli-tv-kd6:26.3.1	Saying, “Yes, sir,” he did so and then said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd6:26.3.2	“I’ve given sugar to the monks, but there’s much left over. 
pli-tv-kd6:26.3.3	What should I do with that?” 
pli-tv-kd6:26.3.4	“Give the monks as much sugar as they need.” 
pli-tv-kd6:26.3.5	Saying, “Yes, sir,” he did so and then said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd6:26.3.6	“I’ve given the monks as much sugar as they need, but there’s much left over. 
pli-tv-kd6:26.3.7	What should I do with that?” 
pli-tv-kd6:26.3.8	“Give the monks as much sugar as they want.” 
pli-tv-kd6:26.3.9	Saying, “Yes, sir,” he did so, 
pli-tv-kd6:26.3.10	and some monks filled their almsbowls and even their water filter and bag. 
pli-tv-kd6:26.4.1	When he was finished, he said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd6:26.4.2	“I’ve given the monks as much sugar as they want, but there’s much left over. 
pli-tv-kd6:26.4.3	What should I do with that?” 
pli-tv-kd6:26.4.4	“Give to those who are living on leftovers.” 
pli-tv-kd6:26.4.5	Saying, “Yes, sir,” he did so and then said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd6:26.4.6	“I’ve given them sugar, but there’s much left over. 
pli-tv-kd6:26.4.7	What should I do with that?” 
pli-tv-kd6:26.4.8	“Give them as much sugar as they need.” 
pli-tv-kd6:26.5.1	Saying, “Yes, sir,” he did so and then said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd6:26.5.2	“I’ve given them as much sugar as they need, but there’s much left over. 
pli-tv-kd6:26.5.3	What should I do with that?” 
pli-tv-kd6:26.5.4	“Give them as much sugar as they want.” 
pli-tv-kd6:26.5.5	Saying, “Yes, sir,” he did so, 
pli-tv-kd6:26.5.6	and some of those who lived on leftovers filled basins and waterpots and even baskets and their lap. 
pli-tv-kd6:26.6.1	When he was finished, he said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd6:26.6.2	“I’ve given them as much sugar as they want, but there’s much left over. 
pli-tv-kd6:26.6.3	What should I do with that?” 
pli-tv-kd6:26.6.4	“Kaccāna, I don’t see anyone in this world with its gods, lords of death, and supreme beings, in this society with its monastics and brahmins, its gods and humans, who would be able to properly digest that sugar except a Buddha or his disciple. 
pli-tv-kd6:26.6.5	So discard that sugar where there are no cultivated plants or in water without life.” 
pli-tv-kd6:26.6.6	Saying, “Yes, Sir,” he dumped that sugar in water without life. 
pli-tv-kd6:26.7.1	As he did so, that sugar hissed, sputtered, fumed, and smoked—
pli-tv-kd6:26.7.2	just like a plowshare heated the whole day hisses, sputters, fumes, and smokes when dropped in water. 
pli-tv-kd6:26.7.4	Belaṭṭha Kaccāna was awestruck, with goosebumps all over. He approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd6:26.8.1	The Buddha then gave him a progressive teaching: 
pli-tv-kd6:26.8.2	talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. 
pli-tv-kd6:26.8.3	When the Buddha knew that his mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. 
pli-tv-kd6:26.8.4	And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, so too, while he was sitting right there, Belaṭṭha Kaccāna experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: 
pli-tv-kd6:26.8.5	“Anything that has a beginning has an end.” 
pli-tv-kd6:26.9.1	He had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. He then said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd6:26.9.2	“Wonderful, Venerable Sir, wonderful! 
pli-tv-kd6:26.9.3	Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see what’s there, 
pli-tv-kd6:26.9.4	just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways. 
pli-tv-kd6:26.9.5	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the Teaching, and to the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:26.9.6	Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
pli-tv-kd6:27.1.1	The Buddha then continued wandering toward Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd6:27.1.2	When he eventually arrived, he stayed in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. 
pli-tv-kd6:27.1.3	At that time there was an abundance of sugar in Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd6:27.1.4	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd6:27.1.5	“The Buddha has only allowed sugar for those who are sick,” 
pli-tv-kd6:27.1.6	and being afraid of wrongdoing they did not eat it. 
pli-tv-kd6:27.1.8	“I allow you to take sugar when you’re sick and sugar mixed in water when you’re not.” 
pli-tv-kd6:28.1.0	14. Pāṭaligāma 
pli-tv-kd6:28.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Pāṭaligāma with a large sangha of twelve-hundred and fifty monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.1.2	When he eventually arrived, he stayed there. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.1.3	When the lay followers of Pāṭaligāma heard 
pli-tv-kd6:28.1.4	that he had arrived, 
pli-tv-kd6:28.1.5	they went to see him, bowed, and sat down on one side. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.1.6	The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened them with a teaching. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.2.1	And they said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd6:28.2.2	“Please visit our guesthouse together with the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd6:28.2.3	The Buddha consented by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.2.4	Knowing that he had consented, they got up from their seats, bowed down, and circumambulated him with their right side toward him. They then went to the guesthouse, spread mats on the floor, prepared seats, put out a large waterpot, and hung up an oil lamp. They then returned to the Buddha, bowed, 
pli-tv-kd6:28.3.1	and told him 
pli-tv-kd6:28.3.2	that everything was prepared, 
pli-tv-kd6:28.3.6	adding, “Sir, please come at your convenience.” 
pli-tv-kd6:28.3.7	The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to the guesthouse together with the Sangha of monks. He washed his feet, entered the guesthouse, and sat down facing the east, leaning on the central pillar. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.3.8	The monks washed their feet too, entered the guesthouse, and sat down facing east with the Buddha in front of them, leaning against the western wall. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.3.9	The lay followers of Pāṭaligāma followed suit and sat down facing west with the Buddha in front of them, leaning against the eastern wall. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.3.10	And the Buddha addressed those lay followers: 
pli-tv-kd6:28.4.1	“There are these five dangers for one who is immoral because of failure in morality. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.4.3	Because of heedlessness, they lose much wealth. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.4.4	This is the first danger. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.4.5	They get a bad reputation. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.4.6	This is the second danger. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.4.7	Whenever they come to a gathering of people—whether a gathering of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or monastics—they are diffident and timid. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.4.8	This is the third danger. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.4.9	They die confused. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.4.10	This is the fourth danger. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.4.11	After death, they are reborn in a lower realm. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.4.12	This is the fifth danger. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.5.1	There are these five benefits for one who is moral because of success in morality. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.5.3	Because of heedfulness, they gain much wealth. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.5.4	This is the first benefit. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.5.5	They get a good reputation. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.5.6	This is the second benefit. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.5.7	Whenever they come to a gathering of people—whether a gathering of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or monastics—they are confident and self-assured. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.5.8	This is the third benefit. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.5.9	They die with a clear mind. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.5.10	This is the fourth benefit. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.5.11	After death, they are reborn in heaven. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.5.12	This is the fifth benefit.” 
pli-tv-kd6:28.6.1	The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened them by teaching for much of the night. He then dismissed them, saying, 
pli-tv-kd6:28.6.2	“It’s late at night. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.6.3	Please go at your convenience.” 
pli-tv-kd6:28.6.4	Saying, “Yes, Sir,” they got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated him with their right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.7.1	Soon after the lay followers of Pāṭaligāma had left, the Buddha entered an empty cubicle. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.7.2.0	15. Sunidha and Vassakāra 
pli-tv-kd6:28.7.2.1	At that time Sunidha and Vassakāra, the government officials of Magadha, were building a fortress at Pāṭaligāma to defend against the Vajjians. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.7.3	The Buddha got up early in the morning and, with his superhuman and purified clairvoyance, he saw a number of gods taking possession of sites around Pāṭaligāma. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.7.4	Wherever powerful gods took possession of a site, just there powerful kings and government officials inclined to build their houses. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.7.5	Wherever gods of middle standing took possession of a site, just there the kings and government officials of middle standing inclined to build their houses. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.7.6	And wherever the lower ranked gods took possession of a site, just there the lower ranked kings and government officials inclined to build their houses. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.7.7	The Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda, 
pli-tv-kd6:28.7.8	“Who is building a fortress in Pāṭaligāma?” 
pli-tv-kd6:28.8.1	“Sunidha and Vassakāra, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd6:28.8.2	“They are building the fortress, Ānanda, as if they had consulted with the Tāvatiṁsa gods.” 
pli-tv-kd6:28.8.4	And the Buddha told Ānanda what he had seen, 
pli-tv-kd6:28.8.8	adding, “As far, Ānanda, as the extent of the Indian realm, as far as the routes of commerce, Pāṭaliputta will be the chief city, the destination for merchandise. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.8.9	But there will be three dangers for Pāṭaliputta: 
pli-tv-kd6:28.8.10	fire, water, and internal dissension.” 
pli-tv-kd6:28.9.1	Sunidha and Vassakāra then went to the Buddha and exchanged pleasantries with him, 
pli-tv-kd6:28.10.1	adding, 
pli-tv-kd6:28.10.2	“Please accept tomorrow’s meal from us together with the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd6:28.10.3	The Buddha consented by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.10.4	Knowing that he had consented, they left. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.10.5	When they had had various kinds of fine food prepared, they had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.10.6	After robing up, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to Sunidha’s and Vassakāra’s meal offering, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.10.7	Sunidha and Vassakāra then personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, they sat down to one side. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.10.8	And the Buddha expressed his appreciation with these verses: 
pli-tv-kd6:28.11.1	“In whatever place 
pli-tv-kd6:28.11.2	The wise decide to live, 
pli-tv-kd6:28.11.3	There they feed the virtuous, 
pli-tv-kd6:28.11.4	The restrained monastics. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.11.5	Whatever gods are there 
pli-tv-kd6:28.11.6	One should dedicate the offering to them: 
pli-tv-kd6:28.11.7	Being revered and honored, 
pli-tv-kd6:28.11.8	They revere and honor one in return. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.11.9	And they have compassion for one, 
pli-tv-kd6:28.11.10	As a mother for her own child. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.11.11	The person the gods have compassion for 
pli-tv-kd6:28.11.12	Always has good fortune.” 
pli-tv-kd6:28.11.13	The Buddha then got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.12.1	But Sunidha and Vassakāra followed behind him, thinking, 
pli-tv-kd6:28.12.2	“Whatever gate the ascetic Gotama uses to depart we’ll name the Gotama Gate. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.12.3	And the ford he uses to cross the Ganges river we’ll name the Gotama Ford.” 
pli-tv-kd6:28.12.4	And the gate though which the Buddha left was named the Gotama Gate. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.12.5	The Buddha then went to the river Ganges. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.12.6	At that time the river was full to the brim. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.12.7	Among the people who wanted to cross, some were looking for a boat, some for a barge, and some were putting together a raft. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.13.1	The Buddha saw this. Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch his arm, so too the Buddha disappeared on the near shore of the river and reappeared on the far shore together with the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.13.2	Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha exclaimed this inspired verse: 
pli-tv-kd6:28.13.3	“Whoever crosses the flowing mass of water, 
pli-tv-kd6:28.13.4	They build a bridge, leaving the water behind. 
pli-tv-kd6:28.13.5	While ordinary people put together a raft, 
pli-tv-kd6:28.13.6	The wise have crossed already.” 
pli-tv-kd6:29.1.0	16. Discussion of the truths at Koṭigāma 
pli-tv-kd6:29.1.1	The Buddha then went to Koṭigāma, 
pli-tv-kd6:29.1.2	and he stayed there. 
pli-tv-kd6:29.1.3	While there, he addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:29.1.4	“It is because of not awakening to and not penetrating these four noble truths that you and I have wandered on and transmigrated for such a long time: 
pli-tv-kd6:29.1.6	the noble truth of suffering, 
pli-tv-kd6:29.1.7	the noble truth of the origin of suffering, 
pli-tv-kd6:29.1.8	the noble truth of the end of suffering, 
pli-tv-kd6:29.1.9	the noble truth of the path leading to the end of suffering. 
pli-tv-kd6:29.2.1	But now, monks, the noble truth of suffering has been awakened to and penetrated, likewise the noble truth of the origin of suffering, the noble truth of the end of suffering, and the noble truth of the path leading to the end of suffering. Craving for existence has been cut off; that which leads to existence has come to an end; now there is no further existence. 
pli-tv-kd6:29.2.2	Because of not properly seeing 
pli-tv-kd6:29.2.3	The four noble truths, 
pli-tv-kd6:29.2.4	You transmigrate for a long time 
pli-tv-kd6:29.2.5	Among various kinds of rebirth. 
pli-tv-kd6:29.2.6	These have now been seen; 
pli-tv-kd6:29.2.7	That which leads to existence has been abolished. 
pli-tv-kd6:29.2.8	The root of suffering has been cut off; 
pli-tv-kd6:29.2.9	Now there is no further existence.” 
pli-tv-kd6:30.1.0	17-18. The account of Ambapālī and the Licchavīs 
pli-tv-kd6:30.1.1	The courtesan Ambapālī heard 
pli-tv-kd6:30.1.2	that the Buddha had arrived at Koṭigāma. 
pli-tv-kd6:30.1.3	She had her best carriages harnessed, mounted one of them, and left Vesālī to visit the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd6:30.1.4	She went by carriage as far as the ground would allow, dismounted, and then approached the Buddha on foot. After bowing down to the Buddha, she sat down, 
pli-tv-kd6:30.2.1	and the Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching. 
pli-tv-kd6:30.2.2	She then said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd6:30.2.3	“Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd6:30.2.4	The Buddha consented by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-kd6:30.2.5	Knowing that he had consented, she got up from her seat, bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:30.3.1	The Licchavīs of Vesālī, too, 
pli-tv-kd6:30.3.2	heard that the Buddha had arrived at Koṭigāma. 
pli-tv-kd6:30.3.3	They had their best carriages harnessed, mounted one of them, and left Vesālī to visit the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd6:30.3.4	Some of them were blue, with blue makeup, blue clothes, and blue ornaments, and likewise, some of them were yellow, some red, and some white. 
pli-tv-kd6:30.3.5	When Ambapālī met the young Licchavīs, she turned her carriage around and drove up next to them, pole to pole, yoke to yoke, wheel to wheel, axle to axle. 
pli-tv-kd6:30.4.1	The Licchavīs asked her why, 
pli-tv-kd6:30.4.3	and she replied, “Because, sirs, I’ve invited the Buddha for tomorrow’s meal together with the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd6:30.4.4	“We’ll give you a hundred thousand for this meal, Ambapālī.” 
pli-tv-kd6:30.4.5	“Even if you gave me the whole of Vesālī together with its supporting land, I would not give you this meal.” 
pli-tv-kd6:30.4.6	The Licchavīs snapped their fingers in dismay, saying, 
pli-tv-kd6:30.4.7	“Damn it, we’ve been beaten by the mango woman!” 
pli-tv-kd6:30.5.1	And they continued on their way to the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd6:30.5.2	When the Buddha saw them coming, he said to the monks, 
pli-tv-kd6:30.5.3	“Those of you who haven’t seen the Tāvatiṁsa gods look at the Licchavīs. 
pli-tv-kd6:30.5.5	The Licchavīs are comparable with the Tāvatiṁsa gods.” 
pli-tv-kd6:30.5.6	The Licchavīs went by carriage as far as the ground would allow, dismounted, and then approached the Buddha on foot. 
pli-tv-kd6:30.5.7	After bowing down to the Buddha, they sat down, 
pli-tv-kd6:30.5.8	and the Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened them with a teaching. 
pli-tv-kd6:30.5.9	They then said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd6:30.5.10	“Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal from us together with the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd6:30.5.11	“I have already accepted tomorrow’s meal from Ambapālī.” 
pli-tv-kd6:30.5.12	The Licchavīs snapped their fingers in dismay, 
pli-tv-kd6:30.5.13	saying, “Damn it, we’ve been beaten by the mango woman.” 
pli-tv-kd6:30.5.14	After rejoicing in the Buddha’s words, they got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated him with their right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:30.6.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Koṭigāma as long as he liked, he went to Nātikā, 
pli-tv-kd6:30.6.2	where he stayed in the brick house. 
pli-tv-kd6:30.6.3	The following morning Ambapālī had various kinds of fine food prepared in her own park. She then had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready. 
pli-tv-kd6:30.6.4	After robing up, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to Ambapālī’s meal offering, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:30.6.5	And Ambapālī personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, she sat down to one side and said, 
pli-tv-kd6:30.6.6	“Venerable Sir, I give this mango grove to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd6:30.6.7	The Buddha accepted the park. 
pli-tv-kd6:30.6.8	After instructing, inspiring, and gladdening her with a teaching, he got up from his seat and went to the Great Wood near Vesālī, 
pli-tv-kd6:30.6.9	where he stayed in the hall with the peaked roof. 
pli-tv-kd6:30.6.10	The third section for recitation on the Licchavīs is finished. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.1.0	19. The account of General Sīha 
pli-tv-kd6:31.1.1	On one occasion a number of well-known Licchavīs were seated together in the public hall, praising the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha in many ways. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.1.2	Sīha the general, a disciple of the Jains, was seated in that gathering. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.1.3	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd6:31.1.4	“No doubt that Buddha is perfected, a fully Awakened One, since these well-known Licchavīs praise the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha in this way. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.1.5	Let me go and visit that Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd6:31.2.1	He then went to Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta and said, 
pli-tv-kd6:31.2.2	“Sir, I wish to visit the ascetic Gotama.” 
pli-tv-kd6:31.2.3	“Sīha, why visit the ascetic Gotama who teaches non-action when you believe in action? 
pli-tv-kd6:31.2.4	For the ascetic Gotama teaches for the sake of non-action, and he trains his disciples in that.” 
pli-tv-kd6:31.2.5	And Sīha’s intention to go died down. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.3.1	The same sequence of events happened a second time. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.3.10	A third time a number of well-known Licchavīs were seated together in the public hall, praising the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha in many ways. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.3.11	Sīha heard this, and he had the same thoughts as before. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.3.13	In addition he thought this, “What can the Jains do to me, whether I get their permission or not? 
pli-tv-kd6:31.3.14	Let me go and visit the Buddha, the Perfected and fully Awakened One, without getting permission from the Jains.” 
pli-tv-kd6:31.4.1	Soon afterwards, in the middle of the day, General Sīha set out from Vesālī with five hundred carriages to visit the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.4.2	He went by chariot as far as the ground would allow, dismounted, and then approached the Buddha on foot. He bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd6:31.4.3	and said, 
pli-tv-kd6:31.4.4	“Sir, I have heard that the ascetic Gotama teaches non-action, that he teaches for the sake of non-action, and that he trains his disciples in that. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.4.5	Those who say this 
pli-tv-kd6:31.4.6	do they say what you have said without falsely misrepresenting you? Do they explain according to the Teaching so that they can’t be legitimately criticized? 
pli-tv-kd6:31.4.7	I don’t wish to misrepresent you.” 
pli-tv-kd6:31.5.1	“There is a way, Sīha, one could rightly say of me 
pli-tv-kd6:31.5.2	that I teach non-action, that I teach for the sake of non-action, and that I train my disciples in that. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.6.1	What is that way? 
pli-tv-kd6:31.6.3	I teach the non-doing of misconduct by body, speech, and mind; 
pli-tv-kd6:31.6.4	I teach the non-doing of various kinds of bad and unwholesome actions. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.6.7	There is a way one could rightly say of me 
pli-tv-kd6:31.6.8	that I teach action, that I teach for the sake of action, and that I train my disciples in that. What is that way 
pli-tv-kd6:31.6.9	I teach the doing of good conduct by body, speech, and mind; I teach the doing of various kinds of good and wholesome actions. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.7.1	There is a way one could rightly say of me 
pli-tv-kd6:31.7.2	that I am an annihilationist, that I teach for the sake of annihilation, and that I train my disciples in that. What is that way? 
pli-tv-kd6:31.7.3	I teach the annihilation of sensual desire, ill will, and confusion; 
pli-tv-kd6:31.7.4	I teach the annihilation of various kinds of bad and unwholesome actions. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.7.7	There is a way one could rightly say of me 
pli-tv-kd6:31.7.8	that I am detestable, that I teach for the sake of detesting, and that I train my disciples in that. What is that way? 
pli-tv-kd6:31.7.9	I detest misconduct by body, speech, and mind; 
pli-tv-kd6:31.7.10	I detest being possessed of various kinds of bad and unwholesome qualities. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.8.1	There is a way one could rightly say of me 
pli-tv-kd6:31.8.2	that I’m an exterminator, that I teach for the sake of extermination, and that I train my disciples in that. What is that way? 
pli-tv-kd6:31.8.3	I teach the extermination of sensual desire, ill will, and confusion, 
pli-tv-kd6:31.8.4	the extermination of various kinds of bad and unwholesome qualities. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.8.7	There is a way one could rightly say of me 
pli-tv-kd6:31.8.8	that I’m austere, that I teach for the sake of austerity, and that I train my disciples in that. What is that way? 
pli-tv-kd6:31.8.9	I say that bad, unwholesome qualities—
pli-tv-kd6:31.8.10	misconduct by body, speech, and mind—are to be disciplined. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.8.11	One who has abandoned the bad, unwholesome qualities that are to be disciplined, who has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, done away with them so utterly that they are incapable of reappearing—such a one I call one who is austere. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.8.12	Now the Buddha has abandoned the bad, unwholesome qualities that are to be disciplined, has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm tree, done away with them so utterly that they are incapable of reappearing. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.9.1	There is a way one could rightly say of me 
pli-tv-kd6:31.9.2	that I’m withdrawn, that I teach for the sake of withdrawal, and that I train my disciples in that. What is that way? 
pli-tv-kd6:31.9.3	One whose future conception in a womb, whose rebirth in a future life, is abandoned and cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, so utterly done away with that one is incapable of reappearing—such a one I call one who is withdrawn. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.9.4	Now the Buddha’s future conception in a womb, his rebirth in a future life, is abandoned and cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, so utterly done away with that he is incapable of reappearing. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.9.7	There is a way one could rightly say of me 
pli-tv-kd6:31.9.8	that I’m at ease, that I teach for the sake of ease, and that I train my disciples in that. What is that way? 
pli-tv-kd6:31.9.9	I’m at ease in the highest sense; I proclaim my Teaching for sake of ease, and I train my disciples in that.” 
pli-tv-kd6:31.10.1	When the Buddha had finished, Sīha exclaimed, 
pli-tv-kd6:31.10.2	“Wonderful, Venerable Sir, wonderful! Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see what’s there—just so have you made the Teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to you and to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.10.3	Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
pli-tv-kd6:31.10.4	“Consider it carefully, Sīha. It’s good for well-known people such as yourself to think carefully.” 
pli-tv-kd6:31.10.5	“Now I’m even more pleased with you, Sir. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.10.7	If I became a lay follower of another religion, they would carry a banner all over Vesālī proclaiming it. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.10.8	But you instead tell me 
pli-tv-kd6:31.10.9	to consider it carefully. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.10.10	For the second time I go for refuge to you and to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.10.11	Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
pli-tv-kd6:31.11.1	“For a long time, Sīha, your family has been a wellspring of support for the Jains. When they come to you, you should still consider giving them almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd6:31.11.2	“Now I’m even more pleased with you, Sir. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.11.4	I had heard that you say 
pli-tv-kd6:31.11.5	that offerings should only be given to you and your disciples, not to anyone else, 
pli-tv-kd6:31.11.6	and that only offerings given to you and your disciples are fruitful, not what’s given to others. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.11.7	But in reality you encourage me to give to the Jains. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.11.8	Indeed, I shall know the right time for this. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.11.9	For the third time I go for refuge to you and to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.11.10	Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
pli-tv-kd6:31.12.1	The Buddha then gave Sīha a progressive teaching: 
pli-tv-kd6:31.12.2	talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. When the Buddha knew that his mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, so too, while he was sitting right there, Sīha experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.” He had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.12.3	He then said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd6:31.12.4	“Please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd6:31.12.5	The Buddha consented by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.12.6	Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Sīha got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.12.7	Sīha then told a man, 
pli-tv-kd6:31.12.8	“Go and get some ready meat.” 
pli-tv-kd6:31.12.9	And the following morning Sīha had various kinds of fine food prepared, and he had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.12.10	After robing up, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to General Sīha’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.13.1	Just then a number of Jains were walking around Vesālī, from street to street, from intersection to intersection, holding up their arms and calling out, 
pli-tv-kd6:31.13.2	“General Sīha has killed a large animal and made a meal for the ascetic Gotama. The ascetic Gotama is eating that meat knowing that the animal was killed for his sake.” 
pli-tv-kd6:31.13.3	A certain man went up to Sīha and whispered to him what the Jains were doing. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.13.6	Sīha said, “Forget about it. For a long time those venerables have disparaged the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.13.7	They will grow old and still keep on misrepresenting the Buddha with lies. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.13.8	And as for me, I would not kill a living being for the sake of my life.” 
pli-tv-kd6:31.14.1	Sīha then personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, Sīha sat down to one side. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.14.2	The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching. He then got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.14.3	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:31.14.4	“You should not eat meat when you know the animal was killed for your sake. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.14.5	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd6:31.14.6	I allow you to eat meat and fish that is pure in three respects: you haven’t seen, heard, or suspected that the animal was killed for your sake.” 
pli-tv-kd6:32.1.0	20. The allowance for a food-storage area 
pli-tv-kd6:32.1.1	Some time later in Vesālī, there was plenty of food, the crops were abundant, and there was no problem getting by on almsfood. 
pli-tv-kd6:32.1.2	Then, while the Buddha was in seclusion, he thought, 
pli-tv-kd6:32.1.3	“Those things that I allowed the monks when there was a shortage of food, the crops were meager, and it was hard to get by on almsfood—that is, what has been stored indoors within the monastery, what has been cooked indoors within the monastery, what has been cooked by the monks themselves, what has been received after picking it up, what has been brought out, what has been received before the meal, what has come from the forest or a lotus pond—do the monks still make use of these?” 
pli-tv-kd6:32.1.4	When the Buddha had come out from seclusion, he asked Venerable Ānanda about this. 
pli-tv-kd6:32.1.6	He replied, “They do, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd6:32.2.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:32.2.2	“Those things that I allowed you when there was a shortage of food, the crops were meager, and it was hard to get by on almsfood, I prohibit from today onward. 
pli-tv-kd6:32.2.3	You should not eat what has been stored indoors within the monastery, what has been cooked indoors within the monastery, what has been cooked by yourselves, or what has been received after picking it up. 
pli-tv-kd6:32.2.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd6:32.2.5	If you have finished your meal and refused an invitation to eat more, you should not eat non-leftovers that have been brought out, that have been received before the meal, or that have come from the forest or a lotus pond. 
pli-tv-kd6:32.2.6	If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule.” 
pli-tv-kd6:33.1.1	At that time people from the country loaded much salt, oil, rice, and fresh food onto carts, brought them to outside the monastery gateway, and waited for their turn to cook a meal. 
pli-tv-kd6:33.1.2	Just then a storm was approaching. 
pli-tv-kd6:33.1.3	Those people went to Venerable Ānanda and told him what was happening, adding, “What should we do now?” 
pli-tv-kd6:33.1.4	Ānanda told the Buddha, who said, 
pli-tv-kd6:33.2.1	“Well then, Ānanda, the Sangha should designate a building at the edge of the monastery as a food-storage area and then store the food there—whether a dwelling, a stilt house, or a cave. 
pli-tv-kd6:33.2.2	And it should be done like this. 
pli-tv-kd6:33.2.3	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd6:33.2.4	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd6:33.2.5	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should designate such-and-such a dwelling as a food-storage area. 
pli-tv-kd6:33.2.6	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd6:33.2.7	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd6:33.2.8	The Sangha designates such-and-such a dwelling as a food-storage area. 
pli-tv-kd6:33.2.9	Any monk who approves of designating such-and-such a dwelling as a food-storage area should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd6:33.2.10	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd6:33.2.11	The Sangha has designated such-and-such a dwelling as a food-storage area. 
pli-tv-kd6:33.2.12	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd6:33.3.1	Soon afterwards people used the appointed food-storage area for various purposes: for cooking rice porridge and rice, to prepare curries, to chop meat, and to split firewood. 
pli-tv-kd6:33.3.2	After getting up early in the morning, the Buddha heard loud noises, just like the cawing of crows. He asked Venerable Ānanda what it was, 
pli-tv-kd6:33.4.1	and Ānanda explained what was going on. 
pli-tv-kd6:33.4.3	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:33.4.4	“You should not use an appointed food-storage area. 
pli-tv-kd6:33.4.5	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd6:33.4.6	I allow three places as food-storage areas: 
pli-tv-kd6:33.4.7	a building made according to a proclamation, a place where cows rest, and a place given for the purpose by a householder.” 
pli-tv-kd6:33.5.1	Soon afterwards Venerable Yasoja was sick. 
pli-tv-kd6:33.5.2	People brought him tonics 
pli-tv-kd6:33.5.3	and the monks stored them outside. 
pli-tv-kd6:33.5.4	Vermin ate them and thieves stole them. 
pli-tv-kd6:33.5.6	“I allow you to use an appointed food-storage area. 
pli-tv-kd6:33.5.7	I allow four places as food-storage areas: 
pli-tv-kd6:33.5.8	a building made according to a proclamation, a building where cows rest, a building given for the purpose by a householder, and a building appointed by the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-kd6:33.5.9	The fourth section for recitation on Sīha is finished. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.1.0	21. The account of the householder Meṇḍaka 
pli-tv-kd6:34.1.1	At that time in the town of Bhaddiya there was a householder called Meṇḍaka 
pli-tv-kd6:34.1.2	who had supernormal powers. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.1.3	He would wash his hair, sweep out his granary, and sit down outside the door. A shower of grain would then fall out of the sky and fill his granary. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.1.4	His wife, too, had supernormal powers. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.1.5	She would sit down next to a pot of rice and a pot of curry and serve a meal to the slaves, servants, and workers. The food would not be exhausted until she got up. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.1.6	His son, too, had supernormal powers. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.1.7	He would get a bag containing a thousand coins and give the slaves, servants, and workers their wages for six months. That purse would not go empty as long as he held it. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.2.1	His daughter-in-law, too, had supernormal powers. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.2.2	She would sit down next to a four-liter basket and give out rice for six months to the slaves, servants, and workers. The rice would not be exhausted until she got up. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.2.3	Even his slave had supernormal powers. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.2.4	While plowing with a single plow, he made seven furrows. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.3.1	King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha 
pli-tv-kd6:34.3.2	heard that within his kingdom, in the town of Bhaddiya, there was a householder called Meṇḍaka with all these abilities. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.5.1	The King then told the official in charge of all practical affairs about this, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.5.9	adding, “Go and investigate it. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.5.10	If you see it, it will be as if I see it myself.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.5.11	Saying, “Yes, sir,” he set out for Bhaddiya with a fourfold army. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.6.1	When he eventually arrived, he went to Meṇḍaka and said, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.6.2	“I’ve been told by the King 
pli-tv-kd6:34.6.3	to investigate your supernormal powers. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.6.9	Please show them to me.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.6.10	Meṇḍaka then washed his hair, swept out his granary, and sat down outside the door. A shower of grain then fell out of the sky and filled his granary. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.6.11	“Good. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.6.12	Now show me your wife’s supernormal powers.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.7.1	Meṇḍaka told his wife, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.7.2	“Please serve a meal to the fourfold army.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.7.3	She then sat down next to a pot of rice and a pot of curry and served a meal to the fourfold army. The food was not exhausted until she got up. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.7.4	“Good. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.7.5	Now show me your son’s supernormal powers.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.8.1	Meṇḍaka told his son, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.8.2	“Please give wages for six month to the fourfold army.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.8.3	He then got a bag containing a thousand coins and give the fourfold army its wages for six months. That purse did not go empty as long as he held it. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.8.4	“Good. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.8.5	Now show me your daughter-in-law’s supernormal powers.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.9.1	Meṇḍaka told his daughter-in-law, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.9.2	“Please give rice for six month to the fourfold army.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.9.3	She then sat down next to a four-liter basket and gave rice for six months to the fourfold army. The rice was not exhausted until she got up. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.9.4	“Good. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.9.5	Now show me your slave’s supernormal powers.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.9.6	“Sir, we have to go to the field to see that.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.9.7	“Forget about it, then. I consider it as seen.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.9.8	That official then returned to Rājagaha with the fourfold army 
pli-tv-kd6:34.9.9	and he told the King what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.10.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Vesālī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Bhaddiya with a large sangha of twelve-hundred and fifty monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.10.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.10.3	he stayed in the Jātiyā Grove. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.11.1	Meṇḍaka was told: 
pli-tv-kd6:34.11.2	“Sir, the ascetic Gotama, the Sakyan, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, has arrived at Bhaddiya and is staying in the Jātiyā Grove with a large sangha of twelve-hundred and fifty monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.11.3	That good Gotama has a fine reputation: 
pli-tv-kd6:34.11.4	‘He is a Buddha, perfected and fully awakened, complete in insight and conduct, happy, knower of the world, supreme leader of trainable people, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, a Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.11.5	With his own insight he has seen this world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings, this society with its monastics and brahmins, its gods and humans, and he makes it known to others. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.11.6	He has a Teaching that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. It has a true goal and is well articulated. He sets out a perfectly complete and pure spiritual life.’ 
pli-tv-kd6:34.11.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.12.1	Meṇḍaka then had his best carriages harnessed, mounted one of them, and set out from Bhaddiya to visit the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.12.2	A number of monastics from other religions saw Meṇḍaka coming, and they said to him, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.12.3	“Where are you going, householder?” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.12.4	“I’m going to visit the Buddha, Sir, the ascetic Gotama.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.12.5	“Why visit the ascetic Gotama who teaches non-action when you believe in action? 
pli-tv-kd6:34.12.6	For the ascetic Gotama teaches for the sake of non-action, and he trains his disciples in that.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.13.1	Meṇḍaka thought, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.13.2	“No doubt he must be a Buddha, a perfected and fully Awakened One, since these monastics of other religions are jealous.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.13.3	He then went by carriage as far as the ground would allow, dismounted, and then approached the Buddha on foot. After bowing down to the Buddha, he sat down, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.13.4	and the Buddha gave him a progressive teaching: 
pli-tv-kd6:34.13.5	talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. When the Buddha knew that his mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, so too, while he was sitting right there, Meṇḍaka experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.” He had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.13.6	He then said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.13.7	“Wonderful, Venerable Sir, wonderful! Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see what’s there—just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the Teaching, and to the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.13.8	Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.13.9	And please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.13.10	The Buddha consented by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.14.1	Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Meṇḍaka got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.14.2	The following morning Meṇḍaka had various kinds of fine food prepared, and he had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.14.3	After robing up, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to Meṇḍaka’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.15.1	Then Meṇḍaka’s wife, son, daughter-in-law, and slave approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.15.2	And the Buddha gave them a progressive teaching, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.15.3	just as he had done to Meṇḍaka. They, too, experienced the stainless vision of the Truth, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.15.4	and they expressed their appreciation in the same way 
pli-tv-kd6:34.15.7	and became lay followers. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.16.1	Meṇḍaka then personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, Meṇḍaka sat down to one side and said, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.16.2	“Sir, as long as you’re staying in Bhaddiya, I would like to offer a regular meal to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.16.3	The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which he got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.17.0	22. The allowance for five products of a cow, etc. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.17.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Bhaddiya for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Aṅguttarāpa with a large sangha of twelve-hundred and fifty monks. He had not taken leave of Meṇḍaka, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.17.2	but when Meṇḍaka heard about it, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.17.4	he told his slaves and workers, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.17.5	“Load lots of salt, oil, rice, and fresh food onto the carts, and bring along twelve-hundred and fifty cowherds and twelve-hundred and fifty dairy cows. We’ll give the Buddha fresh milk wherever we see him.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.18.1	Meṇḍaka caught up with the Buddha while he was traversing a wilderness area. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.18.2	Meṇḍaka approached the Buddha, bowed down, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.18.3	and said, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.18.4	“Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.18.5	The Buddha consented by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.18.6	Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Meṇḍaka bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.18.7	The following morning Meṇḍaka had various kinds of fine food prepared and then had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.19.1	After robing up, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to Meṇḍaka’s meal offering, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.19.2	Meṇḍaka then told the twelve-hundred and fifty cowherds, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.19.3	“Listen, bring one cow for each and every monk and give them fresh milk.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.19.4	Meṇḍaka then personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha and he gave them fresh milk. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.19.5	Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not accept. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.19.6	The Buddha said, “Accept, monks, and drink.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.20.1	When the Buddha had finished his meal, Meṇḍaka sat down to one side, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.20.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.20.3	“Sir, there are wilderness roads where there is little water and little food, where it’s not easy to travel without provisions. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.20.4	It would be good, Sir, if you would allow provisions.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.20.5	The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened Meṇḍaka with a teaching, after which he got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.21.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:34.21.2	“I allow five products from cows: 
pli-tv-kd6:34.21.3	milk, curd, buttermilk, butter, and ghee. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.21.4	There are wilderness roads where there is little water and little food, where it’s not easy to travel without provisions. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.21.5	I allow you to look for provisions: whatever you need of rice, mung beans, black gram, salt, sugar, oil, and ghee. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.21.6	There are people who have faith and confidence. They may deposit money with an attendant, saying, 
pli-tv-kd6:34.21.7	“With this, please get what is allowable for the venerable.” 
pli-tv-kd6:34.21.8	I allow you to consent to what is allowable from that fund. 
pli-tv-kd6:34.21.9	But I say that under no circumstances should you look for or consent to gold, silver, or money.” 
pli-tv-kd6:35.1.0	23. The account of Keṇiya the dreadlocked ascetic 
pli-tv-kd6:35.1.1	Wandering on, the Buddha eventually arrived at Āpaṇa. 
pli-tv-kd6:35.1.2	Keṇiya the dreadlocked ascetic heard, 
pli-tv-kd6:35.1.3	“The ascetic Gotama, the Sakyan, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, has arrived at Āpaṇa.” And he heard about the Buddha’s qualities just as Meṇḍaka had. 
pli-tv-kd6:35.1.5	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd6:35.1.6	“What should I take to the ascetic Gotama?” 
pli-tv-kd6:35.2.1	And it occurred to him, 
pli-tv-kd6:35.2.2	“There are those ancient sages of the brahmins, the creators and teachers of the Vedas, 
pli-tv-kd6:35.2.3	that is, Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu. The brahmins at present still sing and proclaim the ancient verses that they sang, proclaimed, and collected. Now those ancient sages abstained from eating at night and at the wrong time, yet they consented to certain drinks. 
pli-tv-kd6:35.3.1	The ascetic Gotama also abstains from eating at night and at the wrong time, and it would be appropriate for him to consent to the same drinks.” 
pli-tv-kd6:35.3.2	He then had a large quantity of drinks prepared. Lifting them with carrying poles, he went to the Buddha. He exchanged pleasantries with the Buddha 
pli-tv-kd6:35.3.4	and said, 
pli-tv-kd6:35.3.5	“Good Gotama, please accept the drinks.” 
pli-tv-kd6:35.3.6	“Please give them to the monks, Keṇiya.” 
pli-tv-kd6:35.3.7	He did, 
pli-tv-kd6:35.3.8	but being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not receive them. 
pli-tv-kd6:35.3.9	The Buddha said, “Accept, monks, and drink.” 
pli-tv-kd6:35.4.1	Keṇiya then personally served that large quantity of drinks to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, Keṇiya sat down to one side. 
pli-tv-kd6:35.4.2	The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, 
pli-tv-kd6:35.4.3	and Keṇiya said, 
pli-tv-kd6:35.4.4	“Good Gotama, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd6:35.5.1	“The Sangha is large, Keṇiya. There are twelve hundred and fifty monks. Moreover, you have confidence in the brahmins.” 
pli-tv-kd6:35.5.2	Keṇiya acknowledged what the Buddha had said, 
pli-tv-kd6:35.5.3	but repeated his invitation a second time. 
pli-tv-kd6:35.5.4	The Buddha replied as before, 
pli-tv-kd6:35.5.5	and Keṇiya repeated his invitation a third time. 
pli-tv-kd6:35.5.7	The Buddha then consented by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-kd6:35.5.8	Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Keṇiya got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:35.6.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:35.6.2	“I allow eight kinds of drinks: 
pli-tv-kd6:35.6.3	mango drinks, rose-apple drinks, drinks from bananas with seeds, drinks from seedless bananas, licorice drinks, grape drinks, drinks made from lotus tubers, falsa fruit drinks. 
pli-tv-kd6:35.6.4	I allow juice from all fruits, except grain. 
pli-tv-kd6:35.6.5	I allow juice from all leaves, except the leaves of potherb. 
pli-tv-kd6:35.6.6	I allow juice from all flowers, except licorice flowers. 
pli-tv-kd6:35.6.7	I allow sugarcane juice. 
pli-tv-kd6:35.7.1	The following morning Keṇiya had various kinds of fine food prepared in his own hermitage, and he had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready. 
pli-tv-kd6:35.7.2	After robing up, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to Keṇiya’s hermitage, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:35.7.3	Keṇiya then served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, Keṇiya sat down to one side, 
pli-tv-kd6:35.8.1	and the Buddha expressed his appreciation with these verses: 
pli-tv-kd6:35.8.2	“Sacrifice is the best fire worship, 
pli-tv-kd6:35.8.3	Sāvittī the best meter; 
pli-tv-kd6:35.8.4	A king is the best of humans, 
pli-tv-kd6:35.8.5	The ocean the chief of rivers. 
pli-tv-kd6:35.8.6	The moon is the best in the night sky, 
pli-tv-kd6:35.8.7	The sun the best of all that shines. 
pli-tv-kd6:35.8.8	But for those making offerings, desiring merit, 
pli-tv-kd6:35.8.9	The Sangha is indeed the best.” 
pli-tv-kd6:35.8.10	And the Buddha got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:36.1.0	24. The account of Roja the Mallian 
pli-tv-kd6:36.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Āpaṇa for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Kusinārā with a large sangha of twelve-hundred and fifty monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:36.1.2	When the Mallians of Kusinārā heard that the Buddha was coming, 
pli-tv-kd6:36.1.3	they made an agreement that whoever did not go out to meet the Buddha would be fined five hundred coins. 
pli-tv-kd6:36.1.4	At that time Venerable Ānanda had a friend called Roja the Mallian. 
pli-tv-kd6:36.1.5	As the Buddha was approaching Kusinārā, 
pli-tv-kd6:36.2.1	the Mallians, including Roja, went out to meet him. 
pli-tv-kd6:36.2.2	Roja then went to Ānanda and bowed, 
pli-tv-kd6:36.2.3	and Ānanda said to him, 
pli-tv-kd6:36.2.4	“It’s noble of you to come out to meet the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd6:36.2.5	“I’m not doing this as a service to the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd6:36.2.6	I’m doing it 
pli-tv-kd6:36.2.7	because I would get fined by the Mallians if I didn’t.” 
pli-tv-kd6:36.2.8	Ānanda was disappointed with his friend. 
pli-tv-kd6:36.3.1	He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd6:36.3.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd6:36.3.3	“Venerable Sir, Roja the Mallian is a well-known person. 
pli-tv-kd6:36.3.4	It would be of great benefit if such well-known people gained confidence in this spiritual path. 
pli-tv-kd6:36.3.5	It would be good if you would inspire confidence in Roja.” 
pli-tv-kd6:36.3.6	“That’s not difficult, Ānanda, for the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd6:36.4.1	And the Buddha suffused Roja with a mind of loving kindness, and then got up from his seat and entered a dwelling. 
pli-tv-kd6:36.4.2	When Roja was suffused with loving kindness, he acted just like a young calf looking for its mother: 
pli-tv-kd6:36.4.3	he went from dwelling to dwelling, from precincts to precincts, asking, 
pli-tv-kd6:36.4.4	“Venerables, where is the Buddha staying, the perfected and fully Awakened One? I wish to see him.” 
pli-tv-kd6:36.4.5	“In that dwelling, Roja, with the closed door. Go there quietly and slowly, enter the porch, clear your throat, and knock on the door. The Buddha will then open the door for you.” 
pli-tv-kd6:36.5.1	Roja did what he had been told and the Buddha opened the door for him. 
pli-tv-kd6:36.5.2	Roja entered the dwelling, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd6:36.5.3	The Buddha then gave him a progressive teaching: 
pli-tv-kd6:36.5.4	talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. When the Buddha knew that his mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, so too, while he was sitting right there, Roja experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.” He had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. 
pli-tv-kd6:36.5.5	And he said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd6:36.5.6	“Venerable Sir, it would be good if the venerables would accept robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines from me, and not from others.” 
pli-tv-kd6:36.5.7	“Roja, those who have seen the Truth with a trainee’s knowledge and vision, as you have, think like this. 
pli-tv-kd6:36.5.9	But Roja, let the monks receive both from you and from others.” 
pli-tv-kd6:36.6.1	At this time in Kusinārā there was a succession of fine meals. 
pli-tv-kd6:36.6.2	Not being able to get a turn, Roja thought, 
pli-tv-kd6:36.6.3	“Why don’t I inspect the dining hall and then prepare whatever is lacking?” 
pli-tv-kd6:36.6.4	When he did, he saw that two things were missing: 
pli-tv-kd6:36.6.5	potherbs and fresh food made with flour. 
pli-tv-kd6:36.6.6	He then went to Venerable Ānanda and told what he had been thinking, 
pli-tv-kd6:36.6.11	adding, “Venerable Ānanda, if I was to prepare potherbs and fresh food made with flour, would the Buddha accept it?” 
pli-tv-kd6:36.6.12	“Well, Roja, let me ask the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd6:36.7.1	Venerable Ānanda told the Buddha what had happened 
pli-tv-kd6:36.7.2	and the Buddha said, “Allow it to be prepared, Ānanda.” 
pli-tv-kd6:36.7.3	And Ānanda passed the message on to Roja. 
pli-tv-kd6:36.7.4	The following morning Roja prepared much potherb and fresh food made with flour and brought it to the Buddha, saying, 
pli-tv-kd6:36.7.5	“Venerable Sir, please accept the potherb and the fresh food made with flour.” 
pli-tv-kd6:36.7.6	“Well then, Roja, give it to the monks.” 
pli-tv-kd6:36.7.7	He did, 
pli-tv-kd6:36.7.8	but the monks were afraid of wrongdoing and did not accept. 
pli-tv-kd6:36.7.9	The Buddha said, “Accept, monks, and eat.” 
pli-tv-kd6:36.8.1	And Roja personally served much potherb and fresh food made with flour to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, Roja sat down to one side. 
pli-tv-kd6:36.8.2	The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which he got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-kd6:36.8.3	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:36.8.4	“I allow you all potherbs and all fresh foods made with flour.” 
pli-tv-kd6:37.1.0	25. The account of the one who had gone forth when old 
pli-tv-kd6:37.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Kusinārā for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Ātumā with a large sangha of twelve-hundred and fifty monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:37.1.2	At that time at Ātumā there was a monk who was previously a barber and who had gone forth when he was old. 
pli-tv-kd6:37.1.3	He had two boys, sweet-voiced and articulate, who were skilled barbers, their own teacher’s trade. 
pli-tv-kd6:37.2.1	The monk who had gone forth when old heard that the Buddha was coming to Ātumā, 
pli-tv-kd6:37.2.2	and he said to those two boys, 
pli-tv-kd6:37.2.3	“The Buddha is coming to Ātumā with a large sangha of twelve-hundred and fifty monks. 
pli-tv-kd6:37.2.4	Now go and get the barber equipment, and then go from house to house with a box and collect salt, oil, rice, and fresh food. When the Buddha has arrived, we’ll make a rice-porridge drink.” 
pli-tv-kd6:37.3.1	Saying, “Yes,” they did just that. 
pli-tv-kd6:37.3.2	When people saw those sweet-voiced and articulate boys, they used their services even if they did not really want to. And they gave much in return. 
pli-tv-kd6:37.3.3	Soon the boys had collected a large amount of salt, oil, rice, and fresh food. 
pli-tv-kd6:37.4.1	When the Buddha eventually arrived at Ātumā, 
pli-tv-kd6:37.4.2	he stayed in a dwelling made of husk. 
pli-tv-kd6:37.4.3	The following morning that monk who had gone forth when he was old had much rice porridge prepared and he brought it to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd6:37.4.4	saying, “Venerable Sir, please accept the rice porridge.” 
pli-tv-kd6:37.4.5	When Buddhas know what is going on, sometimes they ask and sometimes not. They know the right time to ask and when not to ask. Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, otherwise not, for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial. Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: 
pli-tv-kd6:37.4.6	to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule. 
pli-tv-kd6:37.4.7	The Buddha then said to him, 
pli-tv-kd6:37.4.8	“Where does this rice porridge come from?” 
pli-tv-kd6:37.4.9	He told him, 
pli-tv-kd6:37.5.1	and the Buddha rebuked him, 
pli-tv-kd6:37.5.2	“It’s not suitable, foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-kd6:37.5.3	How can you who have gone forth encourage others in what is unallowable for you? 
pli-tv-kd6:37.5.4	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd6:37.5.5	and after rebuking him he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd6:37.5.6	“You should not encourage others to do what is unallowable for you. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-kd6:37.5.7	And if you were previously a barber, you should not carry the barber equipment around. 
pli-tv-kd6:37.5.8	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd6:38.1.1	When the Buddha had stayed at Ātumā for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd6:38.1.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd6:38.1.3	he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd6:38.1.4	At that time in Sāvatthī much fruit had been given. 
pli-tv-kd6:38.1.5	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd6:38.1.6	“Which fruits has the Buddha allowed and which has he not allowed?” 
pli-tv-kd6:38.1.7	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd6:38.1.8	“I allow all fruits.” 
pli-tv-kd6:39.1.1	On one occasion seeds belonging to the Sangha had been planted on land belonging to an individual, and seeds belonging to an individual on land belonging to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd6:39.1.3	“If seeds belonging to the Sangha have been planted on land belonging to an individual, that person should be given a share, and the produce may then be eaten. 
pli-tv-kd6:39.1.4	If seeds belonging to an individual have been planted on land belonging to the Sangha, the Sangha should be given a share, and the produce may then be eaten.” 
pli-tv-kd6:40.1.0	26. Discussion of the four great standards 
pli-tv-kd6:40.1.1	At that time the monks were anxious about all sorts of matters, thinking, 
pli-tv-kd6:40.1.2	“What has the Buddha allowed and what has he not allowed?” 
pli-tv-kd6:40.1.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd6:40.1.4	“If I haven’t specifically prohibited something, then it’s unallowable to you if it is similar to what is unallowable and excluded from what is allowable. 
pli-tv-kd6:40.1.5	If I haven’t specifically prohibited something, then it’s allowable to you if it is similar to what is allowable and excluded from what is unallowable. 
pli-tv-kd6:40.1.6	If I haven’t specifically allowed something, then it’s unallowable to you if it is similar to what is unallowable and excluded from what is allowable. 
pli-tv-kd6:40.1.7	If I haven’t specifically allowed something, then it’s allowable to you if it is similar to what is allowable and excluded from what is unallowable, .” 
pli-tv-kd6:40.2.1	Then the monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd6:40.2.2	“Are post-midday tonics mixed with ordinary food allowable or not allowable? 
pli-tv-kd6:40.2.3	Are seven-day tonics mixed with ordinary food allowable or not allowable? 
pli-tv-kd6:40.2.4	Are lifetime tonics mixed with ordinary food allowable or not allowable? 
pli-tv-kd6:40.2.5	Are seven-day tonics mixed with post-midday tonics allowable or not allowable? 
pli-tv-kd6:40.2.6	Are lifetime tonics mixed with post-midday tonics allowable or not allowable? 
pli-tv-kd6:40.2.7	Are lifetime tonics mixed with seven-day tonics allowable or not allowable?” 
pli-tv-kd6:40.2.8	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd6:40.3.1	“When mixed with ordinary food, post-midday tonics are allowable before midday on the day they are received, but not after midday. 
pli-tv-kd6:40.3.2	When mixed with ordinary food, seven-day tonics are allowable before midday on the day they are received, but not after midday. 
pli-tv-kd6:40.3.3	When mixed with ordinary food, lifetime tonics are allowable before midday on the day they are received, but not after midday. 
pli-tv-kd6:40.3.4	When mixed with post-midday tonics, seven-day tonics are allowable after midday on the day they are received, but not after dawn. 
pli-tv-kd6:40.3.5	When mixed with post-midday tonics, lifetime tonics are allowable after midday on the day they are received, but not after dawn. 
pli-tv-kd6:40.3.6	When mixed with seven-day tonics, lifetime tonics are allowable for seven days, but not beyond that.” 
pli-tv-kd6:40.3.7	The sixth chapter on medicines is finished. 
pli-tv-kd6:40.3.65	In this chapter there are one hundred and six topics. 
pli-tv-kd6:40.3.66	The chapter on medicines is finished.
pli-tv-kd7:0.1	Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law 
pli-tv-kd7:0.2	The Long Division 
pli-tv-kd7:0.3	The chapter on the robe-making procedure 
pli-tv-kd7:0.4	1. The allowance for a robe-making procedure 
pli-tv-kd7:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.1.2	At that time thirty monks from Pāvā—all wilderness-dwellers, almsfood-only eaters, rag-robe wearers, and three-robe owners—were traveling to Sāvatthī to visit the Buddha. Because the entry to the rainy-season residence was approaching, they were not able to reach Sāvatthī, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.1.3	and they entered the rains residence at Sāketa while still on their way. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.1.4	They spent the rains residence discontented, thinking, “The Buddha is only 80 kilometers away, but we don’t get to see him.” 
pli-tv-kd7:1.1.5	When they had completed the rainy-season residence and done the invitation procedure at the end of the three months, it was raining, water was accumulating, and it was muddy. As they traveled to Sāvatthī, their robes were soaked. They became exhausted. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.1.6	When they arrived at Sāvatthī, they went to Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, bowed to the Buddha, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.2.1	Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.2.2	the Buddha said to them, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.2.3	“I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re getting by. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.2.4	I hope you had a comfortable rains residence, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and that you had no trouble getting almsfood?” 
pli-tv-kd7:1.2.5	“We’re keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re getting by. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.2.6	We had a comfortable rains residence, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and we had no trouble getting almsfood.” 
pli-tv-kd7:1.2.7	And they told the Buddha what had happened during the rains and while traveling to Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.3.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd7:1.3.2	“I allow monks who have completed the rainy-season residence to do a robe-making procedure. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.3.3	Once you have participated in the robe-making procedure, five things are allowable for you: 
pli-tv-kd7:1.3.4	visiting families before or after a meal invitation, staying apart from your robe for more than a day, eating in a group, keeping as much extra robe-cloth as you need, and whatever robe-cloth is given is only for those who have participated in the robe-making procedure. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.3.6	And the robe-making procedure should be done like this. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.4.1	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd7:1.4.2	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.4.3	This cloth has been given to the Sangha for the robe-making procedure. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.4.4	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give this cloth to monk so-and-so to do the robe-making procedure. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.4.5	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.4.6	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.4.7	This cloth has been given to the Sangha for the robe-making procedure. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.4.8	The Sangha gives this cloth to monk so-and-so to do the robe-making procedure. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.4.9	Any monk who approves of giving this cloth to monk so-and-so to do the robe-making procedure should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.4.10	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.4.11	The Sangha has given this cloth to monk so-and-so to do the robe-making procedure. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.4.12	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’ 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.2	“And, monks, how has the robe-making procedure not been done? 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.3	The robe-making procedure hasn’t been done merely by marking the cloth, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.4	merely by washing the cloth, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.5	merely by planning the robe, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.6	merely by cutting the cloth, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.7	merely by a tacking the cloth, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.8	merely by sewing a seam, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.9	merely by marking with a strip of cloth, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.10	merely by strengthening, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.11	merely by adding a border lengthwise, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.12	merely by adding a border crosswise, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.13	merely by adding a patch, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.14	merely by partial dyeing; 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.15	nor has it been done if a monk has made an indication, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.16	if a monk has given a hint, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.17	if the robe has been borrowed, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.18	if it has been stored, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.19	if it is to be relinquished, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.20	if it hasn’t been marked, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.21	if it’s not an outer robe 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.22	or an upper robe 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.23	or a sarong; 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.24	nor has it been done if the robe hasn’t been made on that very day with five or more cut sections with panels, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.25	if the robe-making procedure isn’t done by an individual, 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.26	or if the appreciation for the procedure is expressed by someone outside the monastic boundary. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.5.27	In this way the robe-making procedure hasn’t been done. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.6.1	And how has the robe-making procedure been done? 
pli-tv-kd7:1.6.2	The robe-making procedure has been done if the cloth is brand new, if it’s nearly new, if it’s old, if it’s a rag, if it’s from a shop; it has been done if a monk hasn’t given a sign, if a monk hasn’t given a hint, if the robe hasn’t been borrowed, if it hasn’t been stored, if it’s not to be relinquished, if it has been marked, if it’s an outer robe or an upper robe or a sarong; it has been done if the robe has been made on that very day with five or more cut sections with panels, if the robe-making procedure is done by an individual, and if the appreciation for the procedure is expressed by someone inside the monastic boundary. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.6.3	In this way the robe-making procedure has been done. 
pli-tv-kd7:1.7.1	And how does the robe-making season come to an end? 
pli-tv-kd7:1.7.2	There are these eight summaries for when the robe-making season comes to an end: 
pli-tv-kd7:1.7.3	when he departs from the monastery, when the robe is finished, when he makes a decision, when the robe-cloth is lost, when he hears about the end of the robe-making season, when an expectation of more robe-cloth is thwarted, when he is outside the monastic boundary, when the robe-making season comes to an end together.” 
pli-tv-kd7:2.1.0	2. The group of seven on “takes”

pli-tv-kd8:1.2.10	and told him about everything they had seen, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.2.13	adding, “It would be good, sir, if we were to appoint a courtesan.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.2.14	“Well then, find a suitable girl.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.3.1	At that time in Rājagaha there was a girl called Sālavatī who was attractive and gracious and had the most beautiful complexion, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.3.2	and the householder association appointed her as courtesan. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.3.3	Soon afterwards she became skilled in dancing, singing, and instrumental music. She was highly desired, charging a hundred coins for a night. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.3.4	Soon enough Sālavatī became pregnant. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.3.5	She thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.3.6	“Men don’t like pregnant women. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.3.7	If anyone finds out about this, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.3.8	it will ruin my career. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.3.9	Let me announce that I’m sick.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.3.10	She told her doorman, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.3.11	“Don’t allow entry to any man. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.3.12	If anyone asks for me, tell them I’m sick.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.3.13	“Yes, madam.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.4.1	Her pregnancy developed, and eventually she gave birth to a son. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.4.2	She told her slave, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.4.3	“Listen, put this boy in a winnowing basket, take him away, and throw him on a trash heap.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.4.4	Saying, “Yes, madam,” she did just that. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.4.5	On the same morning, as Prince Abhaya was walking to an audience with the King, he saw that boy surrounded by crows. He asked his companions, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.4.6	“What’s that surrounded by crows?” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.4.7	“It’s a boy, sir.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.4.8	“Is he alive?” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.4.9	“Yes, he’s alive.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.4.10	“Well then, take him to our compound and give him to the wet-nurses to feed.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.4.11	Saying, “Yes,” that’s what they did. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.4.13	When they knew that he would live, they gave him the name Jīvaka, “Survivor”. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.4.14	And because a prince brought him up, they also gave him the name Komārabhacca, “Prince-reared”. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.5.1	When Jīvaka reached the age of discernment, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.5.2	he went to Prince Abhaya and asked him, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.5.3	“Who, sir, are my mother and father?” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.5.4	“I don’t know who your mother is, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.5.5	but I’m your father, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.5.6	because I brought you up.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.5.7	On a later occasion Jīvaka thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.5.8	“It’s not easy to make a living in a royal family without a profession. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.5.9	Why don’t I learn a profession?” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.5.10	At that time the pre-eminent physician in the world was staying at Takkasilā. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.6.1	Then, without asking permission of Prince Abhaya, Jīvaka left for Takkasilā. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.6.2	When he eventually arrived, he went to that physician and said, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.6.3	“Teacher, I wish to learn the profession.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.6.4	“Well then, Jīvaka, please do so.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.6.5	Jīvaka learned much, and he learned quickly; he remembered well and did not forget. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.6.6	After seven years, Jīvaka thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.6.7	“I’m a good learner, and I’ve been studying for seven years. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.6.8	And yet there’s no end in sight of learning this profession.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.7.1	He went to that physician and told him what he had thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.7.3	adding, “When will I complete the training for this profession?” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.7.4	“Listen, Jīvaka. Take a spade and walk as far as 13 kilometers all around Takkasilā and bring back whatever plant you see that’s not medicinal.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.7.5	Saying, “Yes, teacher,” he did just that. But he did not see any plant that was not medicinal. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.7.6	He then went back to the physician and told him what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.7.8	The physician said, “You are well-trained, Jīvaka. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.7.9	This is enough for you to live on.” And he gave Jīvaka a small amount of provisions for the journey. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.8.1	Jīvaka left for Rājagaha, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.8.2	but the provisions were exhausted by the time he got to Sāketa. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.8.3	Jīvaka thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.8.4	“These roads go through the wilderness where there’s little water and little food. It’s not easy to travel there without provisions. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.8.5	Let me search for provisions.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.8.6.0	2. The account of the wealthy merchant’s wife 
pli-tv-kd8:1.8.6.1	At that time in Sāketa there was a wealthy merchant whose wife had had a headache for seven years. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.8.7	Many of the most famous physicians in the world had come to see her, but none was able to cure her. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.8.8	And they were very expensive. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.8.9	When Jīvaka arrived at Sāketa, he asked people, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.8.10	“Is there anyone who is sick who I might cure?” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.8.11	“There’s a wealthy merchant whose wife has had a headache for seven years. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.8.12	Go, doctor, and cure her.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.9.1	Jīvaka went to that merchant’s house and told the doorman, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.9.2	“Go and say this to the merchant’s wife, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.9.3	‘Madam, a doctor has arrived. He wishes to see you.’” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.9.4	Saying, “Yes, doctor,” he did as asked. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.9.7	When she had been told, she asked, “What sort of doctor is it?” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.9.8	“A young one.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.9.9	“Forget it. I don’t need a young doctor. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.9.10	Many of the most famous physicians in the world have been here, but none was able to cure me. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.9.11	And they were very expensive too.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.10.1	The doorman then returned to Jīvaka and told him what the merchant’s wife had said. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.10.6	Jīvaka replied, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.10.7	“Go and tell her 
pli-tv-kd8:1.10.8	that she doesn’t have to pay anything in advance. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.10.9	When she is cured, she can pay whatever she likes.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.10.10	Saying “Yes, doctor,” he told the merchant’s wife. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.10.14	She replied, “Well then, let him in.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.10.15	Saying, “Yes, madam,” he went to Jīvaka and told him. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.11.1	Jīvaka then approached the merchant’s wife. After examining her, he said to her, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.11.2	“Lady, I need a handful of ghee.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.11.3	She got him a handful of ghee. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.11.4	Jīvaka cooked that ghee with a number of medicines. He then had her lie down on her back on a bed, and he gave her the medicine through the nose. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.11.5	The medicine emerged in her mouth. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.11.6	She then spat it out into a container and told a slave, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.11.7	“Listen, take this ghee in a cotton wadding.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.12.1	Jīvaka thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.12.2	“It’s astonishing how mean this housewife is, in that she takes this ghee, which should be discarded, in a cotton wadding. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.12.3	Many of my valuable medicines went into it, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.12.4	but she might not give me anything for my services.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.12.5	Seeing his body language, the merchant’s wife asked him 
pli-tv-kd8:1.12.6	what he was concerned about. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.12.7	He told her, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.12.11	and she said, “We householders know the benefit of such frugality. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.12.12	This ghee is good for the slaves and workers, for ointment for the feet, or for using in lamps. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.12.13	Don’t be concerned, doctor, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.12.14	your fee will be abundant.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.13.1	Jīvaka cured the headache of the merchant’s wife with a single treatment through the nose. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.13.2	When she was well, she gave him four thousand coins. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.13.3	When her son 
pli-tv-kd8:1.13.5	and daughter-in-law 
pli-tv-kd8:1.13.6	found out that she was well, they too gave him four thousand coins each, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.13.7	as did her husband. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.13.8	The merchant also gave him a male and a female slave and a carriage with horses. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.13.9	Jīvaka took those sixteen thousand coins, as well as the male and female slaves and the carriage with horses, and he left for Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.13.10	When he eventually arrived, he went to Prince Abhaya and said, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.13.11	“For my first job, sir, I earned sixteen thousand coins, a male and a female slave, and a carriage with horses. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.13.12	Please accept it for bringing me up.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.13.13	“There’s no need, Jīvaka. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.13.14	You should keep it all. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.13.15	But please build a house in our compound.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.13.16	“Yes.” And that’s what he did. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.14.0	3. The account of King Bimbisāra 
pli-tv-kd8:1.14.1	At that time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha had hemorrhoids. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.14.2	His wrap garments were soiled with blood, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.14.3	and the queens made fun of him, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.14.4	“Sir, you’re menstruating; your fertile period has arrived. Soon you’ll give birth.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.14.5	And the King felt humiliated. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.14.6	Soon afterwards he told Prince Abhaya what had happened, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.14.9	adding, “Abhaya, please find a doctor who can cure me.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.14.10	“Sir, our young doctor Jīvaka is excellent. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.14.11	He will cure you.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.14.12	“Well then, Abhaya, send for Jīvaka.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.15.1	Prince Abhaya then sent for Jīvaka. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.15.3	Saying, “Yes, sir,” Jīvaka took some medicine on his nail and went to King Bimbisāra. He said, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.15.4	“Sir, let me see your affliction.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.15.5	Jīvaka then cured King Bimbisāra’s hemorrhoids with one application of ointment. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.15.6	When the King was well, he had five hundred women adorned with every kind of ornament. He then had the ornaments removed and made into a pile. And he said to Jīvaka, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.15.7	“Jīvaka, these ornaments from five hundred women are all yours.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.15.8	“There’s no need. Please just remember my act of service.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.15.9	“Well then, Jīvaka, please attend on me, the harem, and the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.15.10	“Yes, sir.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.16.0	4. The account of the wealthy merchant of Rājagaha 
pli-tv-kd8:1.16.1	At that time a wealthy merchant of Rājagaha had had a headache for seven years. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.16.2	Many of the most famous physicians in the world had come to see him, but none was able to cure him. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.16.3	They were very expensive, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.16.4	yet they gave up on him. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.16.5	Some of them said, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.16.6	“The merchant will die in five days.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.16.7	Others said, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.16.8	“The merchant will die in seven days.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.16.9	The householder association of Rājagaha considered, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.16.10	“This merchant has done much for the King and for this association, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.16.11	and now the doctors have given up on him. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.16.16	But there’s Jīvaka, the King’s excellent young doctor. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.16.17	Let’s ask the King for Jīvaka to cure the merchant.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.17.1	They then went to the King and told him about the merchant, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.17.8	adding, “It would be good, sir, if you would tell doctor Jīvaka to cure the merchant.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.17.9	And that’s what the King did. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.17.11	Saying, “Yes, sir,” Jīvaka went to that merchant, examined him, and said, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.17.12	“If I was to cure you, what fee would you pay me?” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.17.13	“I would give you all my wealth, doctor, and I would become your slave.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.1	“Are you able to lie on one side for seven months?” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.2	“I am.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.3	“Are you able to lie on the other side for seven months?” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.4	“I am.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.5	“Are you able to lie on your back for seven months?” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.6	“I am.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.7	Jīvaka then had the merchant lie down on a bed. He bound him to the bed, removed some skin from his head, opened a suture in the skull, and removed two insects. He showed them to the crowd, saying, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.8	“Sirs, look at these two insects, one small and one large. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.9	The doctors who said 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.10	he would live for five days 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.11	had seen the large insect. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.12	In five days it would have destroyed the merchant’s brain. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.13	Because of that he would have died. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.14	Those doctors were right. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.15	And those doctors who said 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.16	he would live for seven days 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.17	had seen the small insect. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.18	In seven days it would have destroyed the merchant’s brain. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.19	Because of that he would have died. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.20	Those doctors were right, too.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.18.21	He then closed the suture in the skull, sewed the skin back together, and applied an ointment. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.19.1	After seven days the merchant said to Jīvaka, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.19.2	“Doctor, I’m unable to lie on one side for seven months.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.19.3	“But didn’t you say you were?” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.19.5	“I did, but I’ll die. I’m unable to do it.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.19.6	“Well then, lie on the other side for seven months.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.19.7	After seven days the merchant said to Jīvaka, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.19.8	“Doctor, I’m unable to lie on the other side for seven months.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.19.9	“But didn’t you say you were?” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.19.11	“I did, but I’ll die. I’m unable to do it.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.19.12	“Well then, lie on your back for seven months.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.19.13	After seven days the merchant said to Jīvaka, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.19.14	“Doctor, I’m unable to lie on my back for seven months.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.19.15	“But didn’t you say you were?” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.19.17	“I did, but I’ll die. I’m unable to do it.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.20.1	“If I hadn’t said this to you, you wouldn’t have been able to lie down for so long. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.20.2	I already knew that you would be well in three times seven days. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.20.3	Get up, you’re cured. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.20.4	But do you remember my fee?” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.20.5	“All my wealth is yours, doctor, and I’m your slave.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.20.6	“There’s no need for that. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.20.7	Just give one hundred thousand coins to the King and another one hundred thousand to me.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.20.8	And being well, he did just that. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.21.0	5. The account of the wealthy merchant’s son 
pli-tv-kd8:1.21.1	On one occasion the son of a wealthy merchant in Benares twisted his gut while turning somersaults. Because of that he was not able to digest rice porridge or food, and he was not able to urinate or defecate. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.21.2	He became thin, haggard, and pale, with veins protruding all over his body. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.21.3	The merchant considered this 
pli-tv-kd8:1.21.6	and thought, “Let me go to Rājagaha and ask the King for doctor Jīvaka to cure my son.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.21.7	He then traveled to Rājagaha, went to King Bimbisāra, and told him about his son, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.21.10	adding, “It would be good, sir, if you would tell doctor Jīvaka to cure my son.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.22.1	And that’s what the King did. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.22.3	Jīvaka consented and then traveled to Benares, where he went to that merchant. He examined his son, dismissed the people there, put up a curtain all around, and tied him to a pillar. He then had his wife stand in front of him, cut open his stomach, and pulled out his twisted gut. He showed it to his wife, saying, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.22.4	“See, this is your husband’s affliction. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.22.5	It’s because of this that he’s in such a bad state.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.22.6	He then untwisted the gut, put it back, sewed the stomach back together, and applied ointment. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.22.7	Soon the merchant’s son was healthy again. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.22.9	His father gave sixteen thousand coins to Jīvaka, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.22.10	and Jīvaka returned to Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.23.0	6. The account of King Pajjota 
pli-tv-kd8:1.23.1	At that time King Pajjota had jaundice. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.23.2	Many of the most famous physicians in the world had come to see him, but none was able to cure him. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.23.3	And they were very expensive. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.23.4	King Pajjota then sent a message to King Bimbisāra: 
pli-tv-kd8:1.23.5	“I have such-and-such a disease. It would be good, sir, if you would tell doctor Jīvaka to cure me.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.23.6	And King Bimbisāra told Jīvaka, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.23.7	“Go to Ujjenī, Jīvaka, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.23.8	and cure King Pajjota.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.23.9	Jīvaka consented and traveled to Ujjenī, where he went to King Pajjota. He then examined him and said, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.24.1	“Give me some ghee, sir. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.24.2	I’ll make a medicine from it for you to drink.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.24.3	“Forget it, Jīvaka. Make whatever will cure me that doesn’t contain ghee. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.24.4	I hate ghee; it’s disgusting.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.24.5	Jīvaka thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.24.6	“I won’t be able to cure this sickness without ghee. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.24.7	Let me prepare medicine from ghee, but with a  bitter color, smell, and taste.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.24.8	Jīvaka then cooked ghee with a number of medicines, but he made sure it had the color, smell, and taste of a bitter substance. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.24.9	And he thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.24.10	“When the King is digesting the ghee after drinking it, it will make him vomit. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.24.11	And because he’s harsh, he might have me executed. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.24.12	Let me take leave in advance.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.24.13	He then went to the King and said, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.25.1	“Sir, we doctors need to pull up roots and collect medicines at short notice. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.25.2	It would be good if you would give notice in the stables and at the gates: 
pli-tv-kd8:1.25.3	‘Jīvaka may ride on whatever animal he wishes, depart by whatever gate he desires, and he may come and go as he pleases.’” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.25.4	And the King did as Jīvaka had asked. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.25.6	At that time King Pajjota had a she-elephant called Bhaddavatikā, which could travel 650 kilometers in a day. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.25.7	After bringing the ghee to the King 
pli-tv-kd8:1.25.9	and having him drink it, Jīvaka went to the elephant stables and fled the city on Bhaddavatikā. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.26.1	Soon afterwards, while King Pajjota was digesting that ghee, he vomited. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.26.2	He said to his men, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.26.3	“That scoundrel Jīvaka made me drink ghee. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.26.4	Find out where he is.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.26.5	“Sir, he’s fled the city on Bhaddavatikā.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.26.6	At that time King Pajjota had a slave called Kāka, whose mother was a spirit and who could travel 780 kilometers in a day. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.26.7	The King told Kāka, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.26.8	“Go, Kāka, and make Jīvaka come back. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.26.9	Tell him that the King is asking him to return. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.26.10	These doctors, Kāka, are full of tricks. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.26.11	Don’t receive anything from him.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.27.1	Kāka caught up with Jīvaka at Kosambī, while he was still on his way and having breakfast. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.27.2	Kāka said, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.27.3	“Doctor, the King is having you return.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.27.4	“Wait, Kāka, until I’ve finished eating. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.27.5	Why don’t you have something to eat?” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.27.6	“There’s no need. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.27.7	The King told me that doctors are full of tricks and that I shouldn’t receive anything from you.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.27.8	Jīvaka then removed the medicinal part of an emblic myrobalan fruit with his nail, before eating it and drinking water. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.27.9	And he said to Kāka, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.27.10	“Here, Kāka, have some emblic myrobalan and water to drink.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.28.1	Kāka thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.28.2	“The doctor is eating and drinking it. It’s unlikely to be anything bad.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.28.3	So he ate half a fruit and drank water. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.28.4	When he had eaten it, he vomited right there. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.28.5	He asked Jīvaka, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.28.6	“Will I live?” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.28.7	“Don’t be afraid, Kāka. Both you and the King will be well. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.28.8	But the King is harsh and might have me executed. Because of that I won’t return.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.28.9	After handing back the she-elephant Bhaddavatikā to Kāka, he continued on to Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.28.10	When he eventually arrived, he went to King Bimbisāra and told him what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.28.11	The King said, “It’s good, Jīvaka, that you didn’t return. That King is harsh and might even have had you executed.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.29.1	When King Pajjota was cured, he sent a message to Jīvaka: 
pli-tv-kd8:1.29.2	“Come, Jīvaka, I wish to give you a gift.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.29.3	He replied, “There’s no need, sir; please just remember my act of service.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.29.4.0	7. The account of the two valuable cloths 
pli-tv-kd8:1.29.4.1	Soon afterwards King Pajjota obtained two valuable cloths, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.29.5	extremely exquisite and fine—they were one in a million. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.29.6	The King sent them to Jīvaka. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.29.7	Jīvaka considered this and thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.29.10	“No-one is worthy of these except the Buddha, the Perfected and fully Awakened One, or King Bimbisāra.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.30.0	8. The account of the thirty purgings 
pli-tv-kd8:1.30.1	On one occasion the Buddha’s body became full of impurities. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.30.2	He said to Venerable Ānanda, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.30.3	“Ānanda, my body is full of impurities. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.30.4	I wish to take a purgative.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.30.5	Ānanda went to Jīvaka and told him what the Buddha had said. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.30.8	And Jīvaka replied, “Well then, Venerable Ānanda, oil the Buddha’s body for a few days.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.30.9	After doing as instructed, Ānanda returned to Jīvaka to let him know, adding, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.30.11	“Please continue the treatment.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.31.1	Jīvaka thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.31.2	“It would not be appropriate for me to give the Buddha a powerful purgative.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.31.3	He then prepared three handfuls of lotus flowers with a variety of medicines, approached the Buddha, and gave him one handful, saying, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.31.4	“Venerable Sir, please smell the first handful. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.31.5	This will purge you ten times.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.31.6	He then brought him the second 
pli-tv-kd8:1.31.9	and the third handful, repeating his instruction, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.31.12	adding, “In this way you’ll have thirty purgings.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.31.13	After giving the Buddha thirty purgings, he bowed down, circumambulated him with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.32.1	When he was outside the gateway, Jīvaka thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.32.2	“I have given thirty purgings to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.32.3	for the his body is full of impurities. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.32.4	But he will only be purged twenty-nine times. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.32.5	After being purged, he will take a bath, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.32.6	and when he’s bathed, he will be purged once. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.32.7	In this way there will be exactly thirty purgings for the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.32.8	The Buddha read Jīvaka’s mind. He told Ānanda about it, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.32.16	adding, “Well then, Ānanda, prepare hot water.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.32.17	Ānanda consented and did so. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.33.1	Jīvaka then went back to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.33.2	and asked, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.33.3	“Sir, are you purged?” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.33.4	“I am, Jīvaka.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.33.5	Jīvaka then told him what he had thought outside the gateway, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.33.12	adding, “Please bathe.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.33.13	The Buddha had a hot bath. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.33.14	When he had bathed, the Buddha was purged once, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.33.15	in total adding up to thirty purgings. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.33.16	And Jīvaka said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.33.17	“Sir, until your body is back to normal, please don’t take any mung-bean broth.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.33.18.0	9. The account of asking for a favor 
pli-tv-kd8:1.33.18.1	Soon the Buddha’s body was back to normal. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.34.1	Jīvaka then took those two valuable cloths and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.34.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.34.3	“Venerable Sir, I wish to ask for a favor.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.34.4	“Buddhas don’t grant favors, Jīvaka.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.34.5	“It’s allowable and blameless.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.34.6	“Well then, please say what it is.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.34.7	“The Buddha and the Sangha of monks are rag-robe wearers. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.34.8	But I’ve received these two valuable cloths from King Pajjota 
pli-tv-kd8:1.34.9	that are extremely exquisite and fine—they are one in a million. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.34.10	Please accept them from me 
pli-tv-kd8:1.34.11	and please allow the Sangha of monks to use robe-cloth given by householders.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.34.12	The Buddha received the two valuable cloths. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.34.13	He then instructed, inspired, and gladdened Jīvaka with a teaching, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.34.14	after which Jīvaka got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.35.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd8:1.35.2	“Monks, I allow you to use robe-cloth given by householders. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.35.3	Anyone who wishes may wear rag-robes 
pli-tv-kd8:1.35.4	and anyone who wishes may accept robe-cloth from householders. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.35.5	But I praise contentment with whatever sort you use.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.35.6	The people of Rājagaha heard 
pli-tv-kd8:1.35.7	that the Buddha had allowed the monks to use robe-cloth given by householders. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.35.8	They were excited and joyful, thinking, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.35.9	“Now we’ll give gifts and make merit.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.35.10	In just a single day many thousands of robes were given at Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.35.11	And the same thing happened in the countryside. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.36.1	A fleecy robe was given to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.36.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd8:1.36.3	“I allow fleecy robes.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.36.4	And a silken fleecy robe was given. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.36.6	“I allow silken fleecy robes.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.36.7	And a woolen fleecy robe was given. 
pli-tv-kd8:1.36.9	“I allow woolen fleecy robes.” 
pli-tv-kd8:1.36.10	The first section for recitation is finished. 
pli-tv-kd8:2.1.0	10. Discussion on the allowance for wool 
pli-tv-kd8:2.1.1	On one occasion the King of Kāsī sent a valuable, woolen Kāsī-cloth to Jīvaka. 
pli-tv-kd8:2.1.2	Jīvaka took the cloth and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd8:2.1.3	and told him what had happened, 
pli-tv-kd8:2.1.5	adding, “Sir, please accept the woolen cloth for my long-lasting benefit and happiness.” 
pli-tv-kd8:2.1.6	The Buddha received the woolen cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:2.1.7	He then instructed, inspired, and gladdened Jīvaka with a teaching, 
pli-tv-kd8:2.1.8	after which Jīvaka got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd8:2.1.9	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd8:2.1.10	“I allow wool.” 
pli-tv-kd8:3.1.1	At that time various kinds of robe-cloth were given to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd8:3.1.2	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:3.1.3	“What kinds of robe-cloth has the Buddha allowed and what has he not allowed?” 
pli-tv-kd8:3.1.4	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd8:3.1.5	“I allow six kinds of robe-cloth: 
pli-tv-kd8:3.1.6	linen, cotton, silk, wool, sunn hemp, and hemp.” 
pli-tv-kd8:3.2.1	Soon afterwards the monks thought, “The Buddha has only allowed one kind of robe, not two,” 
pli-tv-kd8:3.2.2	and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept rags after receiving robe-cloth from householders. 
pli-tv-kd8:3.2.4	“I allow you to accept rags after receiving robe-cloth from a householder. 
pli-tv-kd8:3.2.5	But I praise contentment with both of them.” 
pli-tv-kd8:4.1.0	11. Discussion on searching for rags 
pli-tv-kd8:4.1.1	On one occasion a number of monks were traveling in the Kosalan country. 
pli-tv-kd8:4.1.2	Some of the monks entered a charnel ground to look for rags, while the others walked on. 
pli-tv-kd8:4.1.3	The former monks got hold of rags 
pli-tv-kd8:4.1.4	and the others said, 
pli-tv-kd8:4.1.5	“Please give us a share.” 
pli-tv-kd8:4.1.7	“But why didn’t you wait, then? 
pli-tv-kd8:4.1.8	We won’t give you a share.” 
pli-tv-kd8:4.1.9	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd8:4.1.10	“If you’re unwilling, I allow you not to give a share to those who don’t wait.” 
pli-tv-kd8:4.2.1	On another occasion a number of monks were traveling in the Kosalan country. 
pli-tv-kd8:4.2.2	Some of the monks entered a charnel ground to look for rags, while the others waited. 
pli-tv-kd8:4.2.3	The former monks got hold of rags 
pli-tv-kd8:4.2.4	and the others said, 
pli-tv-kd8:4.2.5	“Please give us a share.” 
pli-tv-kd8:4.2.7	“But why didn’t you come with us, then? 
pli-tv-kd8:4.2.8	We won’t give you a share.” 
pli-tv-kd8:4.2.10	“Even if you’re unwilling, you should give a share to those who wait.” 
pli-tv-kd8:4.3.1	On yet another occasion a number of monks were traveling in the Kosalan country. 
pli-tv-kd8:4.3.2	Some of the monks entered a charnel ground to look for rags first, while the other monks entered afterwards. 
pli-tv-kd8:4.3.3	Those who entered first got hold of rags, 
pli-tv-kd8:4.3.4	but not those who entered afterwards. 
pli-tv-kd8:4.3.5	The latter monks said, 
pli-tv-kd8:4.3.6	“Please give us a share.” 
pli-tv-kd8:4.3.8	“But why, then, did you come in afterwards? 
pli-tv-kd8:4.3.9	We won’t give you a share.” 
pli-tv-kd8:4.3.11	“If you’re unwilling, I allow you not to give a share to those who enter afterwards.” 
pli-tv-kd8:4.4.1	On yet another occasion a number of monks were traveling in the Kosalan country. 
pli-tv-kd8:4.4.2	They all entered a charnel ground together to look for rags. 
pli-tv-kd8:4.4.3	Some of them got hold of rags, while others did not. 
pli-tv-kd8:4.4.4	The latter monks said, 
pli-tv-kd8:4.4.5	“Please give us a share.” 
pli-tv-kd8:4.4.7	“But why didn’t you get any? 
pli-tv-kd8:4.4.8	We won’t give you a share.” 
pli-tv-kd8:4.4.10	“Even if you’re unwilling, you should give a share to those who enter together with you.” 
pli-tv-kd8:4.5.1	On yet another occasion a number of monks were traveling in the Kosalan country. 
pli-tv-kd8:4.5.2	They entered a charnel ground together to look for rags, after making an agreement to share. 
pli-tv-kd8:4.5.3	Some of them got hold of rags, while others did not. 
pli-tv-kd8:4.5.4	The latter monks said, 
pli-tv-kd8:4.5.5	“Please give us a share.” 
pli-tv-kd8:4.5.7	“But why didn’t you get any? 
pli-tv-kd8:4.5.8	We won’t give you a share.” 
pli-tv-kd8:4.5.10	“Even if you’re unwilling, if you have made an agreement about it, you should give a share to those who enter.” 
pli-tv-kd8:5.1.0	12. Discussion on the appointment of a receiver of robe-cloth 
pli-tv-kd8:5.1.1	At that time people brought robe-cloth to the monastery, 
pli-tv-kd8:5.1.2	but not finding anyone to receive it, they took it back. 
pli-tv-kd8:5.1.3	As a result, only a little robe-cloth was given at that monastery. 
pli-tv-kd8:5.1.4	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd8:5.1.5	“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the receiver of robe-cloth: 
pli-tv-kd8:5.1.6	he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows what has and has not been received. 
pli-tv-kd8:5.2.1	And this is how he should be appointed. 
pli-tv-kd8:5.2.2	First a monk should be asked, 
pli-tv-kd8:5.2.3	and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd8:5.2.4	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd8:5.2.5	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should appoint monk so-and-so as the receiver of robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:5.2.6	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd8:5.2.7	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd8:5.2.8	The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as the receiver of robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:5.2.9	Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as the receiver of robe-cloth should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd8:5.2.10	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd8:5.2.11	The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as the receiver of robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:5.2.12	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd8:6.1.1	Soon afterwards, after receiving cloth, the receivers of robe-cloth left it right there and went away. 
pli-tv-kd8:6.1.2	The robe-cloth was lost. 
pli-tv-kd8:6.1.4	“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the storer of robe-cloth: 
pli-tv-kd8:6.1.5	he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows what is and is not stored. 
pli-tv-kd8:6.2.1	And this is how he should be appointed. 
pli-tv-kd8:6.2.2	First a monk should be asked, 
pli-tv-kd8:6.2.3	and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd8:6.2.4	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd8:6.2.5	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should appoint monk so-and-so as the storer of robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:6.2.6	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd8:6.2.7	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd8:6.2.8	The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as the storer of robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:6.2.9	Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as the storer of robe-cloth should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd8:6.2.10	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd8:6.2.11	The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as the storer of robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:6.2.12	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd8:7.1.0	13. Discussion on the designation of a storeroom, etc. 
pli-tv-kd8:7.1.1	Soon afterwards the monk who was the storer of robe-cloth stored it under a roof-cover, at the foot of a tree, and under the eaves of a building. Rats and termites ate it. 
pli-tv-kd8:7.1.3	“I allow you to designate a dwelling, a stilt house, or a cave as a storeroom. 
pli-tv-kd8:7.2.1	And this is how it should be designated. 
pli-tv-kd8:7.2.2	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd8:7.2.3	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd8:7.2.4	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should designate such-and-such a dwelling as a storeroom. 
pli-tv-kd8:7.2.5	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd8:7.2.6	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd8:7.2.7	The Sangha designates such-and-such a dwelling as a storeroom. 
pli-tv-kd8:7.2.8	Any monk who approves of designating such-and-such a dwelling as a storeroom should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd8:7.2.9	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd8:7.2.10	The Sangha has designated such-and-such a dwelling as a storeroom. 
pli-tv-kd8:7.2.11	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd8:8.1.1	At that time the robe-cloth in the Sangha’s storeroom was not looked after. 
pli-tv-kd8:8.1.3	“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the storeman: he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows what is and is not protected. 
pli-tv-kd8:8.1.4	And this is how he should be appointed. 
pli-tv-kd8:8.1.5	First a monk should be asked, 
pli-tv-kd8:8.1.6	and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd8:8.1.7	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd8:8.1.8	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should appoint monk so-and-so as the storeman. 
pli-tv-kd8:8.1.9	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd8:8.1.10	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd8:8.1.11	The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as the storeman. 
pli-tv-kd8:8.1.12	Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as the storeman should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd8:8.1.13	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd8:8.1.14	The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as the storeman. 
pli-tv-kd8:8.1.15	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd8:8.2.1	Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six dismissed the storeman. 
pli-tv-kd8:8.2.3	“You should not dismiss the storeman. 
pli-tv-kd8:8.2.4	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd8:9.1.1	At one time there was much robe-cloth in the Sangha’s storeroom. 
pli-tv-kd8:9.1.3	“You should share it out in the presence of the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-kd8:9.1.4	Soon afterwards there was a racket as the Sangha was sharing out the robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:9.1.6	“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the distributor of robe-cloth: 
pli-tv-kd8:9.1.7	he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows what has and has not been distributed. 
pli-tv-kd8:9.1.8	And this is how he should be appointed. 
pli-tv-kd8:9.1.9	First a monk should be asked, 
pli-tv-kd8:9.1.10	and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd8:9.1.11	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd8:9.1.12	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should appoint monk so-and-so as the distributor of robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:9.1.13	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd8:9.1.14	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd8:9.1.15	The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as the distributor of robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:9.1.16	Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as the distributor of robe-cloth should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd8:9.1.17	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd8:9.1.18	The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as the distributor of robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:9.1.19	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd8:9.2.1	The monks who were distributors of robe-cloth thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:9.2.2	“How should we distribute the robe-cloth?” 
pli-tv-kd8:9.2.4	“You should first sort the cloth, then estimate its value, followed by making portions of equal value, counting the monks, gathering the monks into groups, and finally fixing the shares of robe-cloth.” 
pli-tv-kd8:9.2.5	And the monks who were distributors of robe-cloth thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:9.2.6	“What share of the robe-cloth should we give to the novices?” 
pli-tv-kd8:9.2.8	“I allow you to give half a share to the novices.” 
pli-tv-kd8:9.3.1	On one occasion a monk wanted to take his own share and leave. 
pli-tv-kd8:9.3.3	“You should give a share to one who is leaving.” 
pli-tv-kd8:9.3.4	On another occasion a monk wanted to take an extra share and leave. 
pli-tv-kd8:9.3.6	“I allow you to give an extra share to anyone who gives something in return.” 
pli-tv-kd8:9.4.1	And the distributors of robe-cloth thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:9.4.2	“How should we give out the shares of robe-cloth? According to the order in which the monks have arrived or according to seniority?” 
pli-tv-kd8:9.4.4	“You should share out the remainder and then give it out by drawing lots.” 
pli-tv-kd8:10.1.0	14. Discussion on the dyeing of robes 
pli-tv-kd8:10.1.1	At that time the monks dyed the robes even with dung and beige clay. 
pli-tv-kd8:10.1.2	The robes were discolored. 
pli-tv-kd8:10.1.4	“I allow you to use six kinds of dye: 
pli-tv-kd8:10.1.5	dye from roots, dye from wood, dye from bark, dye from leaves, dye from flowers, and dye from fruit.” 
pli-tv-kd8:10.2.1	At that time the monks dyed the robes in cold water. 
pli-tv-kd8:10.2.2	The robes became smelly. 
pli-tv-kd8:10.2.4	“I allow a dye-pot to boil the dye.” 
pli-tv-kd8:10.2.5	The dye overflowed. 
pli-tv-kd8:10.2.7	“I allow you to fix a collar.” 
pli-tv-kd8:10.2.8	The monks did not know whether the dye was ready or not. 
pli-tv-kd8:10.2.10	“You should put a drop in water or on the back of your nail.” 
pli-tv-kd8:10.3.1	To remove the dye, the monks turned the pot. 
pli-tv-kd8:10.3.2	The pot broke. 
pli-tv-kd8:10.3.4	“I allow a dye-ladle, with or without handle.” 
pli-tv-kd8:10.3.5	The monks did not have a vessel for the dye. 
pli-tv-kd8:10.3.7	“I allow a basin for dye, a waterpot for dye.” 
pli-tv-kd8:10.3.8	The monks were kneading the robes in basins and bowls. 
pli-tv-kd8:10.3.9	The robes split. 
pli-tv-kd8:10.3.11	“I allow a dyeing trough.” 
pli-tv-kd8:11.1.1	At that time the monks spread the robes on the ground. 
pli-tv-kd8:11.1.2	The robes became dirty. 
pli-tv-kd8:11.1.4	“I allow a straw mat.” 
pli-tv-kd8:11.1.5	The straw mat was eaten by termites. 
pli-tv-kd8:11.1.7	“I allow a bamboo robe-rack and a clothesline.” 
pli-tv-kd8:11.1.8	They hung up the robes by the middle. 
pli-tv-kd8:11.1.9	The dye dripped from both sides. 
pli-tv-kd8:11.1.11	“You should fasten it at the corners.” 
pli-tv-kd8:11.1.12	The corners became worn. 
pli-tv-kd8:11.1.14	“I allow you thread for the corners.” 
pli-tv-kd8:11.1.15	The dye dripped from one side. 
pli-tv-kd8:11.1.17	“You should dye it by repeatedly turning it over, and you should not go away while it’s still dripping.” 
pli-tv-kd8:11.2.1	The robes were stiff. 
pli-tv-kd8:11.2.3	“You should rinse it in water.” 
pli-tv-kd8:11.2.4	The robes were rough. 
pli-tv-kd8:11.2.6	“You should beat it with your hands.” 
pli-tv-kd8:11.2.7	At that time the monks wore robes consisting of a single piece of cloth, the color of ivory. 
pli-tv-kd8:11.2.8	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd8:11.2.9	“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd8:11.2.10	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd8:11.2.11	“You should not wear robes made consisting of a single piece of cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:11.2.12	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd8:12.1.0	15. The instruction on robes made of pieces 
pli-tv-kd8:12.1.1	After staying at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward the southern hills. 
pli-tv-kd8:12.1.2	He saw the fields of Magadha laid out in rectangles defined by long and short boundaries and their intersections. He said to Venerable Ānanda, 
pli-tv-kd8:12.1.3	“Ānanda, have a look at these fields.” 
pli-tv-kd8:12.1.4	“Yes, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd8:12.1.5	“Are you able to make this kind of robe for the monks?” 
pli-tv-kd8:12.1.6	“I am.” 
pli-tv-kd8:12.1.7	After staying in the southern hills for as long as he liked, the Buddha returned to Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd8:12.1.8	Ānanda then made robes for a number of monks. He went to the Buddha and said, 
pli-tv-kd8:12.1.9	“Venerable Sir, please have a look at the robes I’ve made.” 
pli-tv-kd8:12.2.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd8:12.2.2	“Ānanda is clever. He understands the detailed meaning of what I have spoken in brief. 
pli-tv-kd8:12.2.3	He can make long inter-panel strips, short inter-panel strips, large panels, medium-sized panels, middle sections, intermediate sections, a strengthening piece for the neck, a strengthening piece for the calves, and outer sections. In this way the robe will be made of pieces, making it worthless, making it appropriate for monastics, making it undesirable for one’s enemies. 
pli-tv-kd8:12.2.4	Your outer robe should be made of pieces and so should your upper robe and sarong.” 
pli-tv-kd8:13.1.0	16. The instruction on three robes 
pli-tv-kd8:13.1.1	After staying at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward Vesālī. 
pli-tv-kd8:13.1.2	On the road between Rājagaha and Vesālī the Buddha saw a number of monks walking along, loaded up with robes on their heads, shoulders, and hips. He thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:13.1.3	“These foolish men have turned to an abundance in robes too readily. 
pli-tv-kd8:13.1.4	Let me set a limit on robes for the monks.” 
pli-tv-kd8:13.2.1	Wandering on, the Buddha eventually arrived at Vesālī, where he stayed at the Gotamaka Shrine. 
pli-tv-kd8:13.2.2	At that time it was midwinter, when the days are cold and the snow is falling. The Buddha sat outside at night without being cold, wearing only one robe. He was fine. 
pli-tv-kd8:13.2.3	Becoming cold at the end of the first part of the night, he put on a second robe. 
pli-tv-kd8:13.2.4	Becoming cold once again at the end of the middle part of the night, he put on a third robe. 
pli-tv-kd8:13.2.5	At the end of the last part of the night, when the sky was flaring up at dawn, he became cold once more. Putting on a fourth robe, he was fine. 
pli-tv-kd8:13.3.1	He thought, “Even those on this spiritual path who come from good families, who are sensitive to the cold and fear the cold, are able to get by with three robes. 
pli-tv-kd8:13.3.2	Let me set a limit on robes for the monks; let me allow them three robes.” 
pli-tv-kd8:13.3.3	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks. 
pli-tv-kd8:13.4.1	He told them what had happened 
pli-tv-kd8:13.5.5	and what he had thought, adding: 
pli-tv-kd8:13.5.8	“I allow you three robes: a double-layered outer robe, a single-layered upper robe, and a single-layered sarong.” 
pli-tv-kd8:13.6.0	17. Discussion on extra robes 
pli-tv-kd8:13.6.1	When they knew that the Buddha had allowed three robes, 
pli-tv-kd8:13.6.2	the monks from the group of six entered the village in one set of three, stayed in the monastery in another set, and went bathing in yet another set. 
pli-tv-kd8:13.6.3	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd8:13.6.4	“How can the monks from the group of six keep extra robes?” 
pli-tv-kd8:13.6.5	And they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd8:13.6.6	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd8:13.6.7	“You should not keep extra robes. 
pli-tv-kd8:13.6.8	If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule.” 
pli-tv-kd8:13.7.1	Soon afterwards Venerable Ānanda was given an extra robe. 
pli-tv-kd8:13.7.2	He wanted to give it to Venerable Sāriputta 
pli-tv-kd8:13.7.3	who was staying at Sāketa. 
pli-tv-kd8:13.7.5	Knowing that the Buddha had laid down a rule against having an extra robe, he thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:13.7.10	“What should I do in this situation?” 
pli-tv-kd8:13.7.11	He told the Buddha, who said, 
pli-tv-kd8:13.7.12	“How long is it, Ānanda, before Sāriputta returns?” 
pli-tv-kd8:13.7.13	“Nine or ten days.” 
pli-tv-kd8:13.7.14	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd8:13.7.15	“You should keep an extra robe for ten days at the most.” 
pli-tv-kd8:13.8.1	Soon afterwards the monks were given an extra robe. 
pli-tv-kd8:13.8.3	Not knowing what to do with it, 
pli-tv-kd8:13.8.4	they told the Buddha, and he said, 
pli-tv-kd8:13.8.5	“I allow you to transfer extra robes to another.” 
pli-tv-kd8:14.1.1	After staying at Vesālī for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward Benares. 
pli-tv-kd8:14.1.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd8:14.1.3	he stayed in the deer park at Isipattana. 
pli-tv-kd8:14.1.4	On that occasion the sarong of a certain monk had a tear. 
pli-tv-kd8:14.1.5	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:14.1.6	“The Buddha has allowed three robes: 
pli-tv-kd8:14.1.7	a double-layered outer robe, a single-layered upper robe, and a single-layered sarong. 
pli-tv-kd8:14.1.8	Since my sarong has a tear, 
pli-tv-kd8:14.1.9	let me add a patch. It will have a double layer of cloth on all sides, but only a single layer in the middle.” 
pli-tv-kd8:14.2.1	And he did so. 
pli-tv-kd8:14.2.2	Just then the Buddha was walking about the dwellings and he saw that monk patching his robe. He went up to that monk and said, 
pli-tv-kd8:14.2.3	“What are you doing, monk?” 
pli-tv-kd8:14.2.4	“I’m patching my robe, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd8:14.2.5	“Well done. 
pli-tv-kd8:14.2.6	It’s good that you are patching your robe.” 
pli-tv-kd8:14.2.7	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd8:14.2.8	“When the cloth is new or nearly new, I allow a double-layered outer robe, a single-layered upper robe, and a single-layered sarong. 
pli-tv-kd8:14.2.9	When the cloth is worn, I allow an outer robe of four layers, a double-layered upper robe, and a double-layered sarong. 
pli-tv-kd8:14.2.10	With rags, you may have as much as you like. 
pli-tv-kd8:14.2.11	With scraps of cloth from a shop, you should search for them. 
pli-tv-kd8:14.2.12	And I allow patches, mending, hems, strips of cloth for marking, and strengthening.” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.1.0	18. The account of Visākhā 
pli-tv-kd8:15.1.1	After staying at Benares for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.1.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-kd8:15.1.3	he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.1.4	Soon afterwards Visākhā Migāramātā went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.1.5	When the Buddha had instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching, 
pli-tv-kd8:15.1.6	Visākhā said, 
pli-tv-kd8:15.1.7	“Please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.1.8	The Buddha consented by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.1.9	Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Visākhā got up from her seat, bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.2.1	The following morning it was pouring down from a great storm extending over the four continents. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.2.2	The Buddha said to the monks, 
pli-tv-kd8:15.2.3	“It rains on the four continents just as it rains here in the Jeta Grove. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.2.4	Bathe in the rain, monks, 
pli-tv-kd8:15.2.5	this is the last great storm of this kind.” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.2.6	Saying, “Yes, Sir,” they took off their robes and bathed in the rain. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.3.1	When Visākhā had had various kinds of fine food prepared, she told a slave, 
pli-tv-kd8:15.3.2	“Go to the monastery and tell the Buddha that the meal is ready.” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.3.3	Saying, “Yes, Lady,” she went to the monastery. When she got there, she saw the monks bathing naked in the rain. She thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:15.3.4	“There are no monks in the monastery, just Ājīvaka ascetics bathing in the rain.” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.3.5	She then returned to Visākhā and told her what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.3.7	But being wise and discerning, Visākhā thought, “No doubt the venerables are bathing naked in the rain. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.3.8	It’s only because of her ignorance that she thinks as she does.” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.3.9	So she sent the slave back to the monastery with the same instructions. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.4.1	When the monks had cooled their bodies and felt invigorated, they took their robes and entered their dwellings. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.4.2	When the slave arrived, she didn’t see any monks. She thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:15.4.3	“There are no monks in the monastery; it’s empty,” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.4.4	and she returned to Visākhā and told her what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.4.6	Once again Visākhā realized what was going on 
pli-tv-kd8:15.4.9	and she told the slave to return to the monastery one more time. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.5.1	When the message had been delivered, the Buddha said to the monks, 
pli-tv-kd8:15.5.2	“Get your bowls and robes; it’s time for the meal.” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.5.3	“Yes, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.5.4	The Buddha robed up and took his bowl and robe. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.5.5	Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch his arm, so too the Buddha disappeared from the Jeta Grove and appeared at Visākhā’s gateway. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.5.6	And he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.6.1	Visākhā thought, “The power and might of the Buddha are truly amazing. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.6.2	The water is flowing knee-deep, even waist-deep, yet not a single monk has wet feet or wet robes.” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.6.3	Delighted and joyful, she personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, she sat down to one side 
pli-tv-kd8:15.6.4	and said, 
pli-tv-kd8:15.6.5	“Venerable Sir, I wish to ask for eight favors.” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.6.6	“Buddhas don’t grant favors, Visākhā.” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.6.7	“It’s allowable and blameless.” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.6.8	“Well then, please say what it is.” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.7.1	“For as long as I live I wish to give rainy-season robes to the Sangha, and I wish to give meals to the newly arrived and departing monastics, as well as to those who are sick and those nursing the sick. I also wish to give medicines to the sick, a regular supply of rice porridge, as well as bathing robes to the nuns.” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.7.2	“But, Visākhā, what reason do you have for asking me for these eight favors?” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.7.3	Visākhā then told the Buddha what had happened to her slave, 
pli-tv-kd8:15.7.9	adding, “Nakedness is gross, disgusting, and repulsive. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.7.10	This is the reason I wish to give rainy-season robes to the Sangha for as long as I live. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.8.1	Also, not knowing the streets or where to go for almsfood, newly arrived monks will get exhausted while walking for alms. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.8.2	After eating a meal for newly arrived monks from me, they will get to know the streets and where to go for almsfood, and they won’t get exhausted while walking for alms. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.8.3	This is the reason I wish to give meals to the newly arrived monks for as long as I live. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.8.4	Also, in trying to get a meal, departing monks may bother the Teacher, or they may arrive late at their destination. Or, if they go without eating, they will be weak while traveling. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.8.5	After eating a meal for departing monks from me, they won’t bother the Teacher, they will arrive at their destination at an appropriate time, and they won’t be weak while traveling. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.8.6	This is the reason I wish to give meals to the departing monks for as long as I live. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.9.1	Also, if sick monks don’t get suitable food, their illness may get worse or they may die. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.9.2	But when they have eaten a meal for the sick from me, their illness won’t get worse and they won’t die. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.9.3	This is the reason I wish to give meals to the sick monks for as long as I live. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.9.4	Also, if the monks who nurse the sick have to get their own meals, they will only be able to bring back meals for the sick after midday, and the sick won’t be able to eat. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.9.5	But when they have eaten a meal for those nursing the sick from me, they will be able to bring back meals for the sick in good time, and the sick will be able to eat. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.9.6	This is the reason I wish to give meals to those monks who nurse the sick for as long as I live. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.10.1	Also, if the sick monks don’t get suitable medicines, their illness may get worse or they may die. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.10.2	But when they have taken medicine from me, their illness won’t get worse and they won’t die. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.10.3	This is the reason I wish to give medicine to the Sangha for as long as I live. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.10.4	Also, while staying at Andhakavinda, the Buddha allowed rice porridge, seeing ten benefits in it. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.10.5	This is the reason I wish to give a regular supply of rice porridge to the Sangha for as long as I live. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.11.1	On one occasion, Sir, nuns were bathing naked at a ford in the river Aciravatī together with prostitutes. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.11.2	The prostitutes made fun of them, 
pli-tv-kd8:15.11.3	‘Venerables, why practice the spiritual life while you’re young? Why not enjoy worldly pleasures? 
pli-tv-kd8:15.11.4	When you’re old, then you can practice the spiritual life. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.11.5	In this way you’ll get the benefits of both.’ 
pli-tv-kd8:15.11.6	Being poked fun at by the prostitutes, the nuns were humiliated. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.11.7	Nakedness in women is gross, disgusting, and repulsive. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.11.8	This is the reason I wish to give bathing robes to the Sangha of nuns for as long as I live.” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.12.1	“But, Visākhā, what benefit do you see that you ask me for these eight favors?” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.12.2	“Monks who have completed the rainy-season residence in the various districts will come to Sāvatthī to visit the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.12.3	If a monk has died, 
pli-tv-kd8:15.12.4	they will ask you about his destination, 
pli-tv-kd8:15.12.5	and you will tell them whether he’s reached the fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of non-returning, or perfection. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.12.6	I’ll then ask those monks 
pli-tv-kd8:15.12.7	whether that dead monk had previously visited Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.13.1	If they say he had, 
pli-tv-kd8:15.13.2	I may conclude, 
pli-tv-kd8:15.13.3	‘No doubt that Venerable will have enjoyed a rainy-season robe supplied by me; or he will have enjoyed a meal for newly arrived monks, a meal for departing monks, a meal for sick monks, a meal for those nursing the sick, medicines, or a regular supply of rice porridge—all given by me.’ 
pli-tv-kd8:15.13.4	When I recall that, I will feel glad. The gladness will give rise to joy, and the mental joy will make my body tranquil. When my body is tranquil, I will feel bliss. And when I feel bliss, my mind will be stilled. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.13.5	In this way I will develop the spiritual faculties, the spiritual powers, and the factors of awakening. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.13.6	It’s because of this benefit that I ask for these eight favors.” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.14.1	“Well said, Visākhā. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.14.2	It’s good that you ask me for these eight favors for the sake of this benefit. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.14.3	I grant you these eight favors.” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.14.4	And the Buddha expressed his appreciation to Visākhā with these verses: 
pli-tv-kd8:15.14.5	“Rejoicing in giving food and drink, 
pli-tv-kd8:15.14.6	A virtuous disciple of the Accomplished One, 
pli-tv-kd8:15.14.7	Overcoming stinginess, gives a gift—
pli-tv-kd8:15.14.8	That leads to heaven, eliminates sadness, and brings bliss. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.14.9	By means of the stainless path, 
pli-tv-kd8:15.14.10	She obtains heaven and long life. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.14.11	Desiring merit, happy and healthy, 
pli-tv-kd8:15.14.12	She rejoices in heaven for a long time.” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.14.13	When the Buddha had expressed his appreciation, he got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-kd8:15.15.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd8:15.15.2	“I allow a rainy-season robe, meals for newly arrived monastics, meals for departing monastics, meals for the sick, meals for those nursing the sick, medicine for the sick, a regular supply of rice porridge, and bathing robes for the Sangha of nuns.” 
pli-tv-kd8:15.15.3	The section for recitation on Visākhā is finished. 
pli-tv-kd8:16.1.0	19. The allowance for a sitting mat 
pli-tv-kd8:16.1.1	At one time after the monks had eaten fine food, they went to sleep absentminded and heedless. 
pli-tv-kd8:16.1.2	They emitted semen while dreaming and the furniture was soiled. 
pli-tv-kd8:16.1.3	Soon afterwards the Buddha was walking about the dwellings with Venerable Ānanda as his attendant. Seeing that soiled furniture, he asked Ānanda what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd8:16.1.5	Ānanda told him, 
pli-tv-kd8:16.2.1	and the Buddha said, “That’s how it is, Ānanda. 
pli-tv-kd8:16.2.2	For one who goes to sleep absentminded and heedless, semen is emitted while dreaming. 
pli-tv-kd8:16.2.3	But for those monks who fall asleep mindful and heedful, this doesn’t happen. 
pli-tv-kd8:16.2.4	Nor does it for ordinary people without sensual desire. 
pli-tv-kd8:16.2.5	And, Ānanda, it’s impossible for a perfected one to emit semen.” 
pli-tv-kd8:16.2.6	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd8:16.2.7	telling them what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd8:16.2.13	He then said, 
pli-tv-kd8:16.3.1	“There are these five disadvantages in going to sleep absentminded and heedless: 
pli-tv-kd8:16.3.2	you don’t sleep well; you wake up feeling miserable; you have nightmares; the gods don’t guard you; and you emit semen. 
pli-tv-kd8:16.3.4	And there are these five benefits in going to sleep mindful and heedful: 
pli-tv-kd8:16.3.5	you sleep well; you wake up feeling good; you don’t have nightmares; the gods guard you; and you don’t emit semen. 
pli-tv-kd8:16.3.7	And, monks, I allow a sitting mat to protect the body, to protect the robes, and to protect the furniture.” 
pli-tv-kd8:16.4.1	But the sitting mat was too small. It did not provide a full protection. 
pli-tv-kd8:16.4.3	“I allow you to make a sheet as large as you like.” 
pli-tv-kd8:17.1.1	On one occasion Venerable Ānanda’s preceptor, Venerable Belaṭṭhasīsa, had carbuncles, 
pli-tv-kd8:17.1.2	and the pus caused his robes to stick to his body. 
pli-tv-kd8:17.1.3	To detach them, the monks kept on moistening his robes with water. 
pli-tv-kd8:17.1.4	As the Buddha was walking about the dwellings, he saw the monks doing this. He went up to them and said, 
pli-tv-kd8:17.1.5	“What illness does this monk have?” 
pli-tv-kd8:17.1.6	“He has carbuncles, Sir. 
pli-tv-kd8:17.1.8	That’s why we’re doing this.” 
pli-tv-kd8:17.1.9	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd8:17.1.10	“For anyone who has an itch, a boil, a running sore, or a carbuncle, I allow a itch-covering cloth.” 
pli-tv-kd8:18.1.1	On one occasion Visākhā took a handkerchief and went to the Buddha. She bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd8:18.1.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd8:18.1.3	“Venerable Sir, please accept this handkerchief for my long-lasting benefit and happiness.” 
pli-tv-kd8:18.1.4	The Buddha accepted it 
pli-tv-kd8:18.1.5	and then instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching. 
pli-tv-kd8:18.1.6	She got up from her seat, bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-kd8:18.1.7	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd8:18.1.8	“I allow handkerchiefs.” 
pli-tv-kd8:19.1.1	At that time Venerable Ānanda had a friend called Roja the Mallian. 
pli-tv-kd8:19.1.2	Roja had an old linen cloth that ended up in Ānanda’s hands, 
pli-tv-kd8:19.1.3	and it so happened that Ānanda needed such a cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:19.1.4	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd8:19.1.5	“I allow you to take things on trust from one who has five qualities: 
pli-tv-kd8:19.1.6	they are a friend, they are a close companion, they have spoken about it, they are alive, and you know they will be pleased if you take it.” 
pli-tv-kd8:20.1.1	At that time the monks had enough robes, 
pli-tv-kd8:20.1.2	but they needed water filters and bags. 
pli-tv-kd8:20.1.4	“I allow cloth for requisites.” 
pli-tv-kd8:20.2.0	20. Discussion of the smallest robe-cloth that can be transferred to another, etc. 
pli-tv-kd8:20.2.1	Soon afterwards the monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:20.2.2	“These things that have been allowed by the Buddha—the three robes, the rainy-season robe, the sitting mat, the sheet, the itch-covering cloth, the handkerchief, and the cloth for requisites—are they all to be determined or to be transferred to another?” 
pli-tv-kd8:20.2.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd8:20.2.4	“You should determine the three robes, not transfer them; 
pli-tv-kd8:20.2.5	you should determine the rainy-season robe for the four months of the rainy season and then transfer it; 
pli-tv-kd8:20.2.6	you should determine the sitting mat, not transfer it; 
pli-tv-kd8:20.2.7	you should determine the sheet, not transfer it; 
pli-tv-kd8:20.2.8	you should determine the itch-covering cloth for as long as you’re sick and then transfer it; 
pli-tv-kd8:20.2.9	you should determine the handkerchief, not transfer it; 
pli-tv-kd8:20.2.10	you should determine the cloth for requisites, not transfer it.” 
pli-tv-kd8:21.1.1	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:21.1.2	“What’s the size of the smallest robe-cloth that can be transferred to another?” 
pli-tv-kd8:21.1.4	“The smallest robe-cloth you should transfer is one that is eight standard fingerbreadths long and four wide.” 
pli-tv-kd8:21.1.5	At that time Venerable Mahākassapa’s rag robes were heavy. 
pli-tv-kd8:21.1.7	“I allow you to mend roughly with thread.” 
pli-tv-kd8:21.1.8	The corners became deformed. 
pli-tv-kd8:21.1.10	“You should fix up the deformity.” 
pli-tv-kd8:21.1.11	The cloth frayed. 
pli-tv-kd8:21.1.13	“I allow you to add a lengthwise border and a crosswise border.” 
pli-tv-kd8:21.1.14	On one occasion the panels of the upper robes were breaking up. 
pli-tv-kd8:21.1.16	“I allow you to darn.” 
pli-tv-kd8:21.2.1	At one time while making a set of three robes for a monk, there was not enough cloth to make all three out of pieces. 
pli-tv-kd8:21.2.3	“I allow two robes made of pieces and one that is not.” 
pli-tv-kd8:21.2.4	There was not enough cloth to make two out of pieces. 
pli-tv-kd8:21.2.6	“I allow one robe made of pieces and two that are not.” 
pli-tv-kd8:21.2.7	There was not enough cloth to make one out of pieces. 
pli-tv-kd8:21.2.9	“I allow you to add a further supply. 
pli-tv-kd8:21.2.10	But you should not wear robes none of which are cut into pieces. 
pli-tv-kd8:21.2.11	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd8:22.1.1	On one occasion a monk who had been given much robe-cloth 
pli-tv-kd8:22.1.2	wanted to give it to his mother and father. 
pli-tv-kd8:22.1.4	“When it’s given to one’s mother and father, what can I say? 
pli-tv-kd8:22.1.5	I allow you to give to your mother and father. 
pli-tv-kd8:22.1.6	But, monks, a gift of faith should not be ruined. 
pli-tv-kd8:22.1.7	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd8:23.1.1	On one occasion a monk left one of his robes in the Blind Men’s Grove and then went for alms in the village in just his sarong and upper robe. 
pli-tv-kd8:23.1.2	Thieves stole that robe 
pli-tv-kd8:23.1.3	and he became poorly dressed. 
pli-tv-kd8:23.1.4	When other monks asked him why, 
pli-tv-kd8:23.1.6	he told them what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd8:23.1.10	“You should not enter a village in just your sarong and upper robe. 
pli-tv-kd8:23.1.11	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd8:23.2.1	Soon afterwards Venerable Ānanda, being absentminded, entered a village in just his sarong and upper robe. 
pli-tv-kd8:23.2.2	The monks asked him why, 
pli-tv-kd8:23.2.3	since the Buddha had laid down a rule against it, 
pli-tv-kd8:23.2.6	and Ānanda told them what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd8:23.2.9	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd8:23.3.1	“There are five reasons for leaving behind the outer robe: 
pli-tv-kd8:23.3.2	you’re sick; it’s the rainy season; you’re going to cross a river; the dwelling is protected by a door; you have participated in the robe-making procedure. 
pli-tv-kd8:23.3.4	There are five reasons for leaving behind the upper robe 
pli-tv-kd8:23.3.5	or the sarong: 
pli-tv-kd8:23.3.6	you’re sick; it’s the rainy season; you’re going to cross a river; the dwelling is protected by a door; you have participated in the robe-making procedure. 
pli-tv-kd8:23.3.8	There are five reasons for leaving behind the rainy-season robe: 
pli-tv-kd8:23.3.9	you’re sick; you’re going outside the monastic boundary; you’re going to cross a river; the dwelling is protected by a door; the rainy-season robe hasn’t been sewn or is unfinished.” 
pli-tv-kd8:24.1.0	21. Discussion of robe-cloth given to the Sangha 
pli-tv-kd8:24.1.1	At that time a certain monk had spent the rainy season by himself. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.1.2	People gave him robe-cloth, intending it for the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.1.3	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:24.1.4	“The Buddha has laid down 
pli-tv-kd8:24.1.5	that a sangha consists of a group of at least four, 
pli-tv-kd8:24.1.6	but I’m here by myself. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.1.7	Now these people have given robe-cloth, intending it for the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.1.8	Let me take this robe-cloth to Sāvatthī.” 
pli-tv-kd8:24.1.9	He then took that robe-cloth to Sāvatthī and told the Buddha what had happened. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.1.10	The Buddha said, “This robe-cloth is yours until the end of the robe-making season. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.2.1	It may be that a monk spends the rainy season by himself, 
pli-tv-kd8:24.2.2	yet people give him robe-cloth, 
pli-tv-kd8:24.2.3	intending it for the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.2.4	That robe-cloth is his until the end of the robe-making season.” 
pli-tv-kd8:24.3.1	At that time a certain monk was living by himself outside the rainy season. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.3.2	People gave him robe-cloth, intending it for the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.3.3	He thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:24.3.4	“The Buddha has laid down 
pli-tv-kd8:24.3.5	that a sangha consists of a group of at least four, 
pli-tv-kd8:24.3.6	but I’m here by myself. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.3.7	Now these people have given robe-cloth, 
pli-tv-kd8:24.3.8	intending it for the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.3.9	Let me take this robe-cloth to Sāvatthī.” 
pli-tv-kd8:24.3.10	He then took that robe-cloth to Sāvatthī and told the monks, 
pli-tv-kd8:24.3.11	who in turn told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.3.12	He said, “It should be shared out in the presence of the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.4.1	It may be that a monk is living by himself outside the rainy season, yet people give him robe-cloth, intending it for the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.4.2	I allow that monk to determine that robe-cloth as his. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.4.3	But if another monk arrives before he has determined that robe-cloth, then he should be given an equal share. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.4.4	If yet another monk arrives before they have shared out that robe-cloth by drawing lots, he too should be given an equal share. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.4.5	If still another monk arrives, but after they have shared out that robe-cloth by drawing lots, they don’t need to give him a share if they are unwilling.” 
pli-tv-kd8:24.5.1	On one occasion, after completing the rainy-season residence at Sāvatthī, two senior monks who were brothers, Venerable Isidāsa and Venerable Isibhaṭa, went to a certain village monastery. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.5.2	Because it was long since they had been there, people gave meals together with robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.5.3	The resident monks asked them, “Venerables, this robe-cloth belonging to the Sangha was given because of you. Will you accept a share?” 
pli-tv-kd8:24.5.4	They replied, “As we understand the teaching of the Buddha, this robe-cloth is just for you until the end of the robe-making season.” 
pli-tv-kd8:24.6.1	At that time three monks were spending the rains residence at Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.6.2	People gave them robe-cloth, intending it for the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.6.3	The monks considered, “The Buddha has laid down that a sangha consists of a group of at least four, but we’re just three. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.6.4	Now these people have given robe-cloth, intending it for the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.6.5	What should we do?” 
pli-tv-kd8:24.6.6	At that time a number of senior monks—Venerable Nilavāsī, Venerable Sāṇavāsī, Venerable Gotaka, Venerable Bhagu, and Venerable Phaḷikasantāna—were staying at Pāṭaliputta in the Kukkuṭa Monastery. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.6.7	The monks from Rājagaha went to Pāṭaliputta to ask these monks. 
pli-tv-kd8:24.6.8	They replied, 
pli-tv-kd8:24.6.9	“As we understand the teaching of the Buddha, that robe-cloth is just for you until the end of the robe-making season.” 
pli-tv-kd8:25.1.0	22. Upananda the Sakyan 
pli-tv-kd8:25.1.1	At one time, after completing the rainy-season residence at Sāvatthī, Venerable Upananda the Sakyan went to a certain village monastery. 
pli-tv-kd8:25.1.2	Just then the monks there had gathered to share out the robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:25.1.3	They said to Upananda, “We’re sharing out the Sangha’s robe-cloth. Will you accept a share?” 
pli-tv-kd8:25.1.4	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd8:25.1.5	He then took that share of robe-cloth and went to another monastery. 
pli-tv-kd8:25.1.6	There, too, the monks had gathered to share out the robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:25.1.7	They said to Upananda, “We’re sharing out the Sangha’s robe-cloth. Will you accept a share?” 
pli-tv-kd8:25.1.8	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd8:25.1.9	He then took that share, too, and went to yet another monastery. 
pli-tv-kd8:25.1.10	There, too, the monks had gathered to share out the robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:25.1.11	They said to Upananda, “We’re sharing out the Sangha’s robe-cloth. Will you accept a share?” 
pli-tv-kd8:25.1.12	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd8:25.1.13	He then took that share too, made a large bundle of robe-cloth, and returned to Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-kd8:25.2.1	The monks said to him, “You have much merit, Upananda, since you have been given so much robe-cloth.” 
pli-tv-kd8:25.2.2	“This has nothing to do with merit.” 
pli-tv-kd8:25.2.3	And he told them how he had obtained so much robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:25.3.1	“So you spent the rains residence in one place and accepted a share of the robe-cloth from somewhere else?” 
pli-tv-kd8:25.3.2	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd8:25.3.3	The monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda, 
pli-tv-kd8:25.3.4	“How can Venerable Upananda spend the rains residence in one place and accept a share of the robe-cloth from somewhere else?” 
pli-tv-kd8:25.3.5	They told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned Upananda: 
pli-tv-kd8:25.3.6	“Is it true, Upananda, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-kd8:25.3.7	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd8:25.3.8	The Buddha rebuked him … 
pli-tv-kd8:25.3.9	“Foolish man, how can you spend the rains residence in one place and accept a share of the robe-cloth from somewhere else? 
pli-tv-kd8:25.3.10	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd8:25.3.11	and after rebuking him … 
pli-tv-kd8:25.3.12	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd8:25.3.13	“You should not spend the rainy-season residence in one place and accept a share of the robe-cloth from somewhere else. 
pli-tv-kd8:25.3.14	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd8:25.4.1	At one time Venerable Upananda spent the rains residence in two separate monasteries, thinking, “In this way I’ll get much robe-cloth.” 
pli-tv-kd8:25.4.2	The monks considered, “What share of the robe-cloth should be given to Venerable Upananda?” 
pli-tv-kd8:25.4.3	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd8:25.4.4	“Give the foolish man one person’s share. 
pli-tv-kd8:25.4.5	It may be that a monk spends the rains residence in two monasteries with the intention of getting much robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:25.4.6	If he spends half the time in each monastery, he should be given half a share of the robe-cloth in each. 
pli-tv-kd8:25.4.7	Otherwise he should be given his share of the robe-cloth in the monastery where he spends the most time.” 
pli-tv-kd8:26.1.0	23. The account of the one who was sick 
pli-tv-kd8:26.1.1	At one time a monk who had dysentery 
pli-tv-kd8:26.1.2	was lying in his own feces and urine. 
pli-tv-kd8:26.1.3	Just then the Buddha was walking about the dwellings with Venerable Ānanda as his attendant and he came to this monk. 
pli-tv-kd8:26.1.4	When he saw his condition, he went up to him and said, 
pli-tv-kd8:26.1.5	“What’s your illness, monk?” 
pli-tv-kd8:26.1.6	“I have dysentery, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd8:26.1.7	“But don’t you have a nurse?” 
pli-tv-kd8:26.1.8	“No.” 
pli-tv-kd8:26.1.9	“Why don’t the monks nurse you?” 
pli-tv-kd8:26.1.10	“Because I don’t do anything for them.” 
pli-tv-kd8:26.2.1	The Buddha said to Ānanda, 
pli-tv-kd8:26.2.2	“Go and get some water, Ānanda, let’s wash this monk.” 
pli-tv-kd8:26.2.3	Saying, “Yes, Sir,” he did so. 
pli-tv-kd8:26.2.4	Then the Buddha poured the water, 
pli-tv-kd8:26.2.5	while Ānanda cleaned him up. 
pli-tv-kd8:26.2.6	Afterwards the Buddha lifted him by the head 
pli-tv-kd8:26.2.7	and Ānanda by the feet, and they lay him on a bed. 
pli-tv-kd8:26.3.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd8:26.3.2	“Is there a sick monk in that dwelling?” 
pli-tv-kd8:26.3.3	“Yes, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd8:26.3.4	“What’s his illness?” 
pli-tv-kd8:26.3.5	“He has dysentery.” 
pli-tv-kd8:26.3.6	“Does he have a nurse?” 
pli-tv-kd8:26.3.7	“No.” 
pli-tv-kd8:26.3.8	“But why don’t you nurse him?” 
pli-tv-kd8:26.3.9	“Because he doesn’t do anything for us.” 
pli-tv-kd8:26.3.11	“Monks, you have no mother or father to nurse you. 
pli-tv-kd8:26.3.12	If you don’t nurse one another, who will? 
pli-tv-kd8:26.3.13	Whoever would nurse me should nurse those who are sick. 
pli-tv-kd8:26.4.1	If you have a preceptor, he should nurse you for life; 
pli-tv-kd8:26.4.2	he should not go anywhere until you have recovered. 
pli-tv-kd8:26.4.3	If you have a teacher, he should nurse you for life; 
pli-tv-kd8:26.4.4	he should not go anywhere until you have recovered. 
pli-tv-kd8:26.4.5	If you have a student, he should nurse you for life; 
pli-tv-kd8:26.4.6	he should not go anywhere until you have recovered. 
pli-tv-kd8:26.4.7	If you have a pupil, he should nurse you for life; 
pli-tv-kd8:26.4.8	he should not go anywhere until you have recovered. 
pli-tv-kd8:26.4.9	If you have a co-student, he should nurse you for life; 
pli-tv-kd8:26.4.10	he should not go anywhere until you have recovered. 
pli-tv-kd8:26.4.11	If you have a co-pupil, he should nurse you for life; 
pli-tv-kd8:26.4.12	he should not go anywhere until you have recovered. 
pli-tv-kd8:26.4.13	If you have none of these, the Sangha should nurse you. 
pli-tv-kd8:26.4.14	If you don’t nurse one who is sick, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd8:26.5.1	When a sick person has five qualities, they are hard to nurse: 
pli-tv-kd8:26.5.2	they do what is detrimental for curing the sickness; they do not know the right amount in what is beneficial; they do not take their medicine; they do not accurately report the state of their illness—whether it’s getting worse, getting better, or remaining the same—to the one who is nursing and trying to help them; they are unable to bear up with bodily feelings that are painful, severe, sharp, and life-threatening. 
pli-tv-kd8:26.6.1	When a sick person has five qualities, they are easy to nurse: 
pli-tv-kd8:26.6.2	they do what is beneficial for curing the sickness; they know the right amount in what is beneficial; they take their medicine; they accurately report the state of their illness—whether it’s getting worse, getting better, or remaining the same—to the one who is nursing and trying to help them; they are able to bear up with bodily feelings that are painful, severe, sharp, and life-threatening. 
pli-tv-kd8:26.7.1	When an attendant has five qualities, they are unsuited to nurse the sick: 
pli-tv-kd8:26.7.2	they are incapable of preparing medicine; not knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful, they bring what is harmful and remove what is beneficial; they nurse the sick for the sake of worldly gain, not with a mind of kindness; they are disgusted at having to clean up feces, urine, spit, or vomit; they are incapable of instructing, inspiring, and gladdening the sick person with a Dhamma talk from time to time. 
pli-tv-kd8:26.8.1	When an attendant has five qualities, they are suited to nurse the sick: 
pli-tv-kd8:26.8.2	they are capable of preparing medicine; knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful, they remove what is harmful and bring what is beneficial; they nurse the sick with a mind of kindness, not for the sake of worldly gain; they are not disgusted at having to clean up feces, urine, spit, or vomit; they are capable of instructing, inspiring, and gladdening the sick person with a Dhamma talk from time to time. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.1.0	24. Discussion of inheritance 
pli-tv-kd8:27.1.1	On one occasion two monks were traveling in the Kosalan country. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.1.2	They arrived at a monastery 
pli-tv-kd8:27.1.3	with a sick monk. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.1.4	They thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:27.1.5	“The Buddha has praised nursing the sick, 
pli-tv-kd8:27.1.6	so let’s nurse this sick monk.” 
pli-tv-kd8:27.1.8	But while they were nursing him, he died. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.1.9	They then took his bowl and robes and went to Sāvatthī, where they told the Buddha what had happened. He said, 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.1	“When a monk dies, the Sangha becomes the owner of his bowl and robes. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.2	Still, the nurses have been very helpful. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.3	I allow the Sangha to give the three robes and bowl to the nurses. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.4	And they should be given like this. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.5	The monk nurse should approach the Sangha and say, 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.6	‘Venerables, monk so-and-so has died. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.7	Here are his three robes and bowl.’ 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.8	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.9	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.10	Monk so-and-so has died. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.11	Here are his three robes and bowl. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.12	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give the three robes and the bowl to the nurses. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.13	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.14	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.15	Monk so-and-so has died. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.16	Here are his three robes and bowl. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.17	The Sangha gives the three robes and the bowl to the nurses. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.18	Any monk who approves of giving the three robes and the bowl to the nurses should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.19	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.20	The Sangha has given the three robes and the bowl to the nurses. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.2.21	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.1	On one occasion a novice monk had died. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.3	“When a novice monk dies, the Sangha becomes the owner of his bowl and robes. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.4	Still, the nurses have been very helpful. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.5	I allow the Sangha to give the robes and the bowl to the nurses. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.6	And they should be given like this. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.7	The monk nurse should approach the Sangha and say, 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.8	‘Venerables, the novice monk so-and-so has died. Here are his robes and bowl.’ 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.9	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.10	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.11	The novice monk so-and-so has died. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.12	Here are his robes and bowl. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.13	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give the robes and the bowl to the nurses. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.14	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.15	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.16	The novice monk so-and-so has died. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.17	Here are his robes and bowl. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.18	The Sangha gives the robes and the bowl to the nurses. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.19	Any monk who approves of giving the robes and the bowl to the nurses should remain silent. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.20	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.21	The Sangha has given the robes and the bowl to the nurses. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.3.22	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-kd8:27.4.1	On one occasion a monk and a novice monk were nursing someone together. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.4.2	While they were doing so, the patient died. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.4.3	The monk nurse thought, 
pli-tv-kd8:27.4.4	“What share of the robes should be given to the novice-monk nurse?” 
pli-tv-kd8:27.4.6	“I allow you to give an equal share to the novice-monk nurse.” 
pli-tv-kd8:27.5.1	On one occasion a monk with many possessions had died. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.5.3	“When a monk dies, the Sangha becomes the owner of his bowl and robes. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.5.4	Still, the nurses have been very helpful. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.5.5	I allow the Sangha to give the three robes and the bowl to the nurses. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.5.6	His ordinary possessions should be distributed in the presence of the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd8:27.5.7	His valuable possessions are for the Sangha everywhere, present and future. They are not to be given out, not to be distributed.” 
pli-tv-kd8:28.1.0	25. Discussion of the prohibition against nakedness 
pli-tv-kd8:28.1.1	On one occasion a naked monk went to the Buddha and said, 
pli-tv-kd8:28.1.2	“In many ways, Sir, you praise fewness of wishes, contentment, erasing of defilements, ascetic practices, being inspiring, reduction in things, and being energetic. 
pli-tv-kd8:28.1.3	Being naked leads to all those things. 
pli-tv-kd8:28.1.4	It would be good if you allowed nakedness for the monks.” 
pli-tv-kd8:28.1.5	The Buddha rebuked him, 
pli-tv-kd8:28.1.6	“Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-kd8:28.1.7	How can you undertake the practice of nakedness, as do the monastics of other religions? 
pli-tv-kd8:28.1.8	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd8:28.1.9	and after rebuking him … 
pli-tv-kd8:28.1.10	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd8:28.1.11	“You should not undertake the practice of nakedness, as do the monastics of other religions. 
pli-tv-kd8:28.1.12	If you do, you commit a serious offense.” 
pli-tv-kd8:28.2.0	26. Discussion of the prohibition against grass robes, etc. 
pli-tv-kd8:28.2.1	On one occasion a monk dressed in a grass robe … 
pli-tv-kd8:28.2.2	in a bark robe … 
pli-tv-kd8:28.2.3	in a robe made of bits of wood … 
pli-tv-kd8:28.2.4	in a sarong of human hair … 
pli-tv-kd8:28.2.5	in a sarong of horse-hair … 
pli-tv-kd8:28.2.6	in a robe of owls’ wings … 
pli-tv-kd8:28.2.7	in a robe of antelope hide, 
pli-tv-kd8:28.2.8	went to the Buddha and said, 
pli-tv-kd8:28.2.9	“In many ways, Sir, you praise fewness of wishes, contentment, erasing of defilements, ascetic practices, being inspiring, reduction in things, and being energetic. 
pli-tv-kd8:28.2.10	A robe of antelope hide leads to all those things. 
pli-tv-kd8:28.2.11	It would be good if you allowed robes of antelope hide for the monks.” 
pli-tv-kd8:28.2.12	The Buddha rebuked him, 
pli-tv-kd8:28.2.13	“Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-kd8:28.2.14	How can you wear a robe of antelope hide, that sign of monastics of other religions? 
pli-tv-kd8:28.2.15	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd8:28.2.16	and after rebuking him … 
pli-tv-kd8:28.2.17	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd8:28.2.18	“You should not wear a robe of antelope hide, that sign of monastics of other religions.
pli-tv-kd8:28.2.19	If you do, you commit a serious offense.” 
pli-tv-kd8:28.3.1	On one occasion a monk dressed in a robe of stalks of crown flower … 
pli-tv-kd8:28.3.2	in a jute robe, went to the Buddha, and said, 
pli-tv-kd8:28.3.3	“In many ways, Sir, you praise fewness of wishes, contentment, erasing of defilements, ascetic practices, being inspiring, reduction in things, and being energetic. 
pli-tv-kd8:28.3.4	A jute robe leads to all those things. 
pli-tv-kd8:28.3.5	It would be good if you allowed jute robes for the monks.” 
pli-tv-kd8:28.3.6	The Buddha rebuked him, 
pli-tv-kd8:28.3.7	“Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-kd8:28.3.8	How can you dress in a jute robe? 
pli-tv-kd8:28.3.9	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd8:28.3.10	and after rebuking him … 
pli-tv-kd8:28.3.11	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd8:28.3.12	“You should not dress in a jute robe. 
pli-tv-kd8:28.3.13	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd8:29.1.0	27. Discussion of the prohibition against what is entirely blue, etc. 
pli-tv-kd8:29.1.1	At that time the monks from the group of six wore entirely blue robes, 
pli-tv-kd8:29.1.2	entirely yellow robes, 
pli-tv-kd8:29.1.3	entirely red robes, 
pli-tv-kd8:29.1.4	entirely magenta robes,

pli-tv-kd8:29.1.13	robes made of lodh tree bark, 
pli-tv-kd8:29.1.14	and turbans. 
pli-tv-kd8:29.1.15	People complained and criticised them, 
pli-tv-kd8:29.1.16	“How can the Sakyan monastics wear turbans? They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-kd8:29.1.18	“You should not wear entirely blue robes, entirely yellow robes, entirely red robes, entirely magenta robes, entirely black robes, entirely orange robes, entirely beige robes, robes with borders made from a single piece of cloth, robes with long borders, robes with floral borders, robes with borders decorated with snakes’ hoods, close-fitting jackets, robes made of lodh tree bark, or turbans. 
pli-tv-kd8:29.1.19	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd8:30.1.0	28. Discussion of robe-cloth that has not yet been given to those who have completed the rainy-season residence 
pli-tv-kd8:30.1.1	At that time, when robe-cloth had not yet been given to the monks, the monks who had completed the rainy-season residence left, disrobed, died, admitted to being novice monks, admitted to having renounced the training, admitted to having committed the worst kind of offense, admitted to being insane, admitted to being deranged, admitted to being overwhelmed by pain, admitted to having been ejected for not recognizing an offense, admitted to having been ejected for not making amends for an offense, admitted to having been ejected for not giving up a bad view, admitted to being _paṇḍakas_, admitted to be living in the community by theft, admitted to having previously left to join the monastics of another religion, admitted to being animals, admitted to being matricides, admitted to being patricides, admitted to being murderers of a perfected one, admitted to having raped a nun, admitted to having caused a schism in the Sangha, admitted to having caused the Buddha to bleed, or admitted to being a hermaphrodite. 
pli-tv-kd8:30.1.2	They told the Buddha and he said, 
pli-tv-kd8:30.2.1	“When robe-cloth hasn’t yet been given to the monks, it may be that a monk who has completed the rains residence leaves. If there is anyone suitable to receive the robe-cloth, it should be given. 
pli-tv-kd8:30.2.2	When robe-cloth hasn’t yet been given to the monks, it may be that a monk who has completed the rains residence disrobes, dies, admits to being a novice monk, admits to having renounced the training, or admits to having committed the worst kind of offense. The Sangha becomes the owner of that robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:30.2.3	When robe-cloth hasn’t yet been given to the monks, it may be that a monk who has completed the rains residence admits to being insane, to being deranged, to being overwhelmed by pain, to having been ejected for not recognizing an offense, to having been ejected for not making amends for an offense, or to having been ejected for not giving up a bad view. If there is anyone suitable to receive the robe-cloth, it should be given. 
pli-tv-kd8:30.2.4	When robe-cloth hasn’t yet been given to the monks, it may be that a monk who has completed the rains residence admits to being a _paṇḍaka_, to be living in the community by theft, to having previously left to join the monastics of another religion, to being an animal, to being a matricide, to being a patricide, to being a murderer of a perfected one, to having raped a nun, to having caused a schism in the Sangha, to having caused the Buddha to bleed, or to being a hermaphrodite. The Sangha becomes the owner of that robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:30.3.1	When robe-cloth has been given but not yet shared out to the monks, it may be that a monk who has completed the rains residence leaves. If there is anyone suitable to receive the robe-cloth, it should be given out. 
pli-tv-kd8:30.3.2	When robe-cloth has been given but not yet shared out to the monks, it may be that a monk who has completed the rains residence disrobes, dies, admits to being a novice monk, admits to having renounced the training, or admits to having committed the worst kind of offense. The Sangha becomes the owner of that robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:30.3.3	When robe-cloth has been given but not yet shared out to the monks, it may be that a monk who has completed the rains residence admits to being insane, to being deranged, to being overwhelmed by pain, to having been ejected for not recognizing an offense, to having been ejected for not making amends for an offense, or to having been ejected for not giving up a bad view. If there is anyone suitable to receive the robe-cloth, it should be given out. 
pli-tv-kd8:30.3.4	When robe-cloth has been given but not yet shared out to the monks, it may be that a monk who has completed the rains residence admits to being a _paṇḍaka_, to be living in the community by theft, to having previously left to join the monastics of another religion, to being an animal, to being a matricide, to being a patricide, to being a murderer of a perfected one, to having raped a nun, to having caused a schism in the Sangha, to having caused the Buddha to bleed, or to being a hermaphrodite. The Sangha becomes the owner of that robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-kd8:30.4.0	29. Discussion of robe-cloth that is given when the Sangha is divided 
pli-tv-kd8:30.4.1	“It may be that the Sangha splits before robe-cloth is given to those monks who have completed the rains residence. 
pli-tv-kd8:30.4.2	If people then give water to one faction and robe-cloth to the other, saying, 
pli-tv-kd8:30.4.3	‘We give to the Sangha,’ 
pli-tv-kd8:30.4.4	it’s all for the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd8:30.4.5	It may be that the Sangha splits before robe-cloth is given to those monks who have completed the rains residence. 
pli-tv-kd8:30.4.6	If people then give water and robe-cloth to the same faction, saying, 
pli-tv-kd8:30.4.7	‘We give to the Sangha,’ 
pli-tv-kd8:30.4.8	it’s all for the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd8:30.5.1	“It may be that the Sangha splits before robe-cloth is given to those monks who have completed the rains residence. 
pli-tv-kd8:30.5.2	If people then give water to one faction and robe-cloth to the other, saying, 
pli-tv-kd8:30.5.3	‘We give to the faction,’ 
pli-tv-kd8:30.5.4	it’s all for the faction.

pli-tv-kd8:30.5.7	‘We give to the faction,’ 
pli-tv-kd8:30.5.8	it’s all for the faction. 
pli-tv-kd8:30.6.1	“When robe-cloth has been given but not yet shared out to those monks who have completed the rains residence, it may be that the Sangha splits. 
pli-tv-kd8:30.6.2	The robe-cloth is then to be shared out equally to everyone.” 
pli-tv-kd8:31.1.0	30. Discussion of what is improperly and properly taken 
pli-tv-kd8:31.1.1	On one occasion Venerable Revata gave a robe to a monk to take to Venerable Sāriputta, saying, 
pli-tv-kd8:31.1.2	“Please give this robe to the elder.” 
pli-tv-kd8:31.1.3	While on his way, that monk took that robe on trust from Revata. 
pli-tv-kd8:31.1.4	Later, when Revata met Sāriputta, he asked him 
pli-tv-kd8:31.1.5	whether he had received that robe. 
pli-tv-kd8:31.1.7	He replied that he had not. 
pli-tv-kd8:31.1.8	Revata then asked the other monk, 
pli-tv-kd8:31.1.9	“I gave you a robe to take to the elder. 
pli-tv-kd8:31.1.10	Where is that robe?” 
pli-tv-kd8:31.1.11	“I took it on trust from you.” 
pli-tv-kd8:31.1.12	They told the Buddha what had happened, and he said, 
pli-tv-kd8:31.2.1	“It may be that a monk gives a robe to a monk to take to yet another monk, saying, 
pli-tv-kd8:31.2.2	‘Give this robe to so-and-so.’ 
pli-tv-kd8:31.2.3	If, while on his way, he takes it on trust from the sender, 
pli-tv-kd8:31.2.4	it’s properly taken. 
pli-tv-kd8:31.2.5	But if he takes it on trust from the intended recipient, 
pli-tv-kd8:31.2.6	it’s improperly taken.

pli-tv-kd8:31.2.17	and he determines it as a robe inherited from the sender, 
pli-tv-kd8:31.2.18	it’s properly determined.

pli-tv-kd8:32.1.0	31. Summary of eight kinds of robes 
pli-tv-kd8:32.1.1	“Monks, there are these eight summaries for the giving of a robe: 
pli-tv-kd8:32.1.2	someone gives within a monastic boundary; someone gives according to an agreement; someone gives where alms are prepared; someone gives to the Sangha; someone gives to both Sanghas; someone gives to a sangha that has completed the rainy-season residence; someone gives by specifying the recipients; someone gives to an individual. 
pli-tv-kd8:32.1.3	Someone gives within a monastic boundary: 
pli-tv-kd8:32.1.4	it should be shared by all the monks within that boundary. 
pli-tv-kd8:32.1.5	Someone gives according to an agreement: 
pli-tv-kd8:32.1.6	when a number of monasteries combine their gains, then when it’s given in one monastery, it’s given to all. 
pli-tv-kd8:32.1.7	Someone gives where alms are prepared: someone gives where the Sangha is constantly working. 
pli-tv-kd8:32.1.8	Someone gives to the Sangha: it’s to be shared out in the presence of the Sangha. 
pli-tv-kd8:32.1.9	Someone gives to both Sanghas: even when there are many monks and just a single nun, she should be given half; even when there are many nuns and just a single monk, he should be given half. 
pli-tv-kd8:32.1.10	Someone gives to a sangha that has completed the rainy-season residence: it’s to be shared out by the monks who have completed the rains residence in that monastery. 
pli-tv-kd8:32.1.11	Someone gives by specifying the recipients: in regard to rice porridge, a meal, fresh food, a robe, a dwelling, or medicines. 
pli-tv-kd8:32.1.12	Someone gives to an individual: 
pli-tv-kd8:32.1.13	‘I give this robe to so-and-so.’” 
pli-tv-kd8:32.1.14	The eighth chapter on robes is finished. 
pli-tv-kd8:32.1.104	In this chapter there are ninety-six topics. 
pli-tv-kd8:32.1.105	The chapter on robes is finished.
pli-tv-kd9:0.1	Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law 
pli-tv-kd9:0.2	The Long Division 
pli-tv-kd9:0.3	The chapter on those from Campā 
pli-tv-kd9:0.4	1. The account of the monk Kassapagotta 
pli-tv-kd9:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā lotus pond. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.1.2	At that time in the country of Kāsī there was a village called Vāsabha. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.1.3	The resident monk there, Kassapagotta, was dedicated to the local monastery, 
pli-tv-kd9:1.1.4	trying to get good monks to come, to make those who had come be at ease, and to make the local monastery grow and reach maturity. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.1.5	At this time a number of monks who were wandering in Kāsī arrived at Vāsabha. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.1.6	When Kassapagotta saw those monks coming, he prepared seats, and he set out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, and water for washing the feet. He then went out to meet them, received their bowls and robes, and asked if they wanted water to drink. He helped them get a bath and also with rice porridge, fresh foods, and meals. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.1.7	Those newly arrived monks thought, 
pli-tv-kd9:1.1.8	“He’s great, this resident monk, in that he helps us with all these things. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.1.9	Let’s settle down right here in Vāsabha.” 
pli-tv-kd9:1.1.10	And they did just that. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.2.1	Soon afterwards Kassapagotta thought, 
pli-tv-kd9:1.2.2	“These monks are now rid of their tiredness from traveling. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.2.3	And by now they know where to get alms. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.2.4	Moreover, it’s hard work to seek support from other families all one’s life, and people don’t like to be asked. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.2.5	Why don’t I stop helping them with rice porridge, fresh foods, and meals?” 
pli-tv-kd9:1.2.6	And he did. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.2.7	Those newly arrived monks considered, 
pli-tv-kd9:1.2.8	“Previously this resident monk helped us get a bath and also with rice porridge, fresh foods, and meals. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.2.9	But he’s stopped helping us with food. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.2.10	He’s hostile, this resident monk. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.2.11	Well then, let’s eject him.” 
pli-tv-kd9:1.3.1	Soon afterwards those newly arrived monks gathered and confronted Kassapagotta about what had happened, adding, 
pli-tv-kd9:1.3.4	“You have committed an offense. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.3.5	Do you recognize the offense?” 
pli-tv-kd9:1.3.6	“No. I haven’t committed any offense that I should recognize.” 
pli-tv-kd9:1.3.7	Those newly arrived monks then ejected Kassapagotta for not recognizing an offense. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.3.8	Kassapagotta thought, 
pli-tv-kd9:1.3.9	“I don’t actually know whether this was an offense or not, whether I’ve committed one or not, whether I’ve been ejected or not, whether it was legitimate or not, whether it’s reversible or not, whether it’s fit to stand or not. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.3.10	Let me go to Campā and ask the Buddha about this.” 
pli-tv-kd9:1.4.1	He then put his dwelling in order, took his bowl and robe, and set out for Campā. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.4.2	When he eventually arrived, he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.4.3	Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, 
pli-tv-kd9:1.4.4	the Buddha said to Kassapagotta, 
pli-tv-kd9:1.4.5	“I hope you are keeping well, monk, I hope you’re getting by. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.4.6	I hope you’re not tired from traveling. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.4.7	And where have you come from?” 
pli-tv-kd9:1.4.8	“I’m keeping well, Venerable Sir, I’m getting by. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.4.9	I’m not tired from traveling.” 
pli-tv-kd9:1.5.1	And he told the Buddha all that had happened, adding, 
pli-tv-kd9:1.5.31	“That’s where I’ve come from.” 
pli-tv-kd9:1.6.1	“This is not an offense, monk, 
pli-tv-kd9:1.6.3	and you haven’t been ejected. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.6.4	You have been ejected by an illegitimate legal procedure that’s reversible and unfit to stand. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.6.5	Go back and stay right there in the village of Vāsabha.” 
pli-tv-kd9:1.6.6	“Yes, Sir.” He got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and set out for Vāsabha. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.7.1	Soon those newly arrived monks became anxious and remorseful: 
pli-tv-kd9:1.7.2	“It’s truly bad for us 
pli-tv-kd9:1.7.3	that we have ejected, without reason, a pure monk who hadn’t committed any offense. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.7.4	Well then, let’s go to Campā and confess our offense in the presence of the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-kd9:1.7.5	They then put their dwellings in order, took their bowls and robes, and set out for Campā. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.7.6	When they eventually arrived, they went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.7.7	Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, 
pli-tv-kd9:1.7.8	the Buddha said to them, 
pli-tv-kd9:1.7.9	“I hope you are keeping well, monks, I hope you’re getting by. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.7.10	I hope you’re not tired from traveling. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.7.11	And where have you come from?” 
pli-tv-kd9:1.7.12	“We are keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re getting by. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.7.13	We’re not tired from traveling. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.7.14	There’s a village in the country of Kāsī called Vāsabha, 
pli-tv-kd9:1.7.15	and that’s where we come from.” 
pli-tv-kd9:1.8.1	“Are you the ones who ejected the resident monk?” 
pli-tv-kd9:1.8.2	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-kd9:1.8.3	“For what reason?” 
pli-tv-kd9:1.8.4	“Without any reason.” 
pli-tv-kd9:1.8.5	The Buddha rebuked them, 
pli-tv-kd9:1.8.6	“Foolish men, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.8.7	How can you, without reason, eject a pure monk who had not committed any offense? 
pli-tv-kd9:1.8.8	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd9:1.8.9	and after rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd9:1.8.10	“You should not, without reason, eject a pure monk who hasn’t committed any offense. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.8.11	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-kd9:1.9.1	Those monks then got up from their seats, put their upper robe over one shoulder, bowed down with their heads at the Buddha’s feet, and said, 
pli-tv-kd9:1.9.2	“Venerable Sir, we have committed an offense. We’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful in ejecting, without reason, a pure monk who hasn’t committed any offense. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.9.3	Please accept our confession so that we may restrain ourselves in the future.” 
pli-tv-kd9:1.9.4	“You have certainly made a mistake. You’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.9.5	But since you acknowledge your mistake and make proper amends, I forgive you. 
pli-tv-kd9:1.9.6	For this is called growth in the training of the noble ones: acknowledging a mistake, making proper amends, and undertaking restraint for the future.” 
pli-tv-kd9:2.1.0	2. Discussion of illegitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly, etc. 
pli-tv-kd9:2.1.1	At that time the monks at Campā did legal procedures such as these: 
pli-tv-kd9:2.1.2	illegitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly, illegitimate legal procedures done unanimously, 
pli-tv-kd9:2.1.3	legitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly, legitimate-like legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly, 
pli-tv-kd9:2.1.4	legitimate-like legal procedures done unanimously,

pli-tv-kd9:2.1.6	two ejecting one, two ejecting two, two ejecting three, two ejecting a sangha, 
pli-tv-kd9:2.1.7	three ejecting one, 
pli-tv-kd9:2.1.8	three ejecting two, three ejecting three, three ejecting a sangha, 
pli-tv-kd9:2.1.9	a sangha ejecting a sangha. 
pli-tv-kd9:2.2.1	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd9:2.2.2	“How can the monks at Campā do such kinds of legal procedures?” 
pli-tv-kd9:2.2.4	They told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-kd9:2.2.5	“Is it true, monks, that the monks at Campā do such kinds of procedures?” 
pli-tv-kd9:2.2.8	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-kd9:2.2.9	The Buddha criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd9:2.2.10	It’s not suitable for those foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-kd9:2.2.11	How can they do such kinds of legal procedures? 
pli-tv-kd9:2.2.14	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-kd9:2.2.15	and after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-kd9:2.2.16	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-kd9:2.3.1	“Illegitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly are invalid and not to be done. 
pli-tv-kd9:2.3.2	Illegitimate legal procedures done unanimously are invalid and not to be done.

pli-tv-kd9:2.3.17	Three ejecting a sangha is invalid and not to be done. 
pli-tv-kd9:2.3.18	A sangha ejecting a sangha is invalid and not to be done. 
pli-tv-kd9:2.4.1	There are these four kinds of legal procedures: 
pli-tv-kd9:2.4.2	an illegitimate legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly, an illegitimate legal procedure done unanimously, a legitimate legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly, and a legitimate legal procedure done unanimously. 
pli-tv-kd9:2.4.3	The illegitimate legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly is reversible and unfit to stand, because it is illegitimate and the assembly is incomplete. 
pli-tv-kd9:2.4.4	You should not do such procedures; I haven’t allowed such procedures. 
pli-tv-kd9:2.4.5	The illegitimate legal procedure done unanimously is reversible and unfit to stand, because it is illegitimate. 
pli-tv-kd9:2.4.6	You should not do such procedures; I haven’t allowed such procedures.

pli-tv-kd9:2.4.8	You should not do such procedures; I haven’t allowed such procedures. 
pli-tv-kd9:2.4.9	The legitimate legal procedure done by a unanimous assembly is irreversible and fit to stand, because it is legitimate and the assembly is unanimous. 
pli-tv-kd9:2.4.10	You should do such procedures; I have allowed such procedures. 
pli-tv-kd9:2.4.11	Therefore, monks, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We will do legal procedures that are legitimate and unanimous.’” 
pli-tv-kd9:3.1.0	3. Discussion of legal procedures deficient in motion, etc. 
pli-tv-kd9:3.1.1	At that time the monks from the group of six did legal procedures such as these:

pli-tv-kd9:3.1.6	procedures that had been objected to, that were illegitimate, reversible, and unfit to stand. 
pli-tv-kd9:3.1.7	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-kd9:3.1.8	“How can the monks from the group of six do such kinds of legal procedures?” 
pli-tv-kd9:3.1.14	They told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:

pli-tv-kd9:5.9.7	Make amends for it.

pli-tv-kd9:5.9.14	then the legal procedure is legitimate.” 
pli-tv-kd9:6.1.0	8. The account of Upāli’s questions 
pli-tv-kd9:6.1.1	On one occasion Venerable Upāli went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-kd9:6.1.2	and said, 
pli-tv-kd9:6.1.3	“If, Venerable Sir, a unanimous Sangha doesn’t do a legal procedure face-to-face that should be done face-to-face, is that a legitimate procedure, a procedure in accordance with the Monastic Law?”

pli-tv-kd9:6.3.1	“That legal procedure is illegitimate, contrary to the Monastic Law. 
pli-tv-kd9:6.3.2	If, Upāli, a unanimous Sangha doesn’t do a legal procedure face-to-face that should be done face-to-face, that procedure is illegitimate, contrary to the Monastic Law, and the Sangha has gone too far.

pli-tv-kd9:6.4.1	“But if, Sir, a unanimous Sangha does a legal procedure face-to-face that should be done face-to-face, is that a legitimate procedure, a procedure in accordance with the Monastic Law?”
