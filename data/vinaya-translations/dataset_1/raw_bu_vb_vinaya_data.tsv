pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:0.2	The monks’ rules and their analysis 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:0.3	The chapter on undetermined offenses 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:0.4	1. The first undetermined training rule 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:0.5	Venerables, these two undetermined rules come up for recitation. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.2	At that time Venerable Udāyī was associating with and visiting a number of families in Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.3	On one occasion one of the families that supported him gave their daughter in marriage to the son of another family. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.4	Soon afterwards Venerable Udāyī robed up in the morning, took his bowl and robe, and went to the first of those families. When he arrived, he asked 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.5	where the daughter was, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.6	and he was told 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.7	that she had been given to another family. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.8	That family too supported Udāyī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.9	He then went there and again asked 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.10	where the girl was. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.11	They said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.12	“She’s sitting in her room.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.13	He went up to that girl, and the two of them sat down alone on a private and concealed seat suitable for action. When they were able, they chatted; otherwise he gave her a teaching. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.14	At that time Visākhā Migāramātā had many healthy children and grandchildren. As a consequence, she was considered auspicious. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.15	At sacrifices, ceremonies, and celebrations people would feed Visākhā first. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.16	Just then she had been invited to that family that supported Udāyī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.17	When she arrived, she saw him sitting alone with that girl, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.18	and she said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.19	“Venerable, it’s not appropriate for you to sit alone with a woman on a private and concealed seat suitable for action. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.20	You may not be aiming at that act, but it’s hard to convince people with little confidence.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.21	But Udāyī did not listen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.22	After leaving, Visākhā told the monks what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.23	The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.24	“How could Venerable Udāyī sit alone with a woman on a private and concealed seat suitable for action?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.25	After rebuking Udāyī in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.26	“Is it true, Udāyī, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.27	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.28	The Buddha rebuked him … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.29	“Foolish man, how could you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.30	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.31	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.32.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.32.1	‘If a monk sits alone with a woman on a private and concealed seat suitable for action, and a trustworthy female lay follower sees him 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.33	and accuses him of an offense entailing expulsion, an offense entailing suspension, or an offense entailing confession, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.34	then, if he admits to the sitting, he is to be dealt with according to one of these three 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.35	or according to what that trustworthy female lay follower has said.

pli-tv-bu-vb-ay2:2.2.1	If she accuses him of an offense entailing suspension or an offense entailing confession, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ay2:2.2.2	then, if he admits to the sitting, he is to be dealt with according to one of these two

pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:0.4	The sub-chapter on robes 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:0.5	10. The training rule on kings 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.2	At that time a certain government official was a supporter of Venerable Upananda the Sakyan. On one occasion that official sent a robe fund by messenger, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.3	“Buy a robe with this fund and give it to Venerable Upananda.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.4	The messenger went to Upananda and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.5	“Venerable, I’ve brought a robe fund for you. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.6	Please receive it.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.8	“We don’t receive robe funds, but we do receive allowable robes at the right time.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.10	“Is there anyone who provides services for you?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.11	Just then a lay follower had come to the monastery on some business. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.12	Upananda told the messenger, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.13	“This lay follower provides services for the monks.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.14	The messenger instructed that lay follower and then returned to Upananda, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.15	“I’ve instructed the lay follower you pointed out to me. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.16	Please go to him at the right time and he’ll give you a robe.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.17	Later on that government official sent a message to Upananda, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.18	“Please use the robe. I would like you to use the robe.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.19	But Upananda did not reply. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.20	The government official sent the same message a second time, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.22	but again Upananda did not reply. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.1.23	The government official then sent the message a third time. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.1	
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.2	At that time the householder association had made an agreement that whoever came late to a meeting would be fined fifty coins. And now they were having a meeting. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.3	Just then Upananda went to that lay follower and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.4	“I need a robe.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.5	“Please wait one day, Venerable, for today there’s a meeting of the householder association. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.6	They’ve made an agreement that whoever comes late gets fined fifty coins.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.7	Saying, “Give me the robe today,” he grabbed him by the belt. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.8	Being pressured by Upananda, the lay follower bought him a robe, and as a consequence he was late for the meeting. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.9	People asked him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.10	“Sir, why are you late? You’ve just lost fifty coins.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.11	When that lay follower told them what had happened, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.12	they complained and criticized Upananda, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.13	“These Sakyan monastics have great desires. They’re not content. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.14	It’s no easy matter to provide them with a service. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.15	How could Venerable Upananda not agree when asked by a lay follower 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.16	to wait for a day?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.17	The monks heard the complaints of those people, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.18	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.19	“How could Venerable Upananda not agree when asked by a lay follower 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.20	to wait for a day?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.21	After rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Upananda: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.22	“Is it true, Upananda, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.23	
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.24	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.25	The Buddha rebuked him … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.26	“Foolish man, how could you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.27	
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.28	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.29	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.1	‘If a king, a king’s employee, a brahmin, or a householder sends a robe fund for a monk by messenger, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.2	‘Buy a robe with this robe fund and give it to monk so-and-so,’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.3	and the messenger goes to that monk and says, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.4	‘Venerable, I have brought a robe fund for you. Please receive it,’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.5	then that monk should reply, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.6	‘We don’t receive robe funds, but we do receive allowable robes at the right time.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.7	If that messenger says, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.8	‘Is there anyone who provides services for you?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.9	the monk, if he needs a robe, should point out a monastery worker or a lay follower and say, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.10	‘They provide services for the monks.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.11	If the messenger instructs that service-provider and then returns to the monk and says, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.12	‘Venerable, I have instructed the service-provider you pointed out. Please go to them at the right time and they will give you a robe,’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.13	then, if that monk needs a robe, he should go to that service-provider and prompt them and remind them two or three times, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.14	‘I need a robe.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.15	If he then gets a robe, all is well. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.16	If he does not get it, he should stand in silence for it at most six times. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.17	If he then gets a robe, all is well. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.18	If he makes any further effort and then gets a robe, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.19	If he does not get a robe, he should go to the owners of that robe fund, or send a message, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.20	‘That monk hasn’t received any benefit from the robe fund you sent for him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.21	Please recover what’s yours, or it might get lost.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.3.22	This is the proper procedure.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.0	Definitions 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.1	For a monk: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.2	for the benefit of a monk; making a monk the object of consideration, one wants to give to him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.3	A king: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.4	whoever rules. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.5	A king’s employee: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.6	whoever gets food and wages from a king. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.7	A brahmin: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.8	a brahmin by birth. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.9	A householder: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.10	anyone apart from a king, a king’s employee, and a brahmin. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.11	A robe fund: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.12	money, gold, a pearl, or a gem. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.13	With this robe fund: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.14	with that which is at one’s disposal. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.15	Buy: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.16	having swapped. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.17	Give: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.18	donate. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.19	And the messenger goes to that monk and says, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.20	“Venerable, I have brought a robe fund for you. Please receive it,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.21	then that monk should reply, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.22	“We don’t receive robe funds, but we do receive allowable robes at the right time.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.23	If that messenger says, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.24	“Is there anyone who provides services for you?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.25	the monk, if he needs a robe, should point out a monastery worker or a lay follower and say, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.26	“They provide services for the monks”: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.27	he should not say, “Give it to them,” “They’ll put it aside,” “They’ll do the swap,” “They’ll buy it.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.28	If the messenger instructs that service-provider and then returns to the monk and says, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.29	“Venerable, I have instructed the service-provider you pointed out. Please go to them at the right time and they’ll give you a robe,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.30	then, if that monk needs a robe, he should go to that service-provider and prompt them and remind them two or three times, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.31	“I need a robe”: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.32	he should not say, “Give me a robe,” “Get me a robe,” “Swap me a robe,” “Buy me a robe.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.33	He should say it a second 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.34	and a third time. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.35	If he gets it, all is well. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.36	If he does not get it, he should go there and stand in silence for it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.37	He should not sit down on a seat. He should not receive food. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.38	He should not give a teaching. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.39	If he is asked, “Why have you come?” he should say, “Think about it.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.40	If he sits down on a seat, or he receives food, or he gives a teaching, he loses one allowance to stand. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.41	He should stand a second 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.42	and a third time. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.43	If he prompts four times, he can stand four times. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.44	If he prompts five times, he can stand twice. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.1.45	If he prompts six times, he cannot stand at all. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.2.1	If he makes any further effort and the robe then appears, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.2.2	then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.2.3	When he gets the robe, it becomes subject to relinquishment. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.2.4	The robe should be relinquished to a sangha, a group, or an individual. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.2.5	“And, monks, it should be relinquished like this. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.2.6	(To be expanded as in [Relinquishment 1](pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.5--3.2.29), with appropriate substitutions.) 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.2.7	‘Venerables, this robe, which I got after prompting more than three times and standing more than six times, is to be relinquished. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.2.8	I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.2.9	the Sangha should give … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.2.10	you should give … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.2.11	‘I give this robe back to you.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.2.12	If he does not get a robe, he should go to the owner of that robe fund, or send a message, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.2.13	“That monk hasn’t received any benefit from the robe fund you sent for him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.2.14	Please recover what’s yours, or it might get lost.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.2.15	This is the proper procedure: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.2.16	this is the right method. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.3.0	Permutations 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.3.1	If he prompts more than three times and stands more than six times, and he perceives it as more, and he gets a robe, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.3.2	If he prompts more than three times and stands more than six times, but he is unsure of it, and he gets a robe, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.3.3	If he prompts more than three times and stands more than six times, but he perceives it as less, and he gets a robe, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.3.4	If he prompts less than three times and stands less than six times, but he perceives it as more, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:2.3.5	If he prompts less than three times and stands less than six times, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

pli-tv-bu-vb-np11:1.4	We want to make blankets containing silk.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np11:1.5	The silk-makers complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np11:1.6	“How can the Sakyan monastics come and say

pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:1.6	People complained and criticized them,

pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:1.21	“How can those foolish men do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:1.22	
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:1.23	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …

pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:1.27	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.1	At one time a certain monk at Kosambī was sick. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.2	His relatives sent him a message, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.3	“Come, Venerable, we’ll nurse you.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.4	The monks 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.5	urged him to go, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.6	but he said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.7	“The Buddha has laid down a training rule 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.8	that a monk who has had a new blanket made must keep it for six years. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.9	Now because I’m sick, I’m unable to travel with my blanket. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.10	And because I’m not comfortable without it, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.11	I can’t go.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.12	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.13	Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.14	“Monks, I allow you to give a blanket-permission to a sick monk. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.15	And it should be given like this. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.16	After approaching the Sangha, the sick monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.17	‘Venerables, I’m sick. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.18	I’m unable to travel with my blanket. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.19	I ask the Sangha for a blanket-permission.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.20	And he should ask a second 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.21	and a third time. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.22	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.23	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.24	The monk so-and-so is sick. He’s unable to travel with his blanket. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.25	He’s asking the Sangha for a blanket-permission. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.26	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give a blanket-permission to monk so-and-so. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np14:2.27	This is the motion.

pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.2	There the Buddha addressed the monks: “Monks, I wish to do a solitary retreat for three months. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.3	No one should visit me except the one who brings me almsfood.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.4	“Yes, Venerable Sir,” they replied, and no one visited him except the one who brought him almsfood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.5	Soon afterwards the Sangha at Sāvatthī made the following agreement: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.6	“The Buddha wishes to be on solitary retreat for three months. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.7	No one should visit him except the one who brings him almsfood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.8	Anyone who does must confess an offense entailing confession.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.9	Just then Venerable Upasena of Vaṅganta and his followers went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.10	Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, the Buddha said this to Upasena, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.11	“I hope you’re keeping well, Upasena, I hope you’re getting by. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.12	I hope you’re not tired from traveling.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.13	“We’re keeping well, Sir, we’re getting by. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.14	We’re not tired from traveling.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.15	One of Upasena’s students was seated not far from the Buddha, and the Buddha said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.16	“Do you like rag-robes, monk?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.17	“I don’t like rag-robes, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.18	“Why then do you wear them?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.19	“My preceptor wears them, and so I do it too.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.20	And the Buddha said to Upasena, “Upasena, your followers are inspiring. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.21	How do you train them?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.22	“When anyone asks me for the full ordination, I tell him this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.23	‘I stay in the wilderness, I eat only almsfood, and I wear rag-robes. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.24	If you do the same, I’ll give you the full ordination.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.25	If he agrees, I ordain him. Otherwise I don’t. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.26	And I do the same when anyone asks me for support. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.30	It’s in this way that I train my followers.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.1	“Good, Upasena, you train your followers well. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.2	But do you know the agreement made by the Sangha at Sāvatthī?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.3	“No.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.4	“The Sangha at Sāvatthī has made the following agreement: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.5	‘The Buddha wishes to be on solitary retreat for three months. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.6	No one should visit him except the one who brings him almsfood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.7	Anyone who does must confess an offense entailing confession.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.8	“Venerable Sir, let the Sangha at Sāvatthī  be known for this agreement. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.9	We, however, don’t lay down new rules, nor do we gets rid of the existing ones. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.10	We practice and undertake the training rules as they are.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.11	“Good, Upasena. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.12	One should not lay down new rules, nor should one get rid of the existing ones. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.13	One should practice and undertake the training rules as they are. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.14	And, Upasena, I allow those monks who stay in the wilderness, who eat only almsfood, and who wear rag-robes to visit me whenever they please.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.15	Upasena and his followers got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with their right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.16	Just then a number of monks were standing outside the gateway, thinking, “We’ll make Venerable Upasena confess an offense entailing confession.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.17	And they said to Upasena, “Upasena, do you know the agreement of the Sangha at Sāvatthī?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.18	“The Buddha asked me the same question, and I replied that I didn’t. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.19	He then told me what it was, and I said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.23	‘Venerable Sir, let the Sangha at Sāvatthī be known for this agreement. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.24	We, however, don’t lay down new rules, nor do we get rid of the existing ones. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.25	We practice and undertake the training rules as they are.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.26	Also, the Buddha has allowed those monks who stay in the wilderness, who eat only almsfood, and who wear rag-robes to visit him whenever they please.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.27	Those monks thought, “It’s true what Venerable Upasena says.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.3.1	The monks heard that the Buddha had allowed those monks who stay in the wilderness, who eat only almsfood, and who wear rag-robes to visit him whenever they please. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.3.2	Longing to see the Buddha, they discarded their blankets and undertook the practice of staying in the wilderness, of eating only almsfood, and of wearing rag-robes. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.3.3	Soon afterwards, when the Buddha and a number of monks were walking about the dwellings, he saw discarded blankets here and there. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.3.4	He asked the monks, “Who owns these discarded blankets?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.3.5	The monks told him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.3.6	Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.3.7	“Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.3.8	for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad people, for the ease of well-behaved monks, for the restraint of corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.3.9	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.3.10.1	‘If a monk is having a sitting-blanket made, he must incorporate a piece of one standard handspan from the border of an old blanket in order to make it ugly.

pli-tv-bu-vb-np16:1.7	As a result he was humiliated.

pli-tv-bu-vb-np16:1.14	The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np16:1.15	“How can a monk carry wool more than 40 kilometers?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np16:1.16	After rebuking that monk in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:

pli-tv-bu-vb-np17:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country in the Banyan Tree Monastery at Kapilavatthu. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np17:1.2	At that time the monks from the group of six had the nuns wash, dye, and comb wool. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np17:1.3	Because of this, the nuns neglected recitation, questioning, the higher morality, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np17:1.4	Mahāpajāpati Gotamī then went to the Buddha and bowed down to him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np17:1.5	And the Buddha said to her, “Gotamī, I hope the nuns are heedful, energetic, and diligent?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np17:1.6	“How could the nuns be heedful, Venerable Sir?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np17:1.7	And she told him what was happening. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np17:1.9	The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np17:1.10	She bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np17:1.11	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks from the group of six: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np17:1.12	“Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np17:1.13	“It’s true, Sir.”

pli-tv-bu-vb-np17:1.15	“No.”

pli-tv-bu-vb-np18:1.2	At that time Venerable Upananda was associating with a family from which he received a regular meal. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np18:1.3	Whenever that family obtained food, they put aside a portion for Upananda. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np18:1.4	And that’s what they did when one evening they obtained some meat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np18:1.6	The following morning their son got up early and cried, “Give me meat!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np18:1.7	The man said to his wife, “Give him the venerable’s portion. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np18:1.8	We’ll buy something else for the venerable.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np18:1.9	On the same morning Upananda robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to that family, where he sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np18:1.10	The man of the house approached Upananda, bowed, sat down, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np18:1.11	“Yesterday evening, Venerable, we obtained some meat, and we put aside a portion for you. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np18:1.12	But then in the morning our son got up early and cried, ‘Give me meat!’ and we gave him your portion. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np18:1.13	What can we get you for a _kahāpaṇa_?”

pli-tv-bu-vb-np18:1.17	After giving a _kahāpaṇa_ to Upananda, that man complained and criticized him, “The Sakyan monastics accept money just as we do.”

pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.27	After approaching the Sangha, that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.28	‘Venerables, I have traded with money in various ways. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.29	This is to be relinquished. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.30	I relinquish it to the Sangha.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.31	After relinquishing it, he is to confess the offense. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.32	The confession should be received by a competent and capable monk. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.33	If a monastery worker or a lay follower is available, you should tell him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.34	“Look into this.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.35	If he says, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.36	“What can I get you with this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.37	one should not say, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.38	“Get this or that;” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.39	one should point out what is allowable: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.40	ghee, oil, honey, or syrup. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.41	If he makes a purchase and brings back what is allowable, everyone may enjoy it except the one who did the exchange into money. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.42	If this is what happens, all is well. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.43	If not, he should be told, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.44	“Discard this.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.45	If he discards it, all is well. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.46	If he does not, a monk who has five qualities should be appointed as the money discarder: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.47	one who is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and who knows what has and has not been discarded. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.48	“And, monks, this is how he should be appointed. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.49	First the monk should be asked 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.50	and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.51	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.52	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should appoint monk so-and-so as the money discarder. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.53	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.54	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.55	The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as the money discarder. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.56	Any monk who agrees to appointing monk so-and-so as the money discarder should remain silent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.57	Any monk who doesn’t agree should speak up. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.58	The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as the money discarder. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.59	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.60	I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.61	The appointed monk should throw it away without taking note of the location.

pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:0.5	1. The training rule on the robe-making season 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:0.6	Venerables, these thirty rules on relinquishment and confession come up for recitation. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:1.0.1	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Vesālī at the Gotamaka Shrine, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:1.2	he allowed the three robes for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:1.3	When they heard about this, the monks from the group of six entered the village in one set of three robes, stayed in the monastery in another set, and went to bathe in yet another set. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:1.4	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:1.5	“How can the monks from the group of six keep extra robes?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:1.6	After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:1.7	“Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:1.8	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:1.9	The Buddha rebuked them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:1.10	“Foolish men, how can you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:1.11	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:1.12	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:1.13.0	Preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:1.13.1	‘If a monk keeps an extra robe, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:1.14	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:2.1.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:2.1.1	Soon afterwards Venerable Ānanda was given an extra robe. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:2.2	He wanted to give it to Venerable Sāriputta 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:2.3	who was staying at Sāketa. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:2.4	Knowing that the Buddha had laid down a rule against having extra robes, Ānanda thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:2.10	“What should I do in this situation?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:2.11	He told the Buddha, who said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:2.12	“How long is it, Ānanda, before Sāriputta returns?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:2.13	“Nine or ten days.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:2.14	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:2.15	“Monks, you should keep an extra robe for ten days at the most. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:2.16	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:2.17.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:2.17.1	‘When his robe is finished and the robe-making season has ended, a monk should keep an extra robe for ten days at the most. If he keeps it beyond that, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.0	Definitions 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.1	When his robe is finished: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.2	the monk has made a robe; or the robe-cloth has been lost, ruined, or burnt; or he has abandoned his expectation of receiving further robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.3	The robe-making season has ended: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.4	it has ended according to one of the eight summaries or the Sangha has ended it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.5	For ten days at the most: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.6	it should be kept ten days at a maximum. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.7	An extra robe: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.8	a robe that is not determined, nor transferred to another. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.9	Robe: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.10	one of the six kinds of robe-cloth, but not smaller than what can be transferred to another. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.1	If he keeps it beyond that, it becomes subject to relinquishment: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.2	it becomes subject to relinquishment at dawn on the eleventh day. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.3	The robe-cloth should be relinquished to a sangha, a group, or an individual. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.4	“And, monks, it should be relinquished like this. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.5	After approaching the Sangha, that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.6	‘Venerables, this robe-cloth, which I have kept over ten days, is to be relinquished. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.7	I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.8	After relinquishing it, he should confess the offense. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.9	The confession should be received by a competent and capable monk. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.10	The relinquished robe-cloth is then to be given back: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.11	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.12	This robe-cloth, which was to be relinquished by monk so-and-so, has been relinquished to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.13	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give this robe-cloth back to monk so-and-so.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.14	After approaching several monks, that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.15	‘Venerables, this robe-cloth, which I have kept over ten days, is to be relinquished. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.16	I relinquish it to the venerables.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.17	After relinquishing it, he should confess the offense. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.18	The confession should be received by a competent and capable monk. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.19	The relinquished robe-cloth is then to be given back: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.20	‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.21	This robe-cloth, which was to be relinquished by monk so-and-so, has been relinquished to you. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.22	If it seems appropriate to you, you should give this robe-cloth back to monk so-and-so.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.23	After approaching a single monk, that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.24	‘This robe-cloth, which I have kept over ten days, is to be relinquished. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.25	I relinquish it to you.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.26	After relinquishing it, he should confess the offense. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.27	The confession should be received by that monk. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.28	The relinquished robe-cloth is then to be given back: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.29	‘I give this robe-cloth back to you.’”

pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:4.18	if he is the first offender. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:5.1	Soon afterwards the monks from the group six did not give back relinquished robe-cloth.

pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.2	At that time Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had become skilled at making robes. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.3	He made an upper robe of old cloth, well-dyed and beautifully executed, and he wore it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.4	Just then a certain wanderer who was wearing an expensive robe went up to Upananda and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.5	“Your upper robe is beautiful. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.6	Please give it to me in exchange for my robe.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.7	“Are you sure?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.8	“I am.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.9	Saying, “Alright, then,” he gave it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.10	The wanderer put on the upper robe and went to the wanderers’ monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.11	And the wanderers said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.12	“This upper robe of yours is beautiful. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.13	Where did you get it?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.14	“I swapped it for my robe.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.15	“But how long will it last? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.16	Your other robe was better.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.17	The wanderer realized they were right, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.18	and so he returned to Upananda and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.19	“Here’s your upper robe. Please give me back mine.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.20	“But didn’t I ask you if you were sure? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.21	I won’t give it back.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.22	Then that wanderer complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.23	“Even householders give back to each other when they have regrets. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.24	How then can a monastic not do the same?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.25	The monks heard the complaints of that wanderer, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.26	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.27	“How can Venerable Upananda barter with a wanderer?”

pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.30	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.31	The Buddha rebuked him …

pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:1.33	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …

pli-tv-bu-vb-np20:2.9	When it has been bartered—his own goods are in the hands of the other and the other’s goods are in his own hands—it becomes subject to relinquishment.

pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:1.2	the monks from the group of six were storing up many almsbowls. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:1.3	When people walking about dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:1.4	“How can the Sakyan monastics store up many bowls? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:1.5	Are they starting up as bowl merchants or setting up a bowl shop?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:1.6	The monks heard the complaints of those people, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:1.7	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:1.8	“How can the monks from the group of six keep extra bowls?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:1.9	After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:1.10	“Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:1.11	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:1.12	The Buddha rebuked them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:1.13	“Foolish men, how can you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:1.14	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:1.15	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:1.16.0	Preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:1.16.1	‘If a monk keeps an extra almsbowl, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:1.17	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:2.1	Soon afterwards Venerable Ānanda received an extra bowl. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:2.2	He wanted to give it to Venerable Sāriputta, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:2.3	who was staying at Sāketa. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:2.4	Knowing that the Buddha had laid down a rule against keeping an extra bowl, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:2.10	Venerable Ānanda thought, “What should I do in this situation?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:2.11	He told the Buddha, who said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:2.12	“How long is it, Ānanda, before Sāriputta returns?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:2.13	“Nine or ten days, Venerable Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:2.14	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:2.15	“Monks, you should keep an extra almsbowl for ten days at the most. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:2.16	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:2.17.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:2.17.1	‘A monk should keep an extra almsbowl for ten days at the most. If he keeps it beyond that, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.0	Definitions 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.1	For ten days at the most: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.2	it should be kept ten days at a maximum. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.3	An extra almsbowl: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.4	a bowl that is not determined, nor transferred to another. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.5	An almsbowl: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.6	there are two kinds of bowls: the iron bowl and the clay bowl. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.7	And there are three sizes of bowls: the large bowl, the medium bowl, and the small bowl. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.8	The large bowl: it takes half an _āḷhaka_ measure of rice, a fourth part of fresh food, and a suitable amount of curry. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.9	The medium bowl: it takes a _nāḷika_ measure of rice, a fourth part of fresh food, and a suitable amount of curry. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.10	The small bowl: it takes a _pattha_ measure of rice, a fourth part of fresh food, and a suitable amount of curry. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.11	Anything larger than this is not a bowl, nor anything smaller. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.12	If he keeps it beyond that, it becomes subject to relinquishment: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.13	it becomes subject to relinquishment at dawn on the eleventh day. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.14	The bowl should be relinquished to a sangha, a group, or an individual. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.15	“And, monks, it should be relinquished like this. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.16	After approaching the Sangha, that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.17	‘Venerables, this almsbowl, which I have kept over ten days, is to be relinquished. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.18	I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.19	After relinquishing it, he should confess the offense. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.20	The confession should be received by a competent and capable monk. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.21	The relinquished bowl is then to be given back: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.22	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.23	This almsbowl, which was to be relinquished by monk so-and-so, has been relinquished to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.24	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give this bowl back to monk so-and-so.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.25	After approaching several monks, that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.26	‘Venerables, this almsbowl, which I have kept over ten days, is to be relinquished. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.27	I relinquish it to the venerables.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.28	After relinquishing it, he should confess the offense. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.29	The confession should be received by a competent and capable monk. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.30	The relinquished bowl is then to be given back: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.31	‘Please, I ask the venerables to listen to me. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.32	This almsbowl, which was to be relinquished by monk so-and-so, has been relinquished to you. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.33	If it seems appropriate to you, you should give this bowl back to monk so-and-so.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.34	After approaching a single monk, that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.35	‘This almsbowl, which I have kept over ten days, is to be relinquished. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.36	I relinquish it to you.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.37	After relinquishing it, he should confess the offense. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.38	The confession should be received by that monk. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.39	The relinquished bowl is then to be given back: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.40	‘I give this almsbowl back to you.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.41.0	Permutations 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.41.1	If it is more than ten days and he perceives it as more, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.42	If it is more than ten days, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.43	If it is more than ten days, but he perceives it as less, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.44	If it has not been determined, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.45	If it has not been transferred, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.46	If it has not been given away, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.47	If it has not been lost, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.48	If it has not been ruined, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.49	If it is not broken, but he perceives that it is, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.50	If it has not been stolen, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.51	If he uses an almsbowl that should be relinquished without first relinquishing it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.52	If it is less than ten days, but he perceives it as more, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.53	If it is less than ten days, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.54	If it is less than ten days and he perceives it as less, there is no offense. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.55.0	Non-offenses 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.55.1	There is no offense: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.56	if, within ten days, it is determined, transferred to another, given away, lost, ruined, broken, stolen, or taken on trust; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.57	if he is insane; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.58	if he is the first offender. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:4.1	Soon afterwards the monks from the group six did not give back a relinquished bowl. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:4.2	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:4.3	“Monks, a relinquished alsmbowl should be given back. If you don’t give it back, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:4.4	The training rule on almsbowls, the first, is finished.

pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country in the Banyan Tree Monastery at Kapilavatthu. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.2	At that time a potter had invited the monks, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.3	“If any of you needs an almsbowl, I’ll provide it.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.4	But the monks had no sense of moderation, and they asked for many bowls. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.5	Those who had small bowls asked for large ones, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.6	and those who had large bowls asked for small ones. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.7	The potter was so busy making bowls for the monks that he was unable to make goods for sale. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.8	He could not make a living for himself, and his wives and children suffered. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.9	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.10	“How can the Sakyan monastics have no sense of moderation and ask for many bowls? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.11	This potter is so busy making bowls for them that he is unable to make goods for sale. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.12	He is unable to make a living for himself, and his wives and children are suffering.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.13	The monks heard the complaints of those people, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.14	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.15	“How can those monks have no sense of moderation and ask for many bowls?”

pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.17	“Is it true, monks, that there are monks who do this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.18	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.19	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.20	“How can those foolish men do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.21	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.22	After criticizing them, he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.1.23	“Monks, a monk should not ask for an almsbowl. If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.2.1	Soon afterwards the bowl of a certain monk broke. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.2.2	Knowing that the Buddha had prohibited asking for a bowl and being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not ask for a new one. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.2.3	As a consequence, he collected almsfood with his hands. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.2.4	People complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.2.5	“How can the Sakyan monastics collect almsfood with their hands, just like the monastics of other religions?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.2.6	The monks heard the complaints of those people 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.2.7	and they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.2.8	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.2.9	“Monks, I allow you to ask for a new almsbowl if your bowl has been lost or is broken.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.3.1	When they knew about the Buddha’s allowance, the monks from the group of six asked for many bowls even if their existing bowl only had a minor chip or scratch. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.3.2	Once again that potter was so busy making bowls for the monks that he was unable to make goods for sale. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.3.3	He could not make a living for himself, and his wives and children suffered. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.3.4	And people complained and criticized them as before. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.3.7	The monks heard the complaints of those people, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.3.8	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,

pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.3.18	That monk should relinquish that almsbowl to a gathering of monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.3.19	He should then be given the last almsbowl belonging to that gathering: ‘Monk, this bowl is yours. Keep it until it breaks.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.3.20	This is the proper procedure.’”

pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:2.1.4	… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:2.1.5	An almsbowl with fewer than five mends: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:2.1.6	it has no mends, one mend, two mends, three mends, or four mends.

pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:2.1.13	Exchanges: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:2.1.14	If he asks, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:2.1.15	When he gets the bowl, it becomes subject to relinquishment. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:2.1.16	It should be relinquished in the midst of the Sangha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:2.1.17	All determined bowls should be brought together. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:2.1.18	One should not determine an inferior bowl, thinking,

pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:2.1.25	After relinquishing it, he should confess the offense. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:2.1.26	The confession should be received by a competent and capable monk. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:2.1.27	A monk who has five qualities should be appointed as the distributor of almsbowls:

pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:2.1.29	“And, monks, this is how he should be appointed. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:2.1.30	First the monk should be asked,

pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:2.1.47	It is not to be offered to anyone who does not have bowl. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:2.1.48	In this manner it should be offered all the way to the most junior monk in the Sangha.

pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.2	At that time Venerable Pilindavaccha was clearing a slope near Rājagaha, intending to build a shelter. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.3	Just then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha went to Pilindavaccha, bowed, sat down, and said, “Venerable, what are you having made?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.4	“I’m clearing a slope, great king. I want to build a shelter.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.5	“Do you need a monastery worker?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.6	“The Buddha hasn’t allowed monastery workers.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.7	“Well then, Sir, please ask the Buddha and tell me the outcome.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.8	“Yes, great king.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.9	Pilindavaccha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened King Bimbisāra with a teaching, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.10	after which the king got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated Pilindavaccha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.11	Soon afterwards Pilindavaccha sent a message to the Buddha: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.12	“Venerable Sir, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha wishes to provide a monastery worker. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.13	What should I tell him?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.14	The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.15	“Monks, I allow monastery workers.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.16	Once again King Bimbisāra went to Pilindavaccha, bowed, sat down, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.17	“Venerable, has the Buddha allowed monastery workers?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.18	“Yes, great king.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.19	“Well then, I’ll provide you with a monastery worker.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.20	But after making this promise, he forgot, and only remembered after a long time. He then addressed the official in charge of all practical affairs: “Listen, has the monastery worker I promised been provided?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.21	“No, sir, he hasn’t.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.22	“How long is it since we made that promise?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.23	The official counted the days and said, “It’s five hundred days.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.24	“Well then, provide him with five hundred monastery workers.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.25	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.26	The official provided Pilindavaccha with those monastery workers and a separate village was established. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.27	They called it “The Monastery Workers’ Village” and “Pilinda Village”. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.2.1	And Pilindavaccha began associating with the families in that village. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.2.2	After robing up one morning, he took his bowl and robe and entered Pilinda Village for almsfood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.2.3	At that time they were holding a celebration in that village and the children were dressed up with ornaments and garlands. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.2.4	As Pilindavaccha was walking on continuous almsround, he came to the house of a certain monastery worker, where he sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.2.5	Just then the daughter of that house had seen the other children dressed up in ornaments and garlands. She cried, saying, “Give me a garland! Give me ornaments!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.2.6	Pilindavaccha asked her mother why the girl was crying. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.2.7	She told him, adding, “Poor people like us can’t afford garlands and ornaments.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.2.8	Pilindavaccha took a roll of grass and said to the mother, “Here, place this pad of grass on the girl’s head.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.2.9	She did, and it turned into a beautiful golden garland. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.2.10	Even the royal compound had nothing like it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.2.11	People told King Bimbisāra, “In the house of such-and-such a monastery worker there’s a beautiful golden garland. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.2.12	Even in your court, sir, there’s nothing like it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.2.13	So how did those poor people get it? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.2.14	They must have stolen it.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.2.15	King Bimbisāra had that family imprisoned. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.2.16	Once again Pilindavaccha robed up in the morning, took his bowl and robe, and entered Pilinda Village for almsfood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.2.17	As he was walking on continuous almsround, he came to the house of that monastery worker. He then asked the neighbors what had happened to that family. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.2.18	“The king has jailed them, Venerable, because of that golden garland.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.1	Pilindavaccha then went to King Bimbisāra’s house and sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.2	King Bimbisāra approached Pilindavaccha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.3	Pilindavaccha said, “Great king, why have you jailed the family of that monastery worker?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.4	“Sir, in the house of that monastery worker there was a beautiful golden garland. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.5	Even the royal compound has nothing like it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.6	So how did those poor people get it? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.7	They must have stolen it.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.8	Pilindavaccha then focused his mind on turning King Bimbisāra’s stilt house into gold. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.9	As a result the whole house became gold. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.10	He said, “Great king, how did you get so much gold?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.11	“Understood, Sir! It’s your supernormal power.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.12	He then released that family. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.13	People said, “They say Venerable Pilindavaccha has performed a superhuman feat, a wonder of supernormal power, for the king and his court!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.14	Being delighted and gaining confidence in Pilindavaccha, they brought him the five tonics: ghee, butter, oil, honey, and syrup. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.15	Ordinarily, too, Pilindavaccha was getting the five tonics. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.16	Since he was getting so much, he gave it away to his followers, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.17	who ended up with an abundance of tonics. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.18	After filling up basins and waterpots and setting these aside, they filled their water filters and bags and hung these in the windows. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.19	But the tonics were dripping, and the dwellings became infested with rats. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.20	When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.21	“These Sakyan monastics are hoarding things indoors, just like King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.22	The monks heard the complaints of those people 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.23	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.24	“How can these monks choose to live in such abundance?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.25	After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.26	“Is it true, monks, that there are monks who live like this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.27	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.28	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.29	“How can those foolish men live like this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.30	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.31	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.33	If one uses them beyond that, one commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”

pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:2.14	If one uses them beyond that, one commits an offense entailing relinquishment: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:2.15	it becomes subject to relinquishment at dawn on the eighth day. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:2.16	The tonics should be relinquished to a sangha, a group, or an individual. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:2.17	“And, monks, they should be relinquished like this:

pli-tv-bu-vb-np24:1.3	Knowing that this was the case, the monks from the group of six 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np24:1.4	went looking for cloth for their rainy-season robes in advance. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np24:1.5	And after sewing them in advance, they wore them. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np24:1.6	Then, because their rainy-season robes were worn, they bathed naked in the rain. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np24:1.7	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,

pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.2	Venerable Upananda the Sakyan said to his brother’s student, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.3	“Come, let’s go wandering the country.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.4	“I can’t, Venerable, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.5	my robes are worn.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.6	“I’ll give you a robe.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.7	And he gave him a robe. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.8	Soon afterwards that monk heard 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.9	that the Buddha was about to go wandering the country. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.10	He thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.11	“Now I’ll go wandering with the Buddha instead.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.12	Then, when Upananda said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.13	“Let’s go,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.14	he replied, “I’m not going with you, but with the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.15	“Well, that robe I gave you is going with me,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.16	and he just took it back in anger. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.17	That monk told other monks what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.18	And the monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.19	“How could Venerable Upananda give away a robe and then take it back in anger?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.20	After rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.21	“Is it true, Upananda, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.22	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np25:1.23	The Buddha rebuked him …

pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.2	a man who was going away said to his wife, “Please weigh some thread, take it to the weavers, get them to weave robe-cloth, and put the robe-cloth aside. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.3	When I return, I’ll give it to Venerable Upananda.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.4	An alms-collecting monk heard that man speaking those words. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.5	He then went to Upananda the Sakyan and said, “Upananda, you have much merit. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.6	In such-and-such a place I heard a man, as he was going away, tell his wife to get robe-cloth woven so that he could give it to you when he returned.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.7	“He’s my supporter.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.8	And the weaver was Upananda’s supporter too. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.9	Upananda then went to that weaver and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.10	“This robe-cloth that you’re weaving for me, make it long and wide. And make it closely woven, well-woven, well-stretched, well-scraped, and well-combed.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.11	“Venerable, they’ve already weighed the thread and given it to me, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.12	telling me to weave the robe-cloth with that. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.13	I won’t be able to make it long, wide, or closely woven. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.14	But I’m able to make it well-woven, well-stretched, well-scraped, and well-combed.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.15	“Just make it long, wide, and closely woven. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.16	There’ll be enough thread.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.17	Then, when all the thread had been used up, that weaver went to that woman and said, “Madam, I need more thread.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.18	“But didn’t I tell you to weave the robe-cloth with that thread?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.19	“You did. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.20	But Venerable Upananda told me to make it long, wide, and closely woven. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.21	And he said there would be enough thread.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.22	That woman then gave him as much thread again as she had done the first time. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.23	When Upananda heard that the husband had returned from his travels, he went to his house and sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.24	That man approached him, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.25	He then said to his wife, “Has the robe-cloth been woven?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.26	“Yes, it has.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.27	“Please bring it. I’ll give it to Venerable Upananda.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.28	She then got the robe-cloth, gave it to her husband, and told him what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.29	After giving the robe-cloth to Upananda, he complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np27:1.30	“These Sakyan monastics have great desires; they’re not content.

pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.1.0	Origin story

pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.1.2	a government official who was going away sent a message to the monks, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.1.3	“Come, Venerables, I wish to give a robe to those who have completed the rainy-season residence.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.1.4	The monks thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.1.5	“The Buddha has allowed such robes only for those who have completed the rains residence,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.1.6	and being afraid of wrongdoing they did not go. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.1.7	That government official complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.1.8	“How can they not come when I send a message? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.1.9	I’m going out with the army. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.1.10	It’s hard to know whether I’ll live or die.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.1.11	The monks heard the complaints of that government official, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.1.12	and they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.1.13	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.1.14	“Monks, I allow you to receive a haste-cloth, and then store it.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.2.1	When they heard about this, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.2.3	monks received haste-cloths and stored them beyond the robe season, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.2.4	keeping them in bundles on a bamboo robe-rack. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.2.5	While walking about the dwellings, Venerable Ānanda saw that cloth, and he asked the monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.2.6	“Whose cloth is this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.2.7	“It’s our haste-cloth.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.2.8	“But how long have you stored it?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:1.2.9	They told him.

pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:0.5	2. The training rule on storehouses 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.0.1	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.2	At that time the monks stored one of their robes with other monks and then left to wander the country in a sarong and an upper robe. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.3	Because they were stored for a long time, the robes became moldy. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.4	The monks put them out in the sun. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.5	Then, while walking about the dwellings, Venerable Ānanda saw the monks sunning those robes. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.6	He asked them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.7	“Whose moldy robes are these?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.8	And they told him what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.9	Venerable Ānanda complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.10	“How can those monks store a robe with other monks and then leave to wander the country in a sarong and an upper robe?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.11	After rebuking those monks in many ways, Venerable Ānanda told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.12	“Is it true, monks, that there are monks who do this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.13	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.14	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.15	“How can those foolish men do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.16	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.17	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.18.0	Preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.18.1	‘When his robe is finished and the robe-making season has ended, if a monk stays apart from his three robes even for a single day, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:1.19	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.1	At one time a certain monk at Kosambī was sick. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.2	His relatives sent him a message, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.3	“Come, Venerable, we’ll nurse you.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.4	The monks urged him to go, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.5	but he said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.6	“The Buddha has laid down a training rule 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.7	that you can’t be apart from your three robes. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.8	Now because I’m sick, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.9	I’m unable to travel with my three robes. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.10	So I can’t go.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.11	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.12	Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.13	“Monks, I allow you to give permission to a sick monk to stay apart from his three robes. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.14	And it should be given like this. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.15	After approaching the Sangha, the sick monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.16	‘Venerables, I’m sick. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.17	I’m unable to travel with my three robes. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.18	I ask the Sangha for permission to stay apart from my three robes.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.19	And he should ask a second 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.20	and a third time. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.21	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.22	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.23	The monk so-and-so is sick. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.24	He is unable to travel with his three robes. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.25	He is asking the Sangha for permission to stay apart from his three robes. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.26	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.27	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.28	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.29	The monk so-and-so is sick. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.30	He is unable to travel with his three robes. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.31	He is asking the Sangha for permission to stay apart from his three robes. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.32	The Sangha gives permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.33	Any monk who approves of giving permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes should remain silent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.34	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.35	The Sangha has given permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.36	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.37	I will remember it thus.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.38	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.39.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:2.39.1	‘When his robe is finished and the robe-making season has ended, if a monk stays apart from his three robes even for a single day, except if the monks have agreed, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”

pli-tv-bu-vb-np30:1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np30:1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np30:1.2	an association had prepared a meal together with robes for the Sangha, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np30:1.3	intending to offer the robes after giving the meal. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np30:1.4	But the monks from the group of six went to that association 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np30:1.5	and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np30:1.6	“Please give these robes to us.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np30:1.7	“Venerables, we can’t do that. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np30:1.8	We’ve prepared our annual alms-offering together with robes for the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np30:1.9	“The Sangha has many donors and supporters. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np30:1.10	But since we’re staying here, we look to you for support. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np30:1.11	If you don’t give to us, who will? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np30:1.12	So give us these robes.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np30:1.13	Being pressured by the monks from the group of six, that association gave the prepared robes to them and served the food to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np30:1.14	The monks who knew that a meal together with robes had been prepared for the Sangha, but who did not know that the robes had been given to the monks from the group six, said,

pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.1.2	a monk had been given robe-cloth outside the robe season. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.1.3	While he was making the robe, he realized there was not enough cloth. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.1.4	Lifting it up, he smoothed it out again and again. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.1.5	While walking about the dwellings, the Buddha saw that monk acting in this way. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.1.6	He went up to him and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.1.7	“What are you doing, monk?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.1.8	“Sir, I’ve been given this out-of-season robe-cloth, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.1.9	but it’s not enough to make a robe. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.1.10	That’s why I lift it up and smooth it out again and again.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.1.11	“Are you expecting to receive more cloth?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.1.12	“I am.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.1.13	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.1.14	“Monks, I allow you to keep out-of-season robe-cloth if you are expecting to receive more.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.2.1	When they heard about this, some monks kept out-of-season robe-cloth for more than a month, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.2.2	keeping them in bundles on a bamboo robe-rack. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.2.3	While walking about the dwellings, Venerable Ānanda saw that robe-cloth, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.2.4	and he asked the monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.2.5	“Whose cloth is this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.3.1	“It’s our out-of-season robe-cloth, which we’re keeping because we’re expecting more.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.3.2	“But how long have you kept it?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.3.3	“More than a month.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.3.4	Venerable Ānanda complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.3.5	“How can these monks keep out-of-season robe-cloth for more than a month?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.3.6	After rebuking those monks in many ways, Venerable Ānanda told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.3.7	“Is it true, monks, that there are monks who do this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.3.8	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.3.9	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.3.10	“How can those foolish men keep out-of-season robe-cloth for more than a month? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.3.11	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …

pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.3.15	If there is not enough cloth, but he is expecting more, he should keep it at most one month to make up the lack. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.3.16	If he keeps it beyond that, then even if he expects more cloth, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”

pli-tv-bu-vb-np4:1.6	One morning Udāyī robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to her. He then uncovered his genitals in front of her and sat down on a seat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np4:1.7	She too uncovered her genitals in front of him and sat down on a seat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np4:1.8	Lustfully staring at her genitals, he emitted semen.

pli-tv-bu-vb-np4:1.11	“Give it to me, Venerable, I’ll wash it.”

pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.0.1	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.2	the nun Uppalavaṇṇā was staying at Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.3	One morning she robed up, took her bowl and robe, and entered Sāvatthī to collect almsfood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.4	When she had finished her almsround and had eaten her meal, she went to the Blind Men’s Grove, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.5	where she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day’s meditation. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.6	Just then some bandits who had stolen and slaughtered a cow were taking the meat to the Blind Men’s Grove. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.7	The head bandit saw Uppalavaṇṇā sitting at the foot of that tree. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.8	He thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.9	“If my sons and brothers see this nun, they’ll harass her,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.10	and he took a different path. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.11	Soon afterwards when the meat was cooked, he took the best part, tied it up with a palm-leaf wrap, hung it from a tree not far from Uppalavaṇṇā, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.12	“Whatever acetic or brahmin sees this gift, please take it.” And he left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.13	Uppalavaṇṇā had just emerged from stillness when she heard the head bandit making that statement. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.14	She took the meat and returned to her dwelling place. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.15	The following morning she prepared the meat and made it into a bundle with her upper robe. She then rose into the air and appeared in the Bamboo Grove. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.1	When she arrived the Buddha had already entered a village to collect almsfood, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.2	but Venerable Udāyī had been left behind to look after the dwellings. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.3	Uppalavaṇṇā approached Udāyī and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.4	“Venerable, where’s the Buddha?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.5	“He’s entered the village to collect almsfood.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.6	“Please give this meat to the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.7	“You’ll please the Buddha with that meat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.8	If you give me your sarong, you’ll please me too.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.9	“It’s hard for women to get material support, and this is one of my five robes. I don’t have another. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.10	I can’t give it away.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.11	“Sister, just as a man giving an elephant might decorate it with a girdle, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.12	so should you, when giving meat to the Buddha, decorate me with your sarong.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.13	Being pressured by Udāyī, Uppalavaṇṇā gave him her sarong and then returned to her dwelling place. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.14	The nuns who received Uppalavaṇṇā’s bowl and robe asked her 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.15	where her sarong was. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.16	And she told them what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.17	The nuns complained and criticized Udāyī, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.18	“How could Venerable Udāyī receive a robe from a nun? It’s hard for women to get material support.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.19	The nuns told the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.20	The monks of few desires complained and criticized Udāyī, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.21	“How could Venerable Udāyī receive a robe from a nun?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.22	After rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.23	“Is it true, Udāyī, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.24	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.25	“Is she a relative of yours?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.26	“No.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.27	“Foolish man, a man and a woman who are unrelated don’t know what’s appropriate and inappropriate, what’s good and bad, in dealing with each other. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.28	And still you did this.

pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:2.1	Then, being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not receive robes from nuns even in exchange. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:2.2	The nuns complained and criticized them,

pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:2.4	The monks heard the criticism of those nuns 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:2.5	and they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:2.6	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

pli-tv-bu-vb-np6:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np6:1.1.2	At that time Venerable Upananda the Sakyan was skilled at teaching. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np6:1.1.3	On one occasion the son of a wealthy merchant went to Upananda, bowed, and sat down.

pli-tv-bu-vb-np6:1.1.19	Being pressured by Upananda, that merchant’s son gave him one of his wraps and left.

pli-tv-bu-vb-np6:2.2	Knowing that the Buddha had laid down this training rule and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not ask for robes. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np6:2.3	As a consequence, they walked naked to Sāvatthī, where they bowed down to the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np6:2.4	The there monks said, “These Ājīvaka ascetics are good people, seeing as they bow down to the monks.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np6:2.5	“We’re not Ājīvakas! We’re monks!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np6:2.6	The monks asked Venerable Upāli to examine them.

pli-tv-bu-vb-np7:1.5	You should ask for a robe.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np7:1.6	“It’s not necessary. We’ve already got one.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-np7:1.7	“We’ll ask for you.”

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:0.5	21. The training rule on the instruction 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.0.1	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.2	At that time the senior monks who were instructing the nuns received robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.3	When the monks from the group of six found out about this, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.5	they thought, “Well then, let’s instruct the nuns.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.6	They then went to the nuns and said, “Come to us, Sisters, and we too will instruct you.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.7	Soon afterwards those nuns went to the monks from the group of six, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.8	bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.9	But after giving just a short teaching, those monks spent the day on pointless talk. They then dismissed the nuns, saying, “Go, Sisters.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.10	The nuns went to the Buddha and bowed, and the Buddha said to them, “Nuns, I hope the instruction was effective?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.11	“Venerable Sir, how could the instruction be effective? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.12	After giving just a short teaching, the monks from the group of six spent the day on pointless talk, and then dismissed us.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.13	The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened those nuns with a teaching. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.14	The nuns bowed, circumambulated the Buddha with their right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.15	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks from the group of six: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.16	“Is it true, monks, that you acted like this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.17	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.18	The Buddha rebuked them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.19	“Foolish men, how could you act like this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.20	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.21	and after rebuking them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.22	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.23	“Monks, you should appoint an instructor of the nuns. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.24	And this is how he should be appointed. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.25	First a monk should be asked 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.26	and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.27	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.28	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should appoint monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.29	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.30	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.31	The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.32	Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns should remain silent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.33	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.34	For the second time I speak on this matter: … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.35	For the third time I speak on this matter: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.36	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.37	The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.38	Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns should remain silent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.39	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.40	The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.41	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.42	Then, after rebuking the monks from the group of six in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.43	“And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.44.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.44.1	‘If a monk who has not been appointed instructs the nuns, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:1.45	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.1	After being appointed to do so, the senior monks who instructed the nuns still received robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.2	When they found out about this, the monks from the group of six said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.4	“Well then, let’s go outside the monastic boundary, appoint each other as instructors of the nuns, and then instruct them.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.5	After doing just that, they again went to the nuns and said, “Sisters, we too have been appointed. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.6	Come to us, and we will instruct you.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.7	Once again the nuns went to the monks from the group of six and everything unfolded as before. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.18	The Buddha then had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks from the group of six: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.19	“Is it true, monks, that you acted like this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.20	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.21	The Buddha rebuked them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.22	“Foolish men, how could you act like this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.23	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …”… 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.24	and after rebuking them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.25	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.26	“Monks, you may appoint a monk who possesses eight qualities as an instructor of the nuns: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.27	He is virtuous and restrained by the Monastic Code. His conduct is good, he associates with the right people, and he sees danger in minor faults. He undertakes and trains in the training rules. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.28	He has learned much, and he retains and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, that have a true goal and are well articulated, and that set out the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life—he has learned many such teachings, retained them in mind, recited them verbally, mentally investigated them, and penetrated them well by view. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.29	He has properly learned both Monastic Codes in detail. He has analyzed them well, thoroughly mastered them, and investigated them well, both in terms of the rules and their detailed exposition. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.30	He is well-spoken and has a good voice. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.31	He is generally liked by and pleasing to the nuns. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.32	He is capable of instructing the nuns. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.33	He has never committed a heavy offense against a Buddhist nun. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.34	He has been fully ordained for at least twenty years. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:2.35	Monks, you may appoint a monk who possesses these eight qualities as an instructor of the nuns.”

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.5	Who has not been appointed: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.6	who has not been appointed through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.7	Nuns:

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.9	Instructs: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.10	If he instructs in the eight important principles, he commits an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.11	If he instructs in any other teaching, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.12	If he instructs a nun who is fully ordained only on one side, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.13	The monk who has been appointed should sweep the precincts, set out water for drinking and water for washing, prepare a seat, get hold of a companion, and then sit down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.14	The nuns should go there, bow down to the monk, and sit down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.15	The monk should then ask them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.16	“Sisters, are you all present?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.17	If they say, “We’re all present, Venerable,” he should say, “Are you keeping the eight important principles?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.18	If they say, “We are,” he should say, “This is the instruction.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.19	If they say, “We’re not,” he should recite the important principles: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.20	“A nun who has been fully ordained for a hundred years should bow down to a monk who was given the full ordination on that very day, and she should stand up for him, raise her joined palms to him, and do acts of respect toward him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.21	This rule is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.22	A nun should not spend the rainy-season residence in a monastery without monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.23	This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.24	Every half-month a nun should seek two things from the Sangha of monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.25	asking it about the observance day and going to it for the instruction. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.26	This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.27	A nun who has completed the rainy-season residence should invite correction from both Sanghas in regard to three things: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.28	what has been seen, what has been heard, and what has been suspected. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.29	This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.30	A nun who has committed a heavy offense must undertake a trial period for a half-month toward both Sanghas.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.33	This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.34	A nun may not in any way abuse or revile a monk. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.35	This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.36	From today onwards, nuns may not correct monks, but monks may correct nuns. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.37	This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.38	If they say, “We’re all present, Venerable,” and he instructs them with another teaching, then he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.39	If they say, “We’re not all present, Venerable,” and he instructs them in the eight important principles, then he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.2	the senior monks were taking turns instructing the nuns. Then, on one occasion, it was the turn of Venerable Cūḷapanthaka. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.3	The nuns said, “Today the instruction won’t be effective. Venerable Cūḷapanthaka will just be repeating the same thing over and over.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.4	Soon afterwards those nuns went to Cūḷapanthaka, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.5	Cūḷapanthaka then said to them, “Are you all here, Sisters?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.6	“We’re all here, Venerable.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.7	“Are you keeping the eight important principles?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.8	“We are.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.9	After saying, “This is the instruction,” he spoke the same utterance again and again: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.10	“For the heedful one possessed of the higher mind, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.11	For the sage training on the path to sagacity—
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.12	There are no sorrows for such a one, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.13	The peaceful one, who is always mindful.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.14	And the nuns said, “Didn’t we say that the instruction wouldn’t be effective, that Venerable Cūḷapanthaka would just be repeating the same thing over and over?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.15	Cūḷapanthaka overheard that conversation between the nuns. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.16	He then rose up into the air, walked back and forth in space, and he stood, sat down, and lay down there. He emitted smoke and fire, and he disappeared, all the while speaking the same utterance and many other sayings by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.17	The nuns said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.18	“It’s astonishing and amazing! 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.19	No previous instruction has been as effective as this one from Venerable Cūḷapanthaka!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.20	And Cūḷapanthaka kept on instructing those nuns until the dark of night and then dismissed them, saying, “Go, Sisters.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.21	But because the gates to town were closed, those nuns spent the night outside and only entered early in the morning. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.22	People complained and criticized them, “These nuns aren’t celibate. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.23	They spend the night in the monastery with the monks and only now do they enter town.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.24	The monks heard the complaints of those people, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.25	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized Cūḷapanthaka, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.26	“How could Venerable Cūḷapanthaka instruct the nuns after the sun has set?”… 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.27	“Is it true, Cūḷapanthaka, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.28	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.29	The Buddha rebuked him … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.30	“Cūḷapanthaka, how could you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.31	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country in the Banyan Tree Monastery at Kapilavatthu, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:1.2	the monks from the group of six went to the nuns’ dwelling place and instructed the nuns from the group of six. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:1.3	Soon afterwards the nuns said to the nuns from the group of six, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:1.4	“Come, Venerables, let’s go to the instruction.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:1.5	“There’s no need. The monks from the group of six came and instructed us right here.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:1.6	The nuns complained and criticized the monks from the group of six, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:1.7	“How could the monks from the group of six go and instruct the nuns at their dwelling place?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:1.8	The those nuns told the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:1.9	The monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:1.10	“How could those monks do this?”… 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:1.11	“Is it true, monks, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:1.12	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:1.13	The Buddha rebuked them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:1.14	“Foolish men, how could you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:1.15	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:1.16	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:1.17.0	Preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:1.17.1	‘If a monk goes to the nuns’ dwelling place, and then instructs them, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:1.18	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:2.1	Soon afterwards Mahāpajāpati Gotamī became sick. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:2.2	The senior monks went to see her 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:2.3	and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:2.4	“We hope you’re bearing up, Gotamī, we hope you’re getting better?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:2.5	“I’m not bearing up, Venerables, and I’m not getting better. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:2.6	Please give me a teaching.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:2.7	“It’s not allowable for us to go and teach the nuns at their dwelling place.” And being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not teach her. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:2.8	Soon afterwards, after robing up in the morning, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to Mahāpajāpati Gotamī, where he sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:2.9	He said to her, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:2.10	“I hope you’re bearing up, Gotamī, I hope you’re getting better?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:2.11	“Previously, Venerable Sir, the senior monks would come and teach me, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:2.12	and because of that I would be comfortable. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:2.13	But now that this has been prohibited by the Buddha, they don’t teach because they’re afraid of wrongdoing. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:2.14	Because of that I’m not comfortable.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:2.15	After instructing, inspiring, and gladdening her with a teaching, the Buddha got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:2.16	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23:2.17	“Monks, I allow you to go and instruct a sick nun at her dwelling place.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.0.1	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.1	On one occasion when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.2	a certain monk was walking for almsfood along a street in Sāvatthī, as was a certain nun. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.3	That monk said to that nun, “Go to such-and-such a place, Sister, and you’ll get alms,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.4	and she said the same to him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.5	And because they met frequently, they became friends. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.6	Just then robe-cloth belonging to the Sangha was being distributed. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.7	Then, after going to the instruction, that nun went to that monk and bowed. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.8	He then said to her, “Sister, will you accept my share of the robe-cloth?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.9	“Yes, Venerable, my robes are worn.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.10	And he gave his robe-cloth to that nun. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.11	As a consequence, his robes, too, became worn. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.12	Other monks said to him, “Why don’t you make a robe for yourself?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.13	And he told them what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.14	The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.15	“How could a monk give robe-cloth to a nun?” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.16	“Is it true, monk, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.17	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.18	“Is she a relative of yours?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.19	“No.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.20	“Foolish man, a man and a woman who are unrelated don’t know what’s appropriate and inappropriate, what’s good and bad, in dealing with each other. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.21	And still you did this. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.22	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.23	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.24.1	‘If a monk gives robe-cloth to an unrelated nun, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:1.25	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:2.1	Once this had happened, the monks did not even give robe-cloth to the nuns in exchange, being afraid of wrongdoing. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:2.2	The nuns complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:2.3	“How can they not give us robe-cloth in exchange?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:2.4	The monks heard the complaints of those nuns 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:2.5	and they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:2.6	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:2.7	“Monks, I allow you to give things in except in exchange  to five kinds of people: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25:2.8	monks, nuns, trainee nuns, novice monks, and novice nuns.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc26:1.5	He then sewed a robe for that nun, well-dyed and beautifully executed, and he drew a picture in the middle of it. He then folded it and put it aside.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc26:1.9	And that nun did just that. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc26:1.10	People complained and criticized her,

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:1.0.1	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:1.2	At that time the monks from the group of six were boarding boats by appointment with nuns. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:1.3	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:1.4	“Just as we enjoy ourselves on boats with our wives, so these Sakyan monastics make appointments with the nuns and then enjoy themselves on boats.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:1.5	The monks heard the complaints of those people, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:1.6	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:1.7	“How can the monks from the group of six board boats by appointments with nuns?” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:1.8	“Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:1.9	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:1.10	The Buddha rebuked them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:1.11	“Foolish men, how can you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:1.12	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:1.13	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:1.14.0	Preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:1.14.1	‘If a monk boards a boat by appointment with a nun, either to go upstream or downstream, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:1.15	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:2.1	Soon afterwards a number of monks and nuns were traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:2.2	On the way they needed to cross a river. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:2.3	The nuns said to the monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:2.4	“Let’s cross together.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:2.5	“Sisters, it’s not allowable for us to board a boat by appointment with a nun. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:2.6	Either you cross first, or we will.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:2.7	“You have the higher status, Venerables. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:2.8	Please go first.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:2.9	But because the nuns crossed afterwards, they were robbed and raped by bandits. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:2.10	When they arrived at Sāvatthī they told the nuns there what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:2.11	The nuns then told the monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:2.12	who in turn told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:2.13	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:2.14	“Monks, I allow you to board a boat by appointment with a nun if it’s for the purpose of crossing. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:2.15	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:2.16.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:2.16.1	‘If a monk boards a boat by appointment with a nun, either to go upstream or downstream, except for the purpose of crossing, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:3.1.11	If the monk boards when the nun has already boarded, he commits an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:3.1.12	If the nun boards when the monks has already boarded, he commits an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:3.1.13	If they both board together, he commits an offense entailing confession.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28:3.1.21	When it is an uninhabited area, a wilderness, then for every six kilometers he commits an offense entailing confession.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.2	At that time the nun Thullanandā was associating with a family from which she received a regular meal. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.3	Now on one occasion the head of that family had invited some senior monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.4	On the same day, the nun Thullanandā robed up in the morning, took her bowl and robe, and went to that family. And she asked the head of the family, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.5	“Why have you prepared so much food?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.6	“Because, Venerable, I’ve invited the senior monks.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.7	“But who are those senior monks?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.8	“Venerable Sāriputta, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, Venerable Mahākaccāna, Venerable Mahākoṭṭhika, Venerable Mahākappina, Venerable Mahācunda, Venerable Anuruddha, Venerable Revata, Venerable Upāli, Venerable Ānanda, and Venerable Rāhula.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.9	“But why do you invite such inferior monks instead of the great ones?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.10	“Who are these great monks?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.11	“Venerable Devadatta, Venerable Kokālika, Venerable Kaṭamodakatissaka, Venerable Khaṇḍadeviyā-putta, and Venerable Samuddadatta.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.12	While this conversation was taking place, the senior monks entered. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.13	Thullanandā said, “Is it true that you’ve invited these great monks?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.14	“Just before you called them inferior and now you call them great.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.15	And that lay person threw her out of the house and made an end of her regular meal. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.16	The monks of few desires complained and criticized Devadatta, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.17	“How could Devadatta eat almsfood knowing that a nun had it prepared?” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.18	“Is it true, Devadatta, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.19	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.20	The Buddha rebuked him …

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.25	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:2.1	Soon afterwards a monk who had earlier left Rājagaha returned to see his family. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:2.2	Because it was long since he had last returned, people prepared food for him respectfully. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:2.3	And the nun who was associating with that family said to them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:2.4	“Give food to that monk.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:2.5	The monk thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:2.6	“The Buddha has prohibited us from eating almsfood knowing that a nun had it prepared,” and being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not accept it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:2.7	And because he was unable to walk for alms, he missed his meal.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:2.9	and they in turn told the Buddha.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:1.1.3	They reviled and insulted them about their caste, name, family, occupation, profession, illnesses, physical traits, defilements, and offenses, and by calling them names.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:1.2.2	On one occasion the ox said to that brahmin,

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:1.2.4	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:1.2.5	And that brahmin did just that. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:1.2.7	Then, after tying one hundred carts together and yoking Nandivisāla to them, he said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:1.2.8	‘Go, you fraud! Pull, you liar!’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:1.2.9	But Nandivisāla didn’t budge. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:1.2.10	Then that brahmin became depressed because he had lost a thousand coins.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:1.2.12	‘Why are you depressed?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:1.2.13	‘Because I lost one thousand coins because of you.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:1.2.14	‘But why did you disgrace me by calling me a fraud when I’m not?

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:1.2.17	Just don’t disgrace me by calling me a fraud.’

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:0.4	The sub-chapter on eating 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:0.5	31. The training rule on alms-meals at public guesthouses 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.0.1	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.2	a certain association was preparing an alms-meal at a public guesthouse not far from Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.3	Then, after robing up in the morning, the monks from the group of six took their bowl and robe and entered Sāvatthī for alms. Not getting anything, they went to that public guesthouse. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.4	Because it was long since they had been there, people served them respectfully. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.5	A second and a third day those monks did the same thing. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.6	Then they thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.7	“What’s the point of returning to the monastery? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.8	Tomorrow we’ll just have to come back here.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.9	So they stayed on and on right there, eating alms at the guesthouse, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.10	while the monastics of other religions left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.11	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.12	“How can the Sakyan monastics stay on and on, eating alms at the guesthouse? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.13	We don’t prepare the alms-food just for them; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.14	we prepare it for everyone.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.15	The monks heard the complaints of those people, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.16	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.17	“How could the monks from the group of six stay on and on, eating alms at a public guesthouse?” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.18	“Is it true, monks, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.19	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.20	The Buddha rebuked them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.21	“Foolish men, how could you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.22	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.23	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.24.0	Preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.24.1	‘If a monk eats more than one alms-meal at a public guesthouse, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.25	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.1	Soon afterwards Venerable Sāriputta was traveling in the Kosalan country on his way to Sāvatthī when he came to a public guesthouse. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.2	Because it was long since he had been there, people served him respectfully. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.3	After he had eaten, Sāriputta became severely ill, and he was unable to leave that guesthouse. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.4	On the second day, too, those people said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.5	“Please eat, Venerable.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.6	But since he knew that 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.7	the Buddha had prohibited eating alms at a public guesthouse after staying on and on, and because he was afraid of wrongdoing, he did not accept. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.8	As a consequence, he missed his meal. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.9	When he arrived at Sāvatthī, he told the monks what had happened, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.10	and they in turn told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.11	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.12	“Monks, I allow a sick monk to stay on at a public guesthouse and eat alms there.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:1.0.1	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:1.2	At that time, because of decline in material support and loss of respect, Devadatta and his followers ate at invitations only after repeatedly asking. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:1.3	People complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:1.4	“How can the Sakyan monastics eat at invitations after repeatedly asking? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:1.5	Who doesn’t like nice food? Who doesn’t prefer tasty food?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:1.6	The monks heard the complaints of those people, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:1.7	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:1.8	“How can Devadatta and his followers eat at invitations after repeatedly asking?” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:1.9	“Is it true, Devadatta, that you do this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:1.10	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:1.11	The Buddha rebuked him … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:1.12	“Foolish man, how can you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:1.13	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:1.14	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:1.15.0	First preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:1.15.1	‘If a monk eats in a group, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:1.16	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:2.1	Soon afterwards people invited sick monks to a meal. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:2.2	But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:2.3	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:2.4	Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:2.5	“Monks, I allow a sick monk to eat in a group. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:2.6	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:2.7.0	Second preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:2.7.1	‘If a monk eats in a group, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:2.8	This is the appropriate occasion: he is sick.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:2.9	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:3.0	Third sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:3.1	Soon afterwards, during the robe-giving season, people prepared a meal together with robe-cloth and then invited the monks, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:3.2	“We wish to offer a meal and then give robe-cloth.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:3.3	But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:3.4	As a result, they only got a small amount of robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:3.5	They told the Buddha. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:3.6	“Monks, I allow you to eat in a group during the robe-giving season. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:3.7	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:3.8.0	Third preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:3.8.1	‘If a monk eats in a group, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:3.9	These are the appropriate occasions: he is sick; it is the robe-giving season.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:3.10	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:4.0	Fourth sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:4.1	Soon afterwards people invited the robe-making monks for a meal. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:4.2	But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:4.3	They told the Buddha. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:4.4	“Monks, I allow you to eat in a group at a time when you are making robes. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:4.5	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:4.6.1	‘If a monk eats in a group, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:4.7	These are the appropriate occasions: he is sick; it is the robe-giving season; it is a time of making robes.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:4.8	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:5.0	Fifth sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:5.1	Soon afterwards some monks went traveling with a group of people. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:5.2	The monks said to those people, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:5.3	“Please wait a moment while we walk for alms.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:5.4	They replied, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:5.5	“Venerables, please eat right here.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:5.6	But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:5.7	They told the Buddha. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:5.8	“Monks, I allow you to eat in a group when you’re traveling. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:5.9	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:5.10.0	Fifth preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:5.10.1	‘If a monk eats in a group, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:5.11	These are the appropriate occasions: he is sick; it is the robe-giving season; it is a time of making robes; he is traveling.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:5.12	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:6.0	Sixth sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:6.1	Soon afterwards some monks were traveling by boat with a group of people. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:6.2	The monks said to those people, “Please go to the shore for a moment while we walk for alms.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:6.3	They replied, “Venerables, please eat right here.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:6.4	But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:6.5	They told the Buddha. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:6.6	“Monks, I allow you to eat in a group when on board a boat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:6.7	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:6.8.0	Sixth preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:6.8.1	‘If a monk eats in a group, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:6.9	These are the appropriate occasions: he is sick; it is the robe-giving season; it is a time of making robes; he is traveling; he is on a boat.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:6.10	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:7.0	Seventh sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:7.1	Soon afterwards monks who had completed the rainy-season residence in various regions were coming to Rājagaha to visit the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:7.2	People saw those monks who had come from various countries and invited them for a meal. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:7.3	But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:7.4	They told the Buddha. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:7.5	“Monks, I allow you to eat in a group on big occasions. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:7.6	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:7.7.0	Seventh preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:7.7.1	‘If a monk eats in a group, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:7.9	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:8.0	Eighth sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:8.1	Soon afterwards a relative of King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha who had gone forth with the Ājīvaka ascetics went to the King and said, “Great King, I wish to make a meal for the monastics of all religions.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:8.2	“That’s fine, Sir, if you first feed the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:8.3	“I’ll do that.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:8.4	And he sent a message to the monks: “Please accept a meal from me tomorrow.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:8.5	But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:8.6	That Ājīvaka ascetic then went to the Buddha, exchanged pleasantries with him, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:8.7	“Good Gotama has gone forth and so have I. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:8.8	One who has gone forth should receive alms from another who has gone forth. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:8.9	Good Gotama, please accept a meal from me tomorrow together with the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:8.10	The Buddha consented by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:8.11	The Ājīvaka understood that the Buddha had consented, and he left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:8.12	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:8.13	“Monks, I allow you to eat in a group when the meal is given by a monastic. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32:8.14	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.0.1	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood near Vesālī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.2	At that time a succession of fine meals had been arranged in Vesālī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.3	A certain poor worker thought, “Why don’t I prepare a meal? It must be really worthwhile, seeing as these people prepare a meal with such respect.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.4	He then went to his boss Kira and said, “Sir, I wish to prepare a meal for the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.5	Please give me my salary.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.6	Because Kira also had faith and confidence, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.7	he gave the worker his salary and much extra. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.8	Soon afterwards that worker went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.9	“Venerable Sir, please accept a meal from me tomorrow together with the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.10	“The Sangha is large.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.11	“No problem! 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.12	I’ve prepare much jujube, supplemented with jujube drinks.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.13	The Buddha consented by remaining silent, and the worker understood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.14	He got up from his seat, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.15	The monks heard that a poor worker had invited the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha on the following day for a meal supplemented with jujube drinks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.16	And so they ate in the morning after walking for alms. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.17	When people heard that a poor worker had invited the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha for a meal, they brought much food of various kinds to him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.18	The following morning that worker prepared his food, and then had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.19	The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe and, together with the Sangha of monks, went to the house of that poor worker, where he sat down on the prepared seat in the dining hall. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.20	The worker served the monks, but they kept saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.21	“Give just a little.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.22	“Venerables, don’t accept so little because you think I’m just a poor worker. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.23	I’ve prepared much food of various kinds. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.24	Please accept as much as you like.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.25	“We’re not accepting so little because of that, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.26	but because we ate in the morning after walking for alms.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.27	That poor worker complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.28	“How could the venerables eat elsewhere when invited by me? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.29	Am I not able to give as much as they need?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.30	The monks heard the complaints of that worker, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.31	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.32	“How could those monks eat elsewhere when invited for a meal?” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.33	“Is it true, monks, that monks did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.34	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.35	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.36	“How could those foolish men do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.37	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:1.40	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:2.1	Soon afterwards a certain monk became sick.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:2.3	“I can’t. I’m expecting another meal.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:2.4	But since that almsfood only arrived at midday, that monk did not get to eat as much as he had intended. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:2.5	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:2.6	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:2.7	“Monks, I allow a sick monk to eat a meal before another.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:3.1	Soon afterwards, during the robe-giving season, people prepared a meal together with robe-cloth and then invited the monks, saying, “We wish to offer a meal and give robe-cloth.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:3.2	But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating a meal before another and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:3.3	As a result, they only got a small amount of robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33:3.4	They told the Buddha. …

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:0.5	34. The training rule on Kāṇamātā 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.2	At that time there was a female lay follower Kāṇamātā who had faith and confidence. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.3	She had a daughter, Kāṇā, who had been given in marriage to a man in a certain village. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.4	On one occasion Kāṇā went to her mother’s house on some business. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.5	Kāṇā’s husband sent her a message: “Please come, Kāṇā, I want you back.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.6	Kāṇamātā thought, “It’s shameful to go empty-handed,” and she baked pastries. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.7	Just when the pastries were finished, an alms-collecting monk entered Kāṇamātā’s house, and she gave him pastries. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.8	After leaving, he told another monk, and he too was given pastries. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.9	And the same happened a third time. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.10	At that, all the pastries were gone. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.11	A second time Kāṇā’s husband sent her the same message, and everything unfolded as before. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.18	A third time he sent the same message, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.19	adding, “If Kāṇā doesn’t come, I’ll find another wife.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.20	But once again all the pastries were given to monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.26	Kāṇā’s husband found another wife, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.27	And when Kāṇā heard what had happened, she cried. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.28	Soon afterwards, after robing up in the morning, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to Kāṇamātā’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.29	Kāṇamātā approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.30	The Buddha asked her why Kāṇā was crying, and she told him what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.1.31	After instructing, inspiring, and gladdening her with a teaching, the Buddha got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.1	Soon afterwards a certain caravan was ready to go south from Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.2	An alms-collecting monk went up to that caravan to get almsfood, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.3	and a lay follower gave him flour products. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.4	After leaving, that monk told another monk, and he too was given flour products. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.5	And the same happened a third time. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.6	At that, all his provisions were gone. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.7	That lay follower said to the other people in the caravan, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.8	“Sirs, please wait one day. I’ve given my provisions to the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.9	I need to prepare more.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.10	“We can’t wait. The caravan is already on its way.” And they left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.11	After preparing provisions, that lay follower followed after the caravan, but he was robbed by thieves. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.12	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.13	“How can the Sakyan monastics receive without moderation? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.14	This man gave to them, and then because he was following after the caravan he was robbed by thieves.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.15	The monks heard the complaints of those people 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.16	and they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.17	Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.18	“Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.19	for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad people, for the ease of well-behaved monks, for the restraint of corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.20	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.21.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.21.1	‘If a monk goes to a family and is invited to take pastries or baked goods, he may accept two or three bowlfuls if he wishes. If he accepts more than that, he commits an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:1.2.22	If he accepts two or three bowlfuls, he should take it away and share it with the monks. This is the proper procedure.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.1.0	Definitions 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.1.1	A monk goes to a family: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.1.2	a family: there are four kinds of families: the aristocratic family, the brahmin family, the merchant family, the worker family. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.1.3	Goes to:

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.1.11	If he wishes: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.1.12	if he desires. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.1.13	He may accept two or three bowlfuls: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.1.14	two or three bowlfuls can be accepted. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.1.15	If he accepts more than that: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.1.16	when he accepts more than that, he commits an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.1.17	If he accepts two or three bowlfuls: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.1.18	leaving that place and seeing a monk, he should tell him, “I’ve accepted two or three bowlfuls from such-and-such a place; don’t accept anything from there.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.1.19	If he sees a monk, but does not tell him, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.1.20	If one who is told accepts from there regardless, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.1.21	He should take it away and share it with the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.1.22	he should take it away when returning from almsround and then share it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.1.23	This is the proper procedure: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.1.24	this is the right method. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.2.0	Permutations 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.2.1	If it is more than two or three bowlfuls, and he perceives it as more, and he accepts it, he commits an offense entailing confession.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.2.4	If it is less than two or three bowlfuls, but he perceives it as more, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34:2.2.5	If it is less than two or three bowlfuls, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.2	a certain brahmin had invited the monks for a meal. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.3	When the monks had finished and refused an invitation to eat more, they went to their respective families, where some ate and some took away almsfood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.4	Soon afterwards that brahmin said to his neighbors, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.5	“The monks have been satisfied by me. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.6	Come, and I’ll satisfy you, too.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.7	“How could you satisfy us? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.8	Those monks who were invited by you came to our houses. Some of them ate there and some took away almsfood.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.9	That brahmin complained and criticized those monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.10	“How could the venerables eat in our house and afterwards eat elsewhere? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.11	Am I not able to give them as much as they need?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.12	The monks heard the complaints of that brahmin, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.13	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.14	“How could those monks finish their meal and refuse an invitation to eat more, and then eat elsewhere?” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.15	“Is it true, monks, that monks did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.16	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.17	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.18	“How could those foolish men do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.19	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.20	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.21.0	Preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.21.1	‘If a monk has finished his meal and refused an invitation to eat more, and then eats fresh or cooked food, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.22	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.1	Soon afterwards the monks were bringing back fine almsfood for the sick monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.2	But because the sick monks were unable to eat as much as they had intended, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.3	the monks threw the leftovers away. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.4	When the Buddha heard the loud sound of crows cawing, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.5	he asked Venerable Ānanda, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.6	“Ānanda, why is there this loud sound of crows cawing?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.7	Ānanda told him what had happened, and the Buddha said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.8	“But Ānanda, don’t the monks eat the leftovers from those who are sick?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.9	“No, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.10	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.11	“Monks, I allow you to eat the leftovers both from those who are sick and from those who are not sick. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.12	And, monks, this is how you make food leftover: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.13	‘I don’t need of any of this.’

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.2	At that time two monks were traveling through the Kosalan country on their way to Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.3	One monk misbehaved 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.4	and the other said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.5	“Don’t do that! It’s not allowable.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.6	Because of that the first monk became resentful. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.7	They then carried on to Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.8	Soon afterwards an association in Sāvatthī was offering a meal to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.9	When the second monk had finished his meal and refused an invitation to eat more, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.10	the resentful monk brought back some almsfood from his own family. He then said to the other, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.11	“Please eat!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.12	“There’s no need. I’m full.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.13	“The almsfood is nice, please eat.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.14	And because he was pressured, he ate the almsfood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.15	The resentful monk then said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.16	“Who are you to correct me when you eat food that’s not leftover even though you have finished your meal and refused an invitation to eat more?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.17	“Shouldn’t you have told me?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.18	“Shouldn’t you have asked?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.19	The second monk told the monks what had happened, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.20	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized the other, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.21	“How could a monk invite another monk to eat food that’s not leftover, when the other has finished his meal and refused an invitation to eat more ?” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.22	“Is it true, monk, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.23	“It’s true, Sir.”

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:1.2	the monks from the group of six ate fine foods that they had requested for themselves. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:1.3	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:1.4	“How can the Sakyan monastics eat fine foods that they have requested for themselves? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:1.5	Who doesn’t like nice food? Who doesn’t prefer tasty food?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:1.6	The monks heard the complaints of those people, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:1.7	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:1.8	“How can the monks from the group of six eat fine foods that they have requested for themselves?” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:1.9	“Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:1.10	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:1.11	The Buddha rebuked them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:1.12	“Foolish men, how can you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:1.13	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:1.14	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:1.15.1	‘If a monk asks for any of these kinds of fine foods for himself—that is, ghee, butter, oil, honey, syrup, fish, meat, milk, and curd—and then eats it, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:1.16	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:2.1	At one time a number of monks were sick. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:2.2	The monks who were looking after them asked, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:2.3	“I hope you’re bearing up? I hope you’re getting better?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:2.4	“Previously we ate fine foods that we had requested ourselves, and then we were comfortable. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:2.5	But now that the Buddha has prohibited this, we don’t request because we’re afraid of wrongdoing. And because of that we’re not comfortable.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:2.6	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:2.7	Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:2.8	“Monks, I allow a sick monk to eat fine foods that he has requested for himself. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:2.9	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc40:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood near Vesālī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc40:1.2	At that time a monk who only used discarded things was staying in a charnel ground. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc40:1.3	He disliked receiving things from people. Instead he would take whatever was offered to the dead at the charnel ground, at the foot of trees, or at the threshold, and he would use that. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc40:1.4	People complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc40:1.5	“How can this monk take the offerings to our ancestors and use them? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc40:1.6	This monk is big and strong. One might even suspect him of eating human flesh!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc40:1.7	The monks heard the complaints of those people, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc40:1.8	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc40:1.9	“How can this monk eat food that hasn’t been given?” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc40:1.10	“Is it true, monk, that you do this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc40:1.11	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc40:1.12	The Buddha rebuked him … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc40:1.13	“Foolish man, how can you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc40:1.14	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc40:1.17	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc40:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc40:2.1	Soon afterwards the monks did not use water or tooth cleaners because they were afraid of wrongdoing. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc40:2.2	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc40:2.3	“Monks, I allow you to use water and tooth cleaners after taking them yourselves.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood near Vesālī, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.2	the Sangha had an abundance of fresh food. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.3	Venerable Ānanda told the Buddha, who said, “Well then, Ānanda, give the pastries to those who take leftovers.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.4	“Yes, Sir.” Ānanda had them sit in a row and gave them one pastry each, until he accidentally gave two to a female wanderer. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.5	The female wanderers sitting next to her said to her, “This monastic is your lover.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.6	“He’s not. He gave me two, thinking they were one.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.7	And a second time … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.8	And a third time Ānanda gave them one pastry each, until he accidentally gave two to that same female wanderer. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.9	Once again the female wanderers sitting next to her said to her, “This monastic is your lover.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.10	“He’s not. He gave me two, thinking they were one.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.11	And they started to argue about whether or not they were lovers. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.1	A certain Ājīvaka ascetic, too, went to that distribution of food. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.2	A monk mixed rice with a large amount of ghee and gave him a large lump. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.3	He took it and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.4	Another Ājīvaka asked him, “Where did you get that lump?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.5	“From the food distribution of the ascetic Gotama, that shaven-headed householder.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.6	Some lay followers overheard that conversation between those Ājīvaka ascetics. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.7	They then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.8	“Venerable Sir, these monastics of other religions want to disparage the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.9	It would be good if the monks didn’t give anything to the monastics of other religions with their own hands.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.10	After the Buddha had instructed, inspired, and gladdened those lay followers with a teaching, they got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated him with their right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.11	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.12	“Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.13	for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad people, for the ease of well-behaved monks, for the restraint of corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.14	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.15.0	Final ruling

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc42:1.6	But since the right time for eating was coming to an end, he was unable to walk for alms. And as he returned to the monastery, there was nobody offering food, and so he missed his meal.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc43:1.3	The husband approached Upananda, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc43:1.4	He then said to his wife, “Please give him alms.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc43:1.5	And she did so. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc43:1.6	Soon afterwards he said, “Please leave, Sir, the alms have been given.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc43:1.7	But the woman, knowing that her husband was lustful, said, “Please sit, Sir, don’t go.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc43:1.8	A second time and

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc43:1.10	and both times his wife repeated hers. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc43:1.11	He then left the house and complained to the monks,

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.2	At that time a family that was supporting Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had invited him to a meal, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.3	and they had invited other monks too. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.4	But since Upananda was visiting other families before that meal, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.5	the other monks said to that family, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.6	“Please give the meal.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.7	“Please wait, Sirs, until Venerable Upananda arrives.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.8	A second time … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.9	A third time those monks said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.10	“Please give the meal before it is too late.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.11	“But we prepared the meal because of Venerable Upananda. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.12	Please wait until he arrives.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.13	Then, after visiting those families, Upananda arrived late, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.14	and those monks did not eat as much as they had intended. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.15	The monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.16	“How can Venerable Upananda visit families first when invited to a meal?” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.17	“Is it true, Upananda, that you do this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.18	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.19	The Buddha rebuked him … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.20	“Foolish man, how can you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.21	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.23.1	‘If a monk who has been invited to a meal visits families beforehand, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:1.24	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:2.1	Soon afterwards a family that was supporting Upananda sent fresh food to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:2.2	They instructed that the food should be shown to Upananda and then given to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:2.3	But on that occasion Upananda had entered the village for alms. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:2.4	When those people arrived at the monastery, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:2.5	they asked for Upananda, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:2.6	and they were told where he was. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:2.7	They said, “Venerables, after showing it to Venerable Upananda, this fresh food is to be given to the Sangha.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:2.8	The monks told the Buddha, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:2.9	who then gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:2.10	“Well then, monks, receive it and put it aside until Upananda returns.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:2.11	When he heard that the Buddha had prohibited visiting families before the meal, Upananda visited them after the meal instead. As a consequence, he returned late to the monastery, and the food had to be returned to the donors. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:2.12	The monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:2.13	“How can Venerable Upananda visit families after the meal?” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:2.14	“Is it true, Upananda, that you do this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:2.15	“It’s true, Sir.”

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:2.18	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:3.0	Third sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:3.1	Soon afterwards it was the robe-giving season. But being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not visit families. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:3.2	As a result, they only got a small amount of robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:3.3	They told the Buddha. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:3.4	“Monks, I allow you to visit families during the robe-giving season. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:3.5	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:3.7	This is the appropriate occasion: it is the robe-giving season.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:3.8	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:4.0	Fourth sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:4.1	Soon afterwards the monks were making robes, and they needed a needle, thread, and scissors. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:4.2	But being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not visit families. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:4.3	They told the Buddha. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:4.4	“Monks, I allow you to visit families at a time of making robes. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:4.5	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:4.6.0	Fourth preliminary ruling

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country in the Banyan Tree Monastery at Kapilavatthu. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.1.2	At that time Mahānāma the Sakyan had an abundance of tonics. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.1.3	He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.1.4	“Venerable Sir, I wish to invite the Sangha to ask for tonics for four months.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.1.5	“Good, good, Mahānāma. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.1.6	Please do so.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.1.7	But the monks were afraid of wrongdoing and did not accept. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.1.8	They then told the Buddha what had happened. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.1.9	“Monks, I allow you to accept an invitation to ask for tonics for four months.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.2.1	Yet the monks only asked Mahānāma for a small amount of tonics, and so he still had an abundance. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.2.2	A second time he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.2.3	“Sir, I wish to invite the Sangha to ask for tonics for a further four months.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.2.4	“Good, good, Mahānāma. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.2.5	Please do so.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.2.6	Again the monks were afraid of wrongdoing and did not accept. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.2.7	They told the Buddha. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.2.8	“Monks, I allow you to accept a further invitation.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.3.1	Once again the monks only asked Mahānāma for a small amount of tonics, and so he still had an abundance. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.3.2	A third time he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.3.3	“Sir, I wish to invite the Sangha to ask for tonics for life.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.3.4	“Good, good, Mahānāma. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.3.5	Please do so.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.3.6	Yet again the monks were afraid of wrongdoing and did not accept. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.3.7	They told the Buddha. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.3.8	“Monks, I allow you to accept a permanent invitation.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.1	At that time the monks from the group of six were shabbily dressed and improper in appearance. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.2	Mahānāma criticized them, “Venerables, why are you shabbily dressed and improper in appearance? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.3	Shouldn’t one who has gone forth be suitably dressed and proper in appearance?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.4	The monks from the group of six developed a grudge against Mahānāma. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.5	Thinking of ways to humiliate him, it occurred to them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.6	“Mahānāma has invited the Sangha to ask for tonics. Let’s ask him for ghee.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.7	They then went to Mahānāma and said, “We need a _doṇa_ measure of ghee.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.8	“Please wait until tomorrow. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.9	People have gone to the cow-pen to get ghee. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.10	You may come and get it in the morning.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.11	A second time 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.12	and a third time the monks from the group of six said the same thing, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.13	and Mahānāma replied as before. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.16	They then said, “Why do you give an invitation if you don’t wish to give?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.17	Mahānāma complained and criticized them, “How can they not wait for one day when asked?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.18	The monks heard the complaints of Mahānāma, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.19	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.20	“How could the monks from the group of six not wait for one day when asked by Mahānāma?” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.21	“Is it true, monks, that you acted like this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.22	“It’s true, Sir.”

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.24	“Foolish men, how could you act like this?

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.1	On one occasion when the Buddha was wandering in the country of Ceti on his way to Bhaddavatikā, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.2	he was seen by a number of cow-herds, shepherds, farmers, and travelers. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.3	They said to him, “Venerable Sir, don’t go to Ambatittha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.4	There’s a highly venomous dragon with supernormal powers there, in the hermitage of a dreadlocked ascetic. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.5	Don’t let it harm you.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.6	The Buddha was silent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.7	They repeated their request a second 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.8	and a third time, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.12	and the Buddha remained silent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.13	The Buddha then continued on to Bhaddavatikā, and he stayed there. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.14	Just then Venerable Sāgata went to the hermitage of that dreadlocked ascetic and entered his fire hut. After putting out a straw mat, he sat down, crossed his legs, straightened his body, and established mindfulness in front of him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.15	Seeing that Sāgata had entered the fire hut, the dragon was upset and emitted smoke. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.16	Sāgata, too, emitted smoke. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.17	The dragon was not able to contain his rage and emitted flames. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.18	Sāgata entered the fire element and he, too, emitted flames. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.19	Then, after conquering fire with fire, Sāgata went to Bhaddavatikā. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.20	After staying at Bhaddavatikā for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward Kosambī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.22	When he arrived, the lay followers there received him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.23	But the lay followers at Kosambī had heard about Sāgata fighting the Ambatittha dragon. And so after receiving the Buddha, they went to see Sāgata. They bowed, stood to one side, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.24	“Venerable, what can we prepare for you that’s delicious but hard to get?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.25	The monks from the group of six replied, “There’s a delicious liquor called Kāpotikā, which is hard for the monks to get. Prepare that.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.26	And the lay followers prepared Kāpotikā in house after house. Then, when they saw that Sāgata had entered the town for alms, they said to him, “Drink, Venerable, drink the Kāpotikā liquor.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.27	Sāgata drank that liquor in house after house, and as he was leaving town, he collapsed at the town gate. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.28	Just then the Buddha, together with a number of monks, was also leaving town, and he saw Sāgata at the town gate. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.29	He said, “Monks, pick up Sāgata.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.30	Saying, “Yes, Sir,” they led him to the monastery, where they put him down with his head toward the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.31	But Sāgata turned around, pointing his feet toward the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.32	The Buddha said, “Previously, monks, wasn’t Sāgata respectful and deferential toward me?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.33	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.34	“But is he now?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.35	“Certainly not.”

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.37	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.38	“Would he now be able to fight a dragon?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.39	“Certainly not.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.40	“So, monks, should one drink that which makes one senseless?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.41	“Certainly not, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.42	“It’s not suitable, monks, it’s not proper for Sāgata, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.43	How could Sāgata drink alcoholic drinks? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:1.44	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.2	the monks were bathing in the hot springs. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.3	Just then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha went to the hot springs, intending to wash his hair. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.4	He waited respectfully for the monks to finish, but they kept on bathing until dark. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.5	Only then was King Bimbisāra able to wash his hair. And because the town gates had been shut, he had to spend the night outside the city. In the morning, with his make-up still on, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.6	he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.7	The Buddha said to him, “Great King, why have you come so early in the morning, with your make-up still on?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.8	The King told him what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.9	The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which the King got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.10	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.11	“Is it true, monks, that monks bathed without moderation, even after seeing the King?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.12	“It’s true, Sir.”

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:2.1	Soon afterwards, because they were afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not bathe when it was hot or when they had a fever, and they went to sleep covered in sweat.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:2.3	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc59:1.2	At that time Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had transferred a robe to a monk who was his brother’s student. He then used that robe without that monk having relinquished it.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc59:1.4	“Venerable Upananada is using a robe that he has transferred to me, even though I haven’t relinquished it.”

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.0.1	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Āḷavī at the Aggāḷava Shrine. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.2	At that time the lay followers were coming to the monastery to listen to the Teaching. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.3	When the instruction was over, the senior monks went to their own dwellings, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.4	but the newly ordained monks lay down right there in the assembly hall together with the lay followers—absentminded, heedless, naked, muttering, and snoring. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.5	The lay followers complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.6	“How can the venerables lie down absentminded, heedless, naked, muttering, and snoring?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.7	The monks heard the complaints of those lay followers, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.8	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.9	“How can monks lie down in the same sleeping place as people who are not fully ordained?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.10	After rebuking those newly ordained monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.11	“Is it true, monks, that monks did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.12	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.13	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.14	“How could those foolish men do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.15	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.16	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.17.0	Preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.17.1	‘If a monk lies down in the same sleeping place as a person who is not fully ordained, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.18	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.1	After staying at Āḷavī for as long as he wanted, the Buddha set out wandering toward Kosambī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.2	When he eventually arrived, he stayed at the Badarikā Monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.3	Just then the monks there said to Venerable Rāhula, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.4	“Rāhula, the Buddha has laid down a training rule that we can’t lie down in the same sleeping place as a person who’s not fully ordained. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.5	Please find another sleeping place.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.6	Since Rāhula was not able to find a sleeping place, he lay down in the restroom. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.7	Then, after rising early in the morning, the Buddha went to the restroom, where he cleared his throat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.8	Rāhula, too, cleared his throat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.9	“Who’s there?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.10	“It’s me, Sir, Rāhula.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.11	“Why are you sitting here, Rāhula?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.12	Rāhula told the Buddha what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.13	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.14	“Monks, I allow you to lie down in the same sleeping place as a person who isn’t fully ordained for two or three nights. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.15	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc61:1.3	he shot them. He cut off their heads and then set them out in a row impaled on stakes.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.2	At that time in Rājagaha there was a group of seventeen boys who were friends, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.3	with the boy Upāli as their leader. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.4	Upāli’s parents considered, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.5	“How can we ensure that Upāli is able to live happily without exhausting himself after we’ve passed away? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.7	He could become a scribe, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.9	but then his fingers will hurt. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.10	Or he could become an accountant, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.12	but then his chest will hurt. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.13	Or he could become a money changer, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.15	but then his eyes will hurt. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.16	But these Sakyan monastics have pleasant habits and a happy life. After eating nice food, they sleep in beds sheltered from the wind. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.17	If Upāli goes forth with them, he’ll be able to live happily without exhausting himself after we’ve passed away.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.18	Upāli overheard this conversation between his parents. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.19	He then went to the other boys and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.20	“Come, let’s go forth with the Sakyan monastics.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.21	“If you go forth, so will we.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.22	And the boys went each to his own parents and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.23	“Please allow me to go forth from home to homelessness.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.25	Since the parents knew that the boys all had the same desire and good intention, they gave their approval. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.26	The boys then went to the monks and asked for the going forth. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.27	And the monks gave them both the going forth and the full ordination. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.28	Soon afterwards they got up early in the morning and cried, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.29	“Give us rice porridge, give a meal, give fresh food.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.30	The monks said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.31	“Wait until it gets light. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.32	If any of those things becomes available, you’ll be able to have it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.35	If not, you’ll have to wait until you’ve walked for alms.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.36	But they carried on as before. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.38	And they defecated and urinated on the furniture. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.39	After rising early in the morning, the Buddha heard the sound of those boys. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.40	He asked Venerable Ānanda what was going on, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.42	and Ānanda told him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.43	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.44	“Is it true, monks, that monks give the full ordination to people they know are less than twenty years old?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.45	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.46	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.47	“How can those foolish men do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.48	A person who is less than twenty years old is unable to endure cold and heat; hunger and thirst; horseflies, mosquitoes, wind, and the burning sun; creeping animals and insects; and rude and unwelcome speech.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.2	At that time the monk Ariṭṭha, the ex-vulture-killer, had the following bad and erroneous view: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.3	“As I understand the Teaching of the Buddha, the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.4	A number of monks heard 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.5	that Ariṭṭha had that view. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.8	They went to him and asked, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.9	“Is it true, Ariṭṭha,

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.11	“Yes, indeed. As I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.12	“No, Ariṭṭha, don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for it’s not good to misrepresent him. The Buddha would never say such a thing. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.13	The Buddha has given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.14	The Buddha has said that there is little enjoyment in worldly pleasures, but much suffering and much trouble, and that the danger in them is greater. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.15	The Buddha has said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.16	similar to a piece of meat …

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.25	But even though the monks corrected Ariṭṭha like this, he stubbornly held on to that bad and erroneous view, and continued to insist on it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.27	Since they were unable to make him give up that view, they went to the Buddha and told him what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.28	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Ariṭṭha:

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.2	Venerable Anuruddha was walking through the Kosalan country on his way to Sāvatthī, when one evening he arrived at a certain village. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.3	Just then a woman in that village had prepared her guesthouse. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.4	Anuruddha went to that woman and said, “If it’s not inconvenient for you, I’d like to stay in your guesthouse for one night.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.5	“Please stay, Venerable.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.6	Other travelers also went to that woman and said, “Madam, if it’s not troublesome for you, we’d like to stay in your guesthouse for one night.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.7	“Sirs, a monastic is already staying there. If he agrees, you may stay.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.8	Those travelers then approached Anuruddha and said, “If you don’t mind, Venerable, we’d like to stay one night in the guesthouse.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.9	“No problem.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.10	Now as soon as that woman had seen Anuruddha, she had fallen in love with him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.11	She now went to him and said, “Sir, you won’t be comfortable surrounded by these people. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.12	Why don’t I prepare a bed for you in the main house?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.13	Anuruddha consented by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.14	After preparing a bed in the main house, she put on jewelery and perfume, and she went to Anuruddha and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.15	“You’re attractive, Sir, and so am I. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.16	Why don’t you take me as your wife?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.17	But Anuruddha remained silent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.18	She said the same thing a second time, but again got no response. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.19	And a third time she said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.20	“You’re attractive, Sir, and so am I. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.21	Why don’t you take me and all this property?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.22	Once again Anuruddha remained silent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.23	She then threw off her wrap, and she walked up and down, stood, sat down, and lay down in front of him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.24	But Anuruddha controlled his senses and neither looked at nor spoke to her. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.25	Then that woman said, “It’s astonishing and amazing. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.26	Many people pay a hundred or a thousand coins to be with me. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.27	But this monastic doesn’t want me and all this property, even when I beg him!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.28	After dressing, she bowed down with her head at Anuruddha’s feet and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.29	“Sir, I’ve made a mistake. I’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.30	Please forgive me so that I may restrain myself in the future.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.31	“You have certainly made a mistake. You’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.32	But since you acknowledge your mistake and make proper amends, I forgive you. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.33	For this is called growth in the training of the noble ones: acknowledging a mistake, making proper amends, and undertaking restraint for the future.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.34	The following morning that woman personally served and satisfied Anuruddha with various kinds of fine food. When he had finished his meal, she bowed and sat down to one side. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.35	And Anuruddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.36	She then said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.37	“Wonderful, Sir, wonderful! 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.38	Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what had been hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see what is there—
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.39	even so have you made the Teaching clear in many ways. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.40	I go for refuge to the Buddha and to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.41	Please accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.42	Soon afterwards, after arriving at Sāvatthī, Anuruddha told the monks what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.43	The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.44	“How can Venerable Anuruddha lie down in the same sleeping place as a woman?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.45	After rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Anuruddha: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.46	“Is it true, Anuruddha, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.47	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.48	The Buddha rebuked him … “Anuruddha, how could you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.49	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.10	“No, Kaṇṭaka, don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for it’s not good to misrepresent him. The Buddha would never say such a thing. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.11	The Buddha has given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.12	The Buddha has said that there’s little enjoyment in worldly pleasures, but much suffering and much trouble, and that the danger in them is greater. … ” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.13	But even though the monks corrected Kaṇṭaka like this, he stubbornly held on to that bad and erroneous view, and he continued to insist on it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.15	Since those monks were unable to make him give up that view, they went to the Buddha and told him what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.16	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the Kaṇṭaka: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.17	“Is it true, Kaṇṭaka, that you have such a view?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.19	“Yes indeed, Venerable Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.20	“Foolish man, who do you think I have taught like this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.21	Haven’t I given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.22	I have said that there is little enjoyment in worldly pleasures, but much suffering and much trouble, and that the danger in them is greater. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.23	I have said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.24	similar to a snake’s head; they are much suffering and much trouble, and the danger in them is greater. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.25	And yet, foolish man, by misunderstanding you have misrepresented me, hurt yourself, and made much demerit. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.26	This will be for your long-lasting harm and suffering. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.27	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.28	and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.29	Having rebuked him … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.30	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.31	“Well then, monks, the Sangha should expel the novice monastic Kaṇṭaka. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.32	And this is how he should be expelled: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.33	‘From today, Kaṇṭaka, you may not refer to the Buddha as your teacher. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.34	And you can no longer share a sleeping place with the monks for two or three nights, as can other novices. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.35	Go! Away with you!’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.36	The Sangha then expelled Kaṇṭaka. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.37	Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six supported Kaṇṭaka, and they were attended on by him, lived with him, and shared a sleeping place with him. Yet they knew that he had been expelled. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.38	The monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.39	“How can the monks from the group of six support Kaṇṭaka, and be attended on by him, live with him, and share a sleeping place with him, even though they know that he has been expelled?” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.40	“Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.41	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.42	The Buddha rebuked them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.43	“Foolish men, how can you do this?

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc7:1.3	After robing up one morning, he took his bowl and robe and went to a certain family. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc7:1.4	Just then the housewife was sitting at the entrance door and the daughter-in-law at the door to one of the rooms. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc7:1.5	Udāyī went up to the housewife and gave her a teaching, whispering in her ear. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc7:1.6	And the daughter-in-law thought,

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc7:1.8	After teaching the housewife in this way, Udāyī went up to the daughter-in-law and gave her a teaching in the same way. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc7:1.9	Then the housewife thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc7:1.10	“Is this monastic my daughter-in-law’s lover, or is he speaking indecently?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc7:1.11	When Udāyī had left,

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc7:1.16	“He gave me a teaching, too.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc7:1.17	And they complained and criticized him,

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.1.2	King Pasenadi of Kosala told his park-keeper, “Go and clean up the park; I’ll be going there.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.1.3	“Yes, sir.” While cleaning the park, he saw the Buddha seated at the foot of a tree. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.1.4	He then went to King Pasenadi and said, “The park is clean, sir, but the Buddha is sitting there.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.1.5	“Marvellous! I’ll visit him.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.1.6	The King went to the park and approached the Buddha, but just then a lay follower was seated there. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.1.7	When the King saw him, he became fearful and stopped. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.1.8	But he considered, “This man isn’t likely to be bad, since he’s visiting the Buddha,” and so he approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.1.9	But when that lay follower, because of his respect for the Buddha, neither bowed down to the King nor stood up for him, the King became annoyed. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.1.10	The Buddha realized what was happening and said to the King, “Great King, this lay follower is learned, a master of the tradition, and he’s free from sensual desire.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.1.11	The King thought, “This lay follower doesn’t deserve to be in an inferior position, since even the Buddha praises him.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.1.12	And he said to that lay follower, “Please say what you want.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.1.13	“Thank you, sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.1.14	The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened King Pasenadi with a teaching, after which the King got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.1.15	Soon afterwards King Pasenadi was up in his best stilt house, when he saw that lay follower walking along the street, holding a sunshade. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.1.16	He summoned him and said, “You are a learned Buddhist, a master of the tradition. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.1.17	It would be good if you would teach my harem.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.1.18	“Whatever I know, sir, I know because of the monks. They should teach the harem.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.2.1	Knowing that the lay follower was right, the King went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.2.2	“It would be good, Venerable Sir, if you would tell a monk to teach my harem.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.2.3	The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened King Pasenadi with a teaching, after which the King got up from his seat, paid his respects as before, and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.2.4	Soon afterwards, the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda, “Well then, Ānanda, teach the King’s harem.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.2.5	“Yes, Sir.” And from time to time he would enter the harem and teach. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.2.6	Then, after robing up one the morning, Ānanda took his bowl and robe and went to King Pasenadi’s house. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.2.7	On that occasion the King was in bed with Queen Mallikā. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.2.8	The Queen saw Ānanda coming and she quickly got up, but her burnished golden dressing gown fell off. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.2.9	Ānanda turned around right there and returned to the monastery. And he told the monks what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.2.10	The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.2.11	“How could Venerable Ānanda enter the royal compound without first being announced?” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.2.12	“Is it true, Ānanda, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.2.13	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.2.14	The Buddha rebuked him … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.2.15	“Ānanda, how could you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.2.16	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.2.17	Having rebuked him … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.2.18	the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.1	“Monks, there are these ten dangers in entering a royal compound. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.2	What ten? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.3	It may be that a monk enters where the king is sitting with his queen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.4	The queen smiles when she sees the monk 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.5	or the monk smiles when he sees the queen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.6	The king thinks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.7	‘Surely they’ve done it, or they’re going to.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.9	Again, because the king is very busy, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.10	he does not remember having slept with a certain woman, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.11	yet she becomes pregnant because of that. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.12	The king thinks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.13	‘Only the monk enters here. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.14	Is he responsible for this?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.16	Again, a gem disappears from the royal compound. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.17	The king thinks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.18	‘Only the monk enters here. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.19	Is he responsible for this?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.21	Again, secret discussions in the royal compound are spread outside. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.22	The king thinks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.23	‘Only the monk enters here. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.24	Is he responsible for this?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.26	Again, in the royal compound a father assails his son, or a son assails his father. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.27	They think, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.28	‘Only the monk enters here. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.29	Is he responsible for this?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.31	Again, the king promotes someone. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.32	Those who dislike this think, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.33	‘The king is close to the monk. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.34	Is he responsible for this?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.36	Again, the king demotes someone. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.37	Those who dislike this think, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.38	‘The king is close to the monk. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.39	Is he responsible for this?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.41	Again, the king sends out the army at an inappropriate time. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.42	Those who dislike this think, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.43	‘The king is close to the monk. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.44	Is he responsible for this?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.46	Again, after sending out the army at an appropriate time, the king orders it to turn back while still en route. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.47	Those who dislike this think, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.48	‘The king is close to the monk. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.49	Is he responsible for this?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.51	Again, a royal compound is crowded with elephants, horses, and chariots, as well as enticing sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles that are not suitable for a monk. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.53	Monks, these are the ten dangers in entering a royal compound.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.54	Then, after rebuking Ānanda in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … the Buddha said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.55	“And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.56.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.56.1	‘If a monk, without first being announced, crosses the threshold to the bedroom of a consecrated aristocrat king, when both the king and the queen are present, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.0.1	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.2	a monk was bathing in the river Aciravatī, when a brahmin, too, came there to bathe. He deposited a bag with five hundred coins on the ground, bathed, forgot about the bag, and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.3	The monk thought, “This is the bag belonging to that brahmin; it wouldn’t be nice if it got lost,” and he picked it up. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.4	Soon the brahmin remembered. He hurried back and asked that monk, “Sir, did you see my bag?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.5	Saying, “I did indeed,” he gave it to him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.6	The brahmin thought, “How can I avoid giving a reward to this monk?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.7	And he said, “I didn’t have five hundred coins, I had a thousand!” And he seized hold of that monk. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.8	After being released, that monk went to the monastery and told the monks what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.9	The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.10	“How could a monk pick up precious things?” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.11	“Is it true, monk, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.12	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.13	The Buddha rebuked him … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.14	“Foolish man, how could you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.15	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.16	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.17.0	First preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.17.1	‘If a monk picks up something precious or something regarded as precious, or he has it picked up, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.18	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.1	Soon afterwards they were holding a celebration in Sāvatthī, with people going to the park all dressed up, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.2	as did Visākhā Migāramātā. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.3	As she was leaving her village, she thought, “What will I do when I get to the park? Why don’t I pay a visit to the Buddha!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.4	She then removed all her ornaments, bound them in a bundle with her upper robe, and gave it to her slave girl, saying, “Listen, look after this bundle.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.5	Visākhā then went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.6	And the Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching, after which she got up from her seat, bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.7	And the slave girl left too, forgetting the bundle. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.8	The monks saw it and told the Buddha. “Well then, monks, pick it up and put it aside.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.9	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.10	“Within a monastery, monks, you should pick up precious things or what’s regarded as precious, or have it picked up, and then put it aside with the thought, ‘Whoever owns this will come and get it.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.11	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.12.0	Second preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.12.1	‘If a monk picks up something precious or something regarded as precious, or he has it picked up, except within a monastery, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.13	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.0	Third sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.1	At that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika had a whole village working for him in the country of Kāsī, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.2	and he had told an apprentice there that if the monks arrived he should make them a meal. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.3	Soon afterwards a number of monks were wandering in the country of Kāsī, when they came to that village. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.4	When that man saw them coming, he approached them, bowed, and said, “Venerables, please accept a meal from Anāthapiṇḍika tomorrow.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.5	The monks accepted by remaining silent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.6	The following morning, after having various kinds of fine food prepared, he had the monks informed that it was time for the meal. He removed a ring from his finger and then offered the food to the monks, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.7	“Venerables, please leave after you’ve eaten. I have to go to work.” And he left, forgetting his ring. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.8	The monks saw it and said, “If we just go, this ring will be lost,” and so they stayed right there. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.9	When that man returned from work, he saw the monks and said to them, “Why are you still here?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.10	And the monks told him what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.11	Those monks then went to Sāvatthī where they told the monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.12	who in turn told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.13	After giving a teaching, the Buddha addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.14	“Within a monastery, monks, or inside a lodging, you should pick up precious things or what’s regarded as precious, or have it picked up, and then put it aside with the thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.15	‘Whoever owns this will come and get it.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.16	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.17.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.17.1	‘If a monk picks up something precious or something regarded as precious, or he has it picked up, except within a monastery or inside a lodging, he commits an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.18	If he picks up something precious or something regarded as precious, or he has it picked up, within a monastery or inside a lodging, he should put it aside with the thought, “Whoever owns it will fetch it.” This is the proper procedure.’”

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:4.1.5	Something precious:

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:4.1.7	Something regarded as precious: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:4.1.8	whatever people regard as valuable or useful—this is called “regarded as precious”. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:4.1.9	Except within a monastery or inside a lodging:

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:4.1.19	If he picks up something precious or something regarded as precious, or he has it picked up, within a monastery or inside a lodging, he should put it aside: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:4.1.20	after taking note of its appearance or distinguishing marks, he should put it aside, and then make an announcement: “Whoever has lost anything should come.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:4.1.21	If anyone comes, they should be told, “Please describe your goods.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:4.1.22	If they rightly describe the appearance or distinguishing marks, it should be given to them. If they do not, they should be told, “Keep looking.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:4.1.23	If that monk is leaving that monastery, he should first place those goods into the hands of suitable monks there. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:4.1.24	If there are no suitable monks, he should place those goods into the hands of suitable householders there. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:4.1.25	This is the proper procedure:

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc85:1.2	At that time the monks from the group of six entered the village at the wrong time, sat down in the public meeting hall, and talked about all sorts of pointless things: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc85:1.3	about kings, gangsters, and officials; about armies, dangers, and battles; about food, drink, clothes, and beds; about garlands and perfumes; about relatives, vehicles, villages, towns, and countries; about women and heroes; gossip; about the departed; about various trivialities; about the world and the sea; about the various kinds of existence. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc85:1.4	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc85:1.5	“How can the Sakyan monastics enter the village at the wrong time, sit down in the public meeting hall, and talk about such pointless things? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc85:1.7	They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc85:1.8	The monks heard the complaints of those people, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc85:1.9	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc85:2.2	People saw them and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc85:2.3	“Venerables, please enter the village.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc85:2.5	But knowing that entering a village at the wrong time had been prohibited by the Buddha and being afraid of wrongdoing, they declined. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc85:2.6	And so thieves robbed them.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:1.11	“Foolish men, how can you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:1.12	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:1.13	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:1.14.0	Preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:1.14.1	‘If a monk is having a sitting mat made, it is to be made the right size. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:1.15	This is the right size: two standard handspans long and one-and-a-half wide. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:1.16	If it exceeds that, it is to be cut down, and he commits an offense entailing confession.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:1.17	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:2.1	At that time there was a big monk called Venerable Udāyī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:2.2	After putting out his sitting mat in front of the Buddha, he stretched it on all sides before sitting down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:2.3	The Buddha asked him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:2.4	“Udāyī, why are you stretching the sitting mat on all sides, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:2.5	as if an old hide?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:2.6	“Because, Venerable Sir, the sitting mat you’ve allowed for the monks is too small.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:2.7	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:2.8	“Monks, I allow a border of one handspan for the sitting mat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:2.9	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:2.10.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:2.10.1	‘If a monk is having a sitting mat made, it should be made the right size. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:2.11	This is the right size: two standard handspans long and one-and-a-half wide, and a border of one handspan. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:2.12	If it exceeds that, it is to be cut down, and he commits an offense entailing confession.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.1.0	Definitions 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.1.1	A sitting mat: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.1.2	one with a border is what is meant. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.1.3	Is having made: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.1.4	making it himself or having it made, it should be made the right size. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.1.5	This is the right size: two standard handspans long and one-and-a-half wide, and a border of one handspan. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.1.6	If he makes one, or has one made, that exceeds that, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.1.7	When he gets it, it is to be cut down, and he is then to confess an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.1.8.0	Permutations 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.1.8.1	If he finishes what he began himself, he commits an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.1.9	If he has others finish what he began himself, he commits an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.1.10	If he finishes himself what was begun by others, he commits an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.1.11	If he has others finish what was begun by others, he commits an offense entailing confession. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.1.12	If he makes one or has one made for the benefit of someone else, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.1.13	If he gets one that was made by someone else and then uses it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.2.0	Non-offenses 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.2.1	There is no offense: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.2.2	if he makes it the right size; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.2.3	if he makes it smaller than the right size; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.2.4	if he gets one made by another that exceeds the right size and then cuts it down before using it; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.2.5	if he makes a canopy, a floor cover, a cloth screen, a mattress, or a pillow; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.2.6	if he is insane; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.2.7	if he is the first offender. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89:3.2.8	The training rule on sitting mats, the seventh, is finished.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:0.5	8. The training rule on telling truthfully 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood near Vesālī, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.2	a number of monks who were friends had entered the rainy-season residence on the banks of the river Vaggumudā. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.3	At that time Vajjī was short of food and afflicted with hunger, with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to straw. It was not easy to get by on almsfood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.4	The monks considered the difficult circumstances, and they thought, “How can we live in concord and harmony, have a comfortable rainy season, and get almsfood without trouble?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.5	Some said, “We could work for the householders, and they’ll support us in return.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.6	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.7	Others said, “There’s no need to work for the householders. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.8	Let’s instead take messages for them, and they’ll support us in return.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.9	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.10	Still others said, “There’s no need to do work or take messages for them. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.11	Let’s instead talk up one another’s superhuman qualities to the householders: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.12	‘That monk has the first absorption, that monk the second absorption, that monk the third, that monk the fourth; that monk is a stream-enterer, that monk a once-returner, that a non-returner, that a perfected one; that monk has the three true insights, and that the six direct knowledges.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.13	Then they’ll support us. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.14	In this way we’ll live in concord and harmony, spend the rainy season in comfort, and have no trouble getting almsfood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.15	This is the way to go.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.16	Then those monks did just that. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.17	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.18	And the people there thought, “We’re so fortunate that such monks have come to us for the rainy-season residence. Such virtuous and good monks have never before entered the rains residence with us.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.19	And they gave such food and drink to those monks that they did not even eat and drink themselves, or give to their parents, to their wives and children, to their slaves, servants, and workers, to their friends and companions, or to their relatives. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.1.21	Soon those monks had a good color, bright faces, clear skin, and sharp senses. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.1	Now it was the custom for monks who had completed the rainy-season residence to go and visit the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.2	And so, when the three months were over and they had completed the rains residence, those monks put their dwellings in order, took their bowls and robes, and set out for Vesālī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.3	When they eventually arrived, they went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.4	There they approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.5	At that time the monks who had completed the rains residence in that region were thin, haggard and pale, with veins protruding all over their bodies. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.6	Yet the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā had a good color, bright faces, clear skin, and  sharp senses. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.7	Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.8	the Buddha said to them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.9	“I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re getting by. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.10	I hope you had a comfortable rains residence, living in concord and harmony, and that you had no trouble getting almsfood?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.11	“We’re keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re getting by. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.12	We had a comfortable rains residence, living in concord and harmony, and we had no trouble getting almsfood.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.13	When Buddhas know what is going on, sometimes they ask and sometimes not. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.14	They know the right time to ask and when not to ask. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.15	Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, otherwise not, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.16	for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.17	Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.18	And the Buddha said to those monks, “In what way, monks, did you have a comfortable rains residence, with no trouble getting almsfood?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.19	They then told him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.20	“But did you really have those superhuman qualities?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.21	“Yes, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.22	The Buddha rebuked them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.23	“How could you for the sake of your stomachs talk up one another’s superhuman qualities to householders? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.24	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.25	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.26.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.26.1	‘If a monk truthfully tells a person who is not fully ordained of a superhuman quality, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc92:1.2	At that time there was a handsome and graceful monk called Venerable Nanda, the Buddha’s cousin. He was 7 centimeters shorter than the Buddha,

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc9:1.3	He then committed an offense of intentional emission of semen. He asked the Sangha for probation for that offense, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc9:1.4	which he received. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc9:1.5	Just then an association in Sāvatthī was offering a meal to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc9:1.6	Because Upananda was on probation, he sat on the last seat in the dining hall. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc9:1.7	The monks from the group of six then told those lay followers,

pli-tv-bu-vb-pc9:1.9	After committing an offense of intentional emission of semen, he asked the Sangha for probation for that offense, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc9:1.10	which he received. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pc9:1.11	And because he’s on probation, he now sits on the last seat.”

pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:0.4	1. The first training rule on acknowledgment 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:0.5	Venerables, these four rules on acknowledgment come up for recitation. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.2	a certain nun was returning from almsround in Sāvatthī. She saw a monk and said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.3	“Here, Venerable, please take some almsfood.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.4	Saying, “Alright, Sister,” he took everything. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.5	But because the time for eating was coming to an end, she was not able to go for alms, and she missed her meal. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.6	The next day 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.7	and the following day the same thing happened again. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.11	On the fourth day that nun was walking along a street, trembling. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.12	A wealthy merchant coming by carriage in the opposite direction saw her and shouted out, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.13	“Watch out, Venerable!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.14	As she stepped aside, she collapsed right there. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.15	And the merchant asked her for forgiveness: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.16	“Forgive me, Venerable, since you fell because of me.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.17	“I didn’t fall because of you, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.18	but because I’m weak.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.19	“But why are you so weak?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.20	The nun told him what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.21	He then brought her to his house and gave her a meal. Afterwards he complained and criticized the monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.22	“How can the venerables receive food directly from a nun? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.23	It’s difficult for women to get material support.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.24	The monks heard the complaints of that merchant, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.25	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized that monk, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.26	“How could a monk receive food directly from a nun?” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.27	“Is it true, monk, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.28	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.29	“Is she a relative of yours?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.30	“No, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.31	“Foolish man, a man and a woman who are unrelated don’t know what’s appropriate and inappropriate, what’s good and bad, in dealing with each other. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.32	So how could you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.33	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.34	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.35.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1:1.35.1	‘If a monk receives fresh or cooked food directly from an unrelated nun who has entered an inhabited area, and then eats it, he must acknowledge it:

pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:1.2	At that time, when families invited monks to meals, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:1.3	the nuns from the group of six were directing people toward the monks from the group of six, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:1.4	“Give curry here; give rice here.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:1.5	The monks from the group of six ate as much as they wanted, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:1.6	but not so the other monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:1.7	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:1.8	“How could the monks from the group of six not restrain the nuns from giving directions?” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:1.9	“Is it true, monks, that you didn’t do this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:1.10	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:1.11	The Buddha rebuked them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:1.12	“Foolish men, how could you not do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:1.13	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:1.14	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:1.15.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:1.15.1	‘When monks eat at invitations to families, if a nun is there giving directions, saying, “Give bean curry here; give rice here,” then those monks should stop her: “Stop, Sister, while the monks are eating.” If not even a single monk addresses that nun in this way to stop her, they must acknowledge it: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:1.16	“We have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing which is to be acknowledged. We acknowledge it.”’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.1.0	Definitions 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.1.1	When monks eat at invitations to families: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.1.2	a family: there are four kinds of families: the aristocratic family, the brahmin family, the merchant family, the worker family. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.1.3	Eat at invitations: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.1.4	eat any of the five cooked foods at invitations. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.1.5	A nun: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.1.6	she has been given the full ordination by both Sanghas. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.1.7	Giving directions: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.1.8	saying, “Give bean curry here; give rice here,” according to friendship, according to companionship, according to who one is devoted to, according to being a co-student, according to being a co-pupil—this is called “giving directions”. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.1.9	Those monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.1.10	the monks who are eating. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.1.11	Her: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.1.12	the nun who is giving directions. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.1.13	Those monks should stop her: ‘Stop, Sister, while the monks are eating’: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.1.14	if she is not stopped by even one monk, and a monk then receives food with the intention of eating it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.1.15	For every mouthful, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.2.0	Permutations 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.2.1	If she is fully ordained, and he perceives her as such, and he does not restrain her from giving directions, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.2.2	If she is fully ordained, but he is unsure of it, and he does not restrain her from giving directions, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.2.3	If she is fully ordained, but he does not perceive her as such, and he does not restrain her from giving directions, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.2.4	If he does not restrain a nun who is fully ordained only on one side from giving directions, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.2.5	If the person is not fully ordained, but he perceives them as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.2.6	If the person is not fully ordained, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.2.7	If the person is not fully ordained, and he does not perceive them as such, there is no offense. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.3.0	Non-offenses 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.3.1	There is no offense: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.3.2	if a nun has someone else give her own food, but she does not give it herself; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.3.3	if a nun gives someone else’s food, but she does not have anyone give it; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.3.4	if a nun has someone give what has not yet been given; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.3.5	if a nun has someone give to someone who has not yet received anything; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.3.6	if a nun has someone give equally to all; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.3.7	if a trainee nun is giving directions; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.3.8	if a novice nun is giving directions; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.3.9	if it is anything apart from the five kinds of cooked food; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.3.10	if he is insane; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.3.11	if he is the first offender. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2:2.3.12	The second training rule on acknowledgment is finished.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.0.1	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.2	At that time in Sāvatthī there was a family where both the husband and the wife had confidence. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.3	They were growing in faith, but declining in wealth. Whatever food they had in the morning, they gave to the monks. Sometimes they went without food. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.4	People complained and criticized the monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.5	“How can the Sakyan monastics not have a sense of moderation in receiving offerings? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.6	After giving to them, these people sometimes go without.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.7	The monks heard the complaints of those people 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.8	and they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.9	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.10	“Monks, if a family’s faith is growing, but its wealth is declining, I allow you to designate it as ‘in training’, through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and one announcement. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.11	And the designation should be given like this. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.12	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.13	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.14	Such-and-such a family is growing in faith, but declining in wealth. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.15	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should designate that family as “in training”. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.16	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.17	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.18	Such-and-such a family is growing in faith, but declining in wealth. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.19	The Sangha designates that family as “in training”. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.20	Any monk who approves of designating that family as “in training” should remain silent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.21	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.22	The Sangha designates such-and-such a family as “in training”. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.23	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.24	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.25.0	First preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.25.1	‘There are families that are designated as “in training”. If a monk eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from such a family, he must acknowledge it: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.26	“I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.27	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:2.1	Soon afterwards there was a celebration in Sāvatthī 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:2.2	and people invited the monks for a meal. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:2.3	And so did the family that had been designated as in training. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:2.5	But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from such a family, and being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not accept. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:2.6	That family complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:2.7	“What is it with us that they don’t receive from us?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:2.8	The monks heard the complaints of those people 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:2.9	and they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:2.10	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:2.11	“Monks, if you have been invited, I allow you to eat fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from a family designated as in training. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:2.12	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:2.13.0	Second preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:2.13.1	‘There are families that are designated as “in training”. If a monk, without first being invited, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from such a family, he must acknowledge it: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:2.14	“I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:2.15	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:3.0	Third sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:3.1	Soon afterwards a certain monk was associating with that family. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:3.2	One morning he robed up, took his bowl and robe, went to them, and sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:3.3	Just then that monk was sick, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:3.4	and so they invited him to eat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:3.7	But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited an uninvited monk from eating fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from such a family, and being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not accept. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:3.8	And being unable to walk for alms, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:3.9	he missed his meal. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:3.10	He then returned to the monastery and told the monks what had happened, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:3.11	who in turn told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:3.12	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:3.13	“Monks, I allow a sick monk to eat fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from a family designated as in training. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:3.14	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:4.1.0	Definitions 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:4.1.1	There are families that are designated as “in training”: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:4.1.2	a family designated as in training: a family in which the faith is growing but the wealth is declining. Such a family is designated as “in training” through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and one announcement. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:4.1.3	A: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:4.1.4	whoever … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:4.1.5	Monk: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:4.1.6	… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:4.1.7	Such a family: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:4.1.8	that kind of family. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:4.1.9	Without being invited: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:4.1.10	not invited for later on the same day or for the following day, but only after entering the vicinity of the house—this is called “without being invited”. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:4.1.11	Invited: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:4.1.12	invited for later on the same day or for the following day, but not after entering the vicinity of the house—this is called “invited”.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:4.1.20	there are five kinds of cooked food: cooked grain, porridge, flour  products, fish, and meat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:4.1.21	If, without being sick and without being invited, he receives fresh or cooked food with the intention of eating it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country in the Banyan Tree Monastery at Kapilavatthu, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.2	the slaves of the Sakyans were rebelling. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.3	The Sakyan women wished to prepare a meal at the wilderness dwellings, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.4	but the slaves heard about this 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.6	and infested the path. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.7	When the Sakyan women took various kinds of fine food and set out for a wilderness dwelling, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.8	the slaves emerged, and they robbed and raped those Sakyan women. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.9	Soon afterwards the Sakyan men came out, and they got hold of those criminals together with their loot. They then complained and criticized the monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.10	“How could they not announce that there are criminals staying in the monastery?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.11	The monks heard the complaints of the Sakyans 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.12	and they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.13	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.14	“Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons: for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad people, for the ease of well-behaved monks, for the restraint of corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.15	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.26	apart from the five cooked foods, the post-midday tonics, the seven-day tonics, and the lifetime tonics—the rest is called “fresh food”. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.27	Cooked food: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.28	there are five kinds of cooked food: cooked grain, porridge, flour products, fish, and meat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.29	Inside that monastery: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.30	if the monastery is enclosed, then within the enclosure. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.31	If the monastery is unenclosed, then in the vicinity. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.32	Who is not sick: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.33	who is able to walk for alms. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.34	Who is sick: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.35	who is unable to walk for alms. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.36	If, without making an announcement, one who is not sick receives fresh or cooked food with the intention of eating it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.37	For every mouthful, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.38.0	Permutations 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.38.1	If there has been no announcement, and he does not perceive that there has, and he, not being sick, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it inside that monastery, then he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.39	If there has been no announcement, but he is unsure of it, and he, not being sick, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it inside that monastery, then he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.40	If there has been no announcement, but he perceives that there has, and he, not being sick, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it inside that monastery, then he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.41	If he receives post-midday tonics, seven-day tonics, or lifetime tonics for the purpose of food, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.42	For every mouthful, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.43	If there has been an announcement, but he does not perceive that there has, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.44	If there has been an announcement, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.45	If there has been an announcement, and he perceives that there has, there is no offense. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.2.0	Non-offenses 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.2.1	There is no offense: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.2.2	if there has been an announcement; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.2.3	if he is sick; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.2.4	if he eats the leftovers from where there has been an announcement or from one who is sick; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.2.5	if he receives the food outside the monastery and then eats it inside; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.2.6	if he eats a root, bark, a leaf, a flower, or a fruit originating in that monastery; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.2.7	if, when there is a reason, he uses post-midday tonics, seven-day tonics, or lifetime tonics; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.2.8	if he is insane; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.2.9	if he is the first offender. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.2.10	The fourth training rule entailing acknowledgment is finished. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.2.11	“Venerables, the four rules on acknowledgment have been recited. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.2.12	In regard to this I ask you, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.2.13	‘Are you pure in this?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.2.14	A second time I ask, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.2.15	‘Are you pure in this?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.2.16	A third time I ask, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.2.17	‘Are you pure in this?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.2.18	You are pure in this and therefore silent. I will remember it thus.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.2.19	The chapter on offenses entailing acknowledgment is finished.
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:0.1	Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:0.2	The monks’ rules and their analysis 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:0.3	The chapter on offenses entailing expulsion 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:0.4	The first training rule on expulsion 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:0.5	The chapter on Verañjā 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.0.1	Homage to the Buddha, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.0.2	The origin of the Monastic Law 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Verañjā at the foot of Naḷeru’s Nimba tree with a large sangha of five hundred monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.1.2	A brahmin in Verañjā was told: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.1.3	“Sir, the ascetic Gotama, the Sakyan, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, is staying at Verañjā at the foot of Naleru’s Nimba tree with a large sangha of five hundred monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.1.4	That good Gotama has a fine reputation: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.1.5	‘He is a Buddha, perfected and fully awakened, complete in insight and conduct, happy, knower of the world, supreme leader of trainable people, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, a Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.1.6	With his own insight he has seen this world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings, this society with its monastics and brahmins, its gods and humans, and he makes it known to others. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.1.7	He has a Teaching that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. It has a true goal and is well articulated. He sets out a perfectly complete and pure spiritual life.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.1.8	It’s good to see such perfected ones.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.2.1	That brahmin then went to the Buddha, exchanged pleasantries with him, sat down, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.2.2	“I’ve heard, good Gotama, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.2.3	that you don’t bow down to old brahmins, stand up for them, or offer them a seat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.2.4	I’ve now seen that this is indeed the case. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.2.5	This isn’t right.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.2.6	“Brahmin, in the world with its gods, lords of death, and supreme beings, in this society with its monastics and brahmins, its gods and humans, I don’t see anyone I should bow down to, rise up for, or offer a seat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.2.7	If I did, their head would explode.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.1	“Good Gotama lacks taste.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.2	“Thereʼs a way you could rightly say that I lack taste. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.3	For Iʼve abandoned the taste for forms, sounds, smells, flavors, and touches. Iʼve cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, eradicated it, and made it incapable of reappearing in the future. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.4	But that’s not what you had in mind.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.5	“Good Gotama is unlikeable.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.6	“Thereʼs a way you could rightly say that I’m unlikeable. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.7	For Iʼve abandoned the liking of forms, sounds, smells, flavors, and touches. Iʼve cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, eradicated it, and made it incapable of reappearing in the future. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.8	But that’s not what you had in mind.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.9	“Good Gotama teaches inaction.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.10	“Thereʼs a way you could rightly say that I teach inaction. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.11	For I teach the non-doing of misconduct by body, speech, and mind. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.12	I teach the non-doing of the various kinds of bad, unwholesome actions. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.13	But that’s not what you had in mind.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.14	“Good Gotama is an annihilationist.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.15	“Thereʼs a way you could rightly say that I’m an annihilationist. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.16	For I teach the annihilation of sensual desire, ill will, and confusion. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.17	I teach the annihilation of the various kinds of bad, unwholesome qualities. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.18	But that’s not what you had in mind.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.19	“Good Gotama is detestable.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.20	“Thereʼs a way you could rightly say that I’m detestable. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.21	For I detest misconduct by body, speech, and mind. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.22	I detest having the various kinds of bad, unwholesome qualities. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.23	But that’s not what you had in mind.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.24	“Good Gotama is an exterminator.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.25	“Thereʼs a way you could rightly say that I’m an exterminator. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.26	For I teach the extermination of sensual desire, ill will, and confusion. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.27	I teach the extermination of the various kinds of bad, unwholesome qualities. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.28	But that’s not what you had in mind.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.29	“Good Gotama is austere.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.30	“Thereʼs a way you could rightly say that I’m austere. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.31	For I say that bad, unwholesome qualities—misconduct by body, speech, and mind—are to be disciplined. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.32	One who has abandoned them, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, eradicated them, and made them incapable of reappearing in the future—such a one I call austere. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.33	Now Iʼve abandoned the bad, unwholesome qualities that are to be disciplined. Iʼve cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, eradicated them, and made them incapable of reappearing in the future. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.34	But that’s not what you had in mind. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.35	“Good Gotama is an abortionist.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.36	“Thereʼs a way you could rightly say that I’m an abortionist. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.37	For one who has abandoned any future conception in a womb, any rebirth in a future life, who has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, eradicated it, and made it incapable of reappearing in the future—such a one I call an abortionist. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.38	Now Iʼve abandoned any future conception in a womb, any rebirth in a future life. Iʼve cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, eradicated it, and made it incapable of reappearing in the future. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.39	But that’s not what you had in mind. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.4.1	Suppose, brahmin, there was a hen with eight, ten, or twelve eggs, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.4.2	which she had properly covered, warmed, and incubated. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.4.3	The first chick that hatches safely—after piercing through the eggshell with its claw or its beak—is it to be called the eldest or the youngest?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.4.4	“It’s to be called the eldest, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.4.5	for it’s the eldest among them.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.4.6	“Just so, in this deluded society, enveloped like an egg, I alone in the world have cracked the shell of delusion and reached the supreme full awakening. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.4.7	I, brahmin, am the world’s eldest and best. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.5.1	I was firmly energetic and had clarity of mindfulness; my body was tranquil and my mind stilled and unified. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.5.2	Fully secluded from the five senses, secluded from unwholesome mental qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has movement of the mind, as well as the joy and bliss of seclusion. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.5.3	Through the stilling of the movement of the mind, I entered and remained in the second absorption, which has internal confidence and unification of mind, as well as the joy and bliss of stillness. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.5.4	Through the fading away of joy, I remained even-minded, mindful, and fully aware, experiencing bliss directly, and I entered and remained in the third absorption of which the noble ones declare: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.5.5	‘You are even-minded, mindful, and abide in bliss.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.5.6	Through the abandoning of bliss and pain and the earlier ending of joy and aversion, I entered and remained in the fourth absorption, which has neither pain nor bliss, but consists of purity of mindfulness and even-mindedness. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.6.1	Then, with my mind stilled, purified, cleansed, flawless, free from defilements, supple, wieldy, steady, and unshakable, I directed it to the knowledge that consists of recollecting past lives. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.6.2	I recollected many past lives, that is, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.6.3	one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births; many eons of world dissolution, many eons of world evolution, and many eons of both dissolution and evolution. And I knew: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.6.4	ʻThere I had such name, such family, such appearance, such food, such experience of pleasure and pain, and such a lifespan. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.6.5	Passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.6.6	and there I had such name, such family, such appearance, such food, such experience of pleasure and pain, and such a lifespan. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.6.7	Passing away from there, I was reborn here.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.6.8	In this way I recollected many past lives with their characteristics and particulars. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.6.9	This was the first true insight, which I attained in the first part of the night. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.6.10	Delusion was dispelled and true insight arose, darkness was dispelled and light arose, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.6.11	as happens to one who is heedful, energetic, and diligent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.6.12	This, brahmin, was my first breaking out, like a chick from an eggshell. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.7.1	Then, with my mind stilled, purified, cleansed, flawless, free from defilements, supple, wieldy, steady, and unshakable, I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away and arising of beings. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.7.2	With superhuman and purified clairvoyance, I saw beings passing away and getting reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, gone to good destinations and to bad destinations, and I understood how beings pass on according to their actions: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.7.3	‘These beings who engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, who abused the noble ones, who had wrong views and acted accordingly, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.7.4	at the breaking up of the body after death, have been reborn in a lower realm, a bad destination, a world of misery, hell. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.7.5	But these beings who engaged in good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not abuse the noble ones, who held right view and acted accordingly, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.7.6	at the breaking up of the body after death, have been reborn in a good destination, a heaven world.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.7.7	In this way, with superhuman and purified clairvoyance, I saw beings passing away and getting reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, gone to good destinations and to bad destinations, and I understood how beings pass on according to their actions. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.7.8	This was the second true insight, which I  attained in the middle part of the night. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.7.9	Delusion was dispelled and true insight arose, darkness was dispelled and light arose, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.7.10	as happens to one who is heedful, energetic, and diligent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.7.11	This, brahmin, was my second breaking out, like a chick from an eggshell. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.8.1	Then, with my mind stilled, purified, cleansed, flawless, free from defilements, supple, wieldy, steady, and unshakable, I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the corruptions. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.8.2	I knew according to reality: ʻThis is suffering;’ ʻThis is the origin of suffering;’ ʻThis is the end of suffering;’ ʻThis is the path leading to the end of suffering.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.8.3	I knew according to reality: ʻThese are the corruptions;’ ʻThis is the origin of the corruptions;’ ʻThis is the end of the corruptions;’ ʻThis is the path leading to the end of the corruptions.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.8.4	When I knew and saw this, my mind was freed from the corruption of sensual desire, from the corruption of desire to exist, from the corruption of views, and from the corruption of delusion. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.8.5	When it was freed, I knew it was freed. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.8.6	I understood that birth had come to an end, the spiritual life had been lived, the job had been done, there was no further state of existence. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.8.7	This was the third true insight, which I attained in the last part of the night. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.8.8	Delusion was dispelled and true insight arose, darkness was dispelled and light arose, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.8.9	as happens to one who is heedful, energetic, and diligent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.8.10	This, brahmin, was my third breaking out, like a chick from an eggshell.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.9.1	That brahmin then said to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.9.2	“Good Gotama is the eldest! Good Gotama is the best! 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.9.3	Wonderful, good Gotama, wonderful! 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.9.4	Just as one might set upright what’s overturned, or reveal what’s hidden, or show the way to one who’s lost, or bring a lamp into the dark so that one with eyes might see what’s there—
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.9.5	just so have you made the Teaching clear in many ways. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.9.6	Good Gotama, I go for refuge to you, and to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.9.7	Please accept me as a lay follower who’s gone for refuge for life. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.9.8	And please consent to spend the rainy-season residence at Verañjā together with the Sangha of monks.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.9.9	The Buddha consented by keeping silent, and the brahmin understood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.9.10	He then got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.1	At that time Verañjā was short of food and afflicted with hunger, with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to straw. It was not easy to get by on almsfood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.2	Just then some horse dealers from Uttarāpatha had entered the rainy-season residence at Verañjā with five hundred horses. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.3	In the horse pen they prepared portion upon portion of steamed grain for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.4	Then, after robing up in the morning, the monks took their bowls and robes and entered Verañjā for alms. Not getting anything, they went to the horse pen. They then brought back many portions of steamed grain to the monastery, where they pounded and ate them. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.5	Venerable Ānanda crushed a portion on a stone, took it to the Buddha, and the Buddha ate it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.6	And the Buddha heard the sound of the mortar. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.7	When Buddhas know what is going on, sometimes they ask and sometimes not. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.8	They know the right time to ask and when not to ask. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.9	Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, otherwise not, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.10	for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.11	Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.12	And so the he said to Ānanda, “Ānanda, what’s this sound of a mortar?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.13	Ānanda told him what was happening. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.14	“Well done, Ānanda. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.15	You’re all superior people who have conquered the problems of famine. Later generations will despise even meat and rice.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.1	Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.2	“At present, Venerable Sir, Verañjā is short of food and afflicted with hunger, with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to straw. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.3	It’s not easy to get by on almsfood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.4	But the undersurface of this great earth abounds with food, tasting just like pure honey. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.5	Would it be good, Sir, if I inverted the earth so that the monks may enjoy the nutrition in those sprouts?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.6	“But what will you do, Moggallāna, with the creatures that live there?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.7	“I’ll transform one hand to be like the great earth and make those creatures go there. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.8	I’ll then invert the earth with the other hand.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.9	“Let it be, Moggallāna, don’t invert the earth. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.10	Those creatures might lose their minds.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.11	“In that case, Sir, would it be good if the whole Sangha of monks could go to Uttarakuru for alms?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.12	“Let it be, Moggallāna, don’t pursue this.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.1.1	Soon afterwards Venerable Sāriputta had the following thought while in seclusion, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.1.2	“Which Buddhas had a long-lasting spiritual life, and which not?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.1.3	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.1.4	In the evening, after coming out of seclusion, Sāriputta went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.1.5	“Just now, Sir, while I was in seclusion, I was wondering which Buddhas had a long-lasting spiritual life, and which not?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.1.6	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.1.7	“Sāriputta, the spiritual life established by the Buddhas Vipassī, Sikhī, and Vessabhū didn’t last long. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.1.8	But the spiritual life established by the Buddhas Kakusandha, Konāgamana, and Kassapa did.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.1	“And why did the spiritual life established by the former three Buddhas not last long?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.2	“They made no effort to give detailed teachings to their disciples. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.3	They gave few discourses in prose or in mixed prose and verse; few expositions, verses, inspired exclamations, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and analyses. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.4	Nor did they lay down training rules or recite a monastic code. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.5	After the disappearance of those Buddhas and the disciples awakened under them, those who were the last disciples—of various names, families, and castes, who had gone forth from various households—allowed that spiritual life to disappear rapidly. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.6	It’s like flowers on a wooden plank. If they’re not held together with a string, they’re scattered about, whirled about, and destroyed by the wind. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.7	Why? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.8	Because they’re not held together with a string. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.9	Just so, after the disappearance of those Buddhas and the disciples awakened under them, those who were the last disciples allowed that spiritual life to disappear rapidly. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.10	Instead they were untiring at instructing their disciples by reading their minds. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.11	At one time, Sāriputta, the Buddha Vessabhū, the Perfected and the fully Awakened One, was staying in a certain frightening forest grove. He instructed a sangha of a thousand monks by reading their minds, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.12	‘Think like this, not like that; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.13	pay attention like this, not like that; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.14	abandon this and attain that.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.15	When they had been instructed by Buddha Vessabhū, their minds were freed from the corruptions without grasping. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.16	But if anyone with sensual desire entered that frightening forest grove, they usually had goosebumps all over. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.17	This is why the spiritual life established by those Buddhas did not last long.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.3.1	“Why then did the spiritual life established by the latter three Buddhas last long?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.3.2	“The Buddhas Kakusandha, Konāgamana, and Kassapa were untiring in giving detailed teachings to their disciples. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.3.3	They gave many discourses in prose and in mixed prose and verse; many expositions, verses, inspired exclamations, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and analyses. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.3.4	And they laid down training rules and recited a monastic code. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.3.5	After the disappearance of those Buddhas and the disciples awakened under them, those who were the last disciples—of various names, families, and castes, who had gone forth from various households—made that spiritual life last for a long time. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.3.6	It’s like flowers on a wooden plank. If they’re held together with a string, they’re not scattered about, whirled about, or destroyed by the wind. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.3.7	Why? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.3.8	Because they are held together with a string. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.3.9	Just so, after the disappearance of those Buddhas and the disciples awakened under them, those who were the last disciples made that spiritual life last for a long time. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.3.10	This is why the spiritual life established by those Buddhas lasted long.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.4.1	Sāriputta then got up from his seat, put his upper robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.4.2	“This is the time, Venerable Sir, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.4.3	for laying down training rules and reciting a monastic code, so that this spiritual life may last for a long time.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.4.4	“Hold on, Sāriputta. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.4.5	The Buddha knows the appropriate time for this. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.4.6	The Teacher doesn’t lay down training rules or recite a monastic code until the causes of corruption appear in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.4.7	And they don’t appear until the Sangha has attained long standing, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.4.9	great size, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.4.11	an abundance of the best material support, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.4.13	or great learning. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.4.14	When the causes of corruption appear for any of these reasons, then the Teacher lays down training rules for his disciples and recites a monastic code in order to counteract these causes. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.4.15	Sāriputta, the Sangha of monks is free from cancer and danger, stainless, pure, and established in the essence. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.4.16	Even the least developed of these five hundred monks is a stream-enterer. They will not be reborn in the lower world, but are fixed in destiny and bound for awakening.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.1	Then the Buddha said to Ānanda, “Ānanda, it’s the custom for Buddhas not to go wandering the country without taking leave of those who invited them to spend the rainy-season residence. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.2	Let’s go to the brahmin of Verañjā and take leave.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.3	“Yes, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.4	The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe and, with Ānanda as his attendant, went to that brahmin’s house where he sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.5	The brahmin approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.6	And the Buddha said, “Brahmin, we’ve completed the rains residence according to your invitation, and now we take leave of you. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.7	We wish to depart to wander the country.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.8	“It’s true, good Gotama, that you’ve completed the rains residence according to my invitation, but I haven’t given anything. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.9	That’s not good. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.10	It’s not because I didn’t want to, but because household life is so busy. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.11	Would you and the Sangha of monks please accept a meal from me tomorrow?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.12	The Buddha consented by keeping silent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.13	Then, after instructing, inspiring, and gladdening that brahmin with a teaching, the Buddha got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.14	The following morning the brahmin prepared various kinds of fine food in his own house and then had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.15	The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe and, together with the Sangha of monks, he went to that brahmin’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.16	And that brahmin personally served and satisfied the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha with various kinds of fine food. When the Buddha had finished his meal, the brahmin gave him a set of three robes and to each monk two pieces of cloth. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.17	The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, and then got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.18	After remaining in Verañjā for as long as he liked, the Buddha traveled to Payāgapatiṭṭhāna via Soreyya, Saṅkassa, and Kaṇṇakujja. There he crossed the river Ganges and continued on to Benares. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.19	After remaining at Benares for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Vesālī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.20	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.21	he stayed in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.22	The section for recitation on Verañjā is finished. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.0.1	1. The first training rule on expulsion 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.0.2	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.0.3	First sub-story: the section for recitation on Sudinna 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.1	At that time Sudinna, the son of a wealthy merchant, lived in a village called Kalanda not far from Vesālī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.2	On one occasion Sudinna went to Vesālī on some business together with a number of friends. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.3	Just then the Buddha was seated giving a teaching, surrounded by a large gathering of people. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.4	When Sudinna saw this, he thought, “Why don’t I listen to the Teaching?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.5	He then approached that gathering and sat down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.6	As he was sitting there, he thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.7	“The way I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, it’s not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure as a polished conch shell. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.8	Why don’t I cut off my hair and beard, put on the ocher robes, and go forth from home into homelessness?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.9	When those people had been instructed, inspired, and gladdened by the Buddha, they got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated him with their right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.10	Sudinna then approached the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and told him what he had thought, adding, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.11	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.12	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.13	“Venerable Sir, please give me the going forth.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.14	“But, Sudinna, do you have your parents’ permission?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.15	“No.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.16	“Buddhas don’t give the going forth to anyone who hasn’t gotten their parents’ permission.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.17	“I’ll do whatever is necessary, Sir, to get my parents’ permission.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.1	After finishing his business in Vesālī, Sudinna returned to Kalanda. He then went to his parents and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.2	“Mum and dad, the way I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, it’s not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.3	I want to cut off my hair and beard, put on the ocher robes, and go forth from home into homelessness. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.4	Please give me permission to go forth.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.6	“But, Sudinna, you’re our only child, and we love you dearly. You live in comfort and we care for you. You don’t have any suffering. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.7	Even if you died we wouldn’t want to lose you. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.8	So how can we allow you to go forth from home into homelessness while you’re still living?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.9	Sudinna asked his parents a second 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.18	and a third time, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.23	but got the same reply. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.28	He then lay down on the bare ground and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.29	“I’ll either die right here or go forth!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.30	And he did not eat at the next seven meals. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.31	His parents repeated what they had said, adding, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.32	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.33	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.34	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.35	“Get up, Sudinna, eat, drink, and enjoy yourself! 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.36	Enjoy the pleasures of the world and do acts of merit. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.37	We won’t allow you to go forth.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.38	But Sudinna did not respond. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.39	His parents said the same thing a second 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.40	and a third time, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.2.48	but Sudinna remained silent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.3.1	Then Sudinna’s friends went to him and repeated three times what his parents had said. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.3.13	When Sudinna still did not respond, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.4.1	Sudinna’s friends went to his parents and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.4.3	“Sudinna says he’ll either die right there on the bare ground or go forth. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.4.4	If you don’t allow him to go forth, he’ll die there. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.4.5	But if you allow him to go forth, you’ll see him again afterwards. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.4.6	And if he doesn’t enjoy the going forth, what alternative will he have but to come back here? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.4.7	So please allow him to go forth.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.4.8	“Alright, then.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.4.9	And Sudinna’s friends said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.4.10	“Get up, Sudinna, your parents have given you permission to go forth.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.4.11	When Sudinna heard this, he was excited and joyful, stroking his limbs with his hands as he got up. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.4.12	After spending a few days to regain his strength, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.4.13	“Venerable Sir, I’ve gotten my parents’ permission to go forth. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.4.14	Please give me the going forth.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.4.15	He then received the going forth and the full ordination in the presence of the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.4.16	Not long afterwards he practiced these kinds of ascetic practices: he stayed in the wilderness, ate only almsfood, was a rag-robe wearer, and went on continuous almsround. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.4.17	And he lived supported by a certain Vajjian village. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.5.1	Soon afterwards, the Vajjians were short of food and afflicted with hunger, with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to straw. It was not easy to get by on almsfood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.5.2	Sudinna considered this and thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.5.3	“I have many wealthy relatives in Vesālī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.5.4	Why don’t I get them to support me? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.5.5	My relatives will be able to make offerings and merit, the monks will get material support, and I’ll have no trouble getting almsfood.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.5.6	He then put his dwelling in order, took his bowl and robe, and set out for Vesālī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.5.7	When he eventually arrived, he stayed in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.5.8	His relatives heard that he had arrived in Vesālī, and they presented him with an offering of sixty servings of food. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.5.9	Sudinna gave the sixty servings to the monks. He then took his bowl and robe and entered the village of Kalanda for alms. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.5.10	As he was going on continuous almsround, he came to his own father’s house. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.1	Just then a female slave of Sudinna’s relatives was about to throw away the previous evening’s porridge. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.2	Sudinna said to her, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.3	“If that’s to be thrown away, sister, put it here in my almsbowl.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.4	As she was putting the porridge into his bowl, she recognized his hands, feet, and voice. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.5	She then went to his mother and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.6	“Please be aware, madam, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.7	that master Sudinna is back.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.8	“Gosh, if you’re telling the truth, you’re a free woman!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.9	As Sudinna was eating the previous evening’s porridge at the base of a certain wall, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.10	his father was coming home from work. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.11	When he saw him sitting there, he went up to him and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.12	“But, Sudinna, isn’t there … and you’re eating old porridge! 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.13	Why don’t you go to your own house?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.14	“We went to your house, householder. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.15	That’s where we received this porridge.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.16	Sudinna’s father took him by the arm and said, “Come, let’s go home.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.17	Sudinna went to his father’s house and sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.18	His father said to him, “Please eat, Sudinna.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.19	“There’s no need. I’ve finished for today.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.20	“Then come back for the meal tomorrow.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.21	Sudinna consented by keeping silent, and he got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.22	The next morning Sudinna’s mother had the ground smeared with fresh cow-dung, She then piled up two heaps, one with money and one with gold. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.23	The heaps were so large that a man standing on one side could not see a man standing on the other. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.24	She hid the heaps behind screens, prepared a seat between them, and surrounded it all with a curtain. And she said to Sudinna’s ex-wife, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.25	“Now please adorn yourself in the way our son Sudinna found you especially attractive.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.26	“Yes, madam.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.7.1	Then, after robing up, Venerable Sudinna took his bowl and robe and went to his father’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.7.2	His father went up to him, uncovered the heaps, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.7.3	“This dowry, dear Sudinna, is the fortune from your mother. It’s yours. Another is the fortune from your father and another the fortune from your ancestors. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.7.4	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.7.5	Please return to the lower life, enjoy wealth, and make merit.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.7.6	“I can’t, father. I’m enjoying the spiritual life.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.7.7	Sudinna’s father repeated his request and Sudinna replied as before. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.7.8	When Sudinna’s father repeated his request a third time, Sudinna said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.7.12	“If you wouldn’t get offended, I could tell you what to do.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.7.13	“Let’s hear it.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.7.14	“Well then, make some large hempen sacks, put all the money and gold inside, take it all away in carts, and dump it in the middle of the Ganges. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.7.15	And why? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.7.16	Because that way you will avoid the danger, fear, and terror that it will otherwise cause you, as well as the trouble with protecting it.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.7.17	His father became upset, thinking, “How can our son Sudinna say such things?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.7.18	He then said to Sudinna’s ex-wife, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.7.19	“Well then, since you were so dear to him, perhaps our son Sudinna will listen to you?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.7.20	Sudinna’s ex-wife took hold of his feet and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.7.21	“What are these nymphs like, sir, for which you practice the spiritual life?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.7.22	“Sister, I don’t practice the spiritual life for the sake of nymphs.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.7.23	His ex-wife thought, “Sudinna is now calling me ‘sister’,” and she fainted right there. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.8.1	Sudinna said to his father, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.8.2	“If there’s food to be given, householder, give it, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.8.3	but don’t annoy me.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.8.4	“Eat, Sudinna,” he said. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.8.5	And Sudinna’s mother and father personally served and satisfied him with various kinds of fine food. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.8.6	When Sudinna had finished his meal, his mother said to him: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.8.7	“Sudinna dear, our family is rich. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.8.8	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.8.9	Please return to the lower life, enjoy wealth, and make merit.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.8.10	“Mother, I can’t. I’m enjoying the spiritual life.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.8.11	His mother repeated her request a second time, but got the same reply. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.8.12	She then said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.8.13	“Our family is wealthy, Sudinna. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.8.14	Please give us an offspring, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.8.15	so that the Licchavīs don’t take over our heirless property.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.8.16	“Yes, mother, I can do that.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.8.17	“But where are you staying?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.8.18	“In the Great Wood.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.8.19	And he got up from his seat and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.1	Sudinna’s mother then said to his ex-wife, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.2	“Well then, as soon as you reach your fertile period, please tell me.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.3	“Yes, madam.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.4	Not long afterwards Sudinna’s ex-wife reached her fertile period, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.5	and she reported it to Sudinna’s mother. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.6	“Now, please adorn yourself in the way that our son Sudinna found you especially attractive.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.7	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.8	Then Sudinna’s mother, together with his ex-wife, went to Sudinna in the Great Wood, and she said to him: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.9	“Our family, dear Sudinna, is rich. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.10	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.11	Please return to the lower life, enjoy wealth, and make merit.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.12	“Mother, I can’t. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.13	I’m enjoying the spiritual life.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.14	His mother repeated her request a second time, but got the same reply. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.15	She then said this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.16	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.17	“Well then, please give us an offspring. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.18	We don’t want the Licchavīs to take over our heirless property.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.19	“Alright, mother.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.20	He then took his ex-wife by the arm, disappeared into the Great Wood and—there being no training rule and he seeing no danger—had sexual intercourse with her three times. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.21	As a result she conceived. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.22	And the earth-gods cried out: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.23	“Sirs, the Sangha of monks has free from cancer and danger. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.24	But Sudinna of Kalanda has produced a cancer and endangered it.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.25	Hearing the cry of the earth-gods, the gods belonging to the heaven of the four great kings also cried out … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.26	the Tāvatiṁsa gods … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.27	the Yāma gods … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.28	the Tusita gods … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.29	the gods who delight in creation … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.30	the gods who control the creation of others … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.31	the gods belonging to the retinue of the supreme beings also cried out: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.32	“Sirs, the Sangha of monks has free from cancer and danger. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.33	But Sudinna of Kalanda has produced a cancer and endangered it.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.34	Thus in that moment, in that instance, the news spread as far as the world of the supreme beings. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.35	In the meantime, the pregnancy of Sudinna’s ex-wife developed, and she eventually gave birth to a son. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.36	Sudinna’s friends called him Offspring, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.37	while calling Sudinna’s ex-wife Offspring’s mother, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.38	and Venerable Sudinna Offspring’s father. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.9.39	After some time, they both went forth from home into homelessness and realized perfection. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.1	But Sudinna was anxious and remorseful, thinking, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.2	“This is truly bad for me, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.3	that after going forth on such a well-proclaimed spiritual path, I wasn’t able to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life to the end.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.4	And because of his anxiety and remorse, he became thin, haggard, and pale, with veins protruding all over his body. He became sad, sluggish, miserable, and depressed, weighed down by remorse. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.5	The monks who were Sudinna’s friends said to him: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.6	“In the past, Sudinna, you had a good color, a bright face, clear skin, and sharp senses. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.7	But look at you now. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.8	Could it be that you are dissatisfied with the spiritual life?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.9	“I am not dissatisfied with the spiritual life, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.10	but I’ve done something bad. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.11	I’ve had sexual intercourse with my ex-wife. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.12	I’m anxious and remorseful 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.13	because I wasn’t able to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life to the end.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.14	“No wonder you’re anxious, Sudinna, no wonder you have remorse. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.15	Hasn’t the Buddha given many teachings for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of lust; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.16	for the sake of freedom from bondage, not for the sake of bondage; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.17	for the sake of non-grasping, not for the sake of grasping? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.18	When the Buddha has taught in this way, how could you choose lust, bondage, and grasping? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.19	Hasn’t the Buddha given many teachings for the fading away of lust, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.20	for the clearing away of intoxication, for the removal of thirst, for the uprooting of attachment, for the cutting off of the round of rebirth, for the stopping of craving, for fading away, for ending, for extinguishment? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.21	Hasn’t the Buddha in many ways taught the abandoning of sensual pleasures, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.22	the full understanding of the perception of sensual pleasures, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.23	the removal of thirst for sensual pleasures, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.24	the elimination of thoughts of sensual pleasures, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.25	the stilling of the fever of sensual pleasures? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.26	This will affect people’s confidence 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.10.27	and cause some to lose it.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.1	After rebuking Sudinna in many ways, they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.2	The Buddha then had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned Sudinna: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.3	“Is it true, Sudinna, that you had sexual intercourse with your ex-wife?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.4	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.5	The Buddha rebuked him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.6	“Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.7	How could you go forth on such a well-proclaimed spiritual path and not be able to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life to the end? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.8	Haven’t I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of lust; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.9	for the sake of freedom from bondage, not for the sake of bondage; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.10	for the sake of non-grasping, not for the sake of grasping? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.11	When I have taught in this way, how could you choose lust, bondage, and grasping? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.12	Haven’t I given many teachings for the fading away of lust, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.13	for the clearing away of intoxication, for the removal of thirst, for the uprooting of attachment, for the cutting off of the round of rebirth, for the stopping of craving, for fading away, for ending, for extinguishment? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.14	Haven’t I in many ways taught the abandoning of sensual pleasures, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.15	the full understanding of the perceptions of sensual pleasure, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.16	the removal of thirst for sensual pleasure, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.17	the elimination of thoughts of sensual pleasure, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.18	the stilling of the fevers of sensual pleasure? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.19	It would be better, foolish man, for your penis to enter the mouth of a highly venomous snake than to enter a woman. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.20	It would be better for your penis to enter the mouth of a black snake than to enter a woman. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.21	It would be better for your penis to enter a blazing charcoal pit than to enter a woman. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.22	Why is that? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.23	For although it might cause death or death-like suffering, it would not cause you to be reborn in a bad destination. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.24	But *this* might. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.25	Foolish man, you have practiced what is contrary to the true Teaching, the common practice, the low practice, the coarse practice, that which ends with a wash, that which is done in private, that which is done wherever there are couples. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.26	You are the forerunner, the first performer of many unwholesome things. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.27	This will affect people’s confidence, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.28	and cause some to lose it.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.29	Then the Buddha spoke in many ways in dispraise of being difficult to support and maintain, in dispraise of great desires, discontent, socializing, and laziness; but he spoke in many ways in praise of being easy to support and maintain, of fewness of wishes, contentment, self-elimination, ascetic practices, serenity, reduction in things, and of being energetic. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.30	After giving a teaching on what is right and proper, he addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.31	“Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.32	for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad people, for the ease of good monks, for the restraint of corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.33	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.34.0	First preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.34.1	‘If a monk has sexual intercourse, he is expelled and excluded from the community.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.35	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.11.36	The section for recitation on Sudinna is finished. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.0	Second sub-story: the account of the female monkey 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.1	Some time later, in the Great Wood near Vesālī, a certain monk befriended a female monkey by giving her food. He then had sexual intercourse with her. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.2	Soon afterwards, after robing up in the morning, he took his bowl and robe and entered Vesālī for alms. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.3	Just then a number of monks who were walking about the dwellings came to the one belonging to this monk. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.4	The female monkey saw those monks coming. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.5	She went up to them, shook her buttocks in front of them, wagged her tail, presented her backside, and made a gesture. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.6	The monks thought, “This monk must be having sexual intercourse with this monkey,” and they hid to one side. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.7	Then, when that monk had finished his almsround in Vesālī and had returned with his almsfood, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.9	he ate one part himself and gave the rest to that female monkey. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.10	After eating the food, the monkey presented her buttocks to the monk, and he had sexual intercourse with her. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.11	The other monks said to him, “Hasn’t a training rule been laid down by the Buddha? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.12	Why then do you have sexual intercourse with a monkey?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.13	“It’s true that a training rule has been laid down by the Buddha, but it concerns women, not animals.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.14	“But that’s just the same. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.15	It’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.16	How could you go forth on such a well-proclaimed spiritual path and not be able to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life to the end? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.17	Hasn’t the Buddha given many teachings for the sake of dispassion … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.18	the stilling of the fevers of sensual pleasure? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.19	This will affect people’s confidence, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.20	 and cause some to lose it.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.21	After rebuking that monk in many ways, they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.22	The Buddha then had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned that monk: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.23	“Is it true, monk, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.24	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.25	The Buddha rebuked him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.26	“Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.27	How could you go forth on such a well-proclaimed spiritual path and not be able to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life to the end? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.28	Haven’t I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.29	for the stilling of the fevers of sensual desire? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.30	It would be better, foolish man, for your penis to enter the mouth of a highly venomous snake than to enter a woman. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.31	It would be better for your penis to enter the mouth of a black snake than to enter a woman. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.32	It would be better for your penis to enter a blazing charcoal pit than to enter a woman. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.33	Why is that? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.34	For although it might cause death or death-like suffering, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.35	it would not cause you to be reborn in a bad destination. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.36	But *this* might. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.37	Foolish man, you’ve practiced what is contrary to the true Teaching, the common practice, the low practice, the coarse practice, that which ends with a wash, that which is done in private, that which is done wherever there are couples. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.38	This will affect people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.39	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.40.0	Second preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.40.1	‘If a monk has sexual intercourse, even with a female animal, he is expelled and excluded from the community.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.41	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.42	The account of the female monkey is finished. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:7.1.0	Third sub-story: the section for recitation on covering 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:7.1.1	Soon afterwards there were a number of Vajjian monks from Vesālī who ate, slept, and bathed as much as they liked. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:7.1.2	Then, not reflecting properly and without first renouncing the training and revealing their weakness, they had sexual intercourse. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:7.1.3	After some time they were affected by loss of relatives, loss of property, and loss of health. They then went to Venerable Ānanda and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:7.1.4	“Venerable Ānanda, we don’t blame the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:7.1.5	we only have ourselves to blame. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:7.1.6	We were unfortunate and had little merit—
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:7.1.7	after going forth on such a well-proclaimed spiritual path, we were unable to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life to the end. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:7.1.8	If we were now to get the going forth and the full ordination in the presence of the Buddha, we would have clarity about wholesome qualities and be devoted day in and day out to developing the aids to awakening. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:7.1.9	Venerable Ānanda, please inform the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:7.1.10	Saying, “Yes,” he went to the Buddha and told him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:7.1.11	“It’s impossible, Ānanda, that the Buddha should abolish a training rule that entails expulsion because of the Vajjians.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:7.1.12	The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:7.1.13	“Monks, if someone, without first renouncing the training and revealing their weakness, has sexual intercourse, they may not receive the full ordination once again. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:7.1.14	But, monks, if someone has sexual intercourse after first renouncing the training and revealing their weakness, they may receive the full ordination once again. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:7.1.15	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:7.1.16.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:7.1.16.1	‘If a monk, after taking on the monks’ training and way of life, without first renouncing the training and revealing his weakness, has sexual intercourse, even with a female animal, he is expelled and excluded from the community.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.0	Definitions 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.1	A: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.2	whoever, of such a kind, of such activity, of such caste, of such name, of such family, of such conduct, of such behavior, of such association, who is senior, who is junior, or who is of middle standing—this is called “a”. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.3	Monk: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.4	he is a monk because he lives on alms; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.5	a monk because he has gone over to living on alms; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.6	a monk because he wears a patchwork cloth; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.7	a monk by convention; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.8	a monk on account of his claim; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.9	a “come, monk” monk; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.10	a monk given the full ordination through the taking of the three refuges; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.11	a good monk; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.12	a monk of substance; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.13	a trainee monk; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.14	a fully trained monk; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.15	a monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.16	The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements, which is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.17	Training: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.18	the three trainings: the training in the higher morality, the training in the higher mind, the training in the higher wisdom. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.19	The training in the higher morality is the training meant in this case. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.20	Way of life: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.21	whatever training rule has been laid down by the Buddha—this is called “way of life”. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.1.22	One trains in this; therefore it is called “after taking on the way of life”. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.2.1	Without first renouncing the training and revealing his weakness: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.2.2	“There is, monks, a revealing of weakness without the training being renounced; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.2.3	and there is a revealing of weakness together with the training being renounced. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.2.4	And how is there a revealing of weakness without the training being renounced? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.2.5	It may be that a monk is dissatisfied, discontent, desiring to give up the monastic life; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.2.6	troubled, ashamed, and disgusted with the monkhood; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.2.7	longing to be a householder,

pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.2.14	longing to be a non-monastic, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.2.15	and he says and declares: ‘Why don’t I renounce the Buddha?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.2.16	In this way, monks, there’s a revealing of weakness without the training being renounced. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.2.17	Or again, dissatisfied, discontent, desiring to give up the monastic life;

pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.2.41	‘Why don’t I become a non-monastic?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.2.42	In this way too, monks, there’s a revealing of weakness without the training being renounced. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.2.43	Or again, dissatisfied, discontent, desiring to give up the monastic life; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.2.44	troubled, ashamed, and disgusted with the monkhood;

pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.21.5	The monks saw the moisture and told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.21.6	“Monks, an erection occurs for five reasons: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.21.7	because of sensual desire, feces, urine, or wind, or because of being stung by caterpillars. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.21.9	It’s impossible that that monk had an erection because of sensual desire. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.21.10	That monk is a perfected one. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.21.11	There’s no offense for that monk. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.21.12	But, monks, you should close the door when you are in seclusion during the day.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.22.1	At one time a monk from Bharukaccha dreamed that he had sexual intercourse with his ex-wife. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.22.2	He thought he was no longer a monastic and that he would have to disrobe. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.22.3	While on his way to Bharukaccha, he saw Venerable Upāli and told him what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.22.4	Venerable Upāli said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.22.5	“There’s no offense when it occurs while dreaming.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.1	At one time in Rājagaha there was a female lay follower called Supabbā who had misplaced faith. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.2	She had the view that 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.3	a woman who gives sexual intercourse gives the highest gift. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.4	She saw a monk and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.5	“Sir, come and have sexual intercourse.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.6	“It’s not allowable.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.7	“Then rub between the thighs. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.8	In this way there won’t be any offense for you. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.9	Then rub against the navel. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.10	Then rub against the stomach. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.11	Then rub in the armpit. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.12	Then rub against the throat. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.13	Then rub against the ear-hole. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.14	Then rub against a coil of hair. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.15	Then rub between the fingers. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.16	Then I’ll make make you discharge with my hand. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.17	In this way there won’t be any offense for you.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.18	The monk acted accordingly. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.19	He became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.20	“There’s no offense entailing expulsion, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.21	but there’s an offense entailing suspension.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.24.1	At one time in Sāvatthī there was a female lay follower called Saddhā who had misplaced faith. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.24.2	She had the view that 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.24.3	a woman who gives sexual intercourse gives the highest gift. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.24.4	She saw a monk and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.24.5	“Sir, come and have sexual intercourse.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.24.6	“It’s not allowable.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.24.7	“Then rub between the thighs. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.24.8	Then I’ll make you discharge with my hand. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.24.9	In this way there won’t be any offense for you.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.24.10	The monk acted accordingly. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.24.11	He became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.24.12	“There’s no offense entailing expulsion, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.24.13	but there’s an offense entailing suspension.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.25.1	At one time in Vesālī some Licchavī youths grabbed a monk and made him commit misconduct with a nun. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.25.2	made him commit misconduct with a trainee nun. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.25.3	made him commit misconduct with a novice nun. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.25.4	Both agreed: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.25.5	both should be expelled. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.25.6	Neither agreed: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.25.7	there is no offense for either. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.25.8	At one time in Vesālī some Licchavī youths grabbed a monk and made him commit misconduct with a prostitute. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.25.9	made him commit misconduct with a _paṇḍaka_. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.25.10	made him commit misconduct with a female householder. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.25.11	The monk agreed: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.25.12	he should be expelled. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.25.13	The monk did not agree: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.25.14	there is no offense. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.25.15	At one time in Vesālī some Licchavī youths grabbed two monks and made them commit misconduct with each other. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.25.16	Both agreed: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.25.17	both should be expelled. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.25.18	Neither agreed: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.25.19	there is no offense for either. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.26.1	At one time a monk who had gone forth in old age went to see his ex-wife. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.26.2	Saying, “Come and disrobe,” she grabbed him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.26.3	Stepping backwards, the monk fell on his back. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.26.4	She pulled up his robe and sat down on his penis. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.26.5	He became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.26.6	“Did you consent, monk?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.26.7	“I didn’t consent, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.26.8	“There’s no offense for one who doesn’t consent.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.27.1	At one time a certain monk was staying in the wilderness. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.27.2	A young deer came to his place of urination, drank the urine, and took hold of penis with its mouth. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.27.3	The monk consented. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.27.4	He became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.27.5	“You’ve committed an offense entailing expulsion.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.27.6	The first offense entailing expulsion is finished.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:0.3	The chapter on offenses entailing expulsion 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:0.4	2. The second training rule on expulsion 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.0.1	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha on the Vulture Peak. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.2	At that time a number of monks who were friends had made grass huts on the slope of Mount Isigili and had entered the rainy-season residence there. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.3	Among them was Venerable Dhaniya the potter. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.4	When the three months were over and they had completed the rainy-season residence, the monks demolished their grass huts, put away the grass and sticks, and left to wander the country. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.5	But Venerable Dhaniya spent the winter and the summer right  there. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.6	Then, on one occasion, while Dhaniya was in the village to collect almsfood, some women gathering grass and firewood demolished his grass hut and took away the grass and sticks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.7	A second time Dhaniya collected grass and sticks and made a grass hut, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.8	and again the hut was demolished in the same way. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.9	The same thing happened a third time. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.11	Dhaniya thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.12	“Three times this has happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.13	But I’m well-trained and experienced in my own craft of pottery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.14	Why don’t I knead mud myself and make a hut entirely of clay?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.15	And he did just that. He then collected grass, sticks, and cow-dung, and he baked his hut. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.16	It was a pretty and attractive little hut, red in color like a scarlet rain-mite. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.17	And when struck, it sounded just like a bell. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha was descending from the Vulture Peak with a number of monks when he saw that hut. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.2	He said to the monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.3	“What’s this pretty and attractive thing that’s red in color like a scarlet rain-mite?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.4	The monks told the Buddha, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.5	who then criticized Dhaniya: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.6	“It’s not suitable for that foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.7	How could he make a hut entirely of clay? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.8	Doesn’t he have any consideration, compassion, and mercy for living beings? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.9	Go, monks, and demolish this hut, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.10	so that future generations don’t follow his example. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.11	And, monks, you should not make a hut entirely of clay. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.12	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.13	Saying, “Yes, Venerable Sir,” they went to demolished it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.14	And Dhaniya said to them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.15	“Why are you demolishing my hut?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.16	“The Buddha has asked us to.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.17	“Demolish it then, if the Lord of the Truth has said so.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.1	Dhaniya thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.2	“Three times, while I was in the village to collect almsfood, women gathering grass and firewood demolished my hut and took away the grass and sticks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.3	And now my hut made entirely of clay has been demolished at the Buddha’s request. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.4	Now, the caretaker of the woodyard is a friend of mine. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.5	Why don’t I ask him for timber and make a hut out of that?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.6	Dhaniya then went to the caretaker of the woodyard and told him what had happened, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.9	adding, “Please give me some timber, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.10	I want to make a wooden hut.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.11	“There’s no timber, Sir, that I could give you. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.12	This timber is held by the King. It’s meant for repairs of the town and put aside in case of an emergency. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.13	You can only have it if the King gives it away.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.14	“Actually, it’s been given by the King.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.15	The caretaker of the woodyard thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.16	“These Sakyan monastics have integrity. They are celibate and their conduct is good, and they are truthful, moral, and have a good character. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.17	Even the King has faith in them. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.18	These venerables wouldn’t say something is given if it wasn’t.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.19	And he said to Dhaniya, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.20	“You may take it, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.21	Dhaniya then had that timber cut into pieces, took it away by means of carts, and made a wooden hut. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.1	Soon afterwards the brahmin Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, was inspecting the public works in Rājagaha when he went to the caretaker of the woodyard and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.2	“What’s going on? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.3	Where’s the timber held by the King that’s meant for repairs of the town and put aside in case of an emergency?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.4	“The King has given it to Venerable Dhaniya.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.5	Vassakāra was upset and thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.6	“How could the King give away this timber to Dhaniya the potter?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.7	He then went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.8	“Is it true, sir, that you have given away  to Dhaniya the potter the timber that was held for repairs of the town and put aside in case of an emergency?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.9	“Who said that?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.10	“The caretaker of the woodyard.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.11	“Well then, brahmin, summon the caretaker of the woodyard.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.12	And Vassakāra had the caretaker of the woodyard bound and taken by force. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.13	Dhaniya saw this 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.14	and said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.15	“Why is this happening to you?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.16	“Because of the timber, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.17	“Go then, and I’ll come too.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.18	“Please come before I’m done for.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.1	Dhaniya then went to King Bimbisāra’s house and sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.2	The King approached Dhaniya, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.3	and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.4	“Is it true, Venerable, that I have given to you the timber held for repairs of the town and put aside in case of an emergency” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.5	“Yes, great king.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.6	“We kings are very busy—
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.7	we may give and not remember. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.8	Please remind me.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.9	“Do you remember, great king, when you were first anointed, speaking these words: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.10	‘I give the grass, sticks, and water for the monastics and brahmins to enjoy’?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.11	“I remember. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.12	There are monastics and brahmins who have a sense of conscience, who are afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.13	They are afraid of wrongdoing even in regard to small matters. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.14	When I spoke, I was referring to these, and it concerned what’s ownerless in the wilderness. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.15	Yet you imagine that you can take timber not given to you by means of this pretext? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.16	Even so, I cannot beat, imprison, or banish a monastic or brahmin living in my own kingdom. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.17	Go, you’re free because of your status, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.18	but don’t do such a thing again.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.1	But people complained and criticized him: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.2	“These Sakyan monastics are shameless and immoral liars. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.3	They claim to act with integrity, to be celibate and of good conduct, to be truthful, moral, and good. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.4	But they don’t have the good character of a monastic or a brahmin. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.5	They’ve lost the plot! 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.8	They even deceive the King—what then other people?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.9	The monks heard the complaints of those people. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.10	The monks of few desires, who had a sense of conscience, and who were contented, afraid of wrongdoing, and fond of the training, complained and criticized Venerable Dhaniya, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.11	“How could he take the King’s timber without it being given to him?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.12	After criticizing Dhaniya in many ways, they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.13	The Buddha then convened the Sangha of monks and questioned Venerable Dhaniya: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.14	“Is it true, Dhaniya, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.15	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.16	The Buddha rebuked him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.17	“Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.18	How could you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.19	This will affect people’s confidence 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.20	and cause some to lose it.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.21	Just then a former judge who had gone forth with the monks was sitting near the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.22	The Buddha said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.23	“For what value of stealing does King Bimbisāra beat, imprison, or banish a thief?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.24	“For a _pāda_ coin, Sir, for the worth of a _pāda_, or for more than a _pāda_.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.25	At that time in Rājagaha a _pāda_ coin was worth five _māsaka_ coins. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.26	After rebuking Venerable Dhaniya in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.27	“… And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.28.0	Preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.28.1	‘If a monk, intending to steal, takes what has not been given to him—
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.29	the sort of stealing for which kings, having caught a thief, would beat, imprison, or banish him, saying, “You’re a bandit, you’re a fool, you’ve gone astray, you’re a thief”—
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.30	he too is expelled and excluded from the community.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.31	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.1	At one time the monks from the group of six went to the dyers, stole their collection of cloth, brought it back to the monastery, and shared it out. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.2	The other monks said to them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.3	“You have great merit, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.4	seeing that you’ve gotten so much robe-cloth.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.5	“How is it that we have merit? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.6	Just now we went to the dyers and stole their cloth.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.7	“But hasn’t the Buddha laid down a training rule? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.8	Why then do you steal the dyers’ cloth?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.9	“It’s true that the Buddha has laid down a training rule, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.10	but it concerns inhabited areas, not the wilderness.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.11	“But that’s just the same. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.12	It’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.13	How could you steal the dyers’ cloth? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.14	This will affect people’s confidence, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.15	 and cause some to lose it.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.16	After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.17	The Buddha convened the Sangha of monks and questioned those monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.18	“Is it true, monks, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.19	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.20	The Buddha rebuked them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.21	“It’s not suitable, foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.22	How could you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.23	This will affect people’s confidence, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.24	 and cause some to lose it.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.25	Then, after rebuking the monks from the group of six in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.26	but he spoke in praise … of being energetic. Having given a teaching on what is right and proper, he addressed the monks … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.27	“… And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.28.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.28.1	‘If a monk, intending to steal, takes from an inhabited area or from the wilderness what has not been given to him—
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.29	the sort of stealing for which kings, having caught a thief, would beat, imprison, or banish him, saying, “You’re a bandit, you’re a fool, you’ve gone astray, you’re a thief”—
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.30	he too is expelled and excluded from the community.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:3.0	Definitions 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:3.1	A: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:3.2	whoever …

pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.37.4	On one occasion a monk went to a meadow, cut grass worth five _māsaka_ coins, and took it away, intending to steal it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.37.5	He became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.37.6	“You have committed an offense entailing expulsion.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.38.1	On one occasion some newly arrived monks shared out the mangoes belonging to the Sangha and ate them. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.38.2	The resident monks accused those monks, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.38.3	“You’re not monastics anymore!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.38.4	They became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.38.5	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.38.6	“What were you thinking, monks?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.38.7	“We thought they were meant for eating, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.38.8	“There’s no offense for one who thinks it is meant for eating.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.38.9	On one occasion some newly arrived monks shared out the black plums belonging to the Sangha … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.38.10	the bread-fruit belonging to the Sangha … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.38.11	the jack-fruit belonging to the Sangha … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.38.12	the palm fruits belonging to the Sangha … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.38.13	the sugarcane belonging to the Sangha … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.38.14	the gaub fruit belonging to the Sangha and ate them. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.38.15	The resident monks accused those monks, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.38.16	“You’re not monastics anymore!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.38.17	They became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.38.18	“There’s no offense for one who thinks it is meant for eating.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.39.1	On one occasion the keepers of a mango-grove gave a mango to some monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.39.2	The monks, thinking, “They have the authority to guard, but not to give away,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.39.3	were afraid of wrongdoing and did not accept it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.39.4	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.39.5	“There’s no offense if it’s a gift from a guardian.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.39.6	On one occasion the keepers of a black plum grove … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.39.7	the keepers of a bread-fruit grove … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.39.8	the keepers of a jack-fruit grove … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.39.9	the keepers of a palm grove … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.39.10	the keepers of a sugarcane field … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.39.11	the keepers of a gaub fruit grove gave a gaub fruit to some monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.39.12	The monks, thinking, “They have the authority to guard, but not to give away,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.39.13	were afraid of wrongdoing and did not accept it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.39.14	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.39.15	“There’s no offense if it’s a gift from a guardian.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.40.1	On one occasion a monk borrowed a piece of wood belonging to the Sangha and used it to support the wall of his own dwelling. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.40.2	The monks accused him, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.40.3	“You’re not a monastic anymore!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.40.4	He became anxious 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.40.5	and told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.40.6	“What were you thinking, monk?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.40.7	“I was borrowing it, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.40.8	“There’s no offense for one who is borrowing.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.41.1	On one occasion a monk took water from the Sangha, intending to steal it. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.41.2	took clay from the Sangha, intending to steal it. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.41.3	took a pile of grass from the Sangha, intending to steal it. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.41.4	He became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.41.5	“You have committed an offense entailing expulsion.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.41.6	On one occasion a monk set fire to a pile of grass belonging to the Sangha, intending to steal. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.41.7	He became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.41.8	“There’s no offense entailing expulsion, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.41.9	but there’s an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.42.1	On one occasion a monk took a bed from the Sangha, intending to steal it. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.42.2	He became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.42.3	“You have committed an offense entailing expulsion.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.42.4	On one occasion a monk took a bench from the Sangha, intending to steal it … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.42.5	a mattress from the Sangha … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.42.6	a pillow from the Sangha … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.42.7	a door from the Sangha … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.42.8	a window from the Sangha … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.42.9	took a rafter from the Sangha, intending to steal it. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.42.10	He became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.42.11	“You have committed an offense entailing expulsion.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.43.1	At one time the monks used elsewhere the furniture belonging to a certain lay follower. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.43.2	That lay follower complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.43.3	“How can the Venerables use furniture where it doesn’t belong?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.43.4	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.43.5	“You should not use furniture where it doesn’t belong. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.43.6	If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.44.1	Soon afterwards, being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not take any furniture to the observance-day hall or to meetings, and they sat down on the bare ground. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.44.2	They became dirty, as did their robes. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.44.3	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.44.4	“I allow you to borrow.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.45.1	On one occasion at Campā, a nun who was a pupil of the nun Thullanandā went to a family that supported Thullanandā and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.45.2	“The Venerable wants to drink the triple pungent rice porridge.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.45.3	When it was ready, she took it away and ate it herself. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.45.4	When Thullanandā found out about this, she accused her, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.45.5	“You’re not a monastic anymore!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.45.6	She became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.45.7	She then told the nuns, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.45.8	who in turn told the monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.45.9	who then told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.45.10	“There’s no offense entailing expulsion, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.45.11	but there’s an offense entailing confession for lying in full awareness.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.45.12	On one occasion in Rājagaha, a nun who was a pupil of the nun Thullanandā went to a family that supported Thullanandā and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.45.13	“The Venerable wants a honey-ball.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.45.14	When it was ready, she took it away and ate it herself. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.45.15	When Thullanandā found out about this, she accused her, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.45.16	“You’re not a monastic anymore!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.45.17	She became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.45.18	“There’s no offense entailing expulsion, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.45.19	but there’s an offense entailing confession for lying in full awareness.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.46.1	At that time there was  a householder in Vesāli who was a supporter of Venerable Ajjuka and who had two children living with him, a son and a nephew. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.46.2	He said to Ajjuka, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.46.3	“Sir, please assign my property to the one of these two boys who has faith and confidence.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.46.4	It turned out that the householder’s nephew had faith and confidence, and so Ajjuka assigned the property to him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.46.5	He then established a household with that wealth and made a gift. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.46.6	The householder’s son then said to Venerable Ānanda, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.46.7	“Who is the father’s heir, Venerable Ānanda, the son or the nephew?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.46.8	“The son is the father’s heir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.46.9	“Sir, Venerable Ajjuka has assigned our wealth to our housemate.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.46.10	“Venerable Ajjuka is not a monastic anymore.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.46.11	Ajjuka then said to Ānanda, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.46.12	“Ānanda, please do a proper investigation.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.46.13	On that occasion Venerable Upāli was siding with Ajjuka, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.46.14	and he said to Ānanda, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.46.15	“Ānanda, when one is asked by the owner to assign a property to so-and-so and one does as asked, what has one committed?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.46.16	“One hasn’t committed anything, Sir, not even an act of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.46.17	“Venerable Ajjuka was asked by the owner to assign his property to so-and-so, which he did. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.46.18	There’s no offense for Venerable Ajjuka.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.47.1	At that time a family in Benares that supported Venerable Pilindavaccha was harassed by criminals. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.47.2	Two of their children were kidnapped. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.47.3	Soon afterwards Pilindavaccha brought those children back by his supernormal powers and put them in a stilt house. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.47.4	When people saw those children, they said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.47.5	“This is the greatness of Venerable Pilindavacchaʼs supernormal powers,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.47.6	and they gained confidence in him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.47.7	But the monks complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.47.8	“How could Venerable Pilindavaccha bring back children who had been kidnapped by criminals?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.47.9	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.47.10	“There’s no offense for someone who uses their supernormal powers.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.48.1	At that time the two monks Paṇḍaka and Kapila were friends. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.48.2	One was staying in a village and one at Kosambī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.48.3	Then, while one of them was traveling from that village to Kosambī, he had to cross a river. As he did so, a lump of fat that had escaped from the hands of a pork-butcher stuck to his foot. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.48.4	He grabbed it, thinking, “I’ll give it to the owners.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.48.5	But the owners accused him, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.48.6	“You’re not a monastic anymore!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.48.7	Just then a woman cowherd who had seen him crossing said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.48.8	“Come, Sir, have sexual intercourse.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.48.9	Thinking he was no longer a monastic, he had sexual intercourse with her. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.48.10	When he arrived at Kosambī, he told the monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.48.11	who in turn told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.48.12	“There’s no offense entailing expulsion for stealing, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.48.13	but there’s an offense entailing expulsion for having sexual intercourse.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.49.1	At that time a monk at Sāgalā who was a student of Venerable Daḷhika was plagued by lust. He stole a turban from a shopkeeper and said to Daḷhika, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.49.2	“Sir, I’m not a monastic anymore. I’ll disrobe.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.49.3	“But what have you done?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.49.4	He told him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.49.5	Venerable Daḷhika had the turban brought and valued. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.49.6	It was worth less than five _māsaka_ coins. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.49.7	Saying, “There’s no offense entailing expulsion,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.49.8	he gave a teaching. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.49.9	And that monk was delighted. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.49.10	The second offense entailing expulsion is finished.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:0.3	The chapter on offenses entailing expulsion 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:0.4	3. The third training rule on expulsion 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.0.1	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood near Vesālī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.2	At that time the Buddha spoke to the monks in many ways about unattractiveness—he spoke in praise of unattractiveness, of developing the mind in unattractiveness, and of the attainment of unattractiveness. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.3	The Buddha then addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.4	“Monks, I wish to go into solitary retreat for half a month. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.5	No one should visit me except the one who brings me almsfood.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.6	“Yes, Venerable Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.7	Soon afterwards the monks reflected that the Buddha had praised unattractiveness in many ways, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.8	and they devoted themselves to developing the mind in unattractiveness in its many different facets. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.9	As a consequence, they became troubled by their own bodies, ashamed of and disgusted with them. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.10	Just as a young woman or man—someone fond of adornments, with freshly washed hair—would be ashamed, humiliated, and disgusted if the carcase of a snake, dog, or man was hung around her neck, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.11	just so those monks were troubled by their own bodies. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.12	They took their own lives, took the lives of one another, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.13	and they went to Migalaṇḍika, the monastic lookalike, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.14	“Please kill us. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.15	You will get our bowl and robes.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.16	And hired for a bowl and robes, Migalaṇḍika killed a number of monks. He then took his blood-stained knife to the river Vaggumudā. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.17	While washing it, he became anxious and remorseful, thinking, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.18	“What the heck have I done? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.19	I’ve made so much demerit by killing good monks.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.20	Then a god from the realm of the Lord of Death, coming across the water, said to Migalaṇḍika, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.21	“Well done, superior man, you’re truly fortunate. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.22	You’ve made much merit by helping across those who hadn’t yet crossed.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.23	Migalaṇḍika thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.24	“So it seems that I’m fortunate, that I’ve made much merit!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.25	He then went from dwelling to dwelling, from precincts to precincts, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.26	“Who hasn’t crossed yet? Who can I help across?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.27	The monks who still had worldly attachments became fearful and terrified, with goosebumps all over. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.28	Only those who were free from worldly attachments were unaffected. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.29	Then, on a single day, Migalaṇḍika killed one monk, two monks, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, even sixty monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.1	At the end of that half-month, when the Buddha came out of seclusion, he said to Venerable Ānanda, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.2	“Ānanda, why is the Sangha of monks so reduced?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.3	Ānanda told him what had happened, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.13	adding, “Please give another instruction, Venerable Sir, for the Sangha of monks to become established in perfect insight.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.14	“Well then, Ānanda, bring together in the assembly hall all the monks who live supported by Vesālī.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.15	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.16	When he had done so, he went to the Buddha and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.17	“Sir, the Sangha of monks is gathered. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.18	Please do as you think appropriate.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.19	The Buddha then went to the assembly hall, sat down on the prepared seat, and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.1	“Monks, when stillness by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated, it is peaceful and sublime, and a satisfying state of bliss. And it removes bad and unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.2	Just as a great, unseasonal storm in the last month of the hot season removes the dust and dirt from the air, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.3	just so, when stillness by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated, it is peaceful and sublime, and it removes bad and unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.4	And how is stillness by mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated in this way? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.5	A monk sits down in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty hut. He crosses his legs, straightens his body, and sets up mindfulness in front of him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.6	Simply mindful, he breathes in; mindful, he breathes out. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.7	When he breathes in long, he knows it; and when he breathes out long, he knows that. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.8	When he breathes in short, he knows it; and when he breathes out short, he knows that. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.9	When breathing in, he trains in fully experiencing the breath; when breathing out, he trains in fully experiencing the breath. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.10	When breathing in, he trains in calming the activity of the body; when breathing out, he trains in calming the activity of the body. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.11	When breathing in, he trains in experiencing joy; when breathing out, he trains in experiencing joy. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.12	When breathing in, he trains in experiencing bliss; when breathing out, he trains in experiencing bliss. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.13	When breathing in, he trains in experiencing the activity of the mind; when breathing out, he trains in experiencing the activity of the mind. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.14	When breathing in, he trains in calming the activity of the mind; when breathing out, he trains in calming the activity of the mind. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.15	When breathing in, he trains in experiencing the mind; when breathing out, he trains in experiencing the mind. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.16	When breathing in, he trains in gladdening the mind; when breathing out, he trains in gladdening the mind. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.17	When breathing in, he trains in stilling the mind; when breathing out, he trains in stilling the mind. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.18	When breathing in, he trains in freeing the mind; when breathing out, he trains in freeing the mind. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.19	When breathing in, he trains in contemplating impermanence; when breathing out, he trains in contemplating impermanence. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.20	When breathing in, he trains in contemplating fading away; when breathing out, he trains in contemplating fading away. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.21	When breathing in, he trains in contemplating ending; when breathing out, he trains in contemplating ending. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.22	When breathing in, he trains in contemplating relinquishment; when breathing out, he trains in contemplating relinquishment. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.23	Monks, when stillness by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated like this, it is peaceful and sublime, and a satisfying state of bliss. And it removes bad and unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.1	The Buddha then had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.2	“Is it true, monks, that there are monks who have taken their own lives, who have killed one another, and who have said to Migalaṇḍika, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.3	‘Please kill us. You will get our bowl and robes’?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.4	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.5	The Buddha criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.6	“Monks, it’s not suitable for these monks, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it should not be done. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.7	How could those monks do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.8	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.9	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.10	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.11.0	Preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.11.1	‘If a monk intentionally kills a human being or seeks an instrument of death for them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.12	he too is expelled and excluded from the community.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.13	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.1	At one time a certain lay follower was sick. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.2	He had a beautiful and pleasant wife, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.3	who the monks from the group of six had fallen in love with. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.4	They said to each other, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.5	“If this lay follower recovers, we won’t get her. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.6	Come, let’s praise death to him.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.7	They then went to that lay follower and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.8	“You’ve done what’s good and wholesome; you’ve made a shelter against fear. You haven’t done anything bad; you haven’t been greedy or immoral. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.10	So why carry on with this miserable and difficult life? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.11	Death is better for you. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.12	When you’ve passed away, you’ll be reborn in a happy place, in heaven. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.13	There you’ll be able to enjoy the pleasures of heaven.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.14	That lay follower thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.15	“The venerables have spoken the truth, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.17	for I’ve done what’s good and avoided what’s bad, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.20	and after death I’ll be reborn in a happy place.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.22	From then on he ate various kinds of detrimental food and drank detrimental drinks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.23	and as a consequence, he became very ill 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.24	and died. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.25	But his wife complained and criticized those monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.26	“These Sakyan monastics are shameless and immoral liars. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.27	They claim to act with integrity, to be celibate and of good conduct, to be truthful, moral, and good. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.28	But they don’t have the good character of a monastic or brahmin. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.29	They’ve lost the plot! 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.30	They praised death to my husband, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.31	and as a result my husband is dead.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.32	And other people complained and criticized them in the same way. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.38	The monks heard the criticism of those people. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.39	Those monks who had few desires and a sense of conscience, who were contented, afraid of wrongdoing, and fond of the training, complained and criticized those monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.40	“How could they praise death to that lay follower?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.41	After criticizing those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.42	“Is it true, monks, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.43	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.44	The Buddha rebuked them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.45	“Foolish men, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it should not be done. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.46	How could you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.47	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.48	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.49.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.49.1	‘If a monk intentionally kills a human being or seeks an instrument of death for him or praises death or incites someone to die, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.50	“My friend, what’s the point of this miserable and difficult life? Death is better for you than life!”—
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.51	thinking and intending thus, if he praises death in many ways or incites someone to die—
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.52	he too is expelled and excluded from the community.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.0	Definitions 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.1	A: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.2	whoever … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.3	Monk: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.4	… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.5	Intentionally: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.6	knowing, perceiving, having intended, having decided, he transgresses. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.7	A human being: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.8	from the mind’s first appearance in the mother’s womb, from the first manifestation of consciousness, until the time of death: in between these—this is called “a human being”. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.9	Kills: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.10	Cuts off the life faculty, brings it to an end, interrupts its continuation. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.11	Or seeks an instrument of death for him: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.12	a sword, a dagger, an arrow, a club, a rock, a knife, poison, or a rope. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.13	Or praises death: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.14	he shows the disadvantage in living and speaks in praise of death. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.15	Or incites someone to die: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.16	he says, “Kill yourself with a knife,” “Eat poison,” “Die by hanging yourself with a rope.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.17	My friend: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.18	this is a form of address. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.19	What’s the point of this miserable and difficult life: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.20	Miserable life: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.21	the life of the poor is miserable compared to the life of the rich; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.22	the life of the impoverished is miserable compared to the life of the wealthy; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.23	the life of humans is miserable compared to the life of the gods. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.24	Difficult life: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.25	the life of one whose hands are cut off, whose feet are cut off, whose hands and feet are cut off, whose ears are cut off, whose nose is cut off, whose ears and nose are cut off. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.26	Because of this sort of miserableness and this sort of difficult life, one says, “Death is better for you than life!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.27	Thinking: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.28	mind and thought are equivalent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.29	Intending: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.30	perceiving death, intending death, aiming at death. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.31	In many ways: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.32	in various manners. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.33	He praises death: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.34	he shows the disadvantage in living and speaks in praise of death, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.35	“When you’ve passed away, you’ll be reborn in a happy destination, in heaven. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.36	There you’ll be able to enjoy the pleasures of heaven.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.37	Or incites someone to die: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.38	he says, “Kill yourself with a knife,” “Eat poison,” “Die by hanging yourself with a rope,” “Jump into a chasm,” “Jump into a pit,” “Jump off a cliff.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.39	He too: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.40	this is said with reference to the preceding offenses entailing expulsion. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.41	Is expelled: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.42	just as an ordinary stone that has broken in half cannot be put back together again, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.43	so too is a monk who has intentionally killed a human being not an ascetic, not a Sakyan monastic. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.44	Therefore it is said, “he is expelled.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.45	Excluded from the community: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.46	Community: joint legal procedures, a joint recitation, the same training—this is called “community”. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:3.47	He does not take part in this—therefore it is called “excluded from the community”.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.30.12	The first monk became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.30.13	“There’s no offense entailing expulsion, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.30.14	but there’s a serious offense.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.31.1	On one occasion the monks from the group of six set fire to a forest grove. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.31.2	People were burnt and died. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.31.3	The monks became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.31.4	“There’s no offense for one who isn’t aiming at death.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.31.5	On one occasion the monks from the group of six set fire to a forest grove, aiming to cause death. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.31.6	People were burnt and died. … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.31.7	People were burnt, but did not die. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.31.8	The monks became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.31.9	“There’s no offense entailing expulsion, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.31.10	but there’s a serious offense.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.32.1	On one occasion a monk went to a place of execution and said to the executioner, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.32.2	“Don’t torture him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.32.3	Kill him with a single blow.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.32.4	“Alright, Sir,” he said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.32.5	and he killed him with a single blow. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.32.6	The monk became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.32.7	“You have committed an offense entailing expulsion.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.32.8	On one occasion a monk went to a place of execution and said to the executioner, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.32.9	“Don’t torture him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.32.10	Kill him with a single blow.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.32.11	Saying, “No, I can’t,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.32.12	he executed him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.32.13	The monk became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.32.14	“There’s no offense entailing expulsion, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.32.15	but there’s an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.1	On one occasion a man whose hands and feet had been cut off was at his relatives’ house, surrounded by his relations. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.2	A monk said to those people, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.3	“Do you want to euthanize him?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.4	“Yes, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.5	“Then give him buttermilk.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.6	They gave him buttermilk 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.7	and he died. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.8	The monk became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.9	“You have committed an offense entailing expulsion.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.10	On one occasion a man whose hands and feet had been cut off was at home, surrounded by his relations. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.11	A nun said to those people, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.12	“Do you want to euthanize him?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.13	“Yes, Venerable.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.14	“Then give him salty purgative.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.15	They gave him salty purgative 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.16	and he died. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.17	The nun became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.18	She then told the nuns, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.19	who in turn told the monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.20	who then told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.21	“Monks, that nun has committed an offense entailing expulsion.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.33.22	The third offense entailing expulsion is finished.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:0.3	The chapter on offenses entailing expulsion 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:0.4	4. The fourth training rule on expulsion 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.0.1	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood near Vesālī, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.2	a number of monks who were friends had entered the rainy-season residence on the banks of the river Vaggumudā. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.3	At that time Vajjī was short of food and afflicted with hunger, with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to straw. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.4	It was not easy to get by on almsfood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.5	The monks considered the difficult circumstances, and they thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.6	“How can we live in concord and harmony, have a comfortable rainy season, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.7	and get almsfood without trouble?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.8	Some said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.9	“We could work for the householders, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.10	and they’ll support us in return.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.11	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.12	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.13	Others said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.14	“There’s no need to work for the householders. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.15	Let’s instead take messages for them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.16	and they’ll support us in return.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.17	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.18	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.19	Still others said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.20	“There’s no need to work or take messages for them. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.21	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.22	Let’s instead talk up one another’s superhuman qualities to the householders: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.23	‘That monk has the first absorption, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.24	that monk the second absorption, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.25	that monk the third, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.26	that monk the fourth; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.27	that monk is a stream-enterer, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.28	that monk a once-returner, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.29	that a non-returner, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.30	that a perfected one; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.31	that monk has the three true insights, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.32	and that the six direct knowledges.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.33	Then they’ll support us. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.34	In this way we’ll live in concord and harmony, spend the rainy season in comfort, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.35	and have no trouble getting almsfood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.36	This is the way to go.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.37	Then those monks did just that. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.38	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.39	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.40	And the people there thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.41	“We’re so fortunate that such monks have come to us for the rainy-season residence. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.42	Such virtuous and good monks have never before entered the rains residence with us.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.43	And they gave such food and drink to those monks that they did not even eat and drink themselves, or give to their parents, to their wives and children, to their slaves, servants, and workers, to their friends and companions, or to their relatives. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.45	Soon those monks had a good color, bright faces, clear skin, and  sharp senses. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.1	Now it was the custom for monks who had completed the rainy-season residence to go and visit the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.2	And so, when the three months were over and they had completed the rains residence, those monks put their dwellings in order, took their bowls and robes, and set out Vesālī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.3	When they eventually arrived, they went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. There they approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.4	At that time the monks who had completed the rains residence in that region were thin, haggard, and pale, with veins protruding all over their bodies. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.5	Yet the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā had a good color, bright faces, clear skin, and  sharp senses. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.6	Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.7	the Buddha said to them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.8	“I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re getting by. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.9	I hope you had a comfortable rains residence, living in concord and harmony, and that you had no trouble getting almsfood?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.10	“We’re keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re getting by. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.11	We had a comfortable rains residence, living in concord and harmony, and we had no trouble getting almsfood.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.12	When Buddhas know what is going on, sometimes they ask and sometimes not. They know the right time to ask and when not to ask. Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, otherwise not, for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.13	Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.14	And the Buddha said to those monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.15	“In what way, monks, did you have a comfortable rains residence, with no trouble getting almsfood?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.16	They then told him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.17	“But did you really have those superhuman qualities?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.18	“No, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.19	The Buddha rebuked them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.20	“It’s not suitable, foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.21	How could you for the sake of your stomachs talk up one another’s superhuman qualities to householders? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.22	It would be better for your bellies to be cut open with a sharp butcher’s knife than for you to talk up one another’s superhuman qualities to householders. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.23	Why is that? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.24	For although it might cause death or death-like suffering, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.25	it would not cause you to be reborn in a bad destination. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.26	But *this* might. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.27	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.28	After rebuking them and giving a teaching, he addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.1	“Monks, there are these five great gangsters to be found in the world. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.2	What five? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.3	There are great gangsters who think like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.4	‘When the heck will I walk about in villages, towns, and royal capitals, with a following of a hundred or a thousand men, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.5	killing, destroying, and torturing?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.6	Then after some time, he does just that. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.7	Just so, monks, a bad monk thinks like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.8	‘When the heck will I walk about in villages, towns, and royal capitals, with a following of a hundred or a thousand people, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.9	being honored, respected, and revered by both lay people and those gone forth, getting robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.10	Then after some time, he does just that. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.11	This is the first great gangster to be found in the world. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.12	Again, a bad monk learns the spiritual path proclaimed by the Buddha and takes it as his own. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.13	This is the second great gangster to be found in the world. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.14	Again, a bad monk groundlessly charges someone living a pure spiritual life with a sexual offense. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.15	This is the third great gangster to be found in the world. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.16	Again, a bad monk takes valuable goods and requisites from the Sangha—
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.17	a monastery, the land of a monastery, a dwelling, the site of a dwelling, a bed, a bench, a mattress, a pillow, a metal pot, a metal jar, a metal bucket, a metal bowl, a machete, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, a chisel, a creeper, bamboo, reed, grass, clay, wooden goods, earthenware goods—
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.18	and uses them to win over and create a following among householders. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.19	This is the fourth great gangster to be found in the world. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.20	But in this world with its gods, lords of death, and supreme beings, in this society with its monastics and brahmins, its gods and humans, this is the greatest gangster: one who claims to have a non-existent superhuman quality. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.21	Why is that? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.22	Monks, you’ve eaten the country’s almsfood by theft.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.23	Whoever should declare himself 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.24	To be other than he truly is, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.25	Has eaten this by theft, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.26	Like a cheater who has deceived. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.27	Many ocher-necks of bad qualities, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.28	Uncontrolled and wicked—
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.29	By their wicked deeds, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.30	They are reborn in hell. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.31	It’s better to eat an iron ball, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.32	As hot as a licking flame, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.33	Than for the immoral and uncontrolled 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.34	To eat the country’s alms. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.35	After rebuking the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā in many ways for being difficult to maintain, difficult to support … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.36	“… And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.37.0	Preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.37.1	‘If a monk falsely claims for himself a superhuman quality, a knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, saying, “This I know, this I see,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.38	but after some time—whether questioned or not, but having committed the offense and seeking purification—should say: “Not knowing I said that I know, not seeing that I see; what I said was empty and false,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.39	he too is expelled and excluded from the community.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.40	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:2.1	Soon afterwards a number of monks, thinking they had seen and realized what in fact they had not, declared final knowledge because of overestimation. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:2.2	After some time, their minds inclined to sensual desire, ill will, and confusion. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:2.3	They became anxious, thinking, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:2.4	“The Buddha has laid down a training rule, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:2.5	yet we declared final knowledge because of overestimation. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:2.6	Could it be that we’ve committed an offense entailing expulsion?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:2.7	They told Venerable Ānanda, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:2.8	who told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:2.9	He said, “This is negligible, Ānanda. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:2.10	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:2.11	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:2.12.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:2.12.1	‘If a monk falsely claims for himself a superhuman quality, a knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, saying, “This I know, this I see,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:2.13	but after some time—whether he is questioned or not, but having committed the offense and seeking purification—should say: “Not knowing I said that I know, not seeing that I see; what I said was empty and false,” then, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:2.14	except if it is due to overestimation, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:2.15	he too is expelled and excluded from the community.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.0	Definitions 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.1	A: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.2	whoever … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.3	Monk: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.4	… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.5	Falsely: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.6	although a certain wholesome quality is non-existent in himself, not real, not to be found, and he does not see it or know it, he says, “I have this wholesome quality.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.7	A superhuman quality: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.8	absorption, release, stillness, attainment, knowledge and vision, development of the path, realization of the fruits, abandoning the defilements, a mind without hindrances, delighting in solitude. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.9	For himself: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.10	either he presents those good qualities as in himself, or he presents himself as among those good qualities. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.11	Knowledge: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.12	the three true insights. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.13	Vision: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.14	knowledge and vision are equivalent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.15	Claims: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.16	announces to a woman or a man, to a lay person or one gone forth. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.17	This I know, this I see: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.18	“I know these qualities,” “I see these qualities,” “These qualities are found in me and I conform to them.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.19	After some time: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.20	the moment, the second, the instant after he has made the claim. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.21	He is questioned: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.22	he is questioned in regard to what he has claimed: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.23	“What did you attain?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.24	“How did you attain it?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.25	“When did you attain it?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.26	“Where did you attain it?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.27	“Which defilements did you abandon?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.28	“Which qualities did you gain?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.29	Not: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.30	he is not spoken to by anyone. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.31	Having committed the offense: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.32	having bad desires, overcome by desire, claiming to have a non-existent, unreal superhuman quality, he has committed an offense entailing expulsion. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.33	Seeking purification: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.34	he desires to be a householder, a lay follower, a monastery worker, or a novice monk. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.35	Not knowing I said that I know, not seeing that I see: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.36	“I don’t know these qualities,” “I don’t see these qualities,” “These qualities aren’t found in me and I don’t conform to them.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.37	What I said was empty and false: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.38	“What I said was empty,” “What I said was false,” “What I said was unreal,” “I said it without knowing.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.39	Except if it is due to overestimation: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.40	Unless it is due to overestimation. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.41	He too: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.42	this is said with reference to the preceding offenses entailing expulsion. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.43	Is expelled: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.44	just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.45	so too is a monk with bad desires, overcome by desire, who claims to have a non-existent superhuman quality not an ascetic, not a Sakyan monastic. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.46	Therefore it is said, “he is expelled.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.47	Excluded from the community: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.48	Community: joint legal procedures, a joint recitation, the same training—this is called “community”. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.49	He does not take part in this—therefore it is called “excluded from the community”.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.8.7	but I’m no such disciple. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.8.8	Could it be that I’ve committed an offense entailing expulsion?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.8.9	He told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.8.10	“What were you thinking, monk?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.8.11	“I didn’t intend to make a claim, Sir.”

pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.10.2	The monks said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.10.3	“We hope you’re bearing up? We hope you’re comfortable?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.10.4	“It’s not possible for just anyone to endure this.”

pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.10.10	“It’s not possible for an ordinary person to endure this.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.10.11	He became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.10.12	“What were you thinking, monk?”

pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.10.14	“There’s no offense entailing expulsion,

pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.13.8	“The pleasures of the world have been rejected by me.”

pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.13.14	He became anxious, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.13.15	thinking, “Those who are true disciple of the Buddha may say that,

pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.13.17	Could it be that I’ve committed an offense entailing expulsion?”

pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.14.1	At one time a number of monks entered the rainy-season residence in a certain monastery, making this agreement: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.14.2	“Whoever sets out from this monastery first, we’ll know him as a perfected one.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.14.3	One of them thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.14.4	“Let them think I’m a perfected one,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.14.5	and he set out first from that monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.14.6	He became anxious … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:8.14.7	“You’ve committed an offense entailing expulsion.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.1.0	Case studies, part 2 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.1.2	Venerable Lakkhaṇa and Venerable Mahāmoggallāna were staying on the Vulture Peak. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.1.3	One morning Mahāmoggallāna robed up, took his bowl and robe, went to Lakkhaṇa, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.1.4	“Lakkhaṇa, let’s enter Rājagaha for almsfood.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.1.5	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.1.6	As they descended from the Vulture Peak, Mahāmoggallāna smiled at a certain place. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.1.7	Lakkhaṇa asked him why, and Māhamoggallāna replied,  
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.1.8	
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.1.9	“This isn’t the right time to ask. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.1.10	Please ask me in the presence of the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.1	Then, after their meal and after returning from almsround, Lakkhaṇa and Mahāmoggallāna went to the Buddha, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.2	bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.3	And Lakkhaṇa said to Mahāmoggallāna, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.4	“Earlier on, as we were descending from the Vulture Peak, you smiled at a certain place. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.5	Why was that?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.6	“As I was coming down from the Vulture Peak, I saw a skeleton flying through the air. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.7	Vultures, crows, and hawks were pursuit it, striking it between the ribs, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.8	while it uttered cries of distress. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.9	And I thought 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.10	how amazing and astonishing it is that such a being should exist, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.11	such a spirit, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.12	such a state of existence.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.13	But the monks complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.14	“He’s claiming a superhuman ability!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.15	The Buddha then said to them: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.16	“There are disciples who have vision 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.17	and knowledge, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.18	who can know, see, and witness such things. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.19	I too, monks, have seen that being, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.20	but I didn’t speak about it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.21	If I had, others wouldn’t have believed me, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.22	which would have led to their harm and suffering for a long time. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.23	That being was a cattle butcher right here in Rājagaha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.24	As a result of his deeds, he was tormented in hell for many hundreds of thousands of years. And now, because of the remaining result of his actions, he’s experiencing such an existence. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.25	Moggallāna spoke truthfully. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.2.26	There’s no offense for Moggallāna.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.3.1	“As I was coming down from the Vulture Peak, I saw a lump of flesh flying through the air. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.3.2	Vultures, crows, and hawks were pursuing it, tearing at it and pulling it to pieces,

pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.7.10	Sobhita spoke truthfully.

pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.7.15	As before, so after: he’s expelled and excluded from the community. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.7.16	In regard to this I ask you,

pli-tv-bu-vb-sk1:1.8	After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk1:1.9	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks from the group of six:

pli-tv-bu-vb-sk37:1.5	Who doesn’t like nice food? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk37:1.6	Who doesn’t prefer tasty food?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk37:1.7	The monks heard the complaints of those people, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk37:1.8	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk37:1.9	“How can the monks from the group of six do this?” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk37:1.10	“Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk37:1.11	“It’s true, Sir.”

pli-tv-bu-vb-sk37:1.13	“Foolish men, how can you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk37:1.14	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …

pli-tv-bu-vb-sk37:2.2	The monks who were looking after them asked,

pli-tv-bu-vb-sk37:2.4	“Previously we ate rice and bean curry that we had requested ourselves, and then we were comfortable.

pli-tv-bu-vb-sk37:2.7	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk37:2.8	“Monks, I allow a sick monk to eat rice and bean curry that he has requested for himself.

pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.2	At that time the monks from the group of six were sitting on low seats while giving teachings to people sitting on high seats. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.3	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.4	“How can the monks from the group of six sit on low seats while giving teachings to people sitting on high seats?” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.5	“Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.6	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.7	The Buddha rebuked them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.8	“Foolish men, how can you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.9	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.10	and after rebuking them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.11	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.12.0	Jataka 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.12.1	“Once upon a time in Bārāṇasī, monks, there was a low-caste man whose wife became pregnant. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.13	She said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.14	‘I’m pregnant. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.15	I crave mangoes.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.16	‘But there are no mangoes. It’s the wrong season.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.17	‘If I don’t get any, I’ll die.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.18	At that time the king had a mango tree that was always bearing fruit. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.19	Then that low-caste man went to that mango tree, climbed it, and hid himself. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.20	Just then the king and his brahmin counselor went to that same mango tree. There the king sat on a high seat while learning the Vedas. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.21	The low-caste man thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.22	‘How wrong-headed this king is, in that he sits on a high seat while learning the Vedas. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.23	And the brahmin is wrong-headed too, in that he sits on a low seat while teaching the Vedas to one sitting on a high seat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.24	And I’m wrong-headed too, in that I steal mangoes from the king because of a woman. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.25	This is all so low!’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.26	And he fell out of the tree right there. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.27.0	The low-caste man says: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.27.1	‘Neither understands what is good, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.28	Neither sees the Truth: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.29	Not he who teaches the Vedas, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.30	Nor he who learns improperly.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.31.0	The brahmin replies: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.31.1	‘I’ve eaten the finest rice, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.32	With a curry of pure meat: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.33	Therefore I’m not practicing the Teaching, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.34	The Teaching praised by the Noble Ones.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.35.0	The low-caste man replies in turn: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.35.1	‘A curse it is the obtaining of wealth, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.36	And the obtaining of fame, too, brahmin; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.37	These things come with a low rebirth, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.38	Or with wrong-headed behavior. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.39	‘Go forth, great brahmin, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.40	Other beings will do the cooking; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.41	Don’t go against the Teaching, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.42	Because you’ll break like a jar.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.43	Even at that time, monks, I was displeased by someone teaching the Vedas while sitting on a low seat to someone sitting on a high seat. How, then, could it not be displeasing now? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.44	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.45	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:0.4	10. The training rule on schism in the Sangha 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.2	Devadatta went to see Kokālika, Kaṭamodakatissaka, Khaṇḍadeviyā-putta, and Samuddadatta. He said to them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.3	“Let’s create a schism in the Sangha of the ascetic Gotama. Let’s break its authority.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.4	Kokālika said to Devadatta, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.5	“The ascetic Gotama has great supernormal powers. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.6	How can we do this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.7	“Well, let’s go to the ascetic Gotama and request five things: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.8	‘In many ways, Sir, you praise fewness of wishes, contentment, the erasing of defilements, ascetic practices, being inspiring, the reduction in things, and being energetic. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.9	And there are five things that lead to just that. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.10	It would be good, Sir, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.11	if the monks stayed in the wilderness for life, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.12	and whoever stays near an inhabited area would commit an offense; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.13	if they ate only almsfood for life, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.14	and whoever accepts an invitational meal would commit an offense; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.15	if they were rag-robe wearers for life, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.16	and whoever accepts a robe from a householder would commit an offense;
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.17	if they lived at the foot of a tree for life, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.18	and whoever takes shelter would commit an offense; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.19	if they didn’t eat fish or meat for life, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.20	and whoever does would commit an offense.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.21	The ascetic Gotama won’t allow this. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.22	We’ll then be able to win people over with these five points.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.23	Kokālika said, “It might be possible to create a schism in the Sangha with these five points, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.24	for people have confidence in austerity.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.2.1	Devadatta and his followers then went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.2.2	and Devadatta made his request. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.2.10	The Buddha replied, “No, Devadatta. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.2.11	Those who wish may stay in the wilderness, and those who wish may live near inhabited areas. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.2.12	Those who wish may eat only almsfood, and those who wish may accept invitational meals. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.2.13	Those who wish may be rag-robe wearers, and those who wish may accept robes from householders. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.2.14	I have allowed the foot of a tree as resting place for eight months of the year, as well as fish and meat that are pure in three respects: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.2.15	one hasn’t seen, heard, or suspected that the animal was specifically killed to feed a monastic.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.2.16	Devadatta thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.2.17	“The Buddha doesn’t allow the five points,” and he was glad and elated. He got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left with his followers. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.2.18	Devadatta then entered Rājagaha and won people over with the five points, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.2.32	saying, “The ascetic Gotama doesn’t agree to them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.2.33	but we practice in accordance with them.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.1	The foolish people with little faith and confidence said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.2	“These Sakyan monastics are practicing asceticism and they live their lives to erase defilements. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.3	But the acetic Gotama is extravagant and has chosen to live a life of abundance.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.4	But the wise people who had faith and confidence complained and criticized Devadatta, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.5	“How can Devadatta pursue schism in the Sangha of the Buddha? How can he break its authority?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.6	The monks heard the criticism of those people, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.7	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.8	in the same way. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.9	After rebuking Devadatta in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Devadatta: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.10	“Is it true, Devadatta, that you are doing this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.11	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.12	The Buddha rebuked him … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.13	“Foolish man, how can you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.14	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.15	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.16.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.16.1	‘If a monk pursues schism in a united Sangha or persists in taking up a legal issue conducive to schism, the monks should correct him like this, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.17	“Venerable, don’t pursue schism in the united Sangha or persist in taking up a legal issue conducive to schism. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.18	Stay with the Sangha, for a united Sangha—in concord, in harmony, having a joint recitation—is at ease.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.19	If that monk continues as before, the monks should press him up to three times to make him stop. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.20	If he then stops, all is well. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.3.21	If he does not stop, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss11:1.2	At that time Devadatta was pursuing schism in the Sangha, a break in authority. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss11:1.3	The monks were saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss11:1.4	“Devadatta speaks contrary to the Teaching and the training. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss11:1.5	How can he pursue schism in the Sangha?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss11:1.6	But Kokālika, Kaṭamodakatissaka, Khaṇḍadeviyā-putta, and Samuddadatta said to those monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss11:1.7	“No, Venerables, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss11:1.8	Devadatta speaks in accordance with the Teaching and the training. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss11:1.9	And he speaks with our consent and approval. He knows about us and speaks for us, and we approve of this.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss11:1.10	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss11:1.11	“How can these monks support Devadatta’s pursuit of schism in the Sangha?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss11:1.12	They rebuked those monks in many ways and then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss11:1.13	“Is it true, monks, that there are monks who support this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss11:1.14	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss11:1.15	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss11:1.16	“Monks, how can those foolish men support this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss11:1.17	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss11:1.18	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss11:1.19.1	‘That monk may have one, two, or three monks who side with him and support him, and they may say, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss11:1.20	“Venerables, don’t correct this monk.

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Monastery, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.2	Venerable Channa was misbehaving. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.3	The monks would tell him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.4	“Don’t do that; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.5	it’s not allowable,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.6	and he would reply, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.7	“Who are you to correct me? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.8	I should correct you! 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.9	The Buddha is mine; the Teaching is mine. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.10	The Master realized the Truth because of me. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.11	Just as grass, sticks, and fallen leaves are whirled up by a strong wind all at once, just as various water plants are whirled up by a mountain stream all at once, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.12	so too have you–after going forth with various names, various families, various castes, various households–been lifted up all at once. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.13	So, who are you to correct me? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.14	I should correct you! 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.15	The Buddha is mine; the Teaching is mine. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.16	The Master realized the Truth because of me.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.17	The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.18	“How can Venerable Channa make himself incorrigible when he’s legitimately corrected by the monks?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.19	They rebuked Channa in many ways and then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Channa: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.20	“Is it true, Channa, that you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.21	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.22	The Buddha rebuked him … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.23	“Foolish man, how can you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.24	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.25	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.26.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.26.1	‘If a monk is difficult to correct, and he makes himself incorrigible when legitimately corrected by the monks concerning the training rules that are recited, saying,

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.28	Please refrain from correcting me,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.29	then the monks should correct him like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.30	“Be easy to correct, Venerable, not incorrigible. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.31	And please give legitimate correction to the monks, and the monks will do the same to you. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.32	For it’s in this way that the Buddha’s community has grown, that is, through mutual correction and mutual clearing of offenses.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.33	If that monk continues as before, the monks should press him up to three times to make him stop. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12:1.34	If he then stops, all is well.

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.1.2	At that time Assaji and Punabbasuka were the resident monks at Kīṭāgiri. They were bad and shameless, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.1.3	and were misbehaving in many ways. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.1.4	They planted flowering trees, watered and plucked them, and then tied the flowers together. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.1.5	They made the flowers into garlands, garlands with stalks on one side and garlands with stalks on both sides. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.1.6	They made flower arrangements, wreaths, ornaments for the head, ornaments for the ears, and ornaments for the chest. And they had others do the same. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.1.7	They then took these things, or sent them, to the women, the daughters, the girls, the daughter-in-laws, and the female slaves of good families. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.1.8	They ate from the same plates as these women and drank from the same vessels. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.1.9	They sat on the same seats as them, and they lay down on the same beds, on the same sheets, under the same covers, and both on the same sheets and under the same covers. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.1.10	They ate at the wrong time, drank alcohol, and wore garlands, perfumes, and cosmetics. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.1.11	They danced, sang, played instruments, and performed. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.1.12	While the women were dancing, singing, playing instruments, and performing, so would they. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.2.1	They played various games: eight-row checkers, ten-row checkers, imaginary checkers, hopscotch, spillikins, dice, tip-cat, painting with the hand, ball games, leaf flutes, toy plows, somersaults, toy windmills, toy measures, toy carriages, toy bows, letter guessing, thought guessing, mimicking deformities. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.2.2	They trained in elephant riding, in horsemanship, in carriage riding, in archery, in swordsmanship. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.2.3	And they ran in front of elephants, horses, and carriages, and they ran backwards and forwards. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.2.4	They whistled, clapped their hands, wrestled, and boxed. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.2.5	They spread their outer robe on a stage and said to the dancing girls, “Dance here, Sister,” and they made gestures of approval. And they misbehaved in a variety of ways. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.3.1	Just then a monk who had completed the rainy-season residence in Kāsī was on his way to visit the Buddha at Sāvatthī when he arrived at Kīṭāgiri. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.3.2	In the morning he robed up, took his bowl and robe, and entered Kīṭāgiri to collect almsfood. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.3.3	He was pleasing in his conduct: in going out and coming back, in looking ahead and looking aside, in bending and stretching his arms. His eyes were lowered, and he was perfect in deportment. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.3.4	When people saw him, they said, “Whoʼs this, acting like a moron and always frowning? Who will give almsfood to him? Almsfood should instead be given to our Venerables Assaji and Punabbasuka, for they are gentle, congenial, pleasant to speak with, greeting one with a smile, welcoming, friendly, open, the first to speak.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.3.5	A certain lay follower saw that monk walking for alms in Kīṭāgiri. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.3.6	He approached him, bowed, and said, “Venerable, have you received any almsfood?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.3.7	“No, I haven’t.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.3.8	“Come, let’s go to my house.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.4.1	He took that monk to his house and gave him a meal. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.4.2	He then said, “Where are you going, Venerable?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.4.3	“I’m going to Sāvatthī to see the Buddha.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.4.4	“Well then, would you please pay respect at the Buddha’s feet in my name and say, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.4.5	‘Venerable Sir, the monastery at Kīṭāgiri has been corrupted. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.4.6	Assaji and Punabbasuka are the resident monks there. They are bad and shameless, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.4.7	and are misbehaving in a many ways. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.4.8	They plant flowering trees, water them … And they misbehave in a variety of ways. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.4.9	Those who previously had faith and confidence have now lost it, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.4.10	and thereʼs no longer any support for the Sangha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.4.11	The good monks have left and the bad monks are staying on. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.4.12	Sir, please send monks to stay at the monastery at Kīṭāgiri.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.5.1	The monk consented, got up, and set out for Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.5.2	When he eventually arrived, he went to the Buddha in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. He bowed to the Buddha and sat down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.5.3	Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.5.4	the Buddha said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.5.5	“I hope you’re keeping well, monk, I hope you’re getting by. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.5.6	I hope you’re not tired from traveling. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.5.7	And where have you come from?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.5.8	“I’m keeping well, Sir, I’m getting by. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.5.9	I’m not tired from traveling.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.5.10	He then told the Buddha all that had happened at Kīṭāgiri, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.5.28	adding, “That’s where I’ve come from, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.6.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.6.2	“Is it true, monks, that the bad and shameless monks Assaji and Punabbasuka are misbehaving in this way? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.6.4	And is it true that those people who previously had faith and confidence have now lost it, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.6.5	that there’s no longer any support for the Sangha, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.6.6	and that the good monks have left and the bad monks are staying on?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.6.7	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.6.8	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.6.9	“Monks, how can those foolish men misbehave in this way? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.6.22	
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.6.23	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.6.24	… After criticizing them, he gave a teaching and addressed Sāriputta and Moggallāna: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.6.25	“Sāriputta, the two of you should go and do a legal procedure of banishing the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from Kīṭāgiri. They are your students.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.6.26	“Sir, how can we do a procedure of banishing these monks from Kīṭāgiri? They are temperamental and harsh.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.6.27	“Well, take many monks.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.6.28	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.7.1	“And, monks, this is how it should be done. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.7.2	First you should accuse the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.7.3	They should then be reminded of what they have done, before they are charged with an offense. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.7.4	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.7.5	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.7.6	These monks, Assaji and Punabbasuka, are corrupters of families and badly behaved. Their bad behavior has been seen and heard about, and the families corrupted by them have been seen and heard about. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.7.7	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do a legal procedure of banishing them, prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at Kīṭāgiri. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.7.8	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.7.9	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.7.10	These monks, Assaji and Punabbasuka, are corrupters of families and badly behaved. Their bad behavior has been seen and heard about, and the families corrupted by them have been seen and heard about. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.7.11	The Sangha is doing a legal procedure of banishing them, prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at Kīṭāgiri. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.7.12	Any monk who approves of doing a legal procedure of banishing them, prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at Kīṭāgiri, should remain silent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.7.13	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.7.14	For the second time … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.7.15	For the third time I speak on this matter. Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. … should speak up. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.7.16	The Sangha has performed the legal procedure of banishing them, prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at Kīṭāgiri. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.7.17	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.1	Soon afterwards a sangha of monks, headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna, went to Kīṭāgiri and did the procedure of banishing Assaji and Punabbasuka, prohibiting them from staying at Kīṭāgiri. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.2	After the Sangha had done the procedure, those monks did not conduct themselves properly or suitably so as to deserve to be released, nor did they ask the monks for forgiveness. Instead they abused and reviled them, and they slandered them as acting from desire, ill will, confusion, and fear. And they left and they disrobed. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.3	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.4	“How can these monks act in this way when the Sangha has done a legal procedure of banishing them?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.5	They rebuked the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka in many ways and then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.6	“Is it true, monks, that the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka acted in this way?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.7	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.8	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.9	“And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.10.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.10.1	‘If a monk who lives supported by a village or town is a corrupter of families and badly behaved, and his bad behavior has been seen and heard about, and the families corrupted by him have been seen and heard about, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.11	then the monks should correct him like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.12	“Venerable, you’re a corrupter of families and badly behaved. Your bad behavior has been seen and heard about, and the families corrupted by you have been seen and heard about. Leave this monastery; you’ve stayed here long enough.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.13	If he replies, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.14	“You’re acting out of desire, ill will, confusion, and fear. Because of this sort of offense, you only banish some, but not others,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.15	the monks should correct him like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.16	“No, Venerable, the monks are not acting out of desire, ill will, confusion, and fear. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.17	Venerable, you’re a corrupter of families and badly behaved. Your bad behavior has been seen and heard about, and the families corrupted by you have been seen and heard about. Leave this monastery; you’ve stayed here long enough.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.18	If that monk continues as before, the monks should press him up to three times to make him stop. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.19	If he then stops, all is well. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.20	If he does not stop, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.0	Definitions 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.1	A monk … a village or town: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.2	a village and a town and a city are included in just a village and a town. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.3	Lives supported by: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.4	robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines can be gotten in that place. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.5	A family: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.6	there are four kinds of families: the aristocratic family, the brahmin family, the merchant family, the worker family. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.7	A corrupter of families: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.8	he corrupts families by means of flowers, fruit, bath powder, soap, tooth cleaners, bamboo, medical treatment, or by taking messages on foot. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.9	Badly behaved: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.10	he plants flowering trees and has it done; he waters them and has it done; he plucks them and has it done; he ties the flowers together and has it done. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.11	Has been seen and heard about: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.12	those who are present see it; those who are absent hear about it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.13	The families corrupted by him: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.14	they have lost their faith because of him; they have lost their confidence because of him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.15	Have been seen and heard about: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.16	those who are present see it; those who are absent hear about it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.17	Him: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.18	that monk who is a corrupter of families. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.19	The monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.20	Other monks, those who see it or hear about it. They should correct him like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.21	“Venerable, you’re a corrupter of families and badly behaved. Your bad behavior has been seen and heard about, and the families corrupted by you have been seen and heard about. Leave this monastery; you’ve stayed here long enough.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.22	If he replies, “You’re acting out of desire, ill will, confusion, and fear. Because of this sort of offense, you only banish some, but not others.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.23	Him: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.24	that monk who is having a legal procedure done against him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.25	The monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.26	Other monks, those who see it or hear about it. They should correct him like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.27	“No, Venerable, the monks are not acting out of desire, ill will, confusion, and fear. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.28	Venerable, you’re a corrupter of families and badly behaved. Your bad behavior has been seen and heard about, and the families corrupted by you have been seen and heard about. Leave this monastery; you’ve stayed here long enough.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.29	And they should correct him a second 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.30	and a third time. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.31	If he stops, all is well. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.32	If he does not stop, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.33	If those who hear about it do not say anything, they commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.34	That monk, even if he has to be pulled into the Sangha, should be corrected like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.35	“No, Venerable, the monks are not acting out of desire, ill will, confusion, and fear. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.36	Venerable, you’re a corrupter of families and badly behaved. Your bad behavior has been seen and heard about, and the families corrupted by you have been seen and heard about. Leave this monastery; you’ve stayed here long enough.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.37	They should correct him a second 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.38	and a third time. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.39	If he stops, all is well. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.40	If he does not stop, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.41	Should press him: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.42	“And, monks, he should be pressed like this. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.43	A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.44	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.45	The monk so-and-so, who has had a legal procedure of banishment done against himself, is slandering the monks as acting out of desire, ill will, confusion, and fear. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.46	And he keeps on doing it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.47	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should press him to make him stop. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.48	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.49	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.50	The monk so-and-so, who has had a legal procedure of banishment done against himself, is slandering the monks as acting out of desire, ill will, confusion, and fear. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.51	And he keeps on doing it. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.52	The Sangha presses him to make him stop. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.53	Any monk who approves of pressing him to make him stop should remain silent. Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.54	For the second time I speak on this matter … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.55	For the third time I speak on this matter … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.56	The Sangha has pressed monk so-and-so to stop. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.57	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.58	After the motion, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.59	After each of the first two announcements, he commits a serious offense. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.60	When the last announcement is finished, he commits an offense entailing suspension. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.61	For one who commits the offense entailing suspension, the offense of wrong conduct and the serious offenses are annulled. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.62	He commits an offense entailing suspension: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.63	only the Sangha gives probation for that offense, sends back to the beginning, gives the trial period, and rehabilitates—not several monks, not an individual. Therefore it is called “an offense entailing suspension”. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.64	This is the name and designation of this class of offense. Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension”. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.1.0	Permutations 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.1.1	If it is a legitimate legal procedure, and he perceives it as such, and he does not stop, he commits an offense entailing suspension. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.1.2	If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but he is unsure of it, and he does not stop, he commits an offense entailing suspension. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.1.3	If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but he perceives it as illegitimate, and he does not stop, he commits an offense entailing suspension. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.1.4	If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, but he perceives it as legitimate, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.1.5	If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.1.6	If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, and he perceives it as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.0	Non-offenses 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.1	There is no offense: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.2	if he has not been pressed; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.3	if he stops; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.4	if he is insane; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.5	if he is the first offender. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.6	The training rule on corrupters of families, the thirteenth, is finished. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.7	“Venerables, the thirteen rules on suspension have been recited, nine being immediate offenses, four after the third announcement. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.8	If a monk commits any one of them, he is to undergo probation for the same number of days as he knowingly concealed that offense. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.9	When this is completed, he must undertake the trial period for a further six days. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.10	When this is completed, he is to be rehabilitated wherever there is an Sangha of at least twenty monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.11	If that monk is rehabilitated by an Sangha of even one less than twenty, that monk is not rehabilitated and those monks are at fault. This is the proper procedure. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.12	In regard to this I ask you, ‘Are you pure in this?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.13	A second time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.14	A third time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.15	You are pure in this and therefore silent. I will remember it thus.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.16	The group of thirteen is finished. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.17	This is the summary: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.18	Emission, physical contact, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.19	Indecent, and his own needs; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.20	Matchmaking, and a hut, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:3.2.21	And a dwelling, groundless.

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.0.1	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.2	At that time Venerable Seyyasaka was dissatisfied with the spiritual life, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.3	He became thin, haggard, and pale, with veins protruding all over his body. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.4	Venerable Udāyī saw him in this condition and said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.5	“Seyyasaka, you’re not looking well. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.6	You’re not dissatisfied with the spiritual life, are you?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.7	“I am.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.8	“Well then, eat , sleep, and bathe as much as you like. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.9	And whenever you become discontent and lust overwhelms you, just masturbate with your hand.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.10	“But is that allowable?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.11	“Yes, I do it too.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.12	Then Seyyasaka ate, slept, and bathed as much as he liked, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.13	and whenever he became discontent and lust overwhelmed him, he masturbated with his hand. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.14	After some time Seyyasaka had a good color, a bright face, clear skin, and sharp senses. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.15	The monks who were his friends said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.16	“Seyyasaka, you used to be thin, haggard, and pale, with veins protruding all over your body. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.17	But now you have a good color, a bright face, clear skin, and sharp senses. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.18	Have you been taking medicine?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.19	“No. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.20	I just eat, sleep, and bathe as much as I like, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.21	and whenever I become discontent and lust overwhelms me, I masturbate with my hand.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.1	“Do you eat the food given in faith with the same hand you use to masturbate?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.2	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.3	The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.4	“How can Venerable Seyyasaka masturbate with his hand?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.5	They rebuked Seyyasaka in many ways and then told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.6	The Buddha then had the Sangha gathered and questioned Seyyasaka: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.7	“Is it true, Seyyasaka, that you do this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.8	“Yes, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.9	The Buddha rebuked him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.10	“Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.11	How can you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.12	Haven’t I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.13	for freedom from bondage, not for the sake of bondage; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.14	for the sake of non-grasping, not for the sake of grasping? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.15	When I’ve taught like this, how can you choose passion, bondage, and grasping? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.16	Haven’t I given many teachings for the fading away of lust, for the clearing away of intoxication, for the removal of thirst, for the uprooting of attachment, for the cutting off of the round of rebirth, for the stopping of craving, for fading away, for ending, for extinguishment? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.17	Haven’t I given many teachings for the abandoning of sensual pleasures, for the full understanding of the perceptions of sensual pleasure, for the removal of thirst for sensual pleasure, for the elimination of thoughts of sensual pleasure, for the stilling of the fevers of sensual pleasure? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.18	Foolish man, this will affect people’s confidence, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.19	and cause some to lose it.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.20	Then, after rebuking Seyyasaka in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.21	“And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.22.0	Preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.22.1	‘Intentional emission of semen is an offense entailing suspension.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.2.23	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.1.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.1.1	Soon afterwards some monks ate fine foods, fell asleep absentminded and heedless, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.1.2	and emitted semen while dreaming. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.1.3	They became anxious, thinking, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.1.4	“The Buddha has laid down a training rule 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.1.5	that intentional emission of semen is an offense entailing suspension. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.1.6	We had an emission while dreaming, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.1.7	which is not without intention. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.1.8	Could it be that we’ve committed an offense entailing suspension?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.1.9	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.1.10	“It’s true, monks, that a dream is not without intention, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.1.11	but it’s negligible. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.1.12	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.1.13.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.1.13.1	‘Intentional emission of semen, except while dreaming, is an offense entailing suspension.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.2.0	Definitions 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.2.1	Intentional: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.2.2	knowing, perceiving, having intended, having decided, he transgresses. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.2.3	Semen: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.2.4	there are ten kinds of semen: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.2.5	blue, yellow, red, white, the color of buttermilk, the color of water, the color of oil, the color of milk, the color of curd, the color of ghee. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.2.6	Emission: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.2.7	making it move from its base—this is what is meant by “emission”. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.2.8	Except while dreaming: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.2.9	apart from that which occurs while dreaming. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.2.10	An offense entailing suspension: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.2.11	only the Sangha gives probation for that offense, sends back to the beginning, gives the trial period, and rehabilitates—not several monks, not an individual. Therefore it is called “an offense entailing suspension”. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.2.12	This is the name and designation of this class of offense. Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension”.

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:0.3	The chapter on offenses entailing suspension 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:0.4	2. The training rule on physical contact 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.2	At that time Venerable Udāyī was staying in the wilderness. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.3	He had a beautiful dwelling with a room in the middle and corridors on all sides. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.4	The bed and bench were nicely made up, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.5	and the water for drinking and the water for washing had been well placed. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.6	The precincts were well swept. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.7	Many people came to see Udāyī’s dwelling, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.8	among them a certain brahmin and his wife. They approached Udāyī and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.9	“Venerable, we would like to see your dwelling.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.10	“Well then, brahmin, please do.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.11	Udāyī took the key, unlocked the upper bolt, opened the door, and entered the dwelling. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.12	The brahmin entered after him 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.13	and then the brahmin lady. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.14	Opening some windows and closing others, Udāyī walked around the inner room and came up behind the brahmin lady, touching her all over. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.15	Then the brahmin thanked Udāyī and left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.16	And he expressed his delight, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.17	“These Sakyan monastics who live in the wilderness are superb. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.18	Venerable Udāyī is superb!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.19	But the brahmin lady said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.20	“What’s superb about him? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.21	He touched me all over just like you do.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.22	The brahmin then complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.23	“These Sakyan monastics are shameless and immoral liars. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.24	They claim to act with integrity, to be celibate and of good conduct, to be truthful, moral, and good. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.25	But they don’t have the good character of a monastic or a brahmin. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.26	They’ve lost the plot! 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.27	How could the ascetic Udāyī touch my wife all over? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.28	It’s not possible to go to a monastery or a monk’s dwelling with a wife from a respectable family, or with a daughter, a girl, a daughter-in-law, or a female slave from a respectable family. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.29	If you do, the Sakyan monastics might molest them.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.2.1	The monks heard the criticism of that brahmin. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.2.2	The monks of few desires complained and criticized Udāyī, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.2.3	“How could Venerable Udāyī make physical contact with a woman?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.2.4	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.2.5	He then had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.2.6	“Is it true, Udāyī, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.2.7	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.2.8	The Buddha rebuked him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.2.9	“Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.2.10	How could you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.2.11	Haven’t I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.2.12	the stilling of the fevers of sensual pleasure? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.2.13	This will affect people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.2.14	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.2.15.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.2.15.1	‘If a monk, overcome by lust and with a distorted mind, makes physical contact with a woman—holding her hand or hair, or touching any part of her body—he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:0.2	The monks’ rules and their analysis 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:0.3	The chapter on offenses entailing suspension 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:0.4	3. The training rule on indecent speech 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.1.2	At that time Venerable Udāyī was staying in a beautiful dwelling in the wilderness. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.1.3	
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.1.4	On one occasion a number of women came to the monastery to see the dwellings. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.1.5	They approached Udāyī 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.1.6	and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.1.7	“Venerable, we would like to see your dwelling.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.1.8	Then, after showing them his dwelling, he praised and disparaged their private parts; he requested and implored, asked and enquired, described, instructed, and abused their private parts. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.1.9	The shameless and indecent women flirted with Udāyī; they called out to him, laughed with him, and teased him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.1.10	But after leaving, those of them who had a sense of shame complained to the monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.1.11	“Venerables, this isn’t suitable or appropriate. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.1.12	We wouldn’t want to hear such speech from our own husbands, let alone from Venerable Udāyī.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.2.1	The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.2.2	“How can Venerable Udāyī speak indecently to women?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.2.3	They rebuked Udāyī in many ways and told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.2.4	The Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.2.5	“Is it true, Udāyī, that you spoke like this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.2.6	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.2.7	The Buddha rebuked him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.2.8	“It’s not suitable, foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it should not to be done. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.2.9	How could you speak like this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.2.10	Haven’t I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.2.11	the stilling of the fevers of sensual pleasure? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.2.12	This will affect people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.2.13	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.2.14.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:1.2.14.1	‘If a monk, overcome by lust and with a distorted mind, speaks indecent words to a woman, as a young man might to a young woman and referring to sexual intercourse, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:0.4	4. The training rule on satisfying one’s own desires 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.2	At that time Venerable Udāyī was associating with and visiting a number of families in Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.4	One morning Udāyī robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to the house of a beautiful widow, where he sat down on the prepared seat. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.5	She then approached Udāyī, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.6	And Udāyī instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.7	She then said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.8	“Venerable, please tell me what you need. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.9	I can give robes, almsfood, a dwelling, and medicines.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.10	“It’s not hard for us to get those requisites. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.11	Give instead what’s hard for us to get.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.12	“What’s that, Venerable?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.13	“Sexual intercourse.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.14	“Is it wanted now?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.15	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.16	Saying, “Come,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.17	she entered her bedroom, took off her wrap, and lay back on the bed. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.18	Udāyī went up to her and spat out, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.19	“Who would touch this stinking wretch!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.20	and he left. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.21	That woman then complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.22	“These Sakyan monastics are shameless and immoral liars. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.23	They claim to act with integrity, to be celibate and of good conduct, to be truthful, moral, and good. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.24	But they don’t have the good character of a monastic or  brahmin. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.25	They’ve lost the plot! 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.26	How can the ascetic Udāyī ask for sexual intercourse from me, but then spit out, ‘Who would touch this stinking wretch!’ and leave? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.27	What’s bad about me? How am I stinking? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.1.28	How am I inferior to anyone?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.2.1	Other women, too, criticized him 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.2.2	in the same way, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.2.5	The monks heard the criticism of those women, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.2.6	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.2.7	“How could Venerable Udāyī praise the satisfaction of his own desires in the presence of a woman?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.2.8	Those monks rebuked Udāyī in many ways and then told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.2.9	The Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.2.10	“Is it true, Udāyī, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.2.11	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.2.12	The Buddha rebuked him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.2.13	“It’s not suitable, foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.2.14	How can you do such a thing? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.2.15	Haven’t I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.2.16	the stilling of the fevers of sensual pleasure? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.2.17	This will affect people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.2.18	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.2.19.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:1.2.19.1	‘If a monk, overcome by lust and with a distorted mind, encourages a woman to satisfy his own desires, saying, “Sister, she provides the highest service who in this way satisfies one like me, who is virtuous, celibate, and of good character,” and if it is a reference to sexual intercourse, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.1.0.1	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.1.2	Venerable Udāyī was associating with and visiting a number of families in Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.1.3	When Udāyī saw a young man without a wife or a young woman without a husband, he would praise the young woman in the presence of the parents of the young man, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.1.4	“The young woman of such-and such a family is beautiful, intelligent, skilled, and diligent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.1.5	She’s suitable for your son.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.1.6	They would reply, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.1.7	“They don’t know who we are, Venerable. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.1.8	If you could persuade them to give the girl, we would take her for our son.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.1.9	And he praised the young man in the presence of the parents of the young woman, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.1.10	“The young man of such-and-such a family is handsome, intelligent, skilled, and diligent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.1.11	He’s suitable for your daughter.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.1.12	They would reply, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.1.13	“They don’t know who we are, Venerable, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.1.14	and we would be ashamed to speak to them for the sake of the girl. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.1.15	But if you could persuade them to ask us, we would give our girl to the young man.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.1.16	In this way he arranged for the taking of a bride, for the giving of a bride, and for marriage. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.1	At that time there was a former courtesan who had a beautiful daughter. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.2	On one occasion some lay followers of the Ājīvaka religion came from another village and said to that courtesan, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.3	“Lady, please give your girl to our boy.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.4	“I don’t know who you are, Sirs, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.5	and I won’t give my only daughter to be taken to another village.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.6	People asked those Ājīvaka lay followers 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.7	why they had come. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.8	They replied, “We came to ask that courtesan to give her daughter to our son, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.9	but she refused.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.11	“But why did you ask the courtesan? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.12	You should speak to Venerable Udāyī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.13	He’ll persuade her.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.14	They then went to Udāyī and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.15	“Venerable, we’ve asked that courtesan here to give her daughter to our son, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.16	but she refused. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.18	Would you please persuade her to give her daughter?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.19	Udāyī agreed. Soon afterwards he went to that courtesan and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.20	“Why didn’t you give them your daughter?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.21	“I don’t know who they are, Sir, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.22	and I won’t give my only daughter to be taken to another village.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.23	“Please give her to them. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.24	I know them.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.2.25	“If you know them, I’ll give her away.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.1	She then gave her daughter to those Ājīvaka followers, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.2	and they took her away. For a month they treated her like a daughter-in-law, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.3	but then like a slave. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.4	The girl sent a message to her mother, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.5	“Mum, I’m unhappy and miserable. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.6	For a month they treated me like a daughter-in-law, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.7	but then like a slave. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.8	Come, mum, and take me home.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.9	Soon afterwards the courtesan went to those Ājīvakas and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.10	“Please don’t treat my girl like a slave; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.11	treat her properly!” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.12	They replied, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.13	“We deal with the monastic, not with you. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.14	Go away! 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.15	We don’t want to know you.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.16	Being dismissed, she returned to Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.17	A second time the girl sent the same message to her mother. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.22	That courtesan then went to Udāyī and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.23	“Venerable, my girl is unhappy and miserable. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.24	They treated her like a daughter-in-law for a month, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.25	but then like a slave. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.26	Please tell them 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.28	to treat her properly.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.29	Udāyī went to the Ājīvakas and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.30	“Please don’t treat this girl like a slave; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.31	treat her properly.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.32	They replied, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.33	“We deal with the courtesan, not with you. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.34	A monastic shouldn’t get involved. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.35	You should behave like a proper monastic. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.36	So go away! 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.37	We don’t want to know you.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.38	Being dismissed, he returned to Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.39	A third time that girl sent the same message to her mother, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.44	and a second time the courtesan went to Udāyī and told him the same thing. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.50	He replied, “When I first went, they just dismissed me. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.51	Go yourself; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.52	I’m not going.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.4.1	Then that courtesan complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.4.2	“May Venerable Udāyī be miserable and unhappy, just as my girl is miserable and unhappy because of her nasty mother-in-law, father-in-law, and husband.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.4.3	The girl, too, complained and criticized him in the same way, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.4.5	as did other women who were unhappy with their mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, and husbands. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.4.7	But those women who were happy with their in-laws wished him well, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.4.8	“May Venerable Udāyī be happy and well, just as we are happy and well because of our good mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, and husbands.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.5.1	The monks heard that some women were criticizing him whereas others were wishing him well. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.5.2	And the monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.5.3	“How can Venerable Udāyī act as a matchmaker?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.5.4	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.5.5	The Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.5.6	“Is it true, Udāyī, that you do this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.5.7	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.5.8	The Buddha rebuked him … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.5.9	“Foolish man, how can you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.5.10	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.5.11	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.5.12.0	Preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.5.12.1	‘If a monk acts as a matchmaker, conveying a man’s intention to a woman or a woman’s intention to a man, for marriage or for an affair, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.5.13	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.1	Soon afterwards a number of scoundrels who were enjoying themselves in a park sent a messenger to a prostitute, saying, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.2	“Please come, let’s enjoy ourselves in the park.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.3	She replied, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.4	“Sirs, I don’t know who you are. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.5	I’m wealthy. I don’t want to go outside the city.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.7	The messenger returned the message. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.8	A certain man then said to those men, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.9	“Why did you ask the prostitute? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.10	You should speak to Venerable Udāyī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.11	He’ll persuade her.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.12	But a certain Buddhist lay follower said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.13	“No way. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.14	That’s not allowable for the Sakyan monastics. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.15	He won’t do it.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.16	And they made a bet on whether he would. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.17	Those scoundrels then went to Udāyī and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.18	“Venerable, while we were enjoying ourselves in the park, we sent a message to such-and-such a prostitute, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.19	asking her to come, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.20	but she refused. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.23	Would you please persuade her?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.24	Udāyī agreed. He then went to that prostitute and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.25	“Why don’t you go to those men?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.26	She told him why. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.29	“Please go. I know them.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.30	“If you know them, Sir, I’ll go.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.1.31	And those men took her to the park. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.2.1	Then that lay follower complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.2.2	“How could Venerable Udāyī act as a matchmaker for a brief affair?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.2.3	The monks heard it, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.2.4	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.2.5	“How could Venerable Udāyī act as a matchmaker for a brief affair?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.2.6	They rebuked Udāyī in many ways and then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.2.7	“Is it true, Udāyī, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.2.8	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.2.9	The Buddha rebuked him … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.2.10	“Foolish man, how could you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.2.11	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.2.12	And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.2.13.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:2.2.13.1	‘If a monk acts as a matchmaker, conveying a man’s intention to a woman or a woman’s intention to a man, for marriage or for an affair, even if just a brief one, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:3.13	For an affair: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:3.14	“You should be his mistress.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:3.15	Even if just a brief one: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:3.16	“You will have a short relationship.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:3.17	He commits an offense entailing suspension: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:3.18	… Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension”.

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:0.4	6. The training rule on building huts 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.2	At that time the monks of Āḷavī were building huts by means of begging. The huts were intended for themselves, did not have a sponsoring owner, and were inappropriately large. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.3	And since they were never finished, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.4	the monks kept on begging and asking, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.5	“Please give a man, a servant, an ox, a cart, a machete, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, a chisel; give creepers, bamboo, reeds, grass, clay.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.6	People felt oppressed by all the begging and asking, so much so that when they saw a monk they became alarmed and fearful. They ran away, took a different path, turned away, and closed their doors. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.7	They even ran away when they saw cows, thinking they were monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.8	Just then Venerable Mahākassapa, after completing the rainy-season residence at Rājagaha, set out for Āḷavī. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.9	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.10	he stayed at the Aggāḷava Shrine. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.11	One morning Venerable Mahākassapa robed up, took his bowl and robe, and entered Āḷavī for alms. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.12	When people saw him they became fearful and alarmed, and they ran away, took a different path, turned away, and closed their doors. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.13	After finishing his almsround and eating his meal, Venerable Mahākassapa returned and said to the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.14	“There used to be plenty of almsfood in Āḷavī, and it was easy to get by on alms. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.15	But now there’s a shortage, and it’s hard to get by. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.16	Why is that?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.17	The monks told Venerable Mahākassapa what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.2.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha too set out wandering toward Āḷavī after staying at Rājagaha for as long as he liked. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.2.2	When he eventually arrived, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.2.3	he too stayed at the Aggāḷava Shrine. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.2.4	Venerable Mahākassapa then went to see the Buddha, bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.2.5	and told him what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.2.6	The Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks of Āḷavī: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.2.7	“Is it true, monks, that this is happening?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.2.8	
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.2.9	
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.2.10	
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.2.11	
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.2.12	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.2.13	The Buddha rebuked them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.2.14	“Foolish men, how can you act like this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.2.18	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.2.19	After rebuking them, he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.0	Jātaka 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.1	“Once upon a time, monks, two sages who were brothers lived near the river Ganges. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.2	On one occasion the dragon king Maṇikaṇṭha emerged from the Ganges and went up to the younger sage. He encircled him with seven coils and spread his large hood over his head. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.3	Then, because of his fear of that dragon, the younger sage became thin, haggard, and pale, with veins protruding all over his body. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.4	The older sage saw him like this 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.5	and asked him what was the matter. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.7	The younger sage told him. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.9	The elder sage said, ‘So, do you want that dragon stay away?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.10	‘Yes.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.11	‘Well then, did you see anything belonging to that dragon?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.12	‘I saw an ornamental gem on his neck.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.13	‘In that case, ask the dragon for that gem.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.16	Soon the dragon king again emerged from the Ganges and went up to the younger sage. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.17	And the sage said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.18	‘Sir, give me the gem. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.19	I want the gem.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.20	The dragon thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.21	‘The monk is asking for the gem; he wants the gem,’ and he left in a hurry. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.22	Once more the dragon king emerged from the Ganges and approached the younger sage. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.23	The sage saw him coming 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.24	and said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.25	‘Sir, give me the gem. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.26	I want the gem.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.27	When the dragon heard him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.28	he turned around right there. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.29	Yet again the dragon king emerged from the Ganges. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.30	The younger sage saw him emerging 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.31	and said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.32	‘Sir, give me the gem. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.33	I want the gem.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.34	The dragon king then spoke these verses to the sage: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.35	‘My food and drink are abundant and sublime, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.36	And they appear because of this gem. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.37	I won’t give it to you—you ask too much—
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.38	Nor will I return to your hermitage. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.39	Like a youth holding a sword polished on a rock, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.40	You frighten me, asking for this gem. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.41	I won’t give it to you—you ask too much—
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.42	Nor will I return to your hermitage.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.43	And the dragon king Maṇikaṇṭha thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.44	‘The monk is asking for the gem; he wants the gem,’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.45	and he left and never returned. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.46	Because he did not get to see that beautiful dragon, the young sage became even thinner, more haggard and pale, his veins protruding even more. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.47	The older sage saw him like this 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.48	and asked what was the matter. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.50	He replied, ‘It’s because I no longer get to see that beautiful dragon.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.51	The older sage then spoke to him in verse: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.52	‘One shouldn’t beg from those one wishes to be dear to; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.53	One is detested for asking for too much. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.54	When the brahmin asked the dragon for his gem, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.55	It left and was never to be seen again.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.56	One will be disliked even by animals, monks, for begging and asking, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.3.57	let alone by human beings.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.0	Story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.1	“At one time, monks, a certain monk lived in a forest grove on the slopes of the Himalayas. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.2	Not far from that grove was a large, low-lying marsh. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.3	A great flock of birds fed in the marsh during the day and entered the grove to roost at night. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.4	The monk was disturbed by the noise of the flocking birds, and so he came to see me. He bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.5	and I said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.6	‘I hope you’re keeping well, monk, I hope you’re getting by. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.7	I hope you’re not tired from traveling. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.8	And where have you come from?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.9	‘I’m keeping well, Sir, I’m getting by. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.10	I’m not tired from traveling.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.11	He then explained where he had come from, adding, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.12	
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.13	
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.14	‘That’s where I’ve come from, Sir. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.15	I left because I was disturbed by the noise of that flock of birds.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.16	‘Do you want that flock of birds to stay away?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.17	‘Yes, Sir.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.18	‘Well then, go back to that forest grove. In the first part of the night, call out three times and say, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.19	“Listen to me, good birds. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.20	I want a feather from anyone roosting in this forest grove. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.21	Each one of you must give me a feather.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.22	And in the middle 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.23	and last part of the night do the same thing.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.27	The monk returned to that forest grove and did as instructed. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.36	That flock of birds thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.37	‘The monk is asking for a feather; he wants a feather,’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.38	and they left that grove 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.39	and never returned. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.40	One will be disliked even by animals, monks, for begging and asking, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.4.41	let alone by human beings. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.5.1	“The father of Raṭṭhapāla, monks, once spoke to his son with this verse: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.5.2	‘All these people, Raṭṭhāpāla, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.5.3	Who come to me and beg—
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.5.4	I don’t even know them. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.5.5	So why don’t *you* beg from me?’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.5.6	‘The beggar is disliked, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.5.7	And so is one who doesn’t give when asked. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.5.8	That’s why I do not beg from you; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.5.9	Please don’t hate me for this.’ 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.5.10	If Raṭṭhapāla, who came from a good family, could say this to his own father, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.5.11	how much more can one person to another. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.6.1	It’s hard, monks, for householders to acquire and protect their possessions. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.6.2	And still, foolish men, you kept on begging and asking 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.6.3	for all sorts of things. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.6.4	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.6.6.1	‘When a monk, by means of begging, builds a hut without a sponsoring owner and intended for himself, it is to be no more than twelve standard handspans long and seven wide inside. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.6.7	He must have monks approve a site where no harm will be done and which has space on all sides. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.6.8	If a monk, by means of begging, builds a hut on a site where harm will be done and which lacks space on all sides, or he does not have monks approve the site, or he exceeds the right size, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:0.1	Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:0.2	The monks’ rules and their analysis 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:0.3	The chapter on offenses entailing suspension 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:0.4	7. The training rule on building dwellings 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Monastery, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.2	a householder who was a supporter of Venerable Channa said to him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.3	“I’ll have a dwelling built for you, Venerable, if you would find a site for it.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.4	While Venerable Channa was clearing a site for that dwelling, he felled a tree that served as a shrine and was revered by village, town, district, and kingdom. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.5	People complained and criticized him, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.6	“How can the Sakyan monastics fell a tree that serves as a shrine and is revered by village, town, district, and kingdom? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.7	They are hurting one-sensed life.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.8	The monks heard the criticism of those people, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.9	and the monks of few desires complained and criticized 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.10	Venerable Channa in the same way. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.11	After rebuking Venerable Channa in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Channa: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.12	“Is it true, Channa, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.13	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.14	The Buddha rebuked him … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.15	“Foolish man, how could you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.16	People perceive trees as conscious. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.17	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.18	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.19.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.19.1	‘When a monk builds a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for himself, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.20	he must have monks approve a site where no harm will be done and which has space on all sides. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.21	If a monk builds a large dwelling on a site where harm will be done and which lacks space on all sides, or he does not have monks approve the site, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:2.0	Definitions 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:2.1	A large dwelling: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:2.2	one with a sponsoring owner is what is meant.

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:2.65	this is called “where harm will be done”. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:2.66	Which lacks space on all sides: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:2.67	it is not possible to go around it with a yoked cart, or to go all the way around it with a ladder—

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:2.83	if the site has not been approved through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements, and he then builds a dwelling or has one built, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:2.84	When one piece is left to complete the dwelling, he commits a serious offense. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:2.85	When the last piece is finished, he commits an offense entailing suspension. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:2.86	He commits an offense entailing suspension:

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.1.2	Venerable Dabba the Mallian realized perfection at the age of seven. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.1.3	He had achieved all there is to achieve by a disciple 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.1.4	and had nothing further to do. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.1.5	While he was in seclusion he reflected on this, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.1.9	and he thought, “How can I be of service to the Sangha? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.1.11	Why don’t I assign the dwellings and designate the meals?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.2.1	In the evening Dabba came out of seclusion and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.2.2	and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.2.3	“Venerable Sir, while I was in seclusion I reflected that I’ve achieved all there is to achieve by a disciple, and I was wondering how I could be of service to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.2.4	I thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.2.5	ʻWhy don’t I assign the dwellings and designate the meals?ʼ” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.2.7	“Good, good, Dabba, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.2.8	please do so.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.2.9	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.3.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.3.2	“Monks, the Sangha should appoint Dabba the Mallian as the assigner of dwellings and the designator of meals. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.3.3	And he should be appointed like this. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.3.4	First Dabba should be asked. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.3.5	A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.3.6	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.3.7	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should appoint Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.3.8	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.3.9	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.3.10	The Sangha appoints Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.3.11	Any monk who approves of appointing Venerable Dabba as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals should remain silent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.3.12	Any monk who does not approve should speak up. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.3.13	The Sangha has appointed Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.3.14	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.3.15	I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.1	Dabba assigned dwellings to the monks according to their character. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.2	He assigned dwellings in the same place to those monks who were experts on the discourses, thinking, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.3	“They’ll recite the discourses together.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.4	And he did likewise for the experts on the Monastic Law, thinking, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.5	“They’ll deliberate on the Monastic Law;” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.6	for the expounders of the Teaching, thinking, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.7	“They’ll discuss the Teaching;” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.8	for the meditators, thinking, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.9	“They won’t disturb each other;” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.10	and for the gossips and the body-builders, thinking, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.11	“In this way even these venerables will be happy.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.12	When monks arrived at night, he entered the fire element and assigned dwellings with the help of that light. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.13	Monks even arrived late on purpose, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.14	hoping to see the marvel of Dabba’s supernormal powers. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.15	They would approach Dabba and say, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.16	“Venerable Dabba, please assign us a dwelling.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.18	“Where would you like to stay?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.19	They would intentionally suggest somewhere far away: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.20	“On the Vulture Peak,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.21	“At Robbers’ Cliff,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.22	“On Black Rock on the slope of Mount Isigili,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.23	“In the Sattapaṇṇi Cave on the slope of Mount Vebhāra,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.24	“In Cool Grove on the hill at the Snake’s Pool,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.25	“At Gotamaka Gorge,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.26	“At Tinduka Gorge,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.27	“At Tapoda Gorge,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.28	“In Tapoda Park,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.29	“In Jīvaka’s Mango Grove,” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.30	“In the deer park at Maddakucchi.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.31	Dabba then entered the fire element, and with his finger glowing, he walked in front of those monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.32	They followed behind him with the help of that light. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.33	And he would assign them dwellings: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.34	“This is the bed, this the bench, this the mattress, this the pillow, this the place for defecating, this the place for urinating, this the water for drinking, this the water for washing, this the walking stick; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.35	these are the Sangha’s agreements concerning the right time to enter and the right time to leave.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.4.36	Dabba then returned to the Bamboo Grove. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.5.1	At that time the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka were only newly ordained. They had little merit, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.5.2	getting inferior dwellings and meals. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.5.3	The people of Rājagaha were keen to give specially prepared almsfood to the senior monks—ghee, oil, and special curries—
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.5.4	but to the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka they gave ordinary food of porridge and broken rice. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.5.5	After the meal, when they had returned from almsround, they asked the senior monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.5.6	“What did you get at the dining hall?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.5.7	Some said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.5.8	“We got ghee, oil, and special curries.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.5.9	But the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.5.10	“We didn’t get anything except ordinary food of porridge and broken rice.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.6.1	At that time there was a householder who gave a regular meal of fine food to four monks. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.6.2	He made his offering in the dining hall together with his wives and children. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.6.3	Some of them offered rice, some bean curry, some oil, and some special curries. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.6.4	On one occasion the meal to be given by this householder on the following day had been designated to the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.6.5	Just then that householder went to the monastery on some business. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.6.6	He approached Dabba, bowed, and sat down. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.6.7	And Dabba instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.6.8	After the talk, he asked Dabba, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.6.9	“Sir, who has been designated to receive tomorrow’s meal in our house?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.6.10	“Mettiya and Bhūmajaka.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.6.11	He was disappointed, and thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.6.12	“Why should bad monks eat in our house?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.6.13	After returning to his house, he told a female slave, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.6.14	“For those who are coming for tomorrow’s meal, prepare seats at the gateway and serve them broken rice and porridge.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.6.15	“Yes, sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.1	The monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said to each other, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.2	“Yesterday we were designated a meal from that householder who offers fine food. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.3	Tomorrow he’ll serve us together with his wives and children. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.4	Some of them will offer us rice, some bean curry, some oil, and some special curries.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.5	And because they were excited, they did not sleep properly that night. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.6	The following morning they robed up, took their bowls and robes, and went to the house of that householder. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.7	When the female slave saw them coming, she prepared seats at the gateway and said to them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.8	“Please sit, Venerables.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.9	They thought, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.10	“The meal can’t be ready, since we’re given seats at the gateway.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.11	She then brought them broken rice and porridge, and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.12	“Eat, Sirs.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.13	“But, Sister, we’ve come for the regular meal.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.14	“I know. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.15	But yesterday I was told by the head of the household to serve you like this. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.16	Please eat.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.17	They said to each other, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.18	“Yesterday this householder came to the monastery and spoke with Dabba. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.19	Dabba must be responsible for this split between the householder and us.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.20	And because they were dejected, they did not eat as much as they had intended. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.21	After the meal they returned to the monastery, put their bowls and robes away, and squatted on their heels outside the monastery gateway, using their upper robe as a back-and-knee strap. They were silent and humiliated, their shoulders drooping and their heads down, glum and speechless. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.1	Just then the nun Mettiyā came to them and said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.2	“My respectful greetings to you, Venerables.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.3	But they did not respond. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.4	A second time 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.5	and a third time she said 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.6	the same thing, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.7	but they still did not respond. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.8	“Have I done something wrong? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.9	Why don’t you respond?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.10	“It’s because we’ve been badly treated by Dabba the Mallian, and you’re not taking an interest.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.11	“But what can I do?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.12	“If you like, you could make the Buddha expel Dabba.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.13	“And how can I do that?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.14	“Go to the Buddha and say, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.15	‘Venerable Sir, this isn’t proper or appropriate. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.16	There’s fear, distress, and oppression in this district, where none of these should exist. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.17	From where one would expect security, there’s insecurity. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.18	It’s as if water is burning. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.19	Venerable Dabba the Mallian has raped me.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.20	Saying, “Alright, Venerables,” she went to the Buddha, bowed, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.8.21	and then repeated what she had been told to say. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.1	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Dabba: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.2	“Dabba, do you remember doing as the nun Mettiyā says?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.3	“Venerable Sir, you know what I’m like.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.4	A second and 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.5	a third time the Buddha asked 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.6	the same question 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.7	and got the same response. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.8	He then said, “Dabba, the Dabbas don’t give such evasive answers. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.9	If it was done by you, say so; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.10	if it wasn’t, then say that.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.11	“Since I was born, Sir, I don’t recall having sexual intercourse even in a dream, let alone when awake.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.12	The Buddha addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.13	“Well then, monks, expel the nun Mettiyā, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.14	and call these monks to account.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.15	The Buddha then got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.16	When the monks had expelled the nun Mettiyā, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.17	the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said to them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.18	“Don’t expel the nun Mettiyā; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.19	she’s done nothing wrong. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.20	She was urged on by us. We were angry and displeased, and trying to get Dabba to leave the monastic life.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.21	“But did you groundlessly charge Venerable Dabba with an offense entailing expulsion?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.22	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.23	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.24	“How could the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka groundlessly charge Venerable Dabba with an offense entailing expulsion?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.25	They rebuked those monks in many ways and then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned those monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.26	“Is it true, monks, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.27	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.28	The Buddha rebuked them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.29	“Foolish men, how could you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.30	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.31	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.32.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.32.1	‘If a monk who is angry and displeased groundlessly charges a monk with an offense entailing expulsion, aiming to make him leave the monastic life, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.9.33	and then after some time, whether he is questioned or not, it is clear that the legal issue is groundless, and he admits to his ill will, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:2.18	to make him leave the monkhood, leave the state of a monastic, leave his morality, leave the virtue of monasticism. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:2.19	And then after some time: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:2.20	the moment, the instant, the second after he has laid the charge. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:2.21	He is questioned: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:2.22	he is questioned about the grounds of his charge. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:2.23	Not:

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:2.25	The legal issue: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:2.26	there are four kinds of legal issues: legal issues arising from disputes, legal issues arising from accusations, legal issues arising from offenses, legal issues arising from business. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:2.27	And he admits to his ill will: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:2.28	“What I said was empty,” “What I said was false,” “What I said was unreal,” “I said it without knowing.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:2.29	He commits an offense entailing suspension: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:2.30	… Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension”.

pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:0.2	The monks’ rules and their analysis 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:0.3	The chapter on offenses entailing suspension 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:0.4	9. The second training rule on anger 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.2	the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka were descending from the Vulture Peak when they saw two goats copulating. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.3	They said to each other, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.4	“Let’s give the he-goat the name Dabba the Mallian 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.5	and the she-goat the name Mettiya the nun. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.6	We can then say, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.7	‘Previously we spoke of what we had heard, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.8	but now we’ve seen Dabba copulating with the nun Mettiya.’” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.9	They then gave them those names 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.11	and told the monks, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.12	“Previously we spoke of what we had heard, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.13	but now we’ve seen Dabba copulating with the nun Mettiya.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.14	The monks replied, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.15	“Don’t say such things. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.16	Venerable Dabba wouldn’t do that.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.17	The monks told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.18	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Dabba: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.19	“Dabba, do you remember doing as these monks say?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.20	“Venerable Sir, you know what I’m like.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.21	A second 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.22	and a third time the Buddha asked 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.23	the same question 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.24	and got the same response. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.25	He then said, “Dabba, the Dabbas don’t give such evasive answers. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.26	If it was done by you, say so; 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.27	if it wasn’t done by you, then say that.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.28	“Since I was born, Sir, I don’t recall having sexual intercourse even in a dream, let alone when awake.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.29	“Well then, monks, call those monks to account.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.1.30	And the Buddha got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.2.1	The monks then questioned Mettiya and Bhūmajaka, who told them what had happened. 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.2.2	The monks said, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.2.3	“So did you charge Venerable Dabba with an offense entailing expulsion, using an unrelated legal issue as a pretext?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.2.4	“Yes.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.2.5	The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.2.6	“How could Mettiya and Bhūmajaka charge Venerable Dabba with an offense entailing expulsion, using an unrelated legal issue as a pretext?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.2.7	They rebuked those monks in many ways and then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned those monks: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.2.8	“Is it true, monks, that you did this?” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.2.9	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.2.10	The Buddha rebuked them … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.2.11	“Foolish men, how could you do this? 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.2.12	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.2.13	And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.2.14.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.2.14.1	‘If a monk who is angry and displeased, uses an unrelated legal issue as a pretext to charge a monk with an offense entailing expulsion, aiming to make him leave the monastic life, 
pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9:1.2.15	and then after some time, whether he is questioned or not, it is clear that the legal issue is unrelated and was used as a pretext, and he admits to his ill will, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”
