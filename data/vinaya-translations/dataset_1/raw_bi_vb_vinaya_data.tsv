pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:1.2	At that time the nun Thullanandā was a learned reciter, and she was confident and skilled at giving teachings. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:1.3	Many people visited her. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:1.4	Just then the precincts of Thullanandā’s dwelling were falling apart. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:1.5	People asked her why, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:1.7	and she replied, “I have neither a donor, nor a worker.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:1.8	Then, after collecting voluntary contributions for the precincts of Thullanandā’s dwelling, the people gave the collected requisites to Thullanandā. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:1.9	But even though she had asked for them, Thullanandā exchanged those requisites for tonics, which she then used. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:1.10	When the people found out about this, they complained and criticized her, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:1.11	“When personal requisites are designated for a specific purpose and were asked for, how could the nun Thullanandā exchange them for something else?” … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:1.12	“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā did this?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:1.13	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:1.14	The Buddha criticized her … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:1.15	“When personal requisites are designated for a specific purpose and were asked for, how could the nun Thullanandā exchange them for something else? 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:1.16	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:1.17	And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:1.18.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:1.18.1	‘When a personal requisite is designated for a specific purpose and was asked for, if a nun exchanges it for something else, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”

pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:2.11	Exchanges it for something else: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:2.12	if, apart from the purpose for which it was given, she exchanges it for something else, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:2.13	When she gets it, it becomes subject to relinquishment. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np10:2.14	It is to be relinquished to the Sangha of nuns, a group, or an individual nun.

pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:0.6	Venerables, these thirty rules on relinquishment and confession come up for recitation. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:1.2	At that time the nuns from the group of six had collected a large number of almsbowls. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:1.3	When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized those nuns, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:1.4	“How can the nuns collect a large number of bowls? Will they start up as bowl merchants or set up a bowl shop?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:1.5	The nuns heard the complaints of those people, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:1.6	and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized those nuns, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:1.7	“How can the nuns from the group of six collect bowls?” … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:1.8	“Is it true, monks, that the nuns from the group of six do this?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:1.9	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:1.10	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:1.11	“How can the nuns from the group of six collect bowls? 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:1.12	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:1.13	And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:1.14.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:1.14.1	‘If a nun collects almsbowls, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.0	Definitions 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.1	A: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.2	whoever … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.3	Nun: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.4	… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.5	An almsbowl: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.6	there are two kinds of bowls: the iron bowl and the ceramic bowl. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.7	And there are three grades of bowl: the large bowl, the medium bowl, and the small bowl. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.8	The large bowl: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.9	it takes half an _āḷhaka_ measure of boiled rice, a fourth part of fresh food, and a suitable amount of curry. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.10	The medium bowl: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.11	it takes a _nāḷika_ measure of boiled rice, a fourth part of fresh food, and a suitable amount of curry. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.12	The small bowl: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.13	it takes a _pattha_ measure of boiled rice, a fourth part of fresh food, and a suitable amount of curry. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.14	Anything larger than this is not a bowl, nor anything smaller. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.15	Collects: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.16	almsbowls that have neither been determined nor transferred to another. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.17	Entailing relinquishment: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.18	entailing relinquishment at dawn. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.19	The bowl is to be relinquished to the Sangha, a group, or an individual nun. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.20	“And, monks, it’s to be relinquished like this. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.21	After approaching the Sangha, that nun should put her upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior nuns. She should then squat on her heels, raise her joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.22	‘Venerables, this almsbowl, which I have kept for more than one day, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.23	After relinquishing it, she is to confess the offense. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.24	The confession should be received by a competent and capable nun. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.25	The relinquished bowl is then to be given back: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.26	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.27	This almsbowl, which was to be relinquished by the nun so-and-so, has been relinquished to the Sangha. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.28	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give this bowl back to nun so-and-so.’ 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.29	After approaching several nuns, that nun should put her upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior nuns. She should then squat on her heels, raise her joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.30	‘Venerables, this almsbowl, which I have kept for more than one day, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the venerables.’ 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.31	After relinquishing it, she is to confess the offense. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.32	The confession should be received by a competent and capable nun. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.33	The relinquished bowl is then to be given back: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.34	‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.35	This almsbowl, which was to be relinquished by the nun so-and-so, has been relinquished to you. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.36	If it seems appropriate to you, you should give this bowl back to nun so-and-so.’ 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.37	After approaching a single nun, that nun should put her upper robe over one shoulder, squat on her heels, raise her joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.38	‘This almsbowl, which I have kept for more than one day, is to be relinquished. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.39	I relinquish it to you.’ 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.40	After relinquishing it, she is to confess the offense. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.41	The confession should be received by that nun. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.42	The relinquished bowl is then to be given back: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.43	‘I give this almsbowl back to you.’” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.2.0	Permutations 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.2.1	If it is more than one day and she perceives it as more, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.2.2	If it is more than one day, but she is unsure of it, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.2.3	If it is more than one day, but she perceives it as less, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.2.4	If it has not been determined, but she perceives that it has, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.2.5	If it has not been transferred, but she perceives that it has, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.2.6	If it has not been given away, but she perceives that it has, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.2.7	If it is not lost, but she perceives that it is … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.2.8	If it has not been ruined, but she perceives that it has … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.2.9	If it is not broken, but she perceives that it is … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.2.10	If it has not been stolen, but she perceives that it has, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.2.11	If she uses an almsbowl that should be relinquished without first relinquishing it, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.2.12	If it is less than one day, but she perceives it as more, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.2.13	If it is less than one day, but she is unsure of it, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.2.14	If it is less than one day and she perceives it as less, there is no offense. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.3.0	Non-offenses 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.3.1	There is no offense: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.3.2	if, before dawn, it is determined, transferred to another, given away, lost, ruined, broken, stolen, or taken on trust; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.3.3	if she is insane; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.3.4	if she is the first offender. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:3.1	Soon afterwards the nuns from the group six did not give back a relinquished bowl. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:3.2	They told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:3.3	“Monks, a relinquished almsbowl is to be given back. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:3.4	If a nun doesn’t give it back, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:3.5	The first training rule is finished.

pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.2	At that time, after completing the rainy-season residence in a village monastery, a number of nuns were traveling to Sāvatthī. They were perfect in conduct and deportment, but poorly dressed in shabby robes. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.3	Some lay followers who saw them thought, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.4	“These nuns are perfect in conduct and deportment, but poorly dressed in shabby robes; they must’ve been robbed,” and they gave out-of-season robe-cloth to the Sangha of nuns. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.5	Because they had done the robe-making procedure, the nun Thullanandā 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.6	determined it as in-season robe-cloth, and then shared it out. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.7	The lay followers asked those nuns whether 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.8	they had obtained any robe-cloth. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.9	They replied that they hadn’t 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.10	and told them what had happened. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.12	Those lay followers then complained and criticized her, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.13	“How could Venerable Thullanandā determine out-of-season robe-cloth as ‘in-season’, and then share it out?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.14	The nuns heard the complaints of those lay followers, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.15	and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,

pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:2.1.5	Out-of-season robe-cloth: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:2.1.6	if the robe-making procedure has not been done, robe-cloth that is given during the eleven months. If the robe-making procedure has been done, robe-cloth that is given during the seven months. Also, if it is given in the robe season, but the cloth is designated, it is called “out-of-season robe-cloth”. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:2.1.7	If she shares it out, after determining out-of-season robe-cloth as “in-season”, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:2.1.8	When she gets it, it becomes subject to relinquishment. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:2.1.9	The robe-cloth is to be relinquished to the Sangha of nuns, a group, or an individual nun.

pli-tv-bi-vb-pc13:1.2	a male relative of a nun who was a pupil of Bhaddā Kāpilānī went from his own village to Sāvatthī on some business. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc13:1.3	Then, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc13:1.4	knowing that the Buddha had prohibited standing or talking alone with a man in a concealed place, she instead stood and talked alone with that man out in the open. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc13:1.5	The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc13:1.6	“How could a nun do such a thing?” …

pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.2	At that time a lay follower had invited the Sangha of nuns to ask for garlic: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.3	“If any of the nuns need garlic, I’ll supply it.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.4	And he had told his field-keeper, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.5	“If the nuns come, give two or three bulbs to each nun.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.6	On that occasion they were holding a celebration in Sāvatthī, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.7	and the garlic was used up as soon as it arrived there. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.8	Just then the nuns went to that lay follower and said, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.9	“We need garlic.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.10	“Venerables, there isn’t any. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.11	As soon as the garlic arrives, it’s used up. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.12	Please go to the field.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.13	The nun Thullanandā went to the field, and not having any sense of moderation she took a large amount of garlic. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.14	The field-keeper complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.15	“How can the nuns not have any sense of moderation and take a large amount of garlic?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.16	The nuns heard the complaints of that field-keeper,

pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.23	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.24	and after giving a teaching he addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.25.0	Jataka 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.25.1	“Once upon a time, monks, Thullanandā was the wife of a brahmin. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.26	They had three daughters, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.27	Nandā, Nandavatī, and Sundarīnandā. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.28	When that brahmin eventually died, he was reborn as a goose, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.29	whose feathers were all made of gold. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.30	And he gave his former family members one feather at the time. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.31	Thullanandā considered this. She then grabbed hold of that king of geese and plucked him. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.32	But when his feathers regrew they were white. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.33	At that time too, monks, Thullanandā lost her gold because she was too greedy. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.34	Now she will lose her garlic.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.35	“One should be content with what one gets, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.36	Because excessive greed is bad. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.37	After grabbing hold of the king of geese, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.38	The gold came to an end.”

pli-tv-bi-vb-pc21:1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc21:1.2	a number of nuns were bathing naked at a ford in the river Aciravatī together with prostitutes. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc21:1.3	The prostitutes teased the nuns, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc21:1.4	“Venerables, why practice the spiritual life when you’re still young? Why not enjoy worldly pleasures? 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc21:1.5	You can practice the spiritual life when you’re old. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc21:1.6	In this way you’ll get the benefit of both.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc21:1.7	The nuns felt humiliated. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc21:1.8	They then went to the nuns’ dwelling place and told the nuns what had happened. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc21:1.9	The nuns told the monks, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc21:1.10	who in turn told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc21:1.11	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc21:1.12	“Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the nuns for the following ten reasons:

pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51:1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51:1.2	a number of monks dressed only in a sarong were making robes in a certain village monastery. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51:1.3	Nuns entered that monastery without asking permission and approached those monks. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51:1.4	The monks complained and criticized them,

pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51:1.12.1	‘If a nun enters a monastery without asking permission, she commits an offense entailing confession.’” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51:1.13	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the nuns. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51:2.1	Soon afterwards those monks left that monastery. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51:2.2	But even though the nuns knew that the monks had left, they did not go there. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51:2.3	Soon the monks returned. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51:2.4	When the nuns knew that this was the case, they asked permission and then entered that monastery. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51:2.5	They approached the monks and bowed down to them. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51:2.6	The monks then said to them, “Sisters, why didn’t you sweep the monastery, or put out water for drinking or water for washing?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51:2.7	“The Buddha has laid down a training rule that we may not enter a monastery without asking permission. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51:2.8	That’s why we didn’t do it.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51:2.9	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51:2.10	“Monks, when a monk is available, a nun should enter a monastery only after asking permission. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51:2.11	And so, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:

pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51:3.5	Could it be that we have committed an offense entailing confession?”

pli-tv-bi-vb-pc52:1.4	They took her to that charnel ground, cremated her near Venerable Kappita’s dwelling, and made a stupa. They then went there to cry. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc52:1.5	Venerable Kappita was disturbed by the noise, and so he demolished the stupa and scattered the rubble. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc52:1.6	The nuns from the group of six thought, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc52:1.7	“Kappita has demolished our Venerable’s stupa; let’s kill him,” and they laid a plan. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc52:1.8	A certain nun told Venerable Upāli what was happening, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc52:1.9	and he in turn told Venerable Kappita.

pli-tv-bi-vb-pc5:1.1.3	“Venerable Sir, women smell.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc5:1.1.5	“Well then, the nuns should clean themselves with water.” And the Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc5:1.1.6	after which she bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc5:1.1.7	Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc5:1.1.8	“Monks, I allow the nuns to clean themselves with water.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc5:1.2.1	Being aware that the Buddha had allowed cleaning with water, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc5:1.2.2	a nun did it too deeply, causing a sore in her vagina.

pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.2	At that time the nuns were giving the full admission to married girls who were more than twelve years old and who had trained in the six rules for two years, but who had not been approved by the Sangha. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.3	The nuns said, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.4	“Come, trainee nuns, find out about this,” “Give this,” “Bring this,” “There’s need for this,” or “Make this allowable.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.5	But they replied, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.6	“Venerables, we’re not trainee nuns. We’re nuns.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.7	The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.8	“How can nuns give the full admission to married girls who are more than twelve years old and who have trained for two years in the six rules, but who haven’t been approved by the Sangha?” … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.9	“Is it true, monks, that nuns do this?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.10	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.11	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.12	“How can nuns do this? 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.13	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …” … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.14	and after criticizing them … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.15	he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.16	“Monks, approval should be given for the full admission of a married girl who is more than twelve years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.17	And it should be given like this. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.18	After approaching the Sangha of nuns, that married girl who is more than twelve years old should put her upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the nuns. She should then squat on her heels, raise her joined palms, and say, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.19	‘Venerables, I, the married girl so-and-so, who is more than twelve years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, ask the Sangha for approval to be fully admitted.’ 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.20	And she should ask a second 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.21	and a third time. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.22	A competent and capable nun should then inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.23	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.24	This married girl so-and-so, who is more than twelve years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, is asking the Sangha for approval to be fully admitted. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.25	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give approval for the married girl so-and-so, who is more than twelve years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, to be fully admitted. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.26	This is the motion.

pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.28	This married girl so-and-so, who is more than twelve years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, is asking the Sangha for approval to be fully admitted. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.29	The Sangha gives approval for the married girl so-and-so, who is more than twelve years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, to be fully admitted. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.30	Any nun who approves of giving approval for the married girl so-and-so, who is more than twelve years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, to be fully admitted should remain silent. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.31	Any nun who does not approve should speak up.

pli-tv-bi-vb-pc67:1.34	Then, after criticizing those nuns in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support …

pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.2	the nuns from the group of six were eating oil that they had asked for. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.3	… were eating honey that they had asked for. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.4	… were eating syrup that they had asked for. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.5	… were eating fish that they had asked for. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.6	… were eating meat that they had asked for. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.7	… were drinking milk that they had asked for. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.8	… were eating curd that they had asked for. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.9	People complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.10	“How can nuns eat curd that they have asked for? 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.11	Who doesn’t like nice food? Who doesn’t prefer tasty food?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.12	The nuns heard the complaints of those people. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.13	The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.14	“How can the nuns from the group of six eat curd that they have asked for?” … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.15	“Is it true, monks, that those nuns do this?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.16	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.17	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.18	“How can the nuns from the group of six do this? 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.19	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.20	And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.21.0	First preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.21.1	‘If a nun asks for curd and then eats it, she must acknowledge it: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.22	“I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.1.23	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the nuns. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.2.1	Soon afterwards a number of nuns were sick. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.2.2	The nuns who were looking after them asked, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.2.3	“I hope you’re bearing up? I hope you’re getting better?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.2.4	“Previously we ate curd that we had asked for, and then we were comfortable. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.2.5	But now that the Buddha has prohibited this, we don’t ask because we’re afraid of wrongdoing. And because of that we’re not comfortable.” … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.2.6	They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.2.7	“Monks, I allow a sick nun to eat curd that she has asked for. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.2.8	And so, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.2.9.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd2:1.2.9.1	‘If a nun who is not sick asks for (oil …

pli-tv-bi-vb-pd8:2.1.23	If she is not sick and she asks for herself, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pd8:2.1.24	When she receives it with the intention of eating it, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.

pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.0.1	Origin story 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.0.2	Homage to the Buddha, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.2	Migāra’s grandson Sāḷha wanted to build a dwelling for the Sangha of nuns. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.3	He went to the nuns and said, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.4	“Venerables, I wish to build a dwelling for the Sangha of nuns. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.5	Please give me the nun in charge of building work.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.6	At that time four sisters had gone forth as nuns: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.7	Nandā, Nandavatī, Sundarīnandā, and Thullanandā. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.8	Of these, the nun Sundarīnandā had gone forth when she was young, and she was beautiful, intelligent, skilled, and diligent, and she possessed good judgment in regard to doing and arranging things well. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.9	After appointing Sundarīnandā to be in charge of building work, the Sangha made her work with Sāḷha. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.10	As a consequence of this, Sundarīnandā would often go to Sāḷha’s house to ask for tools, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.11	whether an adz, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, or a chisel. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.12	And Sāḷha would often go to the nuns’ dwelling place to find out about the progress of the building work. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.13	And because they saw each other frequently, they fell in love. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.14	But because Sāḷha could not find any opportunity to be intimate with Sundarīnandā, he invited the Sangha of nuns for a meal. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.15	When preparing the seats in the dining hall, he counted the number of nuns senior to Venerable Sundarīnandā and placed their seats to one side, and he counted the number of nuns junior to her and placed their seat on the other side. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.16	He then placed Sundarīnandā’s seat in a concealed spot in a corner. In this way the senior nuns would think she was seated close to the junior ones and the junior nuns would think she was seated close to the senior ones. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.17	Soon afterwards he informed the Sangha that the meal was ready. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.18	Sundarīnandā thought, “Sāḷha hasn’t prepared a meal for the Sangha as a service, but because he wants to be intimate with me. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.19	If I go, I will get into trouble.” She then told a nun who was her pupil, “Go and bring back almsfood for me. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.20	If anyone asks about me, tell them I’m sick.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.21	“Yes, Venerable,” she replied. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.22	Soon afterwards Sāḷha was standing outside the gateway of his house repeatedly inquiring after Sundarīnandā: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.23	“Venerables, where’s Venerable Sundarīnandā?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.24	The nun who was Sundarīnandā’s pupil told him: “She’s sick. I’m bringing her almsfood.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.25	Sāḷha thought, “I invited the Sangha of nuns because of Sundarīnandā,” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.26	and after telling the people there to serve the meal to the Sangha of nuns, he left for the nuns’ dwelling place. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.27	Just then Sundarīnandā was standing outside the monastery gateway longing for Sāḷha. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.28	When she saw him coming, she entered the dwelling, put on her upper robe so that it covered her head, and lay down on her bed. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.29	Sāḷha approached her and said, “Venerable, what’s wrong with you? Why are you lying down?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.30	“That’s what happens when you desire someone who doesn’t desire you in return.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.31	“What do you mean I don’t desire you? 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.32	I just couldn’t find an opportunity to be intimate with you.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.33	And both having lust, he made physical contact with Sundarīnandā. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.34	Just then a nun who was weak from old age and had problems with her feet was lying down not far from Sundarīnandā. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.35	She saw how Sāḷha made physical contact with Sundarīnandā while both of them had lust. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.36	She complained and criticized her, “How could Venerable Sundarīnandā consent to a man making physical contact with her, when they both had lust?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.37	That nun then told the nuns what had happened. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.38	The nuns of few desires, who had a sense of conscience, and who were contented, afraid of wrongdoing, and fond of the training, complained and criticized her, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.39	“How could Venerable Sundarīnandā consent to a man making physical contact with her, when they both had lust?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.40	Those nuns then told the monks. And the monks of few desires, who had a sense of conscience, and who were contented, afraid of wrongdoing, and fond of the training, criticized her in the same way. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.41	After criticizing the nun Sundarīnandā in many ways, they told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.42	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.43	“Is it true, monks, that the nun Sundarīnandā acted like this?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.44	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.45	The Buddha criticized her, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.46	“It’s not suitable, monks, it’s not proper for the nun Sundarīnandā, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.47	How could Sundarīnandā consent to a man making physical contact with her, when they both had lust? 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.48	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.49	but will hinder it and cause some to change their minds.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.50	And the Buddha spoke in many ways in dispraise of being difficult to support and maintain, in dispraise of great desires, discontent, socializing, and laziness; but he spoke in many ways in praise of being easy to support and maintain, of fewness of wishes, contentment, self-elimination, ascetic practices, serenity, reduction in things, and of being energetic. After giving a teaching on what is right and proper, he addressed the monks: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.51	“Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.52	for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad nuns, for the ease of good nuns, for the restraint of corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.53	And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.54.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.54.1	‘If a lustful nun consents to a lustful man making physical contact with her, to touching her, to taking hold of her, to contacting her, or to squeezing her, anywhere below the collar bone but above the knees, she too is expelled and excluded from the community. The training rule on above the knees.’”

pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:2.1.38	this is said with reference to the preceding offenses entailing expulsion. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:2.1.39	Is expelled: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:2.1.40	just as a man with his head cut off is unable to continue living by reconnecting it to the body, so is a lustful nun who consents to a lustful man making physical contact with her, to touching her, to taking hold of her, to contacting her, or to squeezing her, anywhere below the collar bone but above the knees, not a monastic, not a daughter of the Sakyan. Therefore it is said “she is expelled”. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:2.1.41	Excluded from the community: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:2.1.42	Community: joint legal procedures, a joint recitation, the same training—this is called “community”.

pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:0.4	6. The training rule on those who conceal offenses 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.2	At that time the nun Sundarīnandā was pregnant by Migāra’s grandson Sāḷha. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.3	When the fetus got large, she concealed her condition. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.4	And when the fetus was fully grown, she disrobed and gave birth. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.5	The nuns said to the nun Thullanandā, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.6	“Venerable, Sundarīnandā gave birth shortly after disrobing.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.7	“Could it be that she was pregnant while she was still a nun?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.8	“Yes, Venerables.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.9	“But, Venerable, when you knew that a nun had committed an offense entailing expulsion, why didn’t you either confront her yourself or tell a group of nuns?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.10	“Her disrepute is my disrepute, her infamy is my infamy, her notoriety is my notoriety, her loss is my loss. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.11	Why would I tell others of my own disrepute, infamy, notoriety, and loss?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.12	The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.13	“How could Venerable Thullanandā, knowing that a nun had committed an offense entailing expulsion, neither confront her herself nor tell a group of nuns?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.14	Then those nuns told the monks what had happened, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.15	and the monks in turn told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.16	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.17	“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā acted like this?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.18	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.19	The Buddha criticized her … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.20	“How could the nun Thullanandā, knowing that a nun had committed an offense entailing expulsion, neither confront her herself nor tell a group of nuns? 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.21	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.22	And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.23.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.23.1	‘If a nun knows that a nun has committed an offense entailing expulsion, but she neither confronts her herself nor tells a group of nuns, and afterward—whether that nun remains or has died or has been expelled or has converted—she says, “Venerables, although I previously knew that this nun was like this, I thought, ‘I will neither confront her myself nor tell a group of nuns,’” she too is expelled and excluded from the community. The training rule on those who conceal offenses.’”

pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.3	Nun: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.4	… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.5	Knows: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.6	she knows by herself or others have told her or she has told her. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.7	Has committed an offense entailing expulsion: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.8	she has committed any one of the eight offenses entailing expulsion. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.9	She neither confronts her herself: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.10	she does not herself accuse her. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.11	Nor tells a group of nuns: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.12	she does not tell other nuns. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.13	Whether that nun remains or has died: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.14	Remains: what is meant is that she remains as a nun. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.15	Has died: what is meant is that she has passed away. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.16	Has been expelled: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.17	she has either disrobed herself or been expelled by others. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.18	Has converted: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.19	what is meant is that she has joined another religious community. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.20	Afterward she says, “Venerables, although I previously knew that this nun was like this, I thought, ‘I will neither confront her myself’”: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.21	“I won’t accuse her myself.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.22	“Nor tell a group of nuns”: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.23	“Nor tell other nuns.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.24	She too: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.25	this is said with reference to the preceding offenses entailing expulsion. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.26	Is expelled: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.27	just as a fallen, withered leaf is incapable of becoming green again, so is a nun who knows that a nun has committed an offense entailing expulsion, but who thinks, “I will neither confront her myself nor tell a group of nuns,” by the mere fact of giving up her duty, not a monastic, not a daughter of the Sakyan. Therefore it is said “she is expelled”. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.28	Excluded from the community: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.29	Community: joint legal procedures, a joint recitation, the same training—this is called “community”. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.30	She does not take part in this—therefore it is called “excluded from the community”. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.0	Non-offenses 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.1	There is no offense: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.2	if she does not tell because she thinks there will be quarrels or disputes in the Sangha; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.3	if she does not tell because she thinks there will be a schism or fracture in the Sangha; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.4	if she does not tell because she thinks the person she is telling about is cruel and harsh and that she might become a danger to life or to the living of the spiritual life; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.5	if she does not tell because she does not see any suitable nuns; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.6	if she does not tell, but not because she wants to conceal; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.7	if she does not tell because she thinks the other person will be known through her own actions; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.8	if she is insane; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.9	if she is deranged; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.10	if she is overwhelmed by pain; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.11	if she is the first offender. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.12	The sixth offense entailing expulsion is finished.

pli-tv-bi-vb-pj8:1.2	At that time the nuns from the group of six, being lustful and aiming to indulge in inappropriate sexual conduct, consented to lustful men holding their hand and the edge of their robes, and they stood with them, chatted with them, went to appointments with them, consented to men coming to them, entered covered places with them, and disposed their body for that purpose. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-pj8:1.3	The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them,

pli-tv-bi-vb-pj8:1.9	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence …

pli-tv-bi-vb-sk75:1.8	The nuns told the monks, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-sk75:1.9	who in turn told the Buddha. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-sk75:1.10	Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered

pli-tv-bi-vb-ss11:1.2	At that time the nun Caṇḍakāḷī was angry that a legal issue had been decided against her, saying, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss11:1.3	“The nuns are acting out of favoritism, ill will, confusion, and fear.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss11:1.4	The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,

pli-tv-bi-vb-ss11:1.21	If that nun continues as before, the nuns should press her up to three times to make her stop. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss11:1.22	If she then stops, all is well.

pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.1.54	If they commit the offense entailing suspension, the offense of wrong conduct and the serious offenses are annulled. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.1.55	Two or three may be pressed together, but not more than that. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.1.56	Those nuns too: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.1.57	this is said with reference to the preceding offenses. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.1.58	After the third announcement: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.1.59	there is an offense when they have been pressed for the third time, not as soon as the misconduct has been committed. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.1.60	Entailing sending away: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.1.61	she is sent away from the Sangha. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.1.62	Suspension: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.1.63	… Therefore, too, it is called an offense entailing suspension. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.2.0	Permutations 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.2.1	If it is a legitimate legal procedure, and they perceive it as such, and they do not stop, they commit an offense entailing suspension. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.2.2	If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but they are unsure of it, and they do not stop, they commit an offense entailing suspension. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.2.3	If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but they perceive it as illegitimate, and they do not stop, they commit an offense entailing suspension. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.2.4	If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, but they perceive it as legitimate, they commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.2.5	If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, but they are unsure of it, they commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.2.6	If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, and they perceive it as such, they commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.3.0	Non-offenses 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.3.1	There is no offense: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.3.2	if she has not been pressed; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.3.3	if she stops; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.3.4	if she is insane; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.3.5	if she is the first offender. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12:2.3.6	The twelfth offense entailing suspension is finished.

pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:0.3	The chapter on offenses entailing suspension 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:0.4	13. The second training rule on bad behavior 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.2	At that time the nun Thullanandā had been pressed by the Sangha. She then said to the nuns, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.3	“But, Venerables, you should socialize. Don’t live separately. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.4	There are other nuns in the Sangha who have such behavior, reputation, and notoriety,  and who harass the Sangha of nuns and hide each other’s offenses. The Sangha says nothing to them. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.5	It’s because of disrespect, contempt, impatience, and slander, and because you are weak that the Sangha says to you, ‘Sisters, you socialize, behave badly, have a bad reputation, are notorious, harass the Sangha of nuns, and hide each other’s offenses. Be secluded, Venerables. The Sangha praises seclusion for the Sisters.’” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.6	The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.7	“How could Venerable Thullanandā, after being pressed by the Sangha, say this to the nuns?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.8	… 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.9	
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.10	
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.11	“Is it true, monks, that after being pressed by the Sangha, the nun Thullanandā said this to the nuns?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.15	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.16	The Buddha criticized her … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.17	“How could the nun Thullanandā, after being pressed by the Sangha, say this to the nuns? 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.18	
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.19	
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.20	
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.21	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.22	And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.23.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.23.1	‘If a nun says, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.24	“Venerables, you should socialize. Don’t live separately. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.25	There are other nuns in the Sangha who have such behavior, reputation, and notoriety, and who harass the Sangha of nuns and hide each other’s offenses. The Sangha says nothing to them. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.26	It’s because of disrespect, contempt, impatience, and slander, and because you are weak that the Sangha says to you, ‘Sisters, you socialize, behave badly, have a bad reputation, are notorious, harass the Sangha of nuns, and hide each other’s offenses. Be secluded, Venerables. The Sangha praises seclusion for the Sisters,’” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.27	then the nuns should correct her like this: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.28	“Venerable, don’t say such things: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.29	‘Venerables, you should socialize. Don’t live separately. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.30	There are other nuns in the Sangha who have such behavior, reputation, and notoriety, and who harass the Sangha of nuns and hide each other’s offenses. The Sangha says nothing to them. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.31	It’s because of disrespect, contempt, impatience, and slander, and because you are weak that the Sangha says to you, “Sisters, you socialize, behave badly, have a bad reputation, are notorious, harass the Sangha of nuns, and hide each other’s offenses. Be secluded, Venerables. The Sangha praises seclusion for the Sisters.”’” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.32	If that nun continues as before, the nuns should press her up to three times to make her stop. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.33	If she then stops, all is well. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.34	If she does not stop, then after the third announcement that nun too has committed an offense entailing sending away and suspension.’”

pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.8	It’s because of disrespect that the Sangha … to you: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.9	because of despising. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.10	Because of contempt: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.11	because of contemptuousness. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.12	Because of impatience: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.13	because of irritation. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.14	Because of slander:

pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.16	Because … weak: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.17	Because of lack of supporters. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.18	Says: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.19	“Sisters, you socialize, behave badly, have a bad reputation, are notorious, harass the Sangha of nuns, and hide each other’s offenses. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.20	Be secluded, Venerables. The Sangha praises seclusion for the Sisters.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.21	Her: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.22	that nun who speaks thus. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.23	The nuns: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.24	Other nuns who see it or hear about it. They should correct her like this: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.25	“Venerable, don’t say such things: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.26	‘Venerables, you should socialize. Don’t live separately. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.27	There are other nuns in the Sangha … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.28	“… Be secluded, Venerables. The Sangha praises seclusion for the Sisters.”’” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.29	And they should correct her a second 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.30	and a third time. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.31	If she stops, all is well. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.32	If she does not stop, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.33	If those who heard about it do not say anything, they commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.34	That nun, even if she has to be pulled into the Sangha, should be corrected like this: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.35	“Venerable, don’t say such things:

pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.41	If she stops, all is well. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.42	If she does not stop, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.43	Should press her: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.44	“And, monks, she should be pressed like this. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.45	A competent and capable nun should inform the Sangha: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.46	‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.47	The nun so-and-so, after being pressed by the Sangha, says this to the nuns,

pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.53	‘Sisters, you socialize, behave badly, have a bad reputation, are notorious, harass the Sangha of nuns, and hide each other’s offenses. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.54	Be secluded, Venerables. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.55	The Sangha praises seclusion for the Sisters.’” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.56	And she keeps on saying it. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.57	If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should press her to make her stop. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.58	This is the motion. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.59	Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.60	The nun so-and-so, after being pressed by the Sangha, says this to the nuns,

pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.75	The Sangha has pressed nun so-and-so to stop. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.76	The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.77	After the motion, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.78	After each of the first two announcements, she commits a serious offense. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.79	When the last announcement is finished, she commits an offense entailing suspension. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.80	For one who commits the offense entailing suspension, the offense of wrong conduct and the serious offenses are annulled. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.81	That too: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.82	this is said with reference to the preceding offenses. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.83	After the third announcement: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.84	there is an offense when she has been pressed for the third time, not as soon as the misconduct has been committed. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.85	Entailing sending away: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.86	she is sent away from the Sangha. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.87	Suspension: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.88	only the Sangha gives the trial period for that offense, sends back to the beginning, and rehabilitates—not several nuns, not an individual nun. Therefore it is called an offense entailing suspension. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.89	This is the name and designation of this class of offense. Therefore, too, it is called an offense entailing suspension. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.0	Permutations 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.1	If it is a legitimate legal procedure, and she perceives it as such, and she does not stop, she commits an offense entailing suspension.

pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.7.0	Non-offenses 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.7.1	There is no offense: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.8	if she has not been pressed; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.9	if she stops; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.10	if she is insane; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.11	if she is the first offender. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.12	The thirteenth offense entailing suspension is finished. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.13.0	
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.14	“Venerables, the seventeen rules on suspension have been recited, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.15	nine being immediate offenses, eight after the third announcement. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.16	If a nun commits any one of them, she must undertake a trial period for a half-month toward both Sanghas. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.17	When this is completed, she is to be rehabilitated wherever there is a sangha of at least twenty nuns. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.18	If that nun is rehabilitated by a sangha of nuns of even one less than twenty, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.19	then that nun is not rehabilitated and those nuns are at fault. This is proper procedure. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.20	In regard to this I ask you, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.21	‘Are you pure in this?’ 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.22	A second time I ask, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.23	‘Are you pure in this?’ 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.24	A third time I ask, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.25	‘Are you pure in this?’ 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.26	You are pure in this and therefore silent. I will remember it thus.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:3.27	The group of seventeen is finished.

pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:0.4	1. The training rule on being litigious 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:0.5	Venerables, these seventeen rules on suspension come up for recitation. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.2	At that time a lay follower who had given a storehouse to the Sangha of nuns had died. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.3	He had two sons, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.4	one with and one without faith and confidence, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.5	and they divided their father’s property between them. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.6	Then the one without faith said to the other, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.7	“The storehouse is ours; let’s share it out.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.8	But the one with faith responded, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.9	“No, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.10	our father gave it to the Sangha of nuns.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.11	A second time they both said the same thing, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.16	and a third time the one without faith repeated his proposal. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.18	The one with faith then thought, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.19	“If I get it, I too would give it to the Sangha of nuns,” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.20	and he said, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.21	“Let’s share it out.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.22	But when they shared out that storehouse, it fell to the one without faith. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.23	He then went to the nuns and said, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.24	“Please leave, Venerables, this storehouse is mine.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.25	The nun Thullanandā said to him, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.26	“No, your father gave it to the Sangha of nuns.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.27	Because they were unable to agree, they asked judges to decide on the matter. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.28	They said, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.29	“Venerable, who knows that it was given to the Sangha of nuns?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.30	Thullanandā replied, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.31	“But Sirs, didn’t you appoint a witness who saw or heard the giving of the gift?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.32	Saying, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.33	“It’s true what the Venerable says,” the judges made the storehouse the property of the Sangha of nuns. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.34	The defeated man complained and criticized the nuns, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.35	“They’re not monastics these shaven-headed sluts. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.36	How could they take my storehouse?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.37	Thullanandā told the judges of this 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.38	and they punished him. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.39	That man then made a dwelling place for Ājīvaka ascetics not far from the nuns, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.40	inciting them to abuse the nuns. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.41	Once again Thullanandā told the judges 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.42	and the judges jailed him. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.43	People then complained and criticized those nuns, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.44	“First the nuns take his storehouse, then they have him punished, and then they have him jailed. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.45	Now they’ll have him executed!” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.46	Nuns heard the complaints of those people, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.47	and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.48	“How could Venerable Thullanandā be litigious?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.49	Then those nuns told the monks … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.50	“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā is litigious?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.51	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.52	The Buddha criticized her … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.53	“How could the nun Thullanandā be litigious? 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.54	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.55	And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.56.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.56.1	‘If a nun is litigious toward a householder or a householder’s child or a slave or a worker or even toward a monastic or a wanderer, then that nun has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.0	Definitions 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.1	A: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.2	whoever … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.3	Nun: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.4	… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.5	Litigious: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.6	what is meant is that she is the initiator of a lawsuit. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.7	A householder: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.8	whoever lives at home. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.9	A householder’s child: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.10	whoever is a child or a sibling. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.11	A slave: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.12	one born in the household, one who has been bought, one who has been brought back as a captive. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.13	A worker: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.14	a paid worker, a servant. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.15	A monastic or a wanderer: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.16	anyone who is a wanderer apart from Buddhist monks, nuns, trainee nuns, novice monks, and novice nuns. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.17	If, thinking, “I’ll initiate a lawsuit,” she looks for a companion or just goes there herself, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.18	If she tells one other person, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.19	If she tells a second person, she commits a serious offense. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.20	At the end of the lawsuit, she commits an offense entailing suspension. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.21	An immediate offense: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.22	there is an offense as soon as the misconduct is committed, and no pressing is required. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.23	Entailing sending away: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.24	she is sent away from the Sangha. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.25	Suspension: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.26	only the Sangha gives the trial period for that offense, sends back to the beginning, and rehabilitates—not several nuns, not an individual nun. Therefore it is called an offense entailing suspension. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.27	This is the name and designation of this class of offense. Therefore, too, it is called an offense entailing suspension. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.2.0	Non-offenses 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.2.1	There is no offense: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.2.2	if she goes there because people pull her; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.2.3	if she is asking for protection; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.2.4	if she tells without specifying a person; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.2.5	if she is insane; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.2.6	if she is deranged; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.2.7	if she is overwhelmed by pain; 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.2.8	if she is the first offender. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.2.9	The first offense entailing suspension is finished.

pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:0.4	2. The training rule on one who gives the full admission to a criminal 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.2	At that time in Vesālī the wife of a certain Licchavī man was unfaithful. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.3	He said to her, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.4	“Please stop. If you don’t, I’ll punish you.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.5	But she did not listen. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.6	Just then in Vesālī the Licchavī clan had gathered on some business. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.7	That Licchavī man said to them, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.8	“Sirs, please give me permission in regard to one of my wives.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.9	“What is it with her?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.10	“She’s unfaithful. I wish to kill her.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.11	“You may go ahead.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.12	When his wife heard 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.13	that her husband wanted to kill her, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.14	she took their most valuable possessions and went to Sāvatthī. There she went to the monastics of other religions and asked for the going forth, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.15	but they refused. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.16	She then went to the Buddhist nuns and again asked for the going forth, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.17	but they too refused. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.18	She then went to the nun Thullanandā, showed her the goods, and once again asked for the going forth. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.19	Thullanandā took the goods and gave her the going forth. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.20	That Licchavī man then went to Sāvatthī in search of his wife. When he saw that she had been given the going forth as a nun, he went to King Pasenadi of Kosala 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.21	and said, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.22	“Sir, my wife took my most valuable possessions and came to Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.23	Please permit me to deal with her.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.24	“Well then, find her and then inform me.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.25	“I’ve seen her. She’s gone forth as a nun.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.26	“If she’s gone forth as a nun, there’s nothing that can be done. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.27	The Teaching of the Buddha is well-proclaimed. Let her practice the spiritual life for the full ending of suffering.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.28	Then that Licchavī man complained and criticized the nuns, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.29	“How could the nuns give the going forth to a criminal?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.30	The nuns heard the complaints of that Licchavī man, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.31	and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.32	“How could Venerable Thullanandā give the going forth to a criminal?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.33	The nuns told the monks. … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.34	“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā did this?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.35	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.36	The Buddha criticized her … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.37	“How could the nun Thullanandā give the going forth to a criminal? 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.38	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.39	And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.40.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.40.1	‘If a nun, without getting permission from the king or the Sangha or a community or an association or a society, gives the full admission to a woman who she knows is a criminal and who is known as sentenced to death, then, except when it is allowable, that nun too has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.0	Definitions 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.1	A: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.2	whoever … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.3	Nun: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.4	… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.5	She knows:

pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.15	The king: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.16	where a king reigns, permission should be gotten from the king. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.17	The Sangha:

pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.25	Except when it is allowable: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.26	unless it is allowable. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.27	Allowable: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.28	there are two allowable situations: she has gone forth with monastics of another religion or she has gone forth with other Buddhist nuns. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.29	If, intending to give the full admission, she searches for a group, a teacher, a bowl, or a robe, or she establishes a monastic boundary, then, except when it is allowable, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.30	After the motion, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.31	After each of the first two announcements, she commits a serious offense.

pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.33	and the group and the teacher commit an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.34	That too: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.35	this is said with reference to the preceding offense.

pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.40	Suspension: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.41	… Therefore, too, it is called an offense entailing suspension. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.2.0	Permutations 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.2.1	If she is a criminal, and the nun perceives her as such, and she gives her the full admission, except when it is allowable, she commits an offense entailing suspension. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.2.2	If she is a criminal, but the nun is unsure of it, and she gives her the full admission, except when it is allowable, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.2.3	If she is a criminal, but the nun does not perceive her as such, and she gives her the full admission, except when it is allowable, there is no offense.

pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:1.0.1	Origin story 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:1.0.2	First sub-story 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:1.1	At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:1.2	a nun who was a pupil of Bhaddā Kāpilānī had an argument with the nuns and then went to her relatives’ village. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:1.3	Not seeing her pupil anywhere, Bhaddā Kāpilānī asked the nuns, “Where’s so-and-so? She’s disappeared.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:1.4	“She disappeared, Venerable, after arguing with the nuns.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:1.5	“My dears, her relatives live in such-and-such a village. Go there and look for her.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:1.6	The nuns went there, and when they saw her, they said to her, “Why did you go alone, Venerable? We hope you weren’t assaulted?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:1.7	“I wasn’t.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:1.8	The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:1.9	“How could a nun walk to the next village by herself?” … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:1.10	“Is it true, monks, that a nun did this?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:1.11	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:1.12	The Buddha criticized her … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:1.13	“How could a nun do this? 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:1.14	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:1.15	And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:1.16.0	First preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:1.16.1	‘If a nun walks to the next village by herself, then that nun too has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:1.17	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the nuns. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.0	Second sub-story 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.1	On one occasion two nuns were traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.2	On the way they had to cross a river. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.3	They went to a boatman and said, “Please take us across.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.4	“I’m not able, Venerables, to take both of you across at the same time.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.5	And so they crossed individually, alone with the boatman. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.6	When he had crossed with the first nun, he raped her. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.7	And after returning to the first bank, he raped the other nun as well. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.8	Later, when they were reunited, they asked each other, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.9	“Venerable, I hope you weren’t assaulted?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.10	“I was. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.11	And you, Venerable, were you assaulted?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.12	“I was, too.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.13	They then continued on to Sāvatthī and told the nuns there what had happened. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.14	The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.15	“How could a nun cross a river by herself?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.16	They told the monks, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.17	who in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.18	“Is it true, monks, that a nun did this?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.19	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.20	The Buddha criticized them … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.21	“How could a nun do this? 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.22	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.23	And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.24.0	Second preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.24.1	‘If a nun walks to the next village by herself or crosses a river by herself, then that nun too has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:2.25	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the nuns. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.0	Third sub-story 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.1	On one occasion a number of nuns were walking through the Kosalan country on their way to Sāvatthī, when one evening they arrived at a certain village. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.2	One of the nuns was beautiful and graceful, and a certain man fell in love with her as soon as he saw her. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.3	Then, as he was preparing sleeping places for those nuns, he prepared hers to one side. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.4	And that nun thought, “This man is obsessed with me. If I go there for the night, I’ll get into trouble.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.5	Then, without taking leave of the nuns, she went to a certain family and slept there. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.6	When night arrived, that man went searching for that nun, and as he did so he bumped into the other nuns. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.7	Not seeing that nun anywhere, the nuns said, “No doubt she has left with a man.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.8	The following morning that nun returned to the nuns, and they said to her, “Venerable, why did you leave with a man?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.9	“I didn’t leave with a man, Venerables.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.10	She then told the nuns what had happened. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.11	The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.12	“How could a nun spend the night apart by herself?” … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.13	“Is it true, monks, that a nun did this?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.14	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.15	The Buddha criticized her … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.16	“How could a nun do this? 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.17	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.18	And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.19.0	Third preliminary ruling 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.19.1	‘If a nun walks to the next village by herself or crosses a river by herself or spends the night apart by herself, then that nun too has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:3.20	In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the nuns. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:4.0	Fourth sub-story 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:4.1	On one occasion a number of nuns were traveling through the Kosalan country on their way to Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:4.2	One of the nuns, needing to defecate, stayed behind by herself, and then followed behind the others. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:4.3	People saw her and raped her. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:4.4	She then went to the other nuns, and they said to her, “Why did you stay behind by yourself, Venerable? We hope you weren’t assaulted?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:4.5	“I was.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:4.6	The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:4.7	“How could a nun lag behind her companions by herself?” … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:4.8	“Is it true, monks, that a nun did this?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:4.9	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:4.10	The Buddha criticized her … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:4.11	“How could a nun do this? 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:4.12	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:4.13	And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:4.14.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:4.14.1	‘If a nun walks to the next village by herself or crosses a river by herself or spends the night apart by herself or lags behind her companions by herself, then that nun too has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’”

pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:5.1.5	Walks to the next village by herself: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:5.1.6	if she crosses the boundary of an enclosed village with her first foot, she commits a serious offense.

pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:0.4	4. The training rule on reinstating one who has been ejected 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.0	Origin story 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.2	At that time the nun Caṇḍakāḷī was quarrelsome and argumentative, and she created legal issues in the Sangha. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.3	But when a legal procedure was being done against her, the nun Thullanandā objected. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.4	Soon afterwards Thullanandā went to a village on some business. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.5	The Sangha of nuns 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.6	took the opportunity to eject Caṇḍakāḷī for not recognizing an offense. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.7	When Thullanandā had finished her business in that village, she returned to Sāvatthī. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.8	On her return, Caṇḍakāḷī neither prepared a seat for her, nor set out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, or water for washing the feet; and she did not go out to meet her to receive her bowl and robe, nor ask whether she wanted water to drink. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.9	Thullanandā asked her 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.10	why she was acting like this. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.11	She replied, “That’s how it is, Venerable, when you don’t have a protector.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.12	“But how is it, Venerable, that you don’t have a protector?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.13	“When the nuns knew 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.14	that no one would speak up for me because I am not esteemed by them and I didn’t have a protector, they ejected me for not recognizing an offense.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.16	“They are incompetent fools. They don’t know about legal procedures or their flaws, nor what makes them fail or succeed. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.17	But we know all these things. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.18	We can get legal procedures done that haven’t been done, and we can get procedures that have been done overturned.” And she quickly gathered a sangha of nuns and reinstated the nun Caṇḍakāḷī. 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.19	The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.20	“How could Venerable Thullanandā reinstate a nun who had been ejected by a unanimous Sangha in accordance with the rule, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction, without first getting permission from the Sangha that did the legal procedure and without the consent of the group?” … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.21	“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā did this?” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.22	“It’s true, Sir.” 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.23	The Buddha criticized her … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.24	“How could the nun Thullanandā reinstate a nun who had been ejected by a unanimous Sangha in accordance with the rule, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction, without first getting permission from the Sangha that did the legal procedure and without the consent of the group? 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.25	This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.26	And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.27.0	Final ruling 
pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.27.1	‘If a nun, without getting permission from the Sangha that did the legal procedure and without the consent of the group, reinstates a nun who has been ejected by a unanimous Sangha in accordance with the rule and the Monastic Law and the Teacher’s instruction, then that nun too has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’”

pli-tv-bi-vb-ss5:1.6	The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
