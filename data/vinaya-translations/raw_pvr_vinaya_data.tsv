pli-tv-pvr10:24.4	And thirty-two minor offenses.
pli-tv-pvr10:25.1	Two blameworthy offenses, and three on training—
pli-tv-pvr10:25.2	Fifty-six training rules,
pli-tv-pvr10:25.3	Laid down at six towns,
pli-tv-pvr10:25.4	By the Buddha, the Kinsman of the Sun.
pli-tv-pvr10:26.1	Two hundred and ninety-four,
pli-tv-pvr10:26.2	All pronounced at Sāvatthī,
pli-tv-pvr10:26.3	By the compassionate Buddha,
pli-tv-pvr10:26.4	The famous Gotama.”
pli-tv-pvr10:27.0	2. The four kinds of failure
pli-tv-pvr10:27.1	“What we have asked, you have answered;
pli-tv-pvr10:27.2	All is explained, not otherwise.
pli-tv-pvr10:27.3	I wish to ask you another question. Please tell me this:
pli-tv-pvr10:27.4	Serious, and light, curable;
pli-tv-pvr10:27.5	Incurable, and grave, minor,
pli-tv-pvr10:27.6	And those that are ‘after the third’.
pli-tv-pvr10:28.1	In common, not in common,
pli-tv-pvr10:28.2	The ways that failures are settled—
pli-tv-pvr10:28.3	Please explain all these too,
pli-tv-pvr10:28.4	And we will listen to you.”
pli-tv-pvr10:29.1	“There are thirty-one serious ones,
pli-tv-pvr10:29.2	And eight here that are incurable;
pli-tv-pvr10:29.3	Those that are serious are grave,
pli-tv-pvr10:29.4	Those that are grave are failures in morality;
pli-tv-pvr10:29.5	Offenses entailing expulsion, offenses entailing suspension—
pli-tv-pvr10:29.6	they are called ‘failure in morality’.
pli-tv-pvr10:30.1	Serious offenses, offenses entailing confession,
pli-tv-pvr10:30.2	Offenses entailing acknowledgment, offenses of wrong conduct;
pli-tv-pvr10:30.3	Offenses of wrong speech,
pli-tv-pvr10:30.4	And whoever calls another names for fun—
pli-tv-pvr10:30.5	this is considered failure in conduct.
pli-tv-pvr10:31.1	Holding on to distorted views,
pli-tv-pvr10:31.2	Aiming at what is contrary to the true Dhamma;
pli-tv-pvr10:31.3	Misrepresenting the Awakened One,
pli-tv-pvr10:31.4	Being foolish, enveloped in delusion—
pli-tv-pvr10:31.5	this is considered failure in view.
pli-tv-pvr10:32.1	When, to make a living—having bad desires, overcome by desire—one claims a non-existent, unreal superhuman quality; when, to make a living, one acts as a matchmaker; when, to make a living, one says, ‘Whatever monk lives in your dwelling is a perfected one;’ when, to make a living, a monk eats fine foods that he himself has asked for; when, to make a living, a nun eats fine foods that she herself has asked for; when, to make a living, one eats bean curry or rice that one has asked for oneself—
pli-tv-pvr10:32.2	this is considered failure in livelihood.
pli-tv-pvr10:33.1	There are eleven ‘after the third’;
pli-tv-pvr10:33.2	Listen to them as they truly are:
pli-tv-pvr10:33.3	A nun who takes sides with one who has been ejected,
pli-tv-pvr10:33.4	Eight ‘after the third’,
pli-tv-pvr10:33.5	Ariṭṭha, and Caṇḍakālī—
pli-tv-pvr10:33.6	These are those ‘after the third’.”
pli-tv-pvr10:34.0	3. To be cut down, etc.
pli-tv-pvr10:34.1	“How many on ‘to be cut down’?
pli-tv-pvr10:34.2	How many on ‘to be destroyed’?
pli-tv-pvr10:34.3	How many on ‘to be stripped’?
pli-tv-pvr10:34.4	How many on ‘no other, he commits an offense entailing confession’?
pli-tv-pvr10:34.5	How many on ‘the monks have agreed’?
pli-tv-pvr10:34.6	How many on ‘what is proper’?
pli-tv-pvr10:34.7	How many on ‘at the most’?
pli-tv-pvr10:35.1	How many on ‘knowing’?
pli-tv-pvr10:35.2	Were laid down by the Buddha, the Kinsman of the Sun?”
pli-tv-pvr10:36.1	“There are six on ‘to be cut down’.
pli-tv-pvr10:36.2	There is one on ‘to be destroyed’.
pli-tv-pvr10:36.3	There is one on ‘to be stripped’.
pli-tv-pvr10:36.4	There are four on ‘no other, he commits an offense entailing confession’.
pli-tv-pvr10:36.5	There are four on ‘the monks have agreed’.
pli-tv-pvr10:36.6	There are seven on ‘what is proper’.
pli-tv-pvr10:36.7	There are fourteen on ‘at the most’.
pli-tv-pvr10:37.1	There are sixteen on ‘knowing’.
pli-tv-pvr10:37.2	They were laid down by the Buddha, the Kinsman of the Sun.”

pli-tv-pvr10:57.3	The eight offenses entailing expulsion that are dangerous to approach,
pli-tv-pvr10:57.4	Like the simile of a palm stump.
pli-tv-pvr10:58.1	That person is like a withered leaf, like an ordinary stone that has broken in half,
pli-tv-pvr10:58.2	Like someone with their head cut off.

pli-tv-pvr10:63.0	5. The offenses entailing expulsion, etc.
pli-tv-pvr10:63.1	“It is called, ‘An offense entailing expulsion’.
pli-tv-pvr10:63.2	Listen to it as it really is:
pli-tv-pvr10:63.3	When one has fallen away, offended, and fallen down,
pli-tv-pvr10:63.4	Rejected the true Teaching,
pli-tv-pvr10:63.5	One is also excluded from the community.
pli-tv-pvr10:63.6	This it why it is called that.
pli-tv-pvr10:64.1	It is called, ‘An offense entailing suspension’.
pli-tv-pvr10:64.2	Listen to it as it really is:
pli-tv-pvr10:64.3	Only the Sangha gives probation,
pli-tv-pvr10:64.4	Sends back to the beginning,
pli-tv-pvr10:64.5	Gives the trial period, and rehabilitates.
pli-tv-pvr10:64.6	This it why it is called that.
pli-tv-pvr10:65.1	It is called, ‘An undetermined offense’.
pli-tv-pvr10:65.2	Listen to it as it really is:
pli-tv-pvr10:65.3	Undetermined, not determined,
pli-tv-pvr10:65.4	An undecided rule,
pli-tv-pvr10:65.5	It is one of three cases.
pli-tv-pvr10:65.6	It is called, ‘An undetermined offense’.
pli-tv-pvr10:66.1	It is called, ‘A serious offense’.
pli-tv-pvr10:66.2	Listen to it as it really is:
pli-tv-pvr10:66.3	The one who confesses to instigating another,
pli-tv-pvr10:66.4	And the one who agrees to it—
pli-tv-pvr10:66.5	There is no offense that fits with that.
pli-tv-pvr10:66.6	This it why it is called that.
pli-tv-pvr10:67.1	It is called, ‘An offense entailing relinquishment’.
pli-tv-pvr10:67.2	Listen to it as it really is:
pli-tv-pvr10:67.3	In the midst of the Sangha, in the midst of a group,
pli-tv-pvr10:67.4	Or just one with one,
pli-tv-pvr10:67.5	One relinquishes and then confesses.
pli-tv-pvr10:67.6	This it why it is called that.
pli-tv-pvr10:68.1	It is called, ‘An offense entailing confession’.
pli-tv-pvr10:68.2	Listen to it as it really is:
pli-tv-pvr10:68.3	One lets go of a wholesome state,
pli-tv-pvr10:68.4	Goes against the noble path,
pli-tv-pvr10:68.5	Having a deluded mind.
pli-tv-pvr10:68.6	This it why it is called that.
pli-tv-pvr10:69.1	It is called, ‘An offense entailing acknowledgment’.
pli-tv-pvr10:69.2	Listen to it as it really is:
pli-tv-pvr10:69.3	An unrelated monk,
pli-tv-pvr10:69.4	Whatever food she has obtained with difficulty,
pli-tv-pvr10:69.5	Should he receive it himself and eat it,
pli-tv-pvr10:69.6	It is called blameworthy.
pli-tv-pvr10:70.1	When eating at an invitation,
pli-tv-pvr10:70.2	And a nun there gives directions based on favouritism,
pli-tv-pvr10:70.3	If they eat without having stopped her,
pli-tv-pvr10:70.4	It is called blameworthy.
pli-tv-pvr10:71.1	Going to a family that has faith,
pli-tv-pvr10:71.2	But is poor with little wealth,
pli-tv-pvr10:71.3	If one eats there without being sick,
pli-tv-pvr10:71.4	It is called blameworthy.
pli-tv-pvr10:72.1	If anyone stays in a wilderness,
pli-tv-pvr10:72.2	That is risky and dangerous,
pli-tv-pvr10:72.3	And they eat there without making an announcement,
pli-tv-pvr10:72.4	It is called blameworthy.
pli-tv-pvr10:73.1	An unrelated nun,
pli-tv-pvr10:73.2	Whatever belongs to others—
pli-tv-pvr10:73.3	Ghee, oil, honey, syrup,
pli-tv-pvr10:73.4	Fish, meat, milk, and curd—
pli-tv-pvr10:73.5	If she herself asks for them,
pli-tv-pvr10:73.6	She has committed a blameworthy act in the instruction of the Accomplished One.
pli-tv-pvr10:74.1	It is called, ‘An offense of wrong conduct’.
pli-tv-pvr10:74.2	Listen to it as it really is:
pli-tv-pvr10:74.3	Offended, and failed,
pli-tv-pvr10:74.4	Faltered, and what is badly done,
pli-tv-pvr10:75.1	Whatever people do that is bad,
pli-tv-pvr10:75.2	Whether in public or in private,
pli-tv-pvr10:75.3	They declare to be wrong conduct.
pli-tv-pvr10:75.4	This it why it is called that.
pli-tv-pvr10:76.1	“It is called, ‘An offense of wrong speech’.
pli-tv-pvr10:76.2	Listen to it as it really is:
pli-tv-pvr10:76.3	Wrong speech, wrong utterance,
pli-tv-pvr10:76.4	Whatever sentence is defiled,
pli-tv-pvr10:76.5	And condemned by the wise.
pli-tv-pvr10:76.6	This it why it is called that.
pli-tv-pvr10:77.1	It is called, ‘To be trained in’.
pli-tv-pvr10:77.2	Listen to it as it really is:
pli-tv-pvr10:77.3	For one who is a trainee, training,
pli-tv-pvr10:77.4	Following the straight path,
pli-tv-pvr10:78.1	This is the beginning and the right conduct,
pli-tv-pvr10:78.2	With controlled mouth and restraint—
pli-tv-pvr10:78.3	There is no training like this.
pli-tv-pvr10:78.4	This it why it is called that.
pli-tv-pvr10:79.1	It rains on what’s concealed,
pli-tv-pvr10:79.2	Not on what’s revealed.
pli-tv-pvr10:79.3	Therefore, reveal the concealed,
pli-tv-pvr10:79.4	And it will not be rained upon.
pli-tv-pvr10:80.1	The forest is the destination of deer,
pli-tv-pvr10:80.2	The air is the destination of birds,
pli-tv-pvr10:80.3	Non-existence is the destination of phenomena,
pli-tv-pvr10:80.4	Extinguishment is the destination of a Perfected One.”

pli-tv-pvr10:83.1	“Laid down in seven towns,

pli-tv-pvr11:32.4	How is this?
pli-tv-pvr11:32.5	It may be that monks are disputing, saying,
pli-tv-pvr11:32.6	‘This is the Teaching’, ‘This is contrary to the Teaching’ …
pli-tv-pvr11:32.7	‘This is a grave offense’, or ‘This is a minor offense.’
pli-tv-pvr11:32.8	In regard to this, whatever quarreling, arguing, conflict, disputing, variety in opinion, difference in opinion, heated speech, or strife there is, this called a legal issue arising from a dispute.

pli-tv-pvr11:33.4	How is this?
pli-tv-pvr11:33.5	It may be that the monks accuse a monk of failure in morality, failure in conduct, failure in view, or failure in livelihood.
pli-tv-pvr11:33.6	In regard to this, whatever accusation, accusing, allegation, blame, taking sides because of friendship, taking part in the accusation, or supporting the accusation there is, this is called a legal issue arising from an accusation.
pli-tv-pvr11:33.7	When, during a legal issue arising from an accusation, the Sangha disputes, there is a legal issue arising from a dispute.

pli-tv-pvr11:34.2	A legal issue arising from an offense is neither a legal issue arising from business, nor a legal issue arising from a dispute, nor a legal issue arising from an accusation.
pli-tv-pvr11:34.3	Nevertheless, because of a legal issue arising from an offense, there is a legal issue arising from business, a legal issue arising from a dispute, and a legal issue arising from an accusation.
pli-tv-pvr11:34.4	How is this?
pli-tv-pvr11:34.5	There are legal issues arising from offenses because of the five classes of offenses, and there are legal issues arising from offenses because of the seven classes of offenses—these are called legal issues arising from offenses.
pli-tv-pvr11:34.6	When, during a legal issue arising from an offense, the Sangha disputes, there is a legal issue arising from a dispute.

pli-tv-pvr11:35.2	A legal issue arising from business is neither a legal issue arising from a dispute, nor a legal issue arising from an accusation, nor a legal issue arising from an offense.
pli-tv-pvr11:35.3	Nevertheless, because of a legal issue arising from business, there is a legal issue arising from a dispute, a legal issue arising from an accusation, and a legal issue arising from an offense.
pli-tv-pvr11:35.4	How is this?
pli-tv-pvr11:35.5	Whatever is the duty or the business of the Sangha—a legal procedure consisting of getting permission, a legal procedure consisting of one motion, a legal procedure consisting of one motion and one announcement, a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements—this is called a legal issue arising from business.
pli-tv-pvr11:35.6	When, during a legal issue arising from business, the Sangha disputes, there is a legal issue arising from a dispute.
pli-tv-pvr11:35.7	When one who is disputing makes an accusation, there is an legal issue arising from an accusation.
pli-tv-pvr11:35.8	When one who is accusing commits an offense, there is a legal issue arising from an offense.
pli-tv-pvr11:35.9	When the Sangha does a legal procedure because of that offense, there is a legal issue arising from business.

pli-tv-pvr13:7.11	truth and composure.
pli-tv-pvr13:7.13	“How should the Sangha act?”
pli-tv-pvr13:7.14	The Sangha should know what has been brought before it and what is not.
pli-tv-pvr13:7.16	“How should the investigator act?”

pli-tv-pvr13:28.2	Beginning, at root, observance day,
pli-tv-pvr13:28.3	Destiny. In the chapter on accusing,
pli-tv-pvr13:28.4	The instruction is placed.”
pli-tv-pvr14:0.1	The Compendium
pli-tv-pvr14:0.2	The shorter section on conflict
pli-tv-pvr14:0.3	1. The procedure for an investigator
pli-tv-pvr14:1.1	When a monk who is involved in a conflict is about to approach the Sangha, he should:
pli-tv-pvr14:1.2	be humble;
pli-tv-pvr14:1.3	be intent on removing defilements;
pli-tv-pvr14:1.4	be skilled in appropriate seats and where to sit down, taking a seat without encroaching on the senior monks and without blocking the junior monks;
pli-tv-pvr14:1.5	not ramble or talk pointlessly, but speak according to the Teaching or invite others to speak or value noble silence.
pli-tv-pvr14:2.1	An investigator—who has been approved by the Sangha and who wishes to investigate—should not ask about preceptor, teacher, student, pupil, co-student, co-pupil, caste, name, family, reciter tradition, home address, or nationality.
pli-tv-pvr14:2.2	What is the reason for that?
pli-tv-pvr14:2.3	“In these cases there would be affection or ill will.
pli-tv-pvr14:2.4	When there is affection or ill will, one might be swayed by favoritism, ill will, confusion, or fear.
pli-tv-pvr14:3.1	An investigator—who has been approved by the Sangha and who wishes to investigate—should respect the Sangha, not individuals; should value the true Dhamma, not worldly things; should value the goal, not conformity with a gathering; should investigate at an appropriate time, not at an inappropriate one; should investigate truthfully, not falsely; should investigate gently, not harshly; should investigate beneficially, not unbeneficially; should investigate with a mind of good will, not with ill will; should not whisper in the ear; should not look for flaws; should not wink; should not raise an eyebrow; should not nod; should not signal with the hand; should not gesture with the hand.
pli-tv-pvr14:4.1	One should be skilled in appropriate seats and where to sit down. Looking a plow’s length in front, acting in line with one’s aim, one should sit down on one’s own seat. One should not get up from one’s seat, mangle the investigation, take a wrong path, gesticulate, proceed hastily with force, or speak fiercely without patience. One should have mind of loving kindness with compassion and empathy, and be concerned and work for the welfare of the parties involved. One should speak succinctly and to the point, without being angry or argumentative. He should assess himself, the others, the accuser, the accused, one who accuses illegitimately, one who is accused illegitimately, one who accuses legitimately, and one who is accused legitimately. Not mangling what has been said, nor proclaiming what has not been said, he should carefully scrutinize the sentences and words under consideration, question the others, and deal with them according to what they have admitted. He should gladden those who are confused, relax those who are frightened, restrain those who are fierce, and expose those who are impure. Being moral and gentle, one should not be swayed by favoritism, anger, confusion, or fear. One should be impartial in regard to the Teaching and the people involved.
pli-tv-pvr14:4.2	In this way an investigator is acting in accordance with the instruction of the Teacher. And they are dear, agreeable, respected, and esteemed by their discerning fellow monastics.
pli-tv-pvr14:5.1	The Monastic Code is for the sake of direction, the similes for the sake of illustration, the goal is to be made known, and questioning is for sake of establishing. Asking for permission is for the sake of accusing, accusing for reminding, reminding for initiating a legal process, initiating a legal process for obstructing, obstructing for investigating, investigating for weighing up, weighing up for deciding what is and is not the case, and deciding what is and is not the case is for the sake of restraining bad people and to support the good monks. The Sangha has the purpose of examining and accepting the decision. The Sangha should appoint people who are leaders and who are trustworthy.
pli-tv-pvr14:6.1	The Monastic Law is for the sake of restraint, restraint for non-regret, non-regret for joy, joy for rapture, rapture for tranquility, tranquility for bliss, bliss for stillness, stillness for seeing things according to reality, seeing things according to reality for repulsion, repulsion for dispassion, dispassion for liberation, liberation for knowledge and vision of liberation, and knowledge and vision of liberation is for the sake of extinguishment without grasping.
pli-tv-pvr14:6.2	This is the purpose of discussion, this is the purpose of consultation, this is the purpose of vital conditions, this is the purpose of listening,
pli-tv-pvr14:6.3	that is, the release of mind without grasping.”
pli-tv-pvr14:7.1	“Consider carefully the proper procedure of examination,
pli-tv-pvr14:7.2	As formulated by the skilled Awakened One,
pli-tv-pvr14:7.3	Well-spoken in line with the training rules—

pli-tv-pvr14:8.1	Ignorant about basis, failure, and offense,
pli-tv-pvr14:8.2	As well as source and ways;
pli-tv-pvr14:8.3	Not knowing the sequence,
pli-tv-pvr14:8.4	And the same with what has and has not been done.
pli-tv-pvr14:9.1	Ignorant about legal procedures and legal issues,
pli-tv-pvr14:9.2	As well as their settling.
pli-tv-pvr14:9.3	Greedy, angry, and confused,
pli-tv-pvr14:9.4	Swayed by fear and confusion,
pli-tv-pvr14:10.1	Not skilled in persuasion,
pli-tv-pvr14:10.2	Nor in making others understand;
pli-tv-pvr14:10.3	A shameless one who has obtained a faction,
pli-tv-pvr14:10.4	Disrespectful and doing dark deeds—
pli-tv-pvr14:10.5	A monk such as this
pli-tv-pvr14:10.6	Should be deferred to.
pli-tv-pvr14:11.1	Understanding basis, failure, and offense,
pli-tv-pvr14:11.2	As well as source and ways;
pli-tv-pvr14:11.3	Knowing the sequence,
pli-tv-pvr14:11.4	And the same with what has and has not been done.
pli-tv-pvr14:12.1	Understanding legal procedures and legal issues,
pli-tv-pvr14:12.2	As well as their settling.
pli-tv-pvr14:12.3	Not greedy, angry, or confused,
pli-tv-pvr14:12.4	Swayed neither by fear nor confusion,
pli-tv-pvr14:13.1	Skilled in persuasion,
pli-tv-pvr14:13.2	And in making others understand;
pli-tv-pvr14:13.3	A conscientious one who has obtained a faction,
pli-tv-pvr14:13.4	Respectful and doing bright deeds—
pli-tv-pvr14:13.5	A monk such as this
pli-tv-pvr14:13.6	Should be deferred to.”

pli-tv-pvr14:16.2	Respect for the Sangha, not individuals;
pli-tv-pvr14:16.3	The Monastic Code is for the sake of direction,

pli-tv-pvr15:0.2	The great section on conflict
pli-tv-pvr15:0.3	1. What is to be known by one who is speaking, etc.
pli-tv-pvr15:1.1	When a monk who is involved in a conflict is speaking in the Sangha, he should know the actions that are the bases for offenses, as well as the failures, the offenses, the origin stories, the attributes, the sequence, what has and has not been done, the legal procedures, the legal issues, and their settling. He should not be swayed by desire, ill will, confusion or fear. He should persuade when persuasion is appropriate, should make others understand when making understand is appropriate, should look on when looking on is appropriate, and should inspire when inspiration is appropriate. Thinking, “I have obtained a faction,” he should not despise the factions of others. Thinking, “I am learned,” he should not despise those who are ignorant.

He should resolve that legal issue in accordance with the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction.
pli-tv-pvr15:2.1	“He should know the actions that are the bases for offenses”:

pli-tv-pvr15:6.5	“He should know the attributes of a group”:
pli-tv-pvr15:6.6	“Is this group capable of resolving this legal issue according to the Teaching, the Monastic law, and the Teacherʼs instruction, or is it not?”
pli-tv-pvr15:6.7	“He should know the attributes of an individual”:
pli-tv-pvr15:6.8	“Is this individual capable of resolving this legal issue according to the Teaching, the Monastic law, and the Teacherʼs instruction, or is he not?”
pli-tv-pvr15:6.9	“He should know the attributes of an accuser”:
pli-tv-pvr15:6.10	“Is this Venerable established in the five qualities before accusing another, or is he not?”
pli-tv-pvr15:6.11	“He should know the attributes of an accused”:
pli-tv-pvr15:6.12	“Is this Venerable established in the two qualities of truth and composure, or is he not?”
pli-tv-pvr15:7.1	“He should know the sequence”:
pli-tv-pvr15:7.2	“Does this Venerable move from one action that is the basis for an offense to another action, from one failure to another, from one offense to another? Does he assert things after denying them, deny things after asserting them, or evade the issue? Or does he not?”
pli-tv-pvr15:8.1	“He should know what has and has not been done”:
pli-tv-pvr15:8.2	he should know sexual intercourse, he should know what amounts to sexual intercourse, he should know the preliminaries of sexual intercourse.
pli-tv-pvr15:8.3	“He should know sexual intercourse”:
pli-tv-pvr15:8.4	he should know that which is done wherever there are couples.
pli-tv-pvr15:8.5	“He should know what amounts to sexual intercourse”:

pli-tv-pvr15:9.3	he should know the four kinds of legal procedures consisting of getting permission, the four kinds of legal procedures consisting of one motion, the four kinds of legal procedures consisting one motion and one announcement, and the four kinds of legal procedures consisting of one motion and three announcements.

pli-tv-pvr15:12.0	2. Not to be swayed
pli-tv-pvr15:12.1	“He should not be swayed by desire”:
pli-tv-pvr15:12.2	How is one swayed by desire?
pli-tv-pvr15:12.3	It may be that someone thinks, “This is my preceptor, teacher, student, pupil, co-student, co-pupil, friend, companion, or relative.” To be compassionate toward and protect this person, he proclaims what is contrary to the Teaching as the Teaching and what is the Teaching as contrary to the Teaching. He proclaims what is contrary to the Monastic Law as the Monastic Law, and what is the Monastic Law as contrary to the Monastic Law. He proclaims what hasn’t been spoken by the Buddha as spoken by the Buddha, and what has been spoken by the Buddha as not spoken by the Buddha. He proclaims what was not practiced by the Buddha as practiced by the Buddha, and what was practiced by the Buddha as not practiced by the Buddha. He proclaims what was not laid down by the Buddha as laid down by the Buddha, and what was laid down by the Buddha as not laid down by the Buddha. He proclaims a non-offense as an offense, and an offense as a non-offense. He proclaims a light offense as heavy, and a heavy offense as light. He proclaims a curable offense as incurable, and an incurable offense as curable. He proclaims a grave offense as minor, and a minor offense as grave.
pli-tv-pvr15:12.4	If he is swayed by desire by way of these eighteen grounds, then his behaviour is unbeneficial and a cause of unhappiness for humanity; it is harmful, detrimental, and a cause of suffering for gods and humans.
pli-tv-pvr15:12.5	If he is swayed by desire by way of these eighteen grounds, then he is damaged and impaired, blamed and criticized by sensible people, and makes much demerit.
pli-tv-pvr15:13.1	“He should not be swayed by ill will”:
pli-tv-pvr15:13.2	How is one swayed by ill will?
pli-tv-pvr15:13.3	It may be that someone thinks, “They have harmed me,” and he gives rise to resentment. Or he thinks, “They are harming me,” and he gives rise to resentment. Or he thinks, “They will harm me,” and he gives rise to resentment. Or he thinks, “They have harmed someone who is dear to me” … “They are harming someone who is dear to me” … “They will harm someone who is dear to me” … “They have benefited someone I dislike” … “They are benefiting someone I dislike” … “They will benefit someone I dislike,” and he gives rise to resentment.
