The Buddha gives the brahmin another interpretation of the “threefold lore”; (see Aggika Sutta). The brahmin, thereupon, becomes a convert, enters the Order, and, in due course, attains arahantship. <span class='ref'>SN.i.166<em>f.</em></span></p></dd>	aggikabharadvaja	SN.i.166<em>f.</em>	SN.i.166

The king admits that he had been to various teachers before, but had failed to find satisfaction in their teachings. It is noteworthy that the Buddha greets the king cordially on his arrival and makes no mention whatever of the king’s impiety. Instead, when Ajātasattu expresses his repentance at the end of the discourse, the Buddha accepts his confession and lets him off almost too lightly. But after the king had departed the Buddha tells the monks how the king’s misdeeds had wrought his undoing both in this world and the next, for if he had not been guilty of them, the Eye of Truth would have been opened for him on the occasion of this sermon. <span class='ref'>DN.i.85–86</span></p><p>Henceforth the king became a loyal adherent of the Buddha’s faith, though, as far as we know, he never waited again either upon the Buddha or upon any member of the Order for the discussion of ethical matters.

Thereupon Ajātasattu declared war on his uncle. Before this, uncle and nephew seem to have been on very friendly terms. Once Ajātasattu sent Pasenadi a wonderful piece of foreign fabric, sixteen cubits long and eight broad, mounted on a pole to serve as a canopy. This Pasenadi gave to Ānanda. <span class='ref'>MN.ii.116</span></p><p>At first he was victorious in three battles, but, later, he was defeated by Pasenadi, who followed the military advice of an old monk, the Elder Dhanuggahatissa; Ajātasattu was taken captive with his army. On giving an undertaking not to resort to violence again, he was released, and to seal the friendship, Pasenadi gave him his daughter Vajirā as wife, and the revenue of the disputed village was gifted to her as bath-money. <span class='ref'>SN.i.82–85</span></p><p>Later, when through the treachery of Pasenadi’s minister, Dīgha Kārāyana, his son Viḍūḍabha usurped the throne, Pasenadi, finding himself deserted, went towards Rājagaha to seek Ajātasattu’s help, but on the way he died of exposure and Ajātasattu gave him burial.</p><p>About a year before the Buddha’s death, Ajātasattu sent his chief minister and confidant, the brahmin Vassakāra, to the Buddha to intimate to him his desire to make war on the Vajjians and to find out what prediction the Buddha would make regarding his chances of victory. The Buddha informed the brahmin that the Vajjians practised the seven conditions of welfare which they had learnt from him, and that they were therefore invincible. <span class='ref'>DN.ii.72<em>f.</em></span> The Saṁyutta Nikāya mentions the Buddha as saying that the time would come when the Vajjians would relinquish their strenuous mode of living and that then would come Ajātasattu’s chance. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.268</span></p><p>Rumours are mentioned of King Candappajjota making preparations for a war on Ajātasattu to avenge the death of his friend Bimbisāra, but no mention is made of actual fighting. <span class='ref'>MN.iii.7</span></p><p>It was he who built the fortress of Pāṭāliputta, which later became the capital of Māgadha.</p></dd>	ajatasattu	DN.i.50	DN.i.50

They conceived the view that the brahmins are the highest class of men and that they alone are the legitimate sons of Brahma. Hearing of this, Asita Devala appeared before their hermitage in orange attire, with stout sandals and staff, and shouted for them. The brahmins cursed him with the intention of shrivelling him into a cinder, but the more they cursed the more comely and handsome grew Asita. Feeling that their austerities were evidently fruitless, they questioned Asita who urged them to discard their delusion. Having learnt his identity, they saluted him and wished to be instructed; Asita examined and cross-questioned them about their pretensions regarding their lineage and they could find no answer.

This was the occasion for the preaching of the Cūḷa-Saccaka Sutta. <span class='ref'>MN.i.227<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>The Saṁyutta Nikāya <span class='ref'>SN.iii.124<em>ff.</em></span> records a visit paid by the Buddha to Assaji as he lay grievously sick in Kassapārāma near Rājagaha. He tells the Buddha that he cannot enter into <i>jhāna</i> because of his difficulty in breathing and that he cannot win balance of mind. The Buddha encourages him and asks him to dwell on thoughts of impermanence and non-self.</p></dd>	assaji	SN.iii.124<em>ff.</em>	SN.iii.124

assalāyana	Assalāyana	Assalāyana	<dd><p>A young brahmin, sixteen years old, of Sāvatthī, very learned in the Vedas and allied subjects. Five hundred brahmins staying in the city asked him to hold a discussion with the Buddha and refute his views. He agreed only after repeated requests, because, he said, Gotama was a thinker with views of his own and, therefore, difficult to defeat in controversy.</p><p>He visits the Buddha and asks what he has to say concerning the claims of the brahmins to be the only superior class, the legitimate sons of Brahma.</p><p>The Buddha points out to him that such pretensions are baseless, and that virtue, which alone leads to purity, can be cultivated by any of the four classes. Assalāyana sits silent and upset at the end of the discourse, but when the Buddha relates to him a story of the past where Asita Devala had defeated brahmins who held these same views, Assalāyana feels relieved and expresses his admiration of the Buddha’s exposition. He declares himself a follower of the Buddha. <span class='ref'>MN.ii.147<em>ff.</em></span></p></dd>	assalayana	MN.ii.147<em>ff.</em>	MN.ii.147

Gotama quickly mastered his doctrine and was able to repeat it by heart; but feeling sure that Āḷāra not only knew the doctrine but had realised it, he approached him and questioned him about it. Āḷāra then proclaimed the Ākiñcaññāyatana, and Gotama, putting forth energy and concentration greater than Āḷāra’s, made himself master of that state. Āḷāra recognised his pupil’s eminence and treated him as an equal, but Gotama, not having succeeded in his quest, took leave of Āḷāra to go elsewhere. When, after having practised austerities for six years, the Buddha attained Enlightenment and granted Sahampati’s request to preach the doctrine, it was of Āḷāra he thought first as being the fittest to hear the teaching. But Āḷāra had died seven days earlier. <span class='ref'>Vin.i.7</span></p><p>The Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta <span class='ref'>DN.ii.130</span> mentions a Mallian, Pukkusa, who says he had been Āḷāra’s disciple, but who, when he hears the Buddha’s sermon, confesses faith in the Buddha.

She was married again with the same result, and a third time to a friar. Isidāsī’s father persuaded him to give up the pilgrim’s life; he dwelt with his wife only for a fortnight and refused to stay with her any more. Isidāsī then met the therī Jinadattā, whom she entertained to a meal at her house. Under Jinadattā, Isidāsī joined the Order and became an arahant.</p><p>The Therīgāthā, <span class='ref'>Thig.400–447</span> which contains forty-seven verses ascribed to her, describes not only her present life, but also her past lives. She had been a worker in gold in Erakaccha and had committed adultery in that life. As a result she was born in hell for a long time, and, in subsequent births became an ape, a goat, an ox, a hermaphrodite slave and a carter’s daughter. In this last birth she was sold to a merchant in payment of her father’s debts. When she was sixteen, the merchant’s son, Giridāsa, fell in love with her and married her. He had already one wife, and the new one caused dissension between her and her husband. Therefore it was that in this life she was hated by her husbands.</p></dd>	isidasi	Thig.400–447	Thig.400

Pasenadi was greatly annoyed and when, in due course, the matter reached the ears of the Buddha, Upananda was rebuked and a set of rules was passed regarding promises made about the rainy season. <span class='ref'>Vin.i.153</span> On another occasion Upananda spent the rainy season at Sāvatthī, but when the time came for the monks to gather together and divide the robes that had been given to them, he went from village to village, taking his share of the robes from everywhere. The Buddha sent for him and rebuked him in the presence of the Order, but the rebuke had evidently no effect, for we find him again spending the Vassa alone in two residences, with the idea of obtaining many robes. The Buddha, however, ordered that only one portion should be given to him. <span class='ref'>Vin.i.300</span> His greediness was not confined to robes. Once he was invited to a meal by an official, a follower of the Ājīvakas. He went late, and finding no room left for him, made a junior monk get up and give him his seat. There was a great uproar, but Upananda had his way. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.165</span> Elsewhere he is accused of having appropriated two lodgings for himself at the same time, one at Sāvatthī and the other somewhere in the country. He was evidently unpopular among the monks, because on this occasion we find him spoken of as “a maker of strife, quarrelsome, a maker of disputes, given to idle talk, a raiser of legal questions.”. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.168</span> Upananda was fond of money, for we find in the Vinaya <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.297</span> a statement to the effect that “on the occasion of the matter of Upananda the Sākyan, the Buddha distinctly laid down a precept by which gold and silver were forbidden.” Upananda had been given his meals regularly by a certain</p><p>family. Once a dish of meat was prepared for him, but a little boy in the house started to cry for the meat, and it was given to him. Upananda insisted that a kahāpaṇa should be paid to him in lieu of the meat. <span class='ref'>Vin.iii.236<em>f.</em></span> Upananda was once asked to preach to those that came to Jetavana. Among the visitors was a banker, and when the banker expressed the desire to give something to Upananda to show his appreciation of the sermon, Upananda wished to have the robe that the man wore. The banker was embarrassed, and promised to go home at once and fetch him another robe, even better than the one he had on. But Upananda was adamant, till, in despair, the man gave him his robe and went away. Again, when Upananda heard that a certain man wished to offer him a robe, he went to the man and told him what kind of robe he wanted, and said he would accept no other. <span class='ref'>Vin.iii.215</span> A story is also told of a Paribbājaka exchanging his own garment for one belonging to Upananda, which was of rich colour.

Upāli undertook to go himself to the Buddha and refute his views, in spite of the protestations of Dīgha-Tapassī. At the end of his discussion with the Buddha, which is recorded in the Upāli Sutta, Upāli is converted and invites the Buddha to a meal. Although the Buddha enjoins upon Upāli that his benefactions to the Nigaṇṭhas should not cease because of his conversion, Upāli gives instructions that no Nigaṇṭha be admitted to his presence, but that if they need food it shall be given to them. Hearing a rumour of his conversion, first Tapassī, and later Nāṭaputta himself, go to Upāli’s house, where they learn the truth.

devadatta	Devadatta	Devadatta	<dd><p>A monk, a close relative of the Buddha, who split the Sangha, and attempted to overthrow the Buddha and have him murdered. In one passage in the Vinaya, <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.189</span> Devadatta is spoken of as Godhiputta, the son of Godhi.</p><p>When the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu after the Enlightenment and preached to the Sākiyans, Devadatta was converted together with his friends Ānanda, Bhagu, Kimbila, Bhaddiya, Anuruddha, and their barber, Upāli, and he sought the Buddha at Anupiya and entered the Order. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.182</span> During the rainy season that followed, Devadatta acquired the power of <i>iddhi</i> possible to those who are yet of the world <i>puthujjānika-<i>iddhi</i></i>. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.183</span> Sāriputta is mentioned as having gone about Rājagaha singing Devadatta’s praises. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.189</span> Devadatta was later suspected of evil wishes. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.156</span> About eight years before the Buddha’s death, Devadatta, eager for gain and favour and jealous of the Buddha’s fame, attempted to win over Ajātasattu. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.184<em>ff.</em></span> <span class='ref'>Vin.iii.171<em>f.</em></span> <span class='ref'>Vin.iii.174<em>f.</em></span> <span class='ref'>Vin.iv.71</span> <span class='ref'>AN.iii.123</span> <span class='ref'>AN.iii.402</span> <span class='ref'>AN.ii.73</span> <span class='ref'>AN.iv.160</span></p><p>He assumed the form of a child having a girdle of snakes, and suddenly appeared on Ajātasattu’s lap, frightening him. He then resumed his own form, and Ajātasattu, much impressed, paid him great honour and, it is said, visited him morning and evening with five hundred chariots and sent him daily five hundred dishes of food.</p><p>Sometime later, Devadatta went to the Buddha and suggested that the leadership of the Order should be handed over to him in view of the Buddha’s approaching old age. The Buddha scorned the suggestion, saying, “Not even to Sāriputta or Moggallāna would I hand over the Order, and would I then to thee, vile one, to be vomited like spittle?” <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.188</span> <span class='ref'>MN.i.393</span> Devadatta showed great resentment and vowed vengeance. Thereupon, at the Buddha’s suggestion, a proclamation was issued to the Saṅgha that in anything done by Devadatta in the name of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saṅgha, none but Devadatta was to be recognised.</p><p>It was at this time that Devadatta incited Ajātasattu to kill his father, Bimbisāra, while he himself prepared to kill the Buddha. Ajātasattu agreed, and provided Devadatta with royal archers to shoot the Buddha. These were placed on different paths, one on one path, two on another, and so on up to sixteen, and the plan was so laid that not one of them would survive to tell the tale. But when the Buddha approached the first man, he was terrified by the Buddha’s majesty, and his body became stiff. The Buddha spoke kindly to him, and the man, throwing away his weapons, confessed his intended crime. The Buddha thereupon preached to him and, having converted him, sent him back by a different path. The other groups of archers, tired of waiting, gave up the vigil and went away one after the other. The different groups were led to the Buddha by his <i>iddhi</i>-power, and he preached to them and converted them. The first man returned to Devadatta saying that he was unable to kill the Buddha because of his great <i>iddhi</i>-power.</p><p>Devadatta then decided to kill the Buddha himself. One day, when the Buddha was walking on the slopes of Gijjhakūṭa, he hurled down on him a great rock. Two peaks sprang up from the ground, thereby arresting its rushing advance, but a splinter struck the Buddha’s foot, causing the blood to flow. Being in great pain, he was carried to Maddakucchi, and from there to Jīvaka’s Ambavana, where Jīvaka attended him. After this event, the monks wished the Buddha to have a guard, but this he refused, saying that it was impossible for anyone to deprive a Tathāgata of his life.</p><p>Devadatta’s next attempt on the Buddha’s life was to persuade elephant-keepers to let loose a fierce elephant, Nalāgiri (or Dhanapāla), drunk with toddy, on to the road by which the Buddha would pass. The news spread rapidly, and the Buddha was warned, but refused to turn back.

Proclamation was made, by the beating of drums, that the streets of the city should be cleared as Nālāgiri would be let loose upon them. When the Buddha was informed of this and warned against going into the city for alms, he ignored the warning, and went into Rājagaha with the monks of the eighteen monasteries of the city. At the sight of Nālāgiri all the people fled in terror. Ānanda, seeing the elephant advancing towards the Buddha, went, in spite of the Buddha’s orders to the contrary, and stood in front of the Buddha, who had to make use of his supernatural power to remove him from his place. The Buddha spoke to him, suffusing him with all the love at his command, and, stretching out his right hand, he stroked the animal’s forehead.

One of six eminent teachers, contemporary with the Buddha; he is described as a outsider. <span class='ref'>SN.i.66</span></p><p>He was leader of a sect known as the Nigaṇṭhā, and a summary of his teachings is found in the Sāmaññaphala Sutta. <span class='ref'>DN.i.57</span></p><p>Nāṭaputta is stated to have claimed omniscience—to be all-knowing, all seeing, to have all comprising knowledge and vision. “Whether I walk or stand or sleep or wake,” he is mentioned as saying, “my knowledge and vision are always, and without a break, present before me.” <span class='ref'>MN.ii.31</span> <span class='ref'>AN.i.220</span> <span class='ref'>MN.i.92<em>f.</em></span> <span class='ref'>MN.ii.214<em>ff.</em></span> It is curious, in view of this statement of Nāṭaputta’s doctrine of inaction, that the main ground on which he is stated to have objected to Sīha’s visit to the Buddha, was that the Buddha was an akiriyavādī. <span class='ref'>AN.iv.180</span></p><p>He taught that past deeds should be extirpated by severe austerities, fresh deeds should be avoided by inaction. By expelling through penance all past misdeeds and by not committing fresh misdeeds, the future became cleared. From the destruction of deeds results the destruction of dukkha; this leads to the destruction of vedanā. Thus all dukkha is exhausted and one passes beyond the round of existence. It is said that Nāṭaputta did not employ the term kamma in his teaching; he used, instead, the word daṇḍa; and that, according to him, the daṇḍa of deed was far more criminal than the dandas of word and mind. <span class='ref'>MN.i.371</span></p><p>He is said to have shown no hesitation in declaring the destinies of his disciples after death <span class='ref'>SN.iv.398</span> ; but Sakuludāyi says <span class='ref'>MN.ii.31</span> <span class='ref'>MN.i.93</span> <span class='ref'>MN.ii.214<em>f.</em></span> that when asked a question as to the past, he skipped from one matter to another and dismissed the question, evincing irritation, bad temper and resentment.</p><p>Only one discussion is recorded between Nāṭaputta and a follower of the Buddha, and that was with Citta gahapati at Macchika Sanda. <span class='ref'>SN.iv.298<em>ff.</em></span> He praises Citta at the outset of the discussion, holding him up as an example to his own flock, and agreeing with Citta that knowledge is more excellent than faith. But later, when Citta claims knowledge of the four <i>jhānas</i>, Nāṭaputta is represented as condemning him for a deceitful man. Citta, thereupon, asks him ten questions and, getting no answer, leaves him.</p><p>The Devadaha Sutta <span class='ref'>MN.ii.214</span> <span class='ref'>MN.i.91<em>ff.</em></span> <span class='ref'>AN.v.150</span> <span class='ref'>DN.iii.119</span> contains a detailed analysis and attributed to the Buddha, of the beliefs and teachings of the Nigaṇṭhas. He there selects for his condemnation ten of their operative utterances, major and minor, and proves that the efforts and strivings of the Nigaṇṭhas are fruitless.</p><p>The books contain the names of several disciples of Nāṭaputta, among them a deva called Ninka. <span class='ref'>SN.i.66</span> Nāṭaputta is so convinced of the truth and the irrefutableness of his own doctrines, that he actually encourages his disciples to hold discussions with the Buddha. Some, like Dīgha Tapassī, come away unscathed, without having carried the discussion to any conclusion; others are mentioned as being convinced by the Buddha in the end and as becoming his disciples. Such, for instance, are Asibandhakaputta <span class='ref'>SN.iv.317<em>ff.</em></span> and Abhayarājakumāra. <span class='ref'>MN.i.392<em>ff.</em></span> Nāṭaputta tries, without success, to dissuade Sīha, general of the Licchavis, from visiting the Buddha. <span class='ref'>AN.iv.180<em>ff.</em></span> Sīha goes and is converted. The next day he holds an almsgiving, on a grand scale, to the Buddha and his monks, at which flesh is served. It is said that Nāṭaputta went about Vesāli, sneering at the Buddha for encouraging slaughter. <span class='ref'>Vin.i.233<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>But the greatest blow to Nāṭaputta was when Upāli-gahapati <span class='ref'>MN.i.373<em>ff.</em></span> joined the Buddha. Nāṭaputta had allowed Upāli to visit him in spite of the warning of Dīgha-Tapassī as to the Buddha’s arresting personality. But Nāṭaputta thought Upāli would be proof against it, and, on hearing that he had renounced his allegiance to the Nigaṇṭhas, refused to believe it until he could verify the information himself. The discovery of the apostasy of Upāli prostrated him with grief.; he vomited hot blood and had to be carried away on a litter from Bālaka, where he was then living, to Pāvā. There, soon after, he died, and immediately great dissensions arose among his followers. When the Buddha heard of the quarrels, he remarked that it was only to be expected. <span class='ref'>MN.ii.243<em>f.</em></span> <span class='ref'>DN.iii.117</span> <span class='ref'>DN.iii.210</span></p><p>Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta is the name by which the Jaina teacher, Mahāvīra, was known to his contemporaries.

In the Sāmaññaphala Sutta, <span class='ref'>DN.i.56</span> Ajātasattu is said to have visited him and obtained from him an exposition of his teaching, which was to the effect that the four elements—earth, fire, air, water; pleasure, pain, and the soul—these seven things were eternally existent and unchangeable in their very nature; that there is no volitional activity of consciousness in them. His doctrine is, therefore, one of non action. When one, with a sharp sword, cleaves a head in twain, no one is thereby deprived of life, a sword has merely penetrated into the interval between seven elementary substances. In other words, there is no such act as killing, or hearing, or knowing, etc.; no conceptions of, or distinction between, good and bad, knowledge and ignorance, etc.</p><p>Pakudha’s teachings are also referred to in the Sandaka Sutta, <span class='ref'>MN.i.517</span> and there described at even greater length, but here his name is not mentioned.</p><p>We are told <span class='ref'>MN.i.250</span> <span class='ref'>MN.ii.4</span> that Pakudha’s followers did not hold him in high esteem, in contrast to the devotion felt for the Buddha by his followers.

paribbājakā	Paribbājakā	Paribbājakā	<dd><p>Wanderer. The name given to some of the ascetics and recluses of the Buddha’s time. They were not exclusively brahmin. Their presence seems to have been recognized and respected from earlier times. Generally speaking, their creed is formulated as a belief in perfect bliss after death for the self purged from evil, and as a conviction that this bliss can be won by brahmacariyā, by freedom from all evil in acts, words, aims, and mode of livelihood. <span class='ref'>MN.ii.24</span></p><p>All these four standards of conduct were bodily incorporated in the Buddha’s Noble Eightfold Path, and the last of the four gave to the Ājīvakas their specific name as a separate sect. The Paribbājakas claimed to be identical with the followers of the Buddha in their tenets and teaching, <span class='ref'>MN.i.64f</span> <span class='ref'>MN.i.84<em>f.</em></span> but the Buddha maintained that the two teachings were quite distinct. This is clearly indicated <span class='ref'>Vin.i.39</span> in connection with the conversion of Sāriputta and Moggallāna, who were Paribbājakas under Sañjaya. The goal of the Paribbājakas was deathlessness which, to them, probably meant birth in the world of Brahmā. Their conversion to the Buddha’s Doctrine followed the recognition that Gotama dealt, not with effects but with causes, and that he went to the root of the matter by teaching how casual states of consciousness arose and how they could be banished for ever. <span class='ref'>AN.iv.35<em>ff.</em></span> <span class='ref'>AN.iv.378</span> <span class='ref'>AN.i.215</span></p><p>The Paribbājakas were not ascetics except in so far as they were celibates; some of them were women. They were teachers or sophists who spent eight or nine months of every year wandering from place to place for the purpose of engaging in friendly, conversational discussions on matters of ethics and philosophy, nature lore and mysticism. They differed very much in intelligence, earnestness, and even in honesty. Some of the views discussed in the Brahmajāla Sutta, for instance, and described as those of “Eel wrigglers” and “Hair splitters”, were undoubtedly truly thus described.

Later, the Buddha visited the hermitage of Pātikaputta, with a large following, in order to refute his claims, but Pātikaputta avoided him and went to the Tindukhānuparibbājakārāma. A message was sent to him asking him to come as the Buddha was at his hermitage, but Pātikaputta was unable to arise from his seat. Thereupon, a Licchavi minister, and, after him, Jāliya Dārupattikantevāsī, went to fetch him, but on discovering that he could not rise, they reviled him for his boastfulness. <span class='ref'>AN.iii.13<em>ff.</em></span></p></dd>	patikaputta	AN.iii.13<em>ff.</em>	AN.iii.13

He mentioned that once five hundred carts had passed by where Āḷāra sat, and yet so deep was he in meditation that he had failed to notice them. The Buddha told him how, when he himself was in Atumā in the Bhusāgāra, there was a great thunderstorm which killed two peasants and four oxen, but that he had heard and seen nothing, so deep was his concentration. Pukkusa was greatly impressed by this statement, and, having declared himself a follower of the Buddha, he gave to the Buddha two robes of cloth of gold, one of which, at the Buddha’s suggestion, he handed to Ānanda. When Pukkusa had left, Ānanda draped one robe over the Buddha, and was greatly astonished at its pale appearance in comparison with the deep gold of the Buddha’s body. <span class='ref'>DN.ii.130<em>ff.</em></span></p></dd>	pukkusa	DN.ii.130<em>ff.</em>	DN.ii.130

Bāvarī was greatly distressed, but a <i>devatā</i>, seeing his trouble, reassured him by saying that the brahmin knew neither the meaning of “head” nor of “the splitting of it.” “Who then knows it?” asked Bāvarī, and the <i>devatā</i> told him of the appearance in the world of the Buddha. Forthwith he sent his sixteen pupils—Ajita, Tissametteyya, Puṇṇaka, Mettagū, Dhotaka, Upasīva, Nanda, Hemaka, Todeyya, Kappa, Jatukaṇṇī, Bhadrāvudha, Udaya, Posāla, Mogharāja and Piṅgiya to Sāvatthī to see the Buddha and to find out if his claims to Buddha-hood were justified.

He was followed by his five hundred colleagues, and when they had all worshipped the feet disappeared and the pyre kindled of itself. <span class='ref'>DN.ii.163<em>f.</em></span></p><p>At Pāvā (on the announcement of the Buddha’s death), Kassapa had heard the words of Subhadda, who, in his old age, had joined the Order, that they were “well rid of the great samaṇa and could now do as they liked.” This remark it was which had suggested to Kassapa’s mind the desirability of holding a Recital of the Buddha’s teachings. The five hundred who were selected met in Council under the presidency of Kassapa and recited the Dhamma and the Vinaya.</p><p>The books contain numerous references to Mahā Kassapa—he is classed with Moggallāna, Kappina, and Anuruddha for his great <i>iddhi</i>-powers. <span class='ref'>SN.i.114</span></p><p>The Buddha regarded him as equal to himself in exhorting the monks to lead the active and zealous lives, <span class='ref'>SN.ii.205</span> and constantly held him up as an example to others in his great contentment <span class='ref'>SN.ii.194<em>f.</em></span> and his ability to win over families by his preaching. The Buddha compares him to the moon, unobtrusive; his heart was free from bondage, and he always taught others out of a feeling of compassion. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.197<em>ff.</em></span> The Buddha also thought him equal to himself in his power of attaining the <i>jhānas</i> and abiding therein. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.210<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>Kassapa was willing to help monks along their way, and several instances are given of his exhortations to them. <span class='ref'>Thag.1051–1057</span> <span class='ref'>Thag.1072–1081</span> <span class='ref'>AN.v.161<em>ff.</em></span> But he would not address them unless he felt them to be tractable and deferential to instruction. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.203<em>ff.</em></span> <span class='ref'>SN.ii.219</span></p><p>He was very reluctant to preach to the nuns, but on one occasion he allowed himself to be persuaded by Ānanda, and accompanied by him he visited the nunnery and preached to the nuns. He was probably not popular among certain nuns, for, at the end of his discourse, Thullatissā openly reviled him for what she called his impertinence in having dared to preach in the presence of Ānanda, “as if the needle pedlar were to sell a needle to the needle maker.”. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.215<em>f.</em></span> Kassapa was very careful of the good name of the Order, and we find him <span class='ref'>SN.ii.218<em>f.</em></span> blaming Ānanda for admitting into the Order new members incapable of observing its discipline and of going about with them in large numbers, exposing the Order to the criticism of the public. “A corn trampler art thou, Ānanda,” he says, “a despoiler of families, thy following is breaking up, thy youngsters are melting away,” and ends up with “The boy, methinks, does not know his own measure.” Ānanda, annoyed at being called “boy,” protests “Surely my head is growing grey hairs, your reverence.” Ānanda regarded Kassapa in some sort of way as a teacher, and held him in great respect, not daring to mention even his name, lest it should imply disrespect. <span class='ref'>Vin.i.92<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Thullanandā heard Kassapa censuring Ānanda and raised her voice in protest, “What now? Does Kassapa, once a heretic, deem that he can chide the learned sage Ānanda?” Kassapa was hurt by her words, and complained to Ānanda that such things should be said of him who had been singled out by the Buddha for special honour.</p><p>Kassapa viewed with concern the growing laxity among members of the Order with regard to the observance of rules, even in the very lifetime of the Buddha, and the falling off in the number of those attaining arahantship, and we find him consulting the Buddha as to what should be done. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.224<em>f.</em></span> At the First Council, when Ānanda stated that the Buddha had given leave for the monks to do away with the minor rules of the Order, Kassapa was opposed to any such step, lest it should lead to slackness among the monks and contempt from the laity. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.287<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Kassapa himself did his utmost to lead an exemplary life, dwelling in the forest, subsisting solely on alms, wearing rag robes, always content with little, holding himself aloof from society, ever strenuous and energetic. See also the Mahāgosiṅga Sutta, <span class='ref'>MN.i.214</span> where Kassapa declares his belief in the need for these observances; that his example was profitable to others is proved by the case of Somamitta who, finding his own teacher Vimala given up to laziness, sought Kassapa and attained arahantship under his guidance.</p><p>When asked why he led such a life, he replied that it was not only for his own happiness but also out of compassion for those who came after him, that they might attain to the same end. Even when he was old and the Buddha himself had asked him to give up his coarse rag robe and to dwell near him, he begged to be excused. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.202<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Once, when Kassapa lay grievously ill at Pipphaliguhā, the Buddha visited him and reminded him of the seven bojjhangas which he had practised. <span class='ref'>SN.v.78</span></p><p>Kassapa had special compassion for the poor and would sgo to the poorest families to seek alms. <span class='ref'>Ud.iii.7</span></p><p> Sāriputta seems to have held Kassapa in great esteem, and the Kassapa Saṁyutta contains two discussions between them: one on the necessity for zeal and ardour in the attainment of Nibbāna, <span class='ref'>SN.ii.195<em>f.</em></span> and the other on the existence of a Tathāgata after death. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.222<em>f.</em></span> This regard was mutual, for when Kassapa saw the great honour paid to Sāriputta by the devas he rejoiced greatly and broke forth into song. <span class='ref'>Thag.1082–1085</span></p></dd>	mahakassapa	Thag.1082–1085	Thag.1082

Dūsī incited the householders against Kakusandha Buddha and was, as a result, born in purgatory.</p><p>Moggallāna could see petas and other spirits invisible to the ordinary mortal eye. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.254<em>ff.</em></span> We are told <span class='ref'>SN.v.366<em>f.</em></span> that Moggallāna’s visits to the deva worlds were very welcome to the devas.</p><p>The Buddha paid a compliment to Moggallāna’s powers of preaching, when, having preached himself to the Sākyans in their new Mote Hall at Kapilavatthu, he asked Moggallāna, after their departure, to talk to the monks, as he himself was weary. And Moggallāna spoke to them of lusts and of the means of getting rid of them. At the end of the sermon the Buddha praised him warmly. <span class='ref'>SN.iv.183<em>ff.</em></span> Mention is made elsewhere <span class='ref'>SN.iv.262–269</span> of eloquent sermons preached by him on the <i>jhānas</i>, on qualities which lead to true emancipation, <span class='ref'>AN.v.155<em>ff.</em></span> and of visits paid to him by Sakka in company with numerous other gods in order to hear him preach. Other devas also went to hear him—e.g., Candana, Suyāma, Santusita, Sunimitta and Vasavatti <span class='ref'>SN.iv.269–280</span> He was also consulted by those, such as Vacchagotta, <span class='ref'>SN.iv.391<em>ff.</em></span> and Vappa, <span class='ref'>AN.ii.196<em>ff.</em></span> eager to learn from him the teachings of the Buddha. The Buddha placed great faith in his two chief disciples and looked to them to keep the Order pure. There is one instance recorded of Moggallāna seizing a wicked monk, thrusting outside and bolting the door. <span class='ref'>AN.iv.204<em>ff.</em></span> Once, when a monk charged Sāriputta with having offended him as he was about to start on a journey, Moggallāna and Ānanda went from lodging to lodging to summon the monks that they might hear Sāriputta vindicate himself. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.236</span> <span class='ref'>AN.iv.374</span></p><p>Their fame had reached even to the Brahma world, for we find Tudu Brahmā singing their praises, much to the annoyance of the Kokālika monk.<span class='ref'>AN.v.170<em>ff.</em></span> <span class='ref'>Snp.p.231<em>ff.</em></span> When Devadatta created a schism among the monks and took five hundred of them to Gayāsīsa, the Buddha sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna to bring them back. They were successful in this mission. Kakudha Koliyaputta, once servant of Moggallāna and later born in a huge manomayakāya, had warned Moggallāna of Devadatta’s intrigues against the Buddha, but the Buddha ignored this information carried to him by Moggallāna.<span class='ref'>Vin.ii.185</span> <span class='ref'>AN.iii.122<em>ff.</em></span> Moggallāna seems to have carried out diligently the charge laid on him by the Buddha of looking after the monks’ welfare.

Vaṅgīsa witnessed this and praised Moggallāna in verse before the Buddha.</p><p>The love existing between Moggallāna and Sāriputta was mutual, as was the admiration. Sāriputta’s verses in praise of Moggallāna <span class='ref'>Thag.1178–1181</span> are even more eloquent than those of Moggallāna in praise of Sāriputta. <span class='ref'>Thag.1176</span> Their strongest bond was the love of each for the Buddha; when away from him, they would relate to each other how they had been conversing with him by means of the divine ear and the divine eye. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.275<em>ff.</em></span> Moggallāna elsewhere also <span class='ref'>SN.ii.273<em>f.</em></span> tells the monks of a conversation he held with the Buddha by means of these divine powers.

The commonest use of the word was evidently in the sense of Death. From this it was extended to mean “the world under the sway of death” <span class='ref'>AN.iv.228</span> and the beings therein. Thence, the <i>kilesas</i> also came to be called Māra in that they were instruments of Death, the causes enabling Death to hold sway over the world. All Temptations brought about by the <i>kilesas</i> were likewise regarded as the work of Death. There was also evidently a legend of a <i>devaputta</i> of the Vasavatti world, called Māra, who considered himself the head of the Kāmāvacara world and who recognized any attempt to curb the enjoyment of sensual pleasures, as a direct challenge to himself and to his authority. As time went on these different conceptions of the word became confused one with the other, but this confusion is not always difficult to unravel.</p><p>Various statements are found in the Pitakas connected with Māra, which have, obviously, reference to Death, the <i>kilesas</i>, and the world over which Death and the <i>kilesas</i> hold sway. <span class='ref'>SN.iv.91</span> <span class='ref'>SN.iii.73</span> <span class='ref'>Dhp.8</span> <span class='ref'>Dhp.40</span> <span class='ref'>SN.i.135</span></p><p>The legend of Māra attacking the Buddha to prevent his Awakening had its origin in the Padhāna Sutta. <span class='ref'>Snp.494–517</span> There Māra is represented as visiting Gotama on the banks of the Nerañjara, where he is practicing austerities and tempting him to abandon his striving and devote himself to good works. Gotama refers to Māra’s army as being tenfold. The divisions are as follows: the first consists of the Lusts; the second is Aversion; the third Hunger and Thirst; the fourth Craving; the fifth Sloth and Indolence; the sixth Cowardice; the seventh Doubt; the eighth Hypocrisy and Stupidity; Gains, Fame, Honour and Glory falsely obtained form the ninth; and the tenth is the Lauding of oneself and the Contemning of others. “Seeing this army on all sides,” says the Buddha, “I go forth to meet Māra with his equipage. He shall not make me yield ground. That army of thine, which the world of devas and men conquers not, even that, with my wisdom, will I smite, as an unbaked earthen bowl with a stone.” Here we have practically all the elements found in the later elaborated versions.</p><p>The second part of the Padhāna Sutta <span class='ref'>Snp.446<em>f.</em></span> <span class='ref'>SN.i.122</span> is obviously concerned with later events in the life of Gotama. After Māra had retired discomfited, he followed the Buddha for seven years, watching for any transgression on his part. But the quest was in vain, and, “like a crow attacking a rock,” he left Gotama in disgust. “The lute of Māra, who was so overcome with grief, slipped from his arm. Then, in dejection, the Yakkha disappeared thence.”</p><p>The Saṁyutta Nikāya <span class='ref'>SN.i.124<em>f.</em></span> <span class='ref'>AN.v.46</span> also contains a sutta in which three daughters of Māra are represented as tempting the Buddha after his Enlightenment. Their names are Taṇhā, Arati and Ragā, and they are evidently personifications of three of the ten forces in Māra’s army, as given in the Padhāna Sutta. They assume numerous forms of varying age and charm, full of blandishment, but their attempt is vain, and they are obliged to admit defeat.</p><p>Once Māra came to be regarded as the Spirit of Evil all temptations of lust, fear, greed, etc., were regarded as his activities, and Māra was represented as assuming various disguises in order to carry out his nefarious plans.

The commonest use of the word was evidently in the sense of Death. From this it was extended to mean “the world under the sway of death” <span class='ref'>AN.iv.228</span> and the beings therein. Thence, the <i>kilesas</i> also came to be called Māra in that they were instruments of Death, the causes enabling Death to hold sway over the world. All Temptations brought about by the <i>kilesas</i> were likewise regarded as the work of Death. There was also evidently a legend of a <i>devaputta</i> of the Vasavatti world, called Māra, who considered himself the head of the Kāmāvacara world and who recognized any attempt to curb the enjoyment of sensual pleasures, as a direct challenge to himself and to his authority. As time went on these different conceptions of the word became confused one with the other, but this confusion is not always difficult to unravel.</p><p>Various statements are found in the Pitakas connected with Māra, which have, obviously, reference to Death, the <i>kilesas</i>, and the world over which Death and the <i>kilesas</i> hold sway. <span class='ref'>SN.iv.91</span> <span class='ref'>SN.iii.73</span> <span class='ref'>Dhp.8</span> <span class='ref'>Dhp.40</span> <span class='ref'>SN.i.135</span></p><p>The legend of Māra attacking the Buddha to prevent his Awakening had its origin in the Padhāna Sutta. <span class='ref'>Snp.494–517</span> There Māra is represented as visiting Gotama on the banks of the Nerañjara, where he is practicing austerities and tempting him to abandon his striving and devote himself to good works. Gotama refers to Māra’s army as being tenfold. The divisions are as follows: the first consists of the Lusts; the second is Aversion; the third Hunger and Thirst; the fourth Craving; the fifth Sloth and Indolence; the sixth Cowardice; the seventh Doubt; the eighth Hypocrisy and Stupidity; Gains, Fame, Honour and Glory falsely obtained form the ninth; and the tenth is the Lauding of oneself and the Contemning of others. “Seeing this army on all sides,” says the Buddha, “I go forth to meet Māra with his equipage. He shall not make me yield ground. That army of thine, which the world of devas and men conquers not, even that, with my wisdom, will I smite, as an unbaked earthen bowl with a stone.” Here we have practically all the elements found in the later elaborated versions.</p><p>The second part of the Padhāna Sutta <span class='ref'>Snp.446<em>f.</em></span> <span class='ref'>SN.i.122</span> is obviously concerned with later events in the life of Gotama. After Māra had retired discomfited, he followed the Buddha for seven years, watching for any transgression on his part. But the quest was in vain, and, “like a crow attacking a rock,” he left Gotama in disgust. “The lute of Māra, who was so overcome with grief, slipped from his arm. Then, in dejection, the Yakkha disappeared thence.”</p><p>The Saṁyutta Nikāya <span class='ref'>SN.i.124<em>f.</em></span> <span class='ref'>AN.v.46</span> also contains a sutta in which three daughters of Māra are represented as tempting the Buddha after his Enlightenment. Their names are Taṇhā, Arati and Ragā, and they are evidently personifications of three of the ten forces in Māra’s army, as given in the Padhāna Sutta. They assume numerous forms of varying age and charm, full of blandishment, but their attempt is vain, and they are obliged to admit defeat.</p><p>Once Māra came to be regarded as the Spirit of Evil all temptations of lust, fear, greed, etc., were regarded as his activities, and Māra was represented as assuming various disguises in order to carry out his nefarious plans. Thus the books mention various occasions on which Māra appeared before the Buddha himself and his disciples, men and women, to lure them away from their chosen path.</p><p>Soon after the Buddha’s first vassa, Māra approached him and asked him not to teach the monks regarding the highest emancipation, he himself being yet bound by Māra’s fetters. But the Buddha replied that he was free of all fetters, human and divine. <span class='ref'>Vin.i.22</span> On another occasion Māra entered into the body of Vetambarī and made him utter heretical doctrines. <span class='ref'>SN.i.67</span> In the Brahmanimantanika Sutta. <span class='ref'>MN.i.326</span> Māra is spoken of as entering the hearts even of the inhabitants of the Brahma world. The Māra Saṁyutta <span class='ref'>SN.i.103<em>ff.</em></span> contains several instances of Māra’s temptations of the Buddha by assailing him with doubts as to his emancipation, feelings of fear and dread, appearing before him in the shape of an elephant, a cobra, in various guises beautiful and ugly, making the rocks of Gijjhakūṭa fall with a crash; by making him wonder whether he should ever sleep; by suggesting that, as human life was long, there was no need for haste in living the good life; by dulling the intelligence of his hearers. <span class='ref'>DN.iii.58</span> In the account of Godhika’s suicide <span class='ref'>SN.i.122</span> there is a curious statement that, after Godhika died, Māra went about looking for his consciousness, and the Buddha pointed him out to the monks, “going about like a cloud of smoke.”</p><p>The books mention many occasions on which Māra assumed various forms under which to tempt bhikkhunīs, often in lonely spots—e.g., Āḷavikā, Kisāgotamī, Somā, Vijayā, Uppalavantnā, Cālā, Upacālā, Sisūpacālā, Selā, Vajirā and Khemā.</p><p>Mention is made, especially in the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta, of several occasions on which Māra approached the Buddha, requesting him to die; the first of these occasions was under the Ajapala Banyan tree at Uruvelā, soon after the Enlightenment, but the Buddha refused to die until the sāsana was firmly established.</p><p>With the accounts of Māra, as the personification of Evil, came to be mixed legends of an actual <i>devaputta</i>, named Māra, also called Vasavatti, because he was an inhabitant of the Paranimmitā Vasavatti deva world. In the Aṅguttara Nikāya, Māra is described as the head of those enjoying bliss in the Kāmāvacara worlds. <span class='ref'>AN.ii.17</span> In the Māratajjanīya Sutta <span class='ref'>MN.i.333</span> <span class='ref'>DN.iii.79</span> Moggallāna says that he too had once been a Māra, Dūsī by name; Kālā was his sister’s name, and the Māra of the present age was his nephew. In the sutta, Dūsī is spoken of as having been responsible for many acts of mischief, similar to those ascribed to the Māra of Gotama’s day. According to the sutta, Māradevaputta was evidently regarded as a being of great power, with a strong bent for mischief, especially directed against holy men.</p></dd>	mara	DN.iii.79	DN.iii.79

yakkha	Yakkha	Yakkha	<dd><p>A class of non human beings generally described as non-human. They are mentioned with Devas, Rakkhasas, Dānavas, Gandhabbas, Kinnaras, and Mahoragas (? Nāgas).</p><p>Elsewhere <span class='ref'>AN.ii.38</span> they rank, in progressive order, between <i>manussā</i> and <i>gandhabbā</i>. They are of many different kinds: spirits, ogres, dryads, ghosts, spooks. In the early records, <i>yakkha</i>, like <i>nāga</i>, as an appellative, was anything but depreciative. Thus not only is Sakka, king of the gods, so referred to, <span class='ref'>MN.i.252</span> but even the Buddha is spoken of as a <i>yakkha</i> in poetic diction. <span class='ref'>MN.i.386</span> Many gods, such as Kakudha, are so addressed. <span class='ref'>SN.i.54</span> Of these above named, the followers of Vessavaṇa appear to be the Yakkhas proper. The term <i>yakkha</i> as applied to <i>purisa</i> is evidently used in an exceptionally philosophical sense as meaning “soul” in such passages as ettāvatā yakkhassa suddhi, <span class='ref'>Snp.478</span> or <i>ettāvat’ aggam no vadanti h’ ekā, yakkhassa suddhim idha paṇḍitāse</i>. <span class='ref'>Snp.875</span></p><p>The cult of <i>yakkhas</i> seems to have arisen primarily from the woods and secondarily from the legends of sea faring merchants. To the latter origin belong the stories connected with vimānas found in or near the sea or in lakes. Generally speaking, the Yakkhas were decadent divinities, beings half deified, having a deva’s supernormal powers, particularly as regards influencing people, partly helpful, partly harmful. They are sometimes called <i>devatā</i> <span class='ref'>SN.i.205</span> or <i>devaputta</i>. Some of these, like Indakūta and Sūciloma, are capable of intelligent questioning on metaphysics and ethics. All of them possess supernatural powers; they can transfer themselves at will, to any place, with their abodes, and work miracles, such as assuming any shape at will.</p><p>Sometimes the Yakkhas have been degraded to the state of red eyed cannibal ogres. The female Yakkhas (Yakkhinī) are, in these cases, more fearful and evil minded than the male. They eat flesh and blood and devour even men. <span class='ref'>DN.ii.346</span></p><p>Ordinarily the attitude of the Yakkhas towards man is one of benevolence. They are interested in the spiritual welfare of the human beings with whom they come in contact and somewhat resemble tutelary genii. In the Āṭānāṭiya Sutta, <span class='ref'>DN.iii.194<em>f.</em></span> however, the Yakkha king, Vessavaṇa, is represented as telling the Buddha that, for the most part, the Yakkhas believe neither in the Buddha nor in his teachings, which enjoin upon his followers abstention from various evils and are therefore distasteful to some of the Yakkhas. Such Yakkhas are disposed to molest the followers of the Buddha in their woodland haunts. Cp. the story of the Yakkha who wished to kill Sāriputta. <span class='ref'>Ud.iv.4</span> But the Mahā Yakkhas, <span class='ref'>DN.iii.204<em>f.</em></span> the generals and commanders among Yakkhas, are always willing to help holy men and to prevent wicked Yakkhas from hurting them. Among Yakkhas are some beings who are <i>sotāpannas</i>—e.g., Janavasabha, Sūciloma and Khara. The case of the Yakkha Vajirapāṇi is of special interest. <i>D.i.95</i> He is represented as a kind of mentor, hovering in the air, threatening to kill Ambaṭṭha, if he does not answer the Buddha’s question the third time he is asked. In many cases the Yakkhas are “fallen angels” and come eagerly to listen to the word of the Buddha in order to be able to rise to a higher sphere of existence e.g., Piyaṅkaramātā and Punabbasumātā, and even Vessavaṇa, listening to Veḷukaṇḍakī Nandamātā reciting the Parāyana Vagga. <span class='ref'>AN.iv.63</span> At the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta many hundreds of thousands of Yakkhas were present among the audience.</p><p>The names of the Yakkhas often give us a clue to their origin and function. These are taken from (a) their bodily appearance e.g., Kuvannā, Khara, Kharaloma, Kharadāthika, Citta, Cittarāja, Silesaloma, Sūciloma and Hāritā; (b) their place of residence, attributes of their realms, animals, plants, etc. e.g., Ajakalāpaka, Āḷavaka (forest dweller), Uppala, Kakudha (name of plant), Kumbhīra, Gumbiya, Disāmukha, Yamamoli, Vajira, Vajirapāṇi or Vajirabāhu, Sātāgira, Serīsaka; (c) qualities of character, etc. e.g., Adhamma, Katattha, Dhamma, Puṇṇaka, Māra, Sakaṭa; (d) embodiments of former persons e.g., Janavasabha (lord of men= Bimbisāra), Dīgha, Naradeva, Paṇḍaka, Sīvaka, Serī.</p><p>Vessavaṇa is often mentioned as king of the Yakkhas. He is one of the four Regent Gods, and the Āṭānāṭiya Sutta <span class='ref'>DN.iii.199<em>ff.</em></span> contains a vivid description of the Yakkha kingdom of Uttarakuru, with its numerous cities, crowds of inhabitants, parks, lakes and assembly halls. Vessavaṇa is also called Kuvera, and the Yakkhas are his servants and messengers. They wait upon him in turn.</p><p>No one, apparently, is free from this necessity of waiting upon the king even Janavasabba has to run errands for Vessavaṇa. <span class='ref'>DN.ii.207</span> The Yakkhas hold regular assemblies. <span class='ref'>DN.iii.201</span></p><p>It is sometimes difficult to decide whether the Yakkhas were non-humans spirits or aboriginal tribespeople.

yakkha	Yakkha	Yakkha	<dd><p>A class of non human beings generally described as non-human. They are mentioned with Devas, Rakkhasas, Dānavas, Gandhabbas, Kinnaras, and Mahoragas (? Nāgas).</p><p>Elsewhere <span class='ref'>AN.ii.38</span> they rank, in progressive order, between <i>manussā</i> and <i>gandhabbā</i>. They are of many different kinds: spirits, ogres, dryads, ghosts, spooks. In the early records, <i>yakkha</i>, like <i>nāga</i>, as an appellative, was anything but depreciative. Thus not only is Sakka, king of the gods, so referred to, <span class='ref'>MN.i.252</span> but even the Buddha is spoken of as a <i>yakkha</i> in poetic diction. <span class='ref'>MN.i.386</span> Many gods, such as Kakudha, are so addressed. <span class='ref'>SN.i.54</span> Of these above named, the followers of Vessavaṇa appear to be the Yakkhas proper. The term <i>yakkha</i> as applied to <i>purisa</i> is evidently used in an exceptionally philosophical sense as meaning “soul” in such passages as ettāvatā yakkhassa suddhi, <span class='ref'>Snp.478</span> or <i>ettāvat’ aggam no vadanti h’ ekā, yakkhassa suddhim idha paṇḍitāse</i>. <span class='ref'>Snp.875</span></p><p>The cult of <i>yakkhas</i> seems to have arisen primarily from the woods and secondarily from the legends of sea faring merchants. To the latter origin belong the stories connected with vimānas found in or near the sea or in lakes. Generally speaking, the Yakkhas were decadent divinities, beings half deified, having a deva’s supernormal powers, particularly as regards influencing people, partly helpful, partly harmful. They are sometimes called <i>devatā</i> <span class='ref'>SN.i.205</span> or <i>devaputta</i>. Some of these, like Indakūta and Sūciloma, are capable of intelligent questioning on metaphysics and ethics. All of them possess supernatural powers; they can transfer themselves at will, to any place, with their abodes, and work miracles, such as assuming any shape at will.</p><p>Sometimes the Yakkhas have been degraded to the state of red eyed cannibal ogres. The female Yakkhas (Yakkhinī) are, in these cases, more fearful and evil minded than the male. They eat flesh and blood and devour even men. <span class='ref'>DN.ii.346</span></p><p>Ordinarily the attitude of the Yakkhas towards man is one of benevolence.

yasa 	Yasa2	Yasa	<dd><p>A monk who lived about a century after the Buddha, and who was one of the leaders in the events of the Second Council. When he arrived at the Kūṭāgārasālā in the Mahāvana, he discovered that the Vajjian monks had raised the “Ten Points” contrary to the Buddha’s teachings, and that they were publicly asking for money from their lay disciples. Yasa thereupon protested against such misdemeanours, and the Vajjian monks, hoping to win him over, offered him a share of the money they had collected.</p><p>This offer he rejected with scorn, and the monks passed on him the <i>Patisārattiyakamma</i> (craving of pardon from lay folk). This necessitated that Yasa should be sent among the laymen, accompanied by a messenger, presumably to ask their pardon for having misinformed them. But instead of this, Yasa told the lay people that the behaviour of the Vajjian monks was completely at variance with the rules laid down by the Buddha, and quoted the Buddha’s discourses to prove his charge.</p><p>When the Vajjian monks heard of this, they pronounced on him the <i>Ukkhepaniyakamma</i> (Act of Suspension), but when they assembled to carry it out, Yasa disappeared through the air to Kosambī, from where he sent messengers to the monks of Avanti, of the west (Pātheyyakā or Pāveyyakā) and of the south (Dakkhiṇāpatha), asking for their assistance in checking the corruption of the religion. With them he visited Sambhūta Sānavāsī at Ahogangapabbata, and there they decided to consult Revata who lived in Soreyya. Yasa, therefore, went to Revata, following him through Saṅkassa, Kaṇṇakujja, Udumbara, Aggalapura and Sahajāti. Having found Revata, he questioned him regarding the ten points, and obtained from him promise of assistance.</p><p>Together they returned to Vesāli, where lived Sabbakāmī, the oldest Thera of the day. After obtaining his opinion on the matter, an assembly of the monks was held and a committee was appointed of four from the East: Sabbakāmī, Sāḷha, Khujjasobhita, and Vāsabhagāmika; and four from the West: Revata, Sambhūta-Sānavāsī, Yasa and Sumana. They debated the question at the Vālikārāma, Revata acting as questioner and Sabbakāmī answering his questions. At the end of the enquiry the decision was given against the ten points of the Vajjian monks, and this decision was conveyed to the assembly. Then the recital of the Vinaya was held in which seven hundred monks participated; this recital was called the Sattasatī. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.294<em>ff.</em></span></p></dd>	yasa 	Vin.ii.294<em>ff.</em>	Vin.ii.294

There the monks met him and consulted him regarding the “Ten Points.</p><p>He enquired into these, and, after condemning them as wrong, decided to end the dispute. The Vajjiputtakas, too, had tried to win Revata over to their side, but on failing to do so, persuaded Revata’s pupil, Uttara, to accept robes, etc., from them, and speak to his teacher on their behalf. Uttara did this, but was dismissed by Revata as an unworthy pupil.</p><p>Revata suggested that the dispute should be settled in Vesāli, and the monks having agreed, he visited Sabbakāmī—who was the oldest monk then living and a pupil of Ānanda—during the night, and talked to him on matters of doctrine. During the conversation, Sānavāsī arrived and questioned Sabbakāmī regarding the Ten Points, but the latter refused to express an opinion in private. On Revata’s suggestion a jury of eight, four from either side, was appointed to go into the question. Revata himself was a member of this jury, and he it was who questioned Sabbakāmī during the meeting, held in Vālikārāma, regarding the Ten Points. All the Ten Points were declared to be wrong, and, at the end of the questions, seven hundred monks—chosen from one hundred and twelve thousand, at the head of whom was Revata—held a recital of the Dhamma, which recital therefore came to be called Sattasatī. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.299<em>ff.</em></span></p></dd>	revata	Vin.ii.299<em>ff.</em>	Vin.ii.299

Lohicca visited Kaccāna and discussed with him these statements, and, at the end of the talk, declared himself Kaccāna’s follower. <span class='ref'>SN.iv.117<em>ff.</em></span></p></dd>	lohicca	SN.iv.117<em>ff.</em>	SN.iv.117

He once conceived the idea that a samaṇa or recluse who had reached a good state of mind should tell no one else of it, lest he should entangle himself in new bonds. When the Buddha went to Sālāvatikā Lohicca sent the barber, Bhesikā, to invite the Buddha and the monks in his name. The Buddha accepted the invitation, and, at the end of the meal, questioned Lohicca regarding his views. At the end of the discussion Lohicca became the Buddha’s follower. <span class='ref'>DN.i.224<em>ff.</em></span></p></dd>	lohicca	DN.i.224<em>ff.</em>	DN.i.224

His imperfections are numerous: in spite of his very great age, he is still subject to death and rebirth <span class='ref'>AN.i.144</span> ; as an example of this, it is mentioned that Sunetta had thirty five times been reborn as Sakka, <span class='ref'>AN.iv.105</span> a statement confirmed by the Buddha. <span class='ref'>AN.iv.89</span></p><p>In the Sakkapañha Sutta, Sakka is said to have visited the Buddha at Vediyagiri in Ambasaṇḍā and to have asked him a series of questions.

It is stated in the course of the sutta <span class='ref'>DN.ii.270</span> that it was not the first time that Sakka had approached the Buddha for the same purpose. He had gone to him at the Salaghara in Sāvatthī, but found him in meditation, with Bhuñjatī, wife of Vessavaṇa, waiting on him. He therefore left with a request to Bhuñjatī to greet the Buddha in his name.

One day he saw Dhānañjānī trip up, and heard her exclaim three times, “Glory to the Buddha, the arahant, the all enlightened.” He blamed her for thus extolling a shovelling monk, but when she told him of the Buddha’s marvellous qualities, he felt a desire to see him. Some time after, the Buddha went to Candalakappa and stayed in Todeyya’s Mango grove. When Dhānañjānī told Saṅgārava that he was there, Saṅgārava visited him and questioned him on his views on brahmins. The Buddha said he had great regard for brahmins who had here and now won the goal, having discovered unaided a doctrine before unknown. He himself was one of these. He then proceeds to describe how he came to leave the household life and how, in due course, he won Enlightenment. Saṅgārava asks further whether there are any gods. The Buddha answers that of that there is no doubt; the whole world is in agreement on that point. Saṅgārava is pleased and accepts the Buddha as his teacher. <span class='ref'>MN.ii.209<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>The Saṁyutta <span class='ref'>SN.i.182<em>f.</em></span> mentions a Saṅgārava who is perhaps distinct from the above. He lived in Sāvatthī and was a “bath ritualist,” believing in purification by water, bathing morning and evening. The Buddha, at Ānanda’s request, visited his house and preached to him the Doctrine, after which he became the Buddha’s follower.</p><p>Another Saṁyutta passage <span class='ref'>SN.v.121<em>f.</em></span> contains a sutta in which the brahmin Saṅgārava visits the Buddha and asks him why he can remember certain mantras with great case and others not at all.

When there was a famine in the Vajji country, Sudinna went to Vesāli, hoping to be kept by his rich relations, to the mutual benefit of both parties. They gave him sixty bowls of rice, which he distributed among his colleagues. When he went to his father’s house, in Kalandakagāma, he saw a servant girl about to throw away some boiled rice and asked her to put it into his bowl. The girl, recognizing his hands and feet and voice, told his mother of his arrival. Both she and his father visited him as he was eating the rice, and his father took him by the hand and led him home. There he was provided with a seat and asked to eat: but he refused, saying he had already eaten. The next day he was again invited; he went, and they tried to tempt him back to the lay life. His former wife joined in the attempt, but on being addressed by him as “Sister,” she fell fainting. Then he begged for his meal, saying that if they desired to give it to him they should do so without worrying him. Later his wife visited him, with his mother, at the Mahāvana, and begged that he would give her a son, so that the Licchavis might not confiscate their wealth for want of an heir. Sudinna agreed, and had intercourse three times with her. She became pregnant, and in due course a son was born, who was called Bījaka. When Sudinna realized what he had done he was filled with remorse, and his colleagues, discovering the reason, reported him to the Buddha, who blamed him greatly. <span class='ref'>Vin.iii.11–21</span></p></dd>	sudinna	Vin.iii.11–21	Vin.iii.11

Citta heard Sāriputta preach, and, at the end of the sermon, invited him and the monks to his house the next day. He also invited Sudhamma, but because he had been invited after the others, Sudhamma refused to go. Early the next day he visited Citta’s house to see what offerings had been prepared, and after seeing them, remarked that one thing was missing: sesame cakes. Then Citta rebuked him, comparing him to a crow, the offspring of a cock and a crow. Sudhamma left the house in anger, and going to Sāvatthī, reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha blamed Sudhamma and said that the Saṅgha should pass the <i>paṭisāraṇīyakamma</i> on him. Sudhamma, thereupon, went to Macchikāsaṇḍa to ask pardon of Citta, but Citta would not forgive him.

Placing the body on a litter, they went about the streets of the city crying— “Behold the deeds of the Sākyan monks!” As a result, the monks were subjected to great insults in the streets. For seven days the Buddha stayed in the Gandhakuti, not going to the city for alms, and Ānanda even suggested that they should go to another city.</p><p>But the Buddha pointed out to him the absurdity of running away from a false report, and said that in seven days the truth would be known.

soṇa	Soṇa2	Soṇa	<dd><p>A monk, foremost in those who strive energetically. <span class='ref'>AN.i.24</span> His hands and feet were soft like flowers, and a fine down grew on them. He lived in great luxury in three palaces, each for its own season. King Bimbisāra, hearing of him, sent for him and Soṇa went with eighty thousand fellow townsmen.</p><p>In Rājagaha he heard the Buddha preach, and, winning faith, entered the Order with his parents’ consent. The Buddha gave him a subject for meditation, and he went to Sītavana, but many people visited him and he was unable to concentrate. He strove hard, and, through pacing up and down in meditation, painful sores developed on his feet. But he won no attainment and was filled with despair. The Buddha saw this and taught him that when he was a <i>vīṇā</i> player his <i>vīṇā</i> sounded neither tuneful nor playable when the strings were either over-strung or over-lax. Even so, energy, when over-strung, ends in flurry, when over-lax, in idleness. Soṇa profits by the lesson and becomes an arahant. He then visits the Buddha and declares to him his new found vision. <span class='ref'>AN.iii.374<em>f.</em></span> <span class='ref'>Thag.632</span></p><p>The Vinaya <span class='ref'>Vin.i.179<em>ff.</em></span> gives details of Soṇa’s visit to Bimbisāra. The king, being curious to see Soṇa’s feet, sent for him. He and his eighty-thousand companions went to see the Buddha, and there they were greatly impressed by the <i>iddhi</i>-power of Sāgata. Soṇa then sought the Buddha alone and joined the Order. After ordination he walked about meditating, his feet bled, and his cankamana was covered with blood “like a slaughter house for oxen.” After Soṇa attained arahantship, the Buddha gave him permission to wear shoes with one lining.

He once saw the Buddha at Gomagga in Siṁsapāvana, near Alavi, and asked him if he were one of those who lived happily. The Buddha said he was always happy in any circumstances. <span class='ref'>AN.i.136<em>f.</em></span> On another occasion the Buddha asked Hatthaka how he could command the allegiance of such a large company. “By the four bases of sympathy,” he answered, by giving gifts, by kindly words, by kindly deeds, by equality of treatment. And when Hatthaka had gone, the Buddha praised him for his eminence, in that he possessed eight marvellous qualities: faith, virtue, conscientiousness, fear of blame, ability to listen well, charity, wisdom, modesty. <span class='ref'>AN.iv.218<em>f.</em></span> <span class='ref'>AN.iv.216</span></p><p>Together with Cittagahapati, Hatthaka is often held up as an example to be copied by others. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.235</span> <span class='ref'>AN.i.88</span> <span class='ref'>AN.ii.164</span> <span class='ref'>AN.iii.451</span></p><p>After death, Hatthaka was born in Avihā, there to pass away entirely. From there he once visited the Buddha and tried to stand in his presence, but collapsed and could not remain upright. The Buddha then asked him to create a gross body form, and when he did this he was able to stand. He told the Buddha that he was constantly surrounded by devas wishing to learn the Dhamma from him, and confessed that he had died regretting three things: of not having seen enough of the Buddha, of not heard enough of the Dhamma, of not served enough the Saṅgha. <span class='ref'>AN.i.278<em>f.</em></span></p></dd>	hatthaka	AN.i.278<em>f.</em>	AN.i.278
