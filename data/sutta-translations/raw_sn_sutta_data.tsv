sn1.1:0.3	Crossing the Flood	NA
sn1.1:1.1	So I have heard.	Bhikkhu Bodhi’s *Connected Discourses of the Buddha* includes extensive discussions of variant readings, as well as summaries of the commentary. I don’t replicate these here, but usually I follow Bodhi’s readings and note where I differ.
sn1.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.	NA
sn1.1:1.3	Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	“Deity” is _devatā_, which in Pali as in English is an abstract noun. Though feminine in grammatical gender, it does not imply that the deity is female.
sn1.1:1.4	“Good fellow, how did you cross the flood?”	“Good fellow” (_mārisa_; Sanskrit _mārṣa_, _māriṣa_) is a special term of address used by deities and sometimes by kings. The term harks back to Sanskrit _mādṛśa_, “one like me”, in the sense of having a comparable status. | The Buddha lived and taught in the Gangetic plain, a region characterized by deadly and unpredictable flooding.
sn1.1:1.5	“Neither standing nor swimming, good sir, I crossed the flood.”	That _āyūhati_ means “swim” is clear from [sn2.5:3.5]().
sn1.1:1.6	“But in what way did you cross the flood neither standing nor swimming?”	The deity’s counter-question shows that the Buddha’s answer was deliberately obscure.
sn1.1:1.7	“When I stood, I sank under.	NA
sn1.1:1.8	When I swam, I was swept away.	NA
sn1.1:1.9	That’s how I crossed the flood neither standing nor swimming.”	The teaching suggests a state of poised flow, where one is neither stuck in attachments, nor restlessly straining to get somewhere else.
sn1.1:2.1	“After a long time I see	NA
sn1.1:2.2	a brahmin fully quenched.	NA
sn1.1:2.3	Neither standing nor swimming,	NA
sn1.1:2.4	he’s crossed over clinging to the world.”	NA
sn1.1:3.1	This is what that deity said,	NA
sn1.1:3.2	and the teacher approved.	NA
sn1.1:3.3	NA	NA
sn1.1:3.4	Then that deity, knowing that the teacher approved, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.	NA

sn1.2:4.1	“But how is it that you know the liberation, emancipation, and seclusion of sentient beings?”	NA
sn1.2:5.1	“Due to the ending of relish for rebirth;	The Buddha’s answer seems to mix a few lines of verse with some prose. This line is verse, as it has an unusual structure, best understood as due to the exigencies of metre, and where it occurs elsewhere it is always as verse. Also, this line and the next are metrical (_vatta_). The Chinese parallels at SA 1268 and SA-2 179 format the whole of the Buddha’s answer as prose, the verse being spoken by the deity at the end. Perhaps the Buddha quoted a couple of lines of verse in a prose sentence.
sn1.2:5.2	due to the finishing of perception and consciousness;	With this the Buddha differentiates himself from Yājnavalkya, for whom perception (limited awareness) ends, but consciousness (infinite awareness) is eternal (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12).
sn1.2:5.3	due to the cessation and stilling of feelings—	The Chinese parallels here speak of the liberation of the mind rather than the cessation of feelings. The textual problems seem insoluble and it appears the text is corrupt.

The redactors show their playful side here, placing this “riddle of fives” as the fifth sutta of the Saṁyutta. | The enigmatic repetition of “five” is reminiscent of Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.17: “Where the five groups of five and space are established, I regard that Self as the immortal Brahman, knowing which I am immortal.” Or perhaps it is a reference to the five great sacrifices, to sages, gods, ghosts, men and ancestors (Manu 4.21).

sn1.35:1.2	Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the host of the fault-finders, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, and stood in the air.	For the deities to stand in the air is disrespectful if not downright threatening ([dn3:1.21.1.]()).

sn1.35:2.1	“Someone who pretends	NA

However, at [thag12.2:11.1]() he smiled when Sunīta, having gone forth from a low-born family, was honored by the gods.

This gives a much more satisfying structure, and it seems likely the Pali text has suffered loss.

It symbolized a fixed and immovable point, either in a good sense ([sn56.39:4.1]()) or, as here, an obstacle. The Sanskrit _indrakīla_ is a two-foot long iron bolt securing a fort, presumably fixed in the ground (Arthaśāstra 2.3.26), or else a mountain in the Himalayas. The warrior Arjuna, journeying beyond the Gandhamādana, is stopped at the Indrakīla mountain by Sakra/Indra disguised as a brahmin ascetic, at whose urging Arjuna undertakes asceticism in order to gain the power he would need (Mahābhārata 3.3.37). The symbolic sense of “stopping” relates to the Pali sense of immovability, and suggests that the underlying metaphor is the irresistible power represented by Indra.
sn1.37:7.3	They live pure and immaculate,	NA
sn1.37:7.4	the young giants tamed by the Clear-eyed One.”	The primary sense of _nāga_ seems to be “snake”, especially the cobra. From there it applies to other powerful beings: the elephant, the dragon, and as here, the spiritual “giants” of the Saṅgha.

The point is that gods are dependent and hence not free.

sn1.60:2.1	“Metre is the source of verses.	Rig Veda 10.90.9 says that verses, chants, and metres were born, rather, from the sacrifice.
sn1.60:2.2	Syllables constitute their phrasing.	The _akkhara_ (“syllable”) is the smallest indivisible morpheme, typically consisting of a consonant bound with a vowel. Mystically, it is the “imperishable” Divinity within all things. The “phrasing” (_viyañjana_) is the complex linguistic expression. Verses and other expressions are often counted by their syllables (eg. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 6.2.1.22, 6.2.2.33,  6.3.1.43).
sn1.60:2.3	Verses depend on names.	Chāndogya Upaniṣad 7.1.4 defines “name” (_nāma_) as the Vedic texts and sciences.
sn1.60:2.4	A poet underlies verses.”	The Buddha uses the worldly word for “poet” (_kavi_) instead of the divinely-inspired Vedic “seer” (_isi_, Sanskrit _ṛṣi_).

sn2.1:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
sn2.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
sn2.1:1.3	Then, late at night, the glorious godling Kassapa, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	The commentary says that godlings (_devaputta_) are born “in the lap of the gods”, that is, not from a womb. Typically, in contrast with the “deities” (_devatā_), they are named individuals. The commentary also takes the term as gendered, with _devaputta_ as “son of god” and _devadhītā_ as “daughter of god”. But as the latter term is not attested in early Pali (or Sanskrit) we should probably take _devaputta_ as gender neutral (like _devatā_). This is supported by pre-Buddhist Sanskrit, where we only find _devaputra_ as an adjective, “the heaven and earth, whose children are gods”, where those children are “two young women, sisters” (Rig Veda 1.185.4). | Many of the Suttas in this chapter refer to Indra (i.e. Sakka) under different names. Indra was a son of the original Kassapa, so this may refer to Indra with the patronymic.
sn2.1:1.4	“The Buddha has revealed the mendicant, but not his instructions to a mendicant.”	This is an unusual thing to say, as the Buddha obviously gave instructions for mendicants very often. It must have a specific context. The commentary supplies a context, but it relies on a later legend. | This suggests that the verse below, which is phrased as a direct exhortation to the mendicants, is to be read as Kassapa quoting the Buddha’s own words. However, no such verse is attributed to the Buddha in the Pali canon. At [thag3.7:3.1]() it is spoken by the mendicant Vāraṇa.
sn2.1:1.5	“Well then, Kassapa, clarify this matter yourself.”	NA
sn2.1:2.1	“You should all train <j>to learn well-spoken words,	I read _sikkhetha_ as second person plural optative, and _subhāsitassa_ (etc.) as dative (of purpose), although we would expect the _āya_ form in this sense.

I think it should be corrected to Maghada, “giver of bounty”, cf. Rig Vedic _maghadeya_ (7.67.9), _indro maghāni dayate_ (7.21.7).

Pañcālacaṇḍa appears alongside Āḷavaka, the tutelary deity of Āḷavī, hinting that he may be the fierce (_caṇḍa_) protector of the Pañcāla clan ([dn32:10.16]()). Several Pañcālacaṇḍas appear in the Jātakas: a licentious youth and a misogynistic chaplain ([ja536]()), and a prince of Pañcāla ([ja546]()). A Pañcālacaṇḍa appears as a Vedic teacher of the idea that speech is what unifies (Aitereya Āraṇyaka 3.1.6 = Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka 7.19, Gopatha Brāhmaṇa 1.1.27n).

At [an9.42](), Ānanda explains that each stage of absorption is an “opening” relative to what came before, but still a “confinement”, and only Nibbāna is the opening without confinement.

sn2.9:0.3	The Moon	NA
sn2.9:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	This discourse and the next provide the Buddhist community with verses to recite for solace on the terrifying occasion of an eclipse.
sn2.9:1.2	Now at that time the Moon God had been seized by Rāhu, lord of titans.	Rāhu (“seizer”), is able to swallow the Moon and Sun because he has largest physical body of any creature ([an4.15:2.1]()). This also lets him divert the rains ([an5.197:3.1]()). This myth is alluded to in Atharvaveda 19.9.10a and Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.13.1. An eclipse was a day unfit for study (Manu 4.110). The full story of Rāhu, however, is not told until the Purāṇas, so this Sutta is possibly the oldest telling that survives.
sn2.9:1.3	Then the Moon God, recollecting the Buddha, at that time recited this verse:	Candimā, the “moon” as celestial body or deity, appears frequently in the Vedas (eg. Rig Veda 1.24.10, 1.102.2, etc.). A slightly different form of this name appears in SN 2.11.
sn2.9:2.1	“Homage to you, Buddha, hero!	NA
sn2.9:2.2	You’re free in every way.	NA
sn2.9:2.3	I’ve wandered into confinement:	The later Purāṇic legend says that Rāhu disguised himself as a brahmin to drink the gods’ nectar of immortality. But he was spied by the Sun and Moon, decapitated by Vishnu, and now his disembodied head traverses the skies as a black planet. He does not forget how the Sun and Moon betrayed him, so, nursing his enmity, he swallows them when he can. He is ever frustrated as they simply pass out through his throat.
sn2.9:2.4	be my refuge!”	Here the sense of “refuge” (_saraṇa_) is both physical and spiritual.
sn2.9:3.1	Then the Buddha addressed Rāhu in verse concerning the Moon God:	NA
sn2.9:4.1	“The Moon God has gone for refuge	NA
sn2.9:4.2	to the Realized One, the perfected one.	NA
sn2.9:4.3	The Buddhas have compassion for the world—	NA
sn2.9:4.4	so Rāhu, release the Moon!”	NA
sn2.9:5.1	Then Rāhu, having released the Moon, rushed to see Vepacitti, lord of titans and stood to one side, shocked and awestruck.	Rāhu was the son of Vepacitti and, according to Purāṇic legend, Siṁhikā.
sn2.9:5.2	Vepacitti addressed him in verse:	NA
sn2.9:6.1	“Why the rush?	NA
sn2.9:6.2	Rāhu, you released the Moon	NA

sn2.9:7.3	if, when enchanted by the Buddha’s verse,	_Abhigīta_ first appears with regards to a drop of Soma that has been “chanted over”, “besung”, or “enchanted” and hence imbued with potency (Rig Veda 9.96.23). Throughout Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 8.5.4 it is used more prosaically: a history of horse sacrifices is listed, each event honored with a specific verse “sung about” it. In Pali, the phrase _gāthābhigīta_ is found only in this passage and when the Buddha refused to eat food “chanted over” by a brahmins (eg. [sn7.8:8.1]()). In both cases the chanting has a mysterious potency, so I render “enchanted with verse”.

sn2.10:5.4	Rāhu, release my offspring, the Sun!”	The Buddha is the “kinsman of the sun” as he is a scion of the royal Solar Lineage traced back to the sun himself. Both Sun and Moon attended  the Mahāsamayasutta ([dn20:14.3]()) where, according to the commentary, they became stream-enterers and hence the Buddha’s spiritual “sons”. Symbolically the Buddha, by enabling the Sun’s “release” from the “confined space”, becomes the father of light and wisdom.

sn2.11:1.2	Then, late at night, the glorious godling Candimasa, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side,	Candimasa is another form of the shining “moon”, echoing Vedic _candramasa_ (eg. Rig Veda 1.84.15, 10.64.3, Chāndogya Upaniṣad4.15.5, etc.). As often, there is no obvious link between the deity and the content of their verses.

sn2.11:3.2	they will reach the far shore	NA
sn2.11:3.3	having entered the absorptions,	NA
sn2.11:3.4	diligent, with strife discarded.”	Rig Vedic _raṇa_ usually means “joy, delight” (eg. 8.96.16, 10.104.7) or occasionally “battle, strife, conflict” (see [mn139]()). The commentary explains it here as “vice, defilement”. But compare Rig Veda 10.112.10, where Indra the “bounteous” (_maghavan_) is urged to “battle” and bestow a share of winnings on devotees. Likewise at 10.113.4 Indra’s successful “battle” is a prelude to releasing the waters. Then there is the oft-quoted line _dhanañjayaṃ raṇe-raṇe_ (“winner of the stakes in every battle”, 1.74.3, 6.16.15). These suggest emendation to _raṇañjaya_ (“victor in battle”), but this is not attested in Pali. On the other hand, the Chinese translation at SA 1303 seems to take _raṇa_ in the sense of “delight” (<span lang='lzh'>喜樂</span>). Also see the _uddāna_ to [thag1.50](), _vimalo ca raṇañjaho_, which supports the commentarial sense “free of defilement”. On the whole, since the sense “strife” is clearly attested, and the development of Vedic “joy” to commentarial “defilement” is not well-attested, I am inclined to accept the sense “strife” in all cases, while suspecting that the original of _raṇañjaha_ was _raṇañjaya_.

sn2.12:1.1	Standing to one side, the godling Vishnu recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence:	Veṇhu (variant _veṇḍu_) is the Pali spelling of Sanskrit _viṣṇu_, who in Pali appears only here and at [dn20:14.1](). He appears somewhat often in the Rig Veda, where he is an ally of Indra in his battle with the constrictor serpent (4.18.11, 6.20.2, 8.100.12). His name is explained as meaning “widespread” due to his role as the wide-stepping solar god who made three great strides over the earth, the midspace, and the heavens, opening up the broad expanse of the world. He also played a role in fertility (Rig Veda 7.36.9, 10.84.1). By the time of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa he was identified with the sacrifice (eg. 1.1.2.13). In one passage he is said to be mystically identified with Indra as Maghavan (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 14.1.1.13). | Just as the previous chapter featured Indra under several names, the deities in the next few Suttas may also be names of Vishnu, although the identifications are weak.
sn2.12:2.1	“Happy are the men	The common Pali terms _manuja_ (“mankind”, “man”), _manussa_ (“human”), and _mānava_ (usually “(Vedic) student”, occasionally “son of man”) all have the same root sense, “child of Manu”. Vishnu himself was a child of Manu via his mother Ākūti, Manu’s daughter.

In the Rig Veda he appears a few times under the name Rudra, the “roarer”, where he is feared but approached as dispenser of blessed healing (Rig Veda 2.33). Along with other gods, he is there sometimes described as _śiva_, “kindly, blessed”. As time went on his kindly aspect became more prominent, but he never lost his destructive side.

The commentary reads the first as _akkhacchinno avajhāyati_ (“frets with broken axle”) and the second _akkhacchinno iva jhāyati_ (“frets like one whose axle is broken”). The prefixed verb is not necessary for the sense (cp. [snp4.7:5.2](), [dhp155:3]()), so instead I take the first line as _akkhacchinno eva jhāyati_ (“frets as soon as their axle is broken”).

Normally _kuṭikā_ is understood as a diminutive of _kuṭi_, hence “little hut”. But here several mendicants are staying (as at [ud4.2:1.3]()), while elsewhere the Buddha stayed in one while at the Jetavana ([dn14:1.1.2]()).

Agni was he of red horses (_rohidaśva_, Rig Veda 1.45.2, 4.1.8, 8.43.16, 10.7.4, 10.98.9; see 2.10.2). This can mean the tongues of the ritual fire whose message is speedily conveyed to the gods, but especially the “ruddy steed” swift as the wind (_aruṣā rohitā_, 1.94.10), the “red horses of the dawn” (_aruṇebhir aśvair_, Rig Veda 1.113.14, see 4.52.2, 6.65.2, 7.75.6). The current Sutta seems to draw on the conception of Rohita in Atharvaveda 13, glorifying Agni as the Sun, who “arrives in a flash” (13.2.15), “swift” (13.2.2), “rushing” (13.2.19), “traversing the sky” (13.2.22), radiating as far as worlds extend (13.2.42, 13.2.10, 13.1.16), racing over the world never letting his thought stray (13.2.15). The “Sun’s bay horses” (_sūryasyāśvā harayaḥ_, 13.1.24) are seven ruddy steeds who carry it, spreading out its rays (13.2.4, 13.3.16).

sn2.29:9.1	Suppose there was a pendant of Black Plum River gold, fashioned by a deft smith, well wrought in the forge. When placed on a cream rug it would shine and glow and radiate.	Legend has it that on the slopes of Mount Meru grows the vast Jambu tree that gives the continent of India her name, “the land of the black plum tree”. The fruits of that tree are as big as elephants, and when they fall, their juice flows forth as a river named Jambu. The dried mud of that river yields gold nuggets whose unparalleled lustre is highly sought-after among the gods. This is that gold (Śiva Purāṇa 17.16–19).

sn2.30:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
sn2.30:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
sn2.30:1.3	Then, late at night, several glorious godlings lit up the entire Bamboo Grove. They were Asama, Sahalī, Niṅka, Ākoṭaka, Veṭambarī, and Māṇavagāmiya, and all of them were disciples of various monastics of other religions. They went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side.	Most of these individuals are unknown elsewhere. | For detailed presentations of the sectarian teachings that follow, see [dn2]().
sn2.30:1.4	Standing to one side, the godling Asama recited this verse about Pūraṇa Kassapa in the Buddha’s presence:	 “Peerless”.
sn2.30:2.1	“In injuring and killing here,	NA
sn2.30:2.2	in beating and extortion,	NA
sn2.30:2.3	Kassapa saw no evil,	NA
sn2.30:2.4	nor any merit for oneself.	NA
sn2.30:2.5	What he taught should truly be trusted,	NA
sn2.30:2.6	he’s worthy of esteem as Teacher.”	This is regarded as a pernicious wrong view, which results in rebirth in hell. This shows the complexity of kamma, as Asama must have done some other good kamma to be reborn as a godling.
sn2.30:3.1	Then the godling Sahalī recited this verse about the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla in the Buddha’s presence:	A group of gods of this name (meaning “with plough”?) appeared alongside Vishnu at [dn20:14.1]().
sn2.30:4.1	“Through fervent mortification in disgust of sin he became well restrained.	NA
sn2.30:4.2	He gave up arguing with people.	NA
sn2.30:4.3	Refraining from false speech, he spoke the truth.	NA
sn2.30:4.4	Surely such a man does no wrong!”	NA
sn2.30:5.1	Then the godling Niṅka recited this verse about the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan in the Buddha’s presence:	NA
sn2.30:6.1	“Disgusted at sin, an alert mendicant,	NA
sn2.30:6.2	well restrained in the fourfold constraint;	For this Jain teaching see [dn2:29.4](), [dn25:16.3]()
sn2.30:6.3	explaining what is seen and heard:	NA
sn2.30:6.4	surely he can be no sinner!”	NA
sn2.30:7.1	Then the godling Ākoṭaka recited this verse about various sectarian teachers in the Buddha’s presence:	“Pounder”.
sn2.30:8.1	“Pakudhaka Kātiyāna and the Jain ascetic,	Pakudhaka Kātiyāna is a variant spelling of Pakudha Kaccāyana.
sn2.30:8.2	as well as this bamboo-staffed ascetic and Pūraṇa:	NA
sn2.30:8.3	Teachers of communities, attained ascetics,	NA
sn2.30:8.4	surely they weren’t far from truly good men!”	NA
sn2.30:9.1	Then the godling Veṭambarī replied to the godling Ākoṭaka in verse:	Variant spelling _vegabbhari_.
sn2.30:10.1	“Though the wretched jackal howls along,	NA
sn2.30:10.2	it never equals the lion.	NA
sn2.30:10.3	A naked liar with suspicious conduct,	NA
sn2.30:10.4	though they teach a community, is not like the good.”	NA
sn2.30:11.1	Then Māra the Wicked took possession of the godling Veṭambarī and recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence:	NA
sn2.30:12.1	“Those dedicated to mortification in disgust of sin,	NA
sn2.30:12.2	safeguarding their seclusion,	NA
sn2.30:12.3	entrenched in form,	NA
sn2.30:12.4	they rejoice in the heavenly realm.	NA
sn2.30:12.5	Indeed, those mortals give correct instructions	NA
sn2.30:12.6	regarding the next world.”	NA
sn2.30:13.1	Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse:	NA
sn2.30:14.1	“Whatever forms there are <j>in this world or the world beyond,	NA
sn2.30:14.2	and those of shining beauty in the sky,	NA
sn2.30:14.3	all of these you praise, Namuci,	NA
sn2.30:14.4	like bait tossed out for catching fish.”	NA
sn2.30:15.1	Then the godling Māṇavagāmiya recited this verse about the Buddha in his presence:	The celebration of Namuci’s defeat by Māṇavagāmiya is a striking verbal allusion to Rig Veda 5.30.7c, where the defeat of Namuci opened the way for “the progress of Manu” (_manave gātum_, Rig Veda 5.30.7c), i.e. the spread of the Aryan peoples who were Manu’s children. Reading Pali _gāmiya_ as a secondary derivation from _gama_, “going”, yields the sense, “The Progress of Manu’s Children”. Here the term can have the Buddhist sense of the path of the Aryans.

sn3.1:1.3	Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	Pasenadi, son of Sañjaya Mahākosala, ruled the nation of Kosala from its capital Sāvatthī until his death shortly before the Buddha. Like the Buddha’s family, he claimed descent from the Solar lineage of Okkāka. He features throughout the Suttas as a well-meaning if sometimes naive ruler. During his realm, Kosala was a flourishing trade center with a vibrant religious life, a center not just for Buddhists but for Vedic brahmins and Jains, as well as local religious customs.
sn3.1:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,	Pasenadi’s polite but not reverential behavior indicates that he is not yet a devotee of the Buddha. This may, in fact, record their first meeting.
sn3.1:1.5	“Does the worthy Gotama claim to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening?”	NA

sn3.1:2.1	“Well, there are those ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community, and tutor a community. They’re well-known and famous religious founders, deemed holy by many people. That is,	NA
sn3.1:2.2	Pūraṇa Kassapa, the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla, the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, Pakudha Kaccāyana, and Ajita of the hair blanket.	The sequence of names here differs from the usual ([dn2:2.2]()). We have met four of these already in [sn2.30](), which gives a summary of their teachings. As for the remaining two, Sañjaya’s method of radical avoidance is taught at [dn2:32.2](), while Ajita’s materialistic denial of merit is at [dn2:23.2]().
sn3.1:2.3	I also asked them whether they claimed to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening, but they made no such claim.	NA
sn3.1:2.4	So why do you, given that you’re so young in age and newly gone forth?”	NA

sn3.1:3.7	These four things should not be looked down upon or disparaged because they are young.”	NA
sn3.1:4.1	That is what the Buddha said.	NA

sn3.1:8.2	the serpent of fiery breath glides along.	This is an allusion to the venomous bite, _tejas_ having roots in both “sharp” and “fiery”. This metaphor is the origin of the dragon’s fiery breath. For a fiery dragon defeated by the Buddha, whose flames are even more multi-colored, see [pli-tv-kd1:15.1.1]().

A true Buddhist mendicant, on the other hand, bears any slight or grievance with patience and loving-kindness, per the “simile of the saw” ([mn21:20.1](), [mn28:24.3]()). It is, ironically, due to the very perfection of their virtue that any harmful deed done against them reaps a painful karmic result.

sn3.1:14.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
sn3.1:14.4	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	This marks the point at which Pasenadi becomes a follower of the Buddha.

But they tell deliberate lies for the sake of sensual pleasures.	In the previous Sutta, Pasenadi lamented the corrupting influence of wealth. Here he talks of how he sees this corruption in his court. he speaks further of his frustrations at [mn98:13.1](). | Read _aḍḍa_ (variants _attha_, _aṭṭa_) which in Sanskrit has the senses “solve, infer, argue, discern”. The commentary interprets _aḍḍakaraṇa_ as the “place of judgement” i.e. the court, which is clearly the case at [dn17:1.11.1]().
sn3.7:1.4	Then it occurred to me:	NA
sn3.7:1.5	‘Enough with passing judgment today. Now my dearest will be known by the judgments he makes.’”	_Bhadramukha_ is used here by by a king of his grown son.

The term is of Sanskritic form and is found commonly in the Avadāna literature. Turning to later Sanskrit sources, Nāṭyaśāstra 19.12 says it should be used when addressing inferiors, while Sāhityadarpaṇa 6.154 says it is used when addressing a prince (see SN 3.7 above). The early Pali usage, however, suggests it was an affectionate and respectful term of somewhat elevated usage, but not restricted by status. Since _bhadda_ by itself is a common form of address in the sense “my dear”, I think the suffix _-mukha_ has its intensive sense here, “dearest”, rather than “dear face”.

In addition to conversations on the theme of attachment to loved ones ([mn87](), [ud5.1]()), unrelated incidents with Mallikā appear at [an4.197](), [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc53:1.1](), and [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.2.7](). She is listed as an eminent lay disciple ([an8.91-117:1.1]()) and maintained a monastery for philosophical debates ([mn78:1.3]()). Her passing is recorded at [an5.49](). This is what we know of her from early texts, while later Jātakas and other scriptures tell many colorful tales about her and her unique marriage. | Śvetāmbara Jains hold that, in the far distant past, the nineteenth founding teacher (_tīrthaṅkara_) was the lady Malli (Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra 6.6). Perhaps the Buddhist stories of the wise lady Mallikā helped inspire this legend.

Pasenadi is of course using “self” in a conventional rather than metaphysical sense.
sn3.8:1.5	“No, great king, there isn’t.	Mallikā’s reply is brave, given that she is telling her king and husband she loves herself more than him. This passage alludes to the famous dialogue where Yājñavalkya explains to his wife Maitreyī that he is renouncing in order to seek the true Self.

It would be strange for a devoted Buddhist to undertake such a sacrifice. Perhaps this was before Pasenadi converted.

sn3.9:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha recited these verses:	The rituals listed are grand sacrifices requiring the slaughter of many beasts, intended to establish or grow the power of the king. Not all are readily identifiable in Vedic texts.
sn3.9:4.1	“Horse sacrifice, human sacrifice,	The horse sacrifice (_assamedha_, Sanskrit _aśvamedha_) was expensive, dangerous, and rarely performed. A horse was set free for a year, followed by the king and his army who would conquer any lands on which it strayed. Then it was killed in an obscene rite. It appears in the late stages of the Rig Veda (1.162, 1.163, and perhaps 10.86) and was a major feature of the sacrificial systems (eg. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13) and cosmic meditations (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.1). | Even before the Buddha, human sacrifice was regarded by the Vedists as a long-abandoned practice, substituted by a horse, then an ox, a sheep, and finally a goat (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.2.3.6; compare Genesis 22). It persisted, however, in darker corners of Indian folk religion.
sn3.9:4.2	the ‘casting of the yoke-pin’, <j>the ‘royal soma drinking’,	The “casting of the yoke-pin” (_sammāpāsa_) is obscure. I think it originated as the pulling out of a yoke-pin (_śamyā_) of the beasts of the journey, which were cast about at journey’s end to establish one’s territory (see Manu 8.237). | The “royal soma drinking” (_vājapeyya_) is a rite where, after a horse race, the king drinks the soma, giving him superhuman strength and prowess in battle, and at which several animals, sometimes said to be seventeen, are sacrificed. This is said to be a higher sacrifice that establishes a king as emperor (see Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.1.1).
sn3.9:4.3	and the ‘unimpeded’—	The _niraggaḷa_ is probably a form of the horse sacrifice where the horse is “unimpeded”, thus establishing the king as similarly unstoppable. The Buddha adopted the term for arahants ([mn22:34.1[]()).

The Pali commentaries interpret it as “in line with (_anu-_) family (_kula_)”. But nothing in the contexts connects it with family customs, nor is such a term known in Sanskrit. It seems rather to be a misunderstanding of Sanskrit _anukūla_, literally “along the riverbank”, and in applied use, “in conformity with”, “favorable to”, as in the favor of the gods. This is the standard reading in Buddhist Sanskrit. Such a sacrifice is characterized, not by family custom, but by harmlessness. Thus _anukula_ means “propitious, favored (by the gods and the Dhamma)”.

sn3.11:2.1	Now at that time seven matted-hair ascetics, seven Jain ascetics, seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloth ascetics, and seven wanderers passed by not far from the Buddha. Their armpits and bodies were hairy, and their nails were long; and they carried their pack with shoulder-poles.	“Matted-hair ascetics” (_jaṭilā_) were Vedic ascetics practicing bathing and worshiping the sacred flame ([ud1.9](); see note on [mn40:5.10]()). | “Jain ascetics” (_nigaṇṭhā_) were followers of Mahāvīra. The list next gives the two main subsets of Jains: the Digambara were “naked ascetics” (_acelakā_), while Śvetāmbara were “one-cloth ascetics” (see [an6.57:4.1]()). | “Wanderers (_paribbājakā_) were homeless religious renunciates—male or female—who wandered seeking alms (see note on [dn1:1.1.3]()). | For _khāri_ (“pack”) see also [sn7.9:14.1]().

The use of ascetics for spies (_cara_), which is still common today, is detailed by Kauṭilya in his Arthaśāstra. Those seeking a job can imitate bald (_muṇḍa_) or matted-hair (_jaṭila_) ascetics, pretending to live on a handful of greens but secretly eating what they like (as here). Other fake ascetics or spies disguised as merchants then acclaim them to build reputation (as Pasenadi here). When people seek prophecies, he foretells that those loyal to the king shall prosper and those who oppose him will suffer. The king’s minister then ensures that such prophecies come true (1.11.13, 1.13.15). Female mendicants are especially useful for manipulating the wives of officials (5.1.19, 5.1.50, 12.2.20), or officials regarding their wives (11.1.52). Ascetic spies are taught to manipulate loyalties with morality tales (1.14) and to fool enemy kings by faking magical powers (13.2; cp. Devadatta using magic to seduce Ajātasattu at [pli-tv-kd17:2.1.1]()). They conduct assassinations by tricking targets into consuming poisons in the guise of a ritual (5.1.33) or love-potions (11.1.40), or he may first instigate rape, then accuse the rapist (11.1.48). Princes may also don the guise of such ascetics in order to escape a coup, while forest ascetics misdirect pursuers (7.17.50). Such spies earn a solid middle income comparable to soldiers, superintendents, teachers, or accountants (5.3.22–3).

sn3.12:1.2	Now at that time five kings headed by Pasenadi were amusing themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, and this discussion came up among them:	The five kings are not identified.

sn3.13:0.3	A Bucketful of Rice	NA
sn3.13:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	This Sutta presents what is probably the world’s first weight loss diet.
sn3.13:1.2	Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala used to eat boiled rice by the bucketful.	A _doṇa_ (“bucketful”) was a wooden trough to receive the filtered Soma (Rig Veda 4.32.17). In the Arthaśāstra it measures feed for horses (2.30.12) and elephants (2.15.50). One _doṇa_ was the monthly allotment of grain for a servant (Manu 7.126). Olivelle estimates it at 5 liters or 9.6 kg (*King, Governance, and Law*, appendix 2, pg. 458). | The use of present tense (_bhuñjati_) here indicates that it is an ongoing situation, not just a single large meal (compare the aorist in the previous Sutta).
sn3.13:1.3	Then after eating King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, huffing and puffing. He bowed and sat down to one side.	NA
sn3.13:2.1	Then, knowing that King Pasenadi was huffing and puffing after eating, on that occasion the Buddha recited this verse:	NA
sn3.13:3.1	“When a man is always mindful,	NA
sn3.13:3.2	knowing moderation in eating,	NA
sn3.13:3.3	his discomfort fades,	For _vedanā_ as “discomfort”, compare the stock reflection on eating ([sn35.120:4.3]()).
sn3.13:3.4	and he ages slowly, taking care of his life.”	NA
sn3.13:4.1	Now at that time the student Sudassana was standing behind the king.	This Vedic student attending the king is otherwise unknown.
sn3.13:4.2	Then King Pasenadi addressed him,	NA
sn3.13:4.3	“Please, dear Sudassana, memorize this verse in the Buddha’s presence and recite it to me whenever I am served a meal.	NA
sn3.13:4.4	I’ll set up a regular daily allowance of a hundred dollars for you.”	_Niccabhikkhā_ at [ja398:4.1]() refers to the daily offering of food to a _yakkha_. Here and at [mn94:33.1]() it refers to money.
sn3.13:4.5	“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Sudassana. He memorized that verse in the Buddha’s presence, and then whenever the king was served a meal he would repeat it:	NA
sn3.13:5.1	“When a man is always mindful,	NA
sn3.13:5.2	knowing moderation in eating,	NA
sn3.13:5.3	his discomfort fades,	NA
sn3.13:5.4	and he ages slowly, taking care of his life.”	NA
sn3.13:6.1	Then the king gradually got used to having at most a cup of rice.	_Nālikā_ was a cup made from a hollow bamboo. It was a modest meal for a king ([sn22.96:4.10](), [dn17:2.15.10]()), sufficient for a medium-sized mendicant’s bowl ([pli-tv-bi-vb-np1:2.1.10]()). It does not appear in this sense in the Arthaśāstra, but the *Indian Epigraphical Glossary* says it is one-sixteenth of a _doṇa_ and equivalent to a _prastha_. Olivelle estimates the _prastha_ at around 600g, which is indeed one sixteenth of a _doṇa_. Bear in mind that rice constituted the bulk of the meal, and for monastics, it would often have been the only meal of the day.
sn3.13:6.2	After some time King Pasenadi’s body slimmed right down. Stroking his limbs with his hands, at that time he expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	Interesting use of _sallikhati_ = _sallekha_ (“cut down” = “slimmed”), related to the idea of “effacing” writing as the stone wears away. For the Jains, _sallekhanā_ was the practice of refusing all food at the end of life (Tattvārthasūtra 7.22; compare the Buddhist practice at [mn8:4.3]()).

sn3.14:1.2	Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to Kāsi to attack King Pasenadi of Kosala.	This was obviously after Ajātasattu’s regicide of his father Bimbisāra, and must therefore be in the last years of the Buddha’s life. It is just one of the indications of Ajātasattu’s aggressive nature and the breakdown of peace in the Buddha’s final years. | Kāsi, of which Varanasi was the capital, had lost its status as an independent kingdom to Pasenadi’s father. Here it has become the proxy for the struggle for dominance between the two largest kingdoms of the time, Kosala and Magadha, a struggle that Magadha would ultimately win. | The four divisions of the army are defined in the next Sutta ([sn3.15:1.9]()).

sn3.15:1.7	Then King Pasenadi thought,	NA
sn3.15:1.8	“Even though I’ve never betrayed this King Ajātasattu, he betrayed me. Still, he is my nephew.	The background is explained in [ja239](). Pasenadi’s father, Mahākosala, had forged an alliance by marrying his daughter to Bimbisāra, endowing her with the revenues of a Kāsi village. Ajātasattu gained the throne by murdering his father, and the queen—Pasenadi’s sister Kosaladevī—died of grief soon after. So when he claimed the village, Pasenadi was outraged at the thought of his father’s gift going to such a man. He took the village, and the series of back-and-forth battles began.

sn3.16:1.4	“Your Majesty, Queen Mallikā has given birth to a daughter.”	NA
sn3.16:1.5	When this was said, King Pasenadi was disappointed.	He had hoped for a son. The girl was probably princess Vajirī, for whom the king expresses his love at [mn87:24.1]().

sn3.20:3.2	Once upon a time, great king, that financier householder provided almsfood on behalf of an Independent Buddha named Tagarasikhī.	The concept of the _paccekabuddha_ allows that there were awakened sages in the long periods of time when there is no _sambuddha_ such as Gotama. Both are Buddhas in the sense of being awakened, but they differ in their relation to others. It is sometimes said that they do not teach, but the tradition attributes to them a number of sayings (notably [snp1.3]()). They are sometimes said to be “solitary”, but in [mn116](), 500 dwell on the same hill, while _pacceka_ Brahmās appear in pairs ([sn6.6:1.3]()). Compare [pli-tv-bu-vb-np9:1.36.1](), where “independent” funds are set up for “independent” robes (rather than combining them); the same idea occurs at [an11.16:11.2](). Likewise, [sn1.37:1.7]() speaks of “independent” verses. Thus the burden of sense in the Pali is that _pacceka_ means “independent’, which here has the sense of not forming a fourfold community, but simply living and practicing independently.
sn3.20:3.3	He instructed: ‘Give alms to that ascetic,’ before getting up from his seat and leaving.	He did not give with his own hands.
sn3.20:3.4	But after giving he regretted it:	NA
sn3.20:3.5	‘It would have been better to feed the bondservants or workers with that almsfood.’	Giving to workers is obviously good, but it is not good to regret one’s generosity.
sn3.20:3.6	What’s more, he murdered his brother’s only child for the sake of his fortune.	NA
sn3.20:4.1	Because that financier provided Tagarasikhī with almsfood, as a result of that deed he was reborn seven times in a good place, a heavenly realm.	This sequence shows the complexity of deeds and their results.
sn3.20:4.2	And as a residual result of that same deed he held the position of financier seven times right here in Sāvatthī.	NA
sn3.20:4.3	But because that financier regretted giving alms,	NA
sn3.20:4.4	as a result of that deed his mind didn’t tend to enjoy nice food, clothes, vehicles, or the five refined kinds of sensual stimulation.	The regret did not cancel out the good deed, but it took the shine off it.
sn3.20:4.5	And because that financier murdered his brother’s only child for the sake of his fortune, as a result of that deed he burned in hell for many years, for many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of years.	The results are proportionate to the deeds.
sn3.20:4.6	And as a residual result of that same deed, he is childless for the seventh time, his fortune ending up in the royal treasury.	Rebirth in hell was for the murder, while childlessness is because he tried to usurp the inheritance.

sn3.21:2.2	It’s when a person is reborn in a low family—a family of corpse-workers, bamboo-workers, hunters, chariot-makers, or scavengers—poor, with little to eat or drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find.	_Caṇḍālas_ (“corpse-workers”) are frequently depicted as the lowest of untouchables as seen by Brahmins. However, the usual rendering of “outcast” is unsatisfactory, as all the groups here are defined positively by their occupation, and moreover some, such as the scavengers, would also have been untouchable. The Pali commentaries equate the _caṇḍāla_ with the _chavaka_ (or _chapaka_) of [pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.12.1](), a “corpse disposer” (_chavachaḍḍakacaṇḍālā_; see also _chavakacaṇḍālo_ at [mil5.4.7:2.4]()). They were known for their “bone-washing” ceremony ([dn1:1.13.2](), [an10.107:1.1]()). This agrees with Rāmāyana 1.58.10, which describes a _caṇḍāla_ as dark-complexioned, dirty, with disheveled hair, his body smeared with graveyard ash. Mahāvaṁsa 10.91–94 tells how King Paṇḍukābhaya employed _caṇḍālas_ for cleaning streets and toilets, bearing the dead, and watching over cemeteries, with their village adjoining the cemetery. My grandfather was a corpse-worker, so in another world it might have been my inheritance.

In Buddhist cosmology, this agrees with the fact that Sakka’s realm is the third of the heavens (after the earth gods and the four great kings). Thus the Third Heaven is the heaven of the Thirty-Three. Both ideas spring from an old association of Indra, or divinity generally, with the number three. Agni Purāṇa lists _tridiva_ as a synonym for “heaven”, as does Amarakośa 1.1.11. Kṣīrasvāmin clarifies that three here means “third”, while also adding that some connect it with the Brahmā realm (Amarakośodghāṭana 1.1.6; see [sn7.18:4.2]()).

sn4.1:1.1	So I have heard.	The first five discourses of this chapter are set shortly after the Buddha’s awakening, and hence in the period of time covered in the first chapter of the Vinaya Khandhaka ([pli-tv-kd1]()). However, despite the length of that narrative, only the fourth and fifth are included there. This situation mirrors the Mahāparinibbānasutta, where there are also events missing from the narrative as we have it. Either parts were lost, or the compilers left out some events for some reason.
sn4.1:1.2	At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying in Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.	In modern times this is the pilgrimage site Bodhgaya in the Gaya district of Bihar. It lies by a wide river that is dry in summer but abundant in the rains. In Pali the river is called Nerañjarā, which  is of unclear meaning, but the commentary suggests “sweet waters” (_nela-jala_) or “blue waters” (_nīla-jala_). The Sanskrit is _nairañjanā_, which suggests the sense “unblemished”. Today it is called the Līlajan (or Nīlajan). | Uruvelā, which aptly means “Broadbanks”, was a locality centered around the market town of Senānigama (“Marshalltown”). There was also a sizable hermitage nearby with matted-hair Brahmanical ascetics (_jaṭilā_) who ritually bathed in the water ([pli-tv-kd1:20.15.1]()). After teaching the five monks in Varanasi, the Buddha returned here to teach them, but there is no record of him visiting subsequently.
sn4.1:1.3	Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	NA
sn4.1:1.4	“I am truly freed from that grueling work!	“Grueling work” (_dukkarakārikā_) refers to the self-mortification he practiced for six years before awakening ([mn12:56.1](), [mn100:27.5]()), which was similar to Jain practices ([mn14:17.5]()).
sn4.1:1.5	Thank goodness I’m freed from that pointless grueling work.	NA
sn4.1:1.6	Thank goodness I’m freed and have attained awakening.”	I follow the MS reading here. Sinhalese editions have “steady, mindful” instead of “freed”. Commentary is silent.
sn4.1:2.1	And then Māra the Wicked, knowing the Buddha’s train of thought, went up to him and addressed him in verse:	Māra is sometimes called Namuci, and in fact seems to descend from the Vedic adversary of that name. Vedic Namuci “the wicked” (_pāpmā vai namuciḥ_, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 12.7.3, Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 4.4.4) was a wily trickster (_māyin_, Rig Veda 1.53.7c) who was nonetheless outsmarted by Indra (Rig Veda 5.30.6c), and possessed ineffectual armies reliant on women (Rig Veda 5.30.9a). Buddhist Māra “the wicked” (_māro pāpimā_) was a wily trickster (*passim*) who was nonetheless outsmarted by the Buddha and his followers (*passim*); he possessed ineffectual armies ([dn20:21.3](), [an4.13:2.3](), [snp3.2]()), and sent his daughters to do his dirty work ([sn4.25]()). The decapitated head of Namuci introduced death (_mṛtyu_) in the form of blood to the deathless (_amṛta_) soma (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 12.7.3.4, Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 4.4.4), establishing his Pali names Maccurāja, “King of Death” and Māra, “Murderer”. He appears in a similar guise in Jainism too (Ācaraṅga 1.3.1.3).
sn4.1:3.1	“You’ve departed from the practice of mortification	Māra pretends to favor asceticism. Truth means nothing to him, as words are merely devices for him to get what he wants.
sn4.1:3.2	by which sons of men purify themselves.	NA
sn4.1:3.3	You’re impure, but think yourself pure;	NA
sn4.1:3.4	you’ve strayed from the path of purity.”	NA
sn4.1:4.1	Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse:	NA
sn4.1:5.1	“I realized that it’s pointless;	NA
sn4.1:5.2	all that endless mortification	The split compound _amaraṁ tapaṁ_ also occurs at  [thag3.1:1.4](), and at [snp2.2:11.4]() we have _amarā bahū tapā_. The commentary explains that _amara_ here is “immortality”, and the phrase means “fervent mortification aimed at immortality”. However, I find this unconvincing, one reason being that _amara_ is an adjective (and thus must be glossed with an abstract noun in dative, _amarabhāvatthāya_). It is simpler to assume Pali has an idiomatic sense of _amara_ as “endless”, which occurs here, in the phrase _amarāvikkhepa_ ([dn1:2.23.1]()), and in the Niddesa’s _amarāvitakka_ ([cnd12:6.1]()). Then _amarā_ and _bahū_ are synonyms. I cannot find any use in Sanskrit that parallels this, but _amara_ is noted by Edgerton in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit as “a high number”.
sn4.1:5.3	is as futile	NA
sn4.1:5.4	as oars and rudder on dry land.	_Phiyāritta_ is the fittings for a boat at [an4.196:8.12](). _Phiya_ is perhaps Hybrid Sanskrit _sphija_, “broom”. _Aritta_ is Sanskrit _aritra_, “oar, rudder”. | _Dhammani_ (Vedic _dhanvan_, “desert”) is the neuter noun _dhamman_ in locative singular.

sn4.20:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans, in a wilderness hut on the slopes of the Himalayas.	NA
sn4.20:1.2	Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	NA
sn4.20:1.3	“I wonder if it’s possible to rule legitimately, without killing or having someone kill for you; without conquering or having someone conquer for you; without sorrowing or causing sorrow?”	Legend has it that the Buddha’s destiny was either to be Awakened or become a Wheel Turning Monarch. If he took the second path, he would indeed have ruled without violence ([mn91:5.8]()). Here the Buddha wonders whether this is really possible.
sn4.20:2.1	And then Māra the Wicked, knowing the Buddha’s train of thought, went up to him and said,	NA
sn4.20:2.2	“Rule, Blessed One! Rule, Holy One! Rule legitimately, without killing or having someone kill for you; without conquering or having someone conquer for you; without sorrowing or causing sorrow!”	Māra knows that even the most righteous ruler is afflicted with compromises and remains within his realm.

sn4.21:1.3	Now at that time several mendicants were meditating not far from the Buddha, diligent, keen, and resolute.	As often, here _viharanti_, literally “dwell”, means “meditate”.
sn4.21:1.4	Then Māra the Wicked manifested in the form of a brahmin with a large matted dreadlock, wearing an antelope hide. He was old, bent double, wheezing, and held a staff made of cluster fig tree wood. He went up to those mendicants and said,	The matted hair and antelope hide are well known symbols of the Brahmins. The “cluster fig tree” (_udumbara_) was used for ritual vessels, posts, and firewood, and was regarded as Prajāpatī’s tree, a special source of vitality (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 4.6.1.3).
sn4.21:1.5	“You’ve gone forth while young, reverends.  With pristine black hair, you’re blessed with youth, in the prime of life, and you’ve never flirted with sensual pleasures.	NA

sn4.21:1.8	“Brahmin, that’s not what we’re doing.	Even though these mendicants were diligent, their wisdom was not developed enough for them to recognize Māra.
sn4.21:1.9	We’re giving up what takes effect over time to chase after what is apparent in the present.	NA
sn4.21:1.10	For the Buddha says that sensual pleasures take effect over time; they give much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.	NA
sn4.21:1.11	But this teaching is apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.”	NA
sn4.21:1.12	When they had spoken, Māra the Wicked shook his head, waggled his tongue, raised his eyebrows until his brow puckered in three furrows, and departed leaning on his staff.	NA
sn4.21:2.1	Then those mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said,	NA

sn4.22:1.3	Then as Venerable Samiddhi was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	NA
sn4.22:1.4	“I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate,	NA

sn4.23:0.3	With Godhika	NA
sn4.23:1.1	So I have heard.	Compare the stories of Channa ([mn144](), [sn35.87]()), Vakkali ([sn22.87]()), and the suicidal Saṅgha ([sn54.9](), [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3]()).
sn4.23:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
sn4.23:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Godhika was staying on the slopes of Isigili at the Black Rock.	Godhika’s verse is at [thag1.51]().
sn4.23:1.4	Then Venerable Godhika, meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, experienced temporary freedom of heart.	“Temporary” (_sāmayikaṁ_) liberation is mentioned at [mn122:4.1](), where it contrasts with the “irreversible” liberation of the perfected one. It also appears in [an6.44]() and [an10.75](), and is defined in the Paṭisambhidāmagga as the four absorptions and four formless attainments ([ps1.5:26.2]()).
sn4.23:1.5	But then he fell away from that temporary freedom of heart.	The commentary explains that he was chronically ill, so could not progress in meditation despite strenuous efforts over a long time.
sn4.23:1.6	For a second …	NA

sn4.23:1.15	But for a sixth time he fell away from it.	NA
sn4.23:1.16	For a seventh time Godhika, meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, experienced temporary freedom of heart.	NA
sn4.23:2.1	Then he thought,	NA
sn4.23:2.2	“I’ve fallen away from this temporary freedom of heart no less than six times.	NA
sn4.23:2.3	Why don’t I commit suicide?”	The idiomatic phrase _satthahāraka_ (its verbal form here _satthaṁ āhareyyaṁ_ is reflexive optative first singular) is difficult. The obvious reading is to take _sattha_ as “knife”. However, that yields the sense “knife-bringer”, “assassin”, whereas the use of _idaṁ_ in [mn145:5.32]() shows it must be neuter, i.e. it is a thing not a person. Richard Gombrich suggests we read _sattha_ here as equivalent to Sanskrit _śvasita_, “breathing, life” (see Brahmali’s note on [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.49.1]()), yielding the sense “life-taker”, “breath-stealer”, “deadly weapon”. This agrees with the Vinaya commentary, which explains, “What does it take? Life.” (_Kiṃ harati? Jīvitaṁ_). Since this idiom is only used in the context of suicide, I use the normal English term.
sn4.23:2.4	And then Māra the Wicked, knowing Godhika’s train of thought, went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse:	NA
sn4.23:3.1	“O great hero, O greatly wise!	Māra uncharacteristically showers the Buddha with praise. It seems he is afraid that Godhika will slip beyond his grasp.
sn4.23:3.2	Shining with power and glory.	NA
sn4.23:3.3	You’ve gone beyond all threats and perils,	NA
sn4.23:3.4	I bow to your feet, O Clear-eyed One!	NA
sn4.23:4.1	Great hero, master of death,	NA
sn4.23:4.2	your disciple longs for death,	NA
sn4.23:4.3	he’s planning for it.	NA
sn4.23:4.4	Stop him, O light-bringer!	“Light-bringer” (_jutindhara_) is a curious epithet for Māra to use, not least because it is etymologically parallel to “Lucifer”.
sn4.23:5.1	For Blessed One, renowned among men,	NA
sn4.23:5.2	your disciple who loves your teaching,	NA
sn4.23:5.3	a trainee who hasn’t achieved their heart’s desire—	NA
sn4.23:5.4	how can they kill themselves?”	NA
sn4.23:6.1	Now at that time Venerable Godhika had already committed suicide.	NA
sn4.23:6.2	Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, addressed him in verse:	NA
sn4.23:7.1	“This is how the attentive act,	NA
sn4.23:7.2	for they don’t long for life.	NA
sn4.23:7.3	Having plucked out craving, root and all,	NA
sn4.23:7.4	Godhika is quenched.”	The Buddha confirms that he had attained arahantship, or irreversible liberation, which must have been shortly before he died. The Buddhist tradition says that only an arahant is allowed to take their own life, and only then in cases of terminal illness. However, it is possible to read the scriptural passages the other way. Since an arahant is incapable of doing anything wrong, the fact that they killed themselves shows there is nothing wrong with voluntary euthanasia in cases of incurable and imminent terminal illness.
sn4.23:8.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,	NA
sn4.23:8.2	“Come, mendicants, let’s go to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili where Godhika, who came from a good family, committed suicide.”	NA
sn4.23:8.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
sn4.23:9.1	Then the Buddha together with several mendicants went to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili.	NA
sn4.23:9.2	The Buddha saw Godhika off in the distance lying on his cot, having cast off the aggregates.	NA
sn4.23:9.3	Now at that time a cloud of black smoke was moving east, west, north, south, above, below, and in-between.	NA
sn4.23:10.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,	NA
sn4.23:10.2	“Mendicants, do you see that cloud of black smoke moving east, west, north, south, above, below, and in-between?”	NA
sn4.23:10.3	“Yes, sir.”	NA
sn4.23:10.4	“That’s Māra the Wicked searching for Godhika’s consciousness, wondering:	NA
sn4.23:10.5	‘Where is Godhika’s consciousness established?’	NA
sn4.23:10.6	But since his consciousness is not established, Godhika is quenched.”	NA
sn4.23:10.7	Then Māra, carrying his arched harp made from the pale timber of wood-apple, went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse:	The “arched harp” (_vīṇa_) was a multi-stringed instrument held in the lap, with the strings attached across a curved open arch or bow. It is not the modern Indian instrument called veena, which is a lute or stick zither. Pañcasikha’s harp is described in the same way ([dn21:1.2.4]()), and tradition says they were in fact the same instrument.
sn4.23:11.1	“Above, below, all round,	NA
sn4.23:11.2	in the four quarters and in-between,	NA
sn4.23:11.3	I’ve been searching without success:	NA
sn4.23:11.4	where has that Godhika got to?”	NA
sn4.23:12.1	“He was an attentive and steadfast sage,	NA

sn4.24:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.	According to the commentarial reckoning, this was in the fifth week after Awakening.
sn4.24:1.3	Now at that time Māra the Wicked had been pursuing the Buddha for seven years hoping to find a vulnerability without success.	This series of verses is a cleverly structured argument where Māra tries one method after another, always seeking to find something in the Buddha’s words or deeds that make him vulnerable. | Siddhattha had practiced for six years and had now only just realized Awakening, so either the number seven has been rounded up, or else Māra began his work before Siddhattha left home.
sn4.24:1.4	Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse:	NA
sn4.24:2.1	“Are you swamped by sorrow <j>that you meditate in the forest?	Māra begins the contest of wits by insinuating that something must have gone wrong for the Buddha to end up where he is, trying to play on feelings of self-doubt.

sn4.24:3.1	“I’ve dug out the root of sorrow completely.	The Buddha rejoins with a series of bold and incontrovertible claims, shutting down the idea that he is self-loathing.

sn4.24:6.1	“If you’ve discovered the path	Māra accepts, for rhetorical purposes, the Buddha’s claim that he has found a path Māra cannot see. Better, he argues, for the Buddha to walk it alone and not teach anyone.
sn4.24:6.2	that’s safe, and leads to freedom from death,	NA
sn4.24:6.3	go and walk that path alone—	NA

sn4.24:8.4	Whenever that crab extended a claw, those boys or girls would snap, crack, and break it off with a stick or a stone.	The crab “extends” a claw as a meditator after absorption “extends” the mind to insight ([mn4:27.1]()). See too the simile at [sn35.240]().

sn4.25:12.1	Then Māra’s daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to the Buddha, and stood to one side.	NA
sn4.25:12.2	Māra’s daughter Craving addressed the Buddha in verse:	NA

sn5.1:0.3	With Āḷavikā	NA
sn5.1:1.1	So I have heard.	This chapter naturally follows the previous, as it features Māra challenging various bhikkhunīs. Some of these verses are also included in the Therīgāthā, without the prose narrative. The commentarial backgrounds for the nuns are available in many sources, including Malalasekera’s *Dictionary of Pali proper Names*, and I will not repeat them here.
sn5.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
sn5.1:1.3	Then the nun Āḷavikā robed up in the morning and, taking her bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	Her name means “of Āḷavī”. This exchange (lacking Āḷavikā’s first verse) is echoed in [thig3.7](), where the author is named Selā. The commentary confirms that she is the same person, Selā of Āḷavī.
sn5.1:1.4	She wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on her return from almsround, she went to the Dark Forest seeking seclusion.	Normally one goes “for the day’s meditation” (_divāvihārāya_), whereas here, uniquely, the text has “seeking seclusion” (_vivekatthinī_). In line with this, the next sentence has Māra wanting her to “fall away from seclusion”, whereas normally it is “fall away from immersion”. Seclusion also occurs in Māra’s challenge. | The Dark Forest (_andhavana_) was a thick grove south of Sāvatthī often visited by monks and nuns for meditation. The commentary says the name means “Blind Man’s Forest”, giving an improbable origin story. But compare Sanskrit _andhakūpa_, “dark well” or “blind well”, a well covered over with a lid or overgrowth; also the name of a hell.
sn5.1:1.5	Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the nun Āḷavikā feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make her fall away from seclusion, went up to her and addressed her in verse:	NA
sn5.1:2.1	“There’s no escape in the world,	NA
sn5.1:2.2	so what will seclusion do for you?	NA
sn5.1:2.3	Enjoy erotic delights;	NA
sn5.1:2.4	don’t regret it later.”	NA
sn5.1:3.1	Then the nun Āḷavikā thought,	NA
sn5.1:3.2	“Who’s speaking this verse, a human or a non-human?”	NA
sn5.1:3.3	Then she thought,	NA
sn5.1:3.4	“This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from seclusion!”	She immediately recognizes him.
sn5.1:3.5	Then Āḷavikā, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse:	NA
sn5.1:4.1	“There is an escape in the world,	NA
sn5.1:4.2	and I’ve personally experienced it with wisdom.	NA
sn5.1:4.3	O Wicked One, kinsman of the negligent,	NA

sn5.2:0.3	With Somā	NA
sn5.2:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	NA
sn5.2:1.2	Then the nun Somā robed up in the morning and, taking her bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	For Pasenadi’s wife of the same name, see [mn90:3.1]() and note.
sn5.2:1.3	She wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on her return from almsround, she went to the Dark Forest for the day’s meditation,	NA
sn5.2:1.4	plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a tree to meditate.	NA
sn5.2:1.5	Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the nun Somā feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make her fall away from immersion, went up to her and addressed her in verse:	NA
sn5.2:2.1	“That state’s very challenging;	NA
sn5.2:2.2	it’s for the sages to attain.	NA
sn5.2:2.3	With her two-inch wisdom,	“Two-inch wisdom” (_dvaṅgulapaññā_) is literally “two finger(-breadth’s) wisdom”. It is explained by the commentary as limited wisdom; or because women hold thread between two fingers. The subcommentary and the commentary to the Therīgāthā say it is because women test whether rice is cooked by pressing a grain between two fingers. Normally, _aṅgula_ with a number is a unit of length equal to the width of the middle finger. For example, the time past noon is measured when the sun’s shadow moves two inches ([pli-tv-kd22:1.10.16]()), which is the same distance the shadow moves each month (Arthaśāstra 2.20.42). Thus the first commentarial explanation is the most plausible: “two-inch wisdom” means “limited wisdom”.
sn5.2:2.4	it’s not possible for a woman.”	It is Māra, not the Buddha, who doubts women’s capacity. It is interesting to see who adopts Māra’s view. In Mahāvastu 3.391, a brahmin ascetic urges a female competitor to throw a debating match with him, lest people say that he was beaten by “a mere woman’s two-inch wisdom”. In [vv18:8.4](), a former serving woman celebrates how she as a woman attained the Dhamma, but the commentary says this was “despite her two-inch thick intelligence”. In the late literary text Bṛhatkathāślokasaṁgraha the idiom is employed by a woman to dismiss women’s wit (22.35)—as so often, a woman makes the best misogynist—or by a man who muses that perhaps men like him are the real fools since they allow women to entice them (22.302–3).
sn5.2:3.1	Then the nun Somā thought,	NA
sn5.2:3.2	“Who’s speaking this verse, a human or a non-human?”	NA

sn5.2:3.5	Then Somā, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse:	NA

[thig11.1:7.3]() reads _Na cāpi te dutiyo atthi koci_, “There is no male companion with you”. The two lines use _dutiya_ (“second”) in different senses, as the ordinal number, and as “companion”. The Therīgāthā commentary offers two explanations, the second of which appears to lean on a version of the line similar to that found here. This, together with the fact that the unusual term _vaṇṇadhātu_ seems like a direct reference to her name, suggests that this version may be the original one.

The Buddha declared that one who does not consent is innocent. It seems hard to reconcile the two events, unless the Vinaya incident was when she was young and not yet accomplished. If that were the case, perhaps Māra is deliberately capitalizing on the past assault, assuming she will be traumatized by it.

sn6.1:0.2	1. The Appeal	NA
sn6.1:0.3	The Appeal of the Divinity	NA
sn6.1:1.1	So I have heard.	A similar account is told of Gotama Buddha at [mn26:19.2](), [mn85:43.2](), and [pli-tv-kd1:5.2.2](), and of Vipassī at [dn14:3.1.4]().
sn6.1:1.2	At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying in Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.	NA
sn6.1:1.3	Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	NA
sn6.1:1.4	“This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute.	NA
sn6.1:1.5	But people like clinging, they love it and enjoy it.	NA
sn6.1:1.6	It’s hard for them to see this topic; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination.	“Specific conditionality” (_ idappaccayatā_) refers to the fact that dependent origination traces the specific conditions for other specific things: this conditions that. It is not a general principle of universal conditionality (“everything is interconnected”). | Dependent origination ([paṭiccasamuppāda]()) is treated in detail in SN 12.
sn6.1:1.7	It’s also hard for them to see this topic; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.	NA
sn6.1:1.8	And if I were to teach this principle, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.”	Up to this point, the Bodhisatta has been solely concerned with finding the answer to his quest, and only now does he think of sharing it with others. The idea that he had made an aspiration for Buddhahood in the long ago past out of a desire to help all sentient beings is not supported in early texts.
sn6.1:1.9	And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to the Buddha:	“Not supernaturally inspired” (_anacchariyā_) rejects the Vedic “channeling” of scripture from the Divinity, while “not learned before in the past” (_pubbe assutapubbā_), echoing the Dhammacakkappavattanasutta ([sn56.11:5.1]()), rejects the oral tradition.
sn6.1:2.1	“I’ve struggled hard to realize this,	NA
sn6.1:2.2	enough with trying to explain it!	NA
sn6.1:2.3	Those mired in greed and hate	NA
sn6.1:2.4	can’t really understand this teaching.	NA
sn6.1:3.1	It goes against the stream, subtle,	NA
sn6.1:3.2	deep, obscure, and very fine.	NA
sn6.1:3.3	Those besotted by greed cannot see,	NA
sn6.1:3.4	for they’re shrouded in a mass of darkness.”	NA
sn6.1:4.1	And as the Buddha reflected like this, his mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.	Had he followed this inclination he would have been a _paccekabuddha_, a Buddha “awakened for himself”.
sn6.1:5.1	Then the divinity Sahampati, knowing the Buddha’s train of thought, thought,	While Sahampati features prominently in the suttas, no deity of that name is found in early Brahmanical texts. He seems, however, to be the Buddhist version of Brahmā Svayambhū, the “Self-born Divinity”, to whom Yājñavalkya traces the authority of his teaching lineage (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.6.3, 4.5.3, 6.5.4). Yājñavalkya identifies this “self-born” with the sun (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.9.3.16; see also Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 4.6.6) and with Prajāpati (13.5.3.1). Explaining the origin of the soma rite of the “All-Sacrifice”, he says that Brahmā Svayambhū, while performing fervent austerities, decided to offer his self to all creatures and all creatures to his self, thus establishing lordship (_adhipatya_) over all creatures (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13.7.1.1). The root _pati_ (“lord”) here establishes a linguistic link with _sahampati_. Further, in the earliest use of _svayambhū_ at Rig Veda 10.83.4, the “self-born” deity Manyu “prevails” (_sahuriḥ sahāvān_) in battle. Thus we can identify Sahampati, the “Lord Who Prevails”, with the highest divinity recognized by Yājñavalkya, who originated as victor in battle, whose physical manifestation is the sun, whose spiritual function is to imbue all creatures with divinity, and who serves as the ultimate source of authority. Meanwhile, the epithet _sayambhū_ was taken for the Buddha ([pli-tv-kd11:35.1.37]()).
sn6.1:5.2	“Oh lord! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.”	Having surpassed the greatest of the Brahmanical contemplatives, the Buddha’s achievement is recognized by the chief Brahmanical divinity. | The Pali _vata bho_ works much like the English exclamation “oh lord” as an appeal to authority (_bho_), often in a purely rhetorical sense.
sn6.1:5.3	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared in front of the Buddha.	NA
sn6.1:5.4	He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:	NA
sn6.1:5.5	“Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma!	NA
sn6.1:5.6	There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching.	NA
sn6.1:5.7	There will be those who understand the teaching!”	Sahampati is the one who recognizes the potential in all beings, since it was he who imbued them with divinity. He did this to ensure dominance, but now his motive has transformed into compassion.
sn6.1:5.8	This is what the divinity Sahampati said. Then he went on to say:	NA
sn6.1:6.1	“Among the Magadhans there appeared in the past	NA
sn6.1:6.2	an impure teaching thought up by the stained.	The “impure teaching” was, according to the commentary, that of the six ascetic teachers, who are regularly associated with Magadha (eg. [sn2.30](), [snp3.6](), [dn2]()). Less likely it refers to Brahmanical teachers like Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta, who are more closely associated with Kosala and whose system is regarded as passed down rather than “thought up”.
sn6.1:6.3	Fling open the door to freedom from death!	“Freedom from death” (_amata_, Sanskrit _amṛta_) is yet another Brahmanical term transformed by the Buddha. Its Vedic meaning was “immortality”, and hence the “ambrosia” of soma through which immortality was gained. For the Buddha, as seen in the “noble quest” itself, it was the freedom from the cycles of birth, aging, and death.
sn6.1:6.4	Let them hear the teaching <j>the immaculate one discovered.	NA
sn6.1:7.1	Standing high on a rocky mountain,	NA
sn6.1:7.2	you can see the people all around.	NA
sn6.1:7.3	In just the same way, All-seer, so intelligent,	NA
sn6.1:7.4	having ascended the Temple of Truth,	NA
sn6.1:7.5	rid of sorrow, look upon the people	NA
sn6.1:7.6	swamped with sorrow,  <j>oppressed by rebirth and old age.	NA
sn6.1:8.1	Rise, hero! Victor in battle, caravan leader,	Here we see a verbal echo of Sahampati’s martial origins.
sn6.1:8.2	wander the world cleared of debt.	A “caravan leader” (_satthavāha_) guides their flock through treacherous deserts and wastelands, as illustrated at [dn23:23.3](). | _Anaṇa_ (“debtless”) is a technical term in the Vedic system. According to Manu 6.35–7, a renunciate must first pay off three debts: study of Vedas, begetting a son, and offering of sacrifices. One who goes forth with these debts unpaid is headed for a downfall. The Buddha has indeed paid off all these debts: he studied the Vedas under his former teachers ([mn26:15.6]()); he has a son Rāhula; and his path is regarded as the highest form of sacrifice ([dn5:24.1]()). But in Buddhism the concept is reinterpreted as meaning one has let go of all defilements, becoming a “perfected”, literally “worthy” one, after which one can eat almsfood free of debt ([mn124:38.1](), [sn16.11:13.2]()).
sn6.1:8.3	Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma!	NA
sn6.1:8.4	There will be those who understand!”	NA
sn6.1:9.1	Then the Buddha, understanding the Divinity’s invitation, surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, out of his compassion for sentient beings.	NA
sn6.1:9.2	And the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not.	Here we see the sense of _indriya_ as “spiritual potential”. Originally it was the state of excited energy produced by soma that allowed Indra to manifest his full power and overcome his foes. It implicitly links back to the five spiritual qualities that the Buddha attributed to his teachers, which he later formalized as “faculties”. Here as there, the idea creates a connection between beings, a recognition of shared qualities that, when properly nurtured, can mature into awakening. | For the “fault to do with the next world” see [an2.1]().
sn6.1:9.3	It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them.	NA
sn6.1:9.4	In the same way, the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not.	NA
sn6.1:9.5	When he had seen this he replied in verse to the divinity Sahampati:	NA
sn6.1:10.1	“Flung open are the doors to freedom from death!	NA
sn6.1:10.2	Let those with ears to hear commit to faith.	_Pamuñcantu saddhaṁ_ has long troubled translators, as the basic sense of _pamuñcantu_ is “release”. The problem is a long-standing one, for Sanskrit variants include _pramodantu_ (“celebrate”) or _praṇudantu kāṅkṣāḥ_ (“dispel doubts”). I think it is a poetic variant of _adhimuñcantu_, to “decide” or “commit” to faith; it is extremely common in Pali to use a synonymous verb to reinforce the sense of the noun. In [snp5.19](), _muttasaddho_, _pamuñcassu saddhaṁ_, and _adhimuttacittaṁ_ are all used in this sense.
sn6.1:10.3	Thinking it would be troublesome, Divinity, <j>I did not teach	NA
sn6.1:10.4	the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among mankind.”	NA
sn6.1:11.1	Then the divinity Sahampati, knowing that his request for the Buddha to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.	NA

sn6.2:6.3	Why don’t I honor and respect and rely on the same Dhamma to which I was awakened?”	NA
sn6.2:7.1	Then the divinity Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared in front of the Buddha.	NA
sn6.2:7.2	He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:	NA

Normally it means “greatness” but it can also stand for the Sanskrit _mahātman_, “great Self”. Read in that way the two phrases _attakāma_ and _mahattamabhikaṅkhatā_ would both mean “desiring the True Self” in the Upaniṣadic system. For the Buddha, they meant perfecting oneself through development.

sn6.3:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
sn6.3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
sn6.3:1.3	Now at that time a certain brahmin lady had a son called Brahmadeva, who had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the Buddha.	This pair is found only here.
sn6.3:2.1	Then Venerable Brahmadeva, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
sn6.3:2.2	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	NA
sn6.3:2.3	And Venerable Brahmadeva became one of the perfected.	NA
sn6.3:3.1	Then Brahmadeva robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	NA
sn6.3:3.2	Wandering indiscriminately for almsfood in Sāvatthī, he approached his own mother’s home.	NA
sn6.3:3.3	Now at that time Brahmadeva’s mother, the brahmin lady, was presenting a regular oblation to the Divinity.	For “presenting a regular oblation” (_āhutiṁ niccaṁ paggaṇhāti_) compare Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.9.2.19, where the sacrificer “seizes” (_sampragṛhṇāti_) the cup and spoon to make an oblation (_āhuti_). This is a householder “sacrifice with wife” (_patnīsaṃyāja_), where an oblation of ghee is offered to four pairs of gods with their wives for the sake of offspring. The lady of the house sits to the south-west of the fire. Here, however, she appears to be the chief sponsor.

sn6.3:4.3	But the Divinity doesn’t eat that kind of food.	See Chāndogya Upaniṣad 4.3.7, where Brahmā is said to be the most magnificent because he eats what is not food.
sn6.3:4.4	Why pray, when you don’t know the path to divinity?	The “path to divinity” (_brahmapatha_) is said to be for one who sees the Self in the eye as the immortal Divinity. One such, even should they have no proper funeral service, travels after death along the path of light where they are received by a non-human who leads them to Divinity, from which there is no return (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 4.15).

sn6.4:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
sn6.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	The opening is shared with [mn49](), except there the Buddha recalls an encounter at Ukkaṭṭhā. See also [ja405]().
sn6.4:1.3	Now at that time Baka the Divinity had the following harmful misconception:	Baka maintains the same wrong view at [mn49:2.2](), where he engages the Buddha in philosophical debate. The word _baka_ means “stork” or “crane”. To search for a high divinity of this name in Brahmanism is to be disappointed, for instead we find a man-eating demon (_rakṣasa_) in bird form whose fate is to be slain by the hero Bhīma (or Kṛṣṇa). Pali stories tell of how the stork dozes peacefully as if meditating by the water, while in reality he is trying to fool fish into approaching so he can snatch them up ([ja38](), [ja236]()). A cunning, large, white, high-flying, predatory bird who fakes meditation is a fitting image for the antagonist of these suttas.
sn6.4:1.4	“This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is whole, this is not liable to pass away. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.”	The use of the impersonal pronoun (_idaṁ_) to refer to the self as divinity is a characteristic Upaniṣadic idiom: “you are that” (_tat tvam asi_, Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.8.7); “that self is divinity” (_ayam ātmā brahma_, Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 1.2); “I am that” (_so’ham asmi_, Īśa Upaniṣad 16); “this is that self hidden in all” (_eṣa ta ātmā sarvāntaraḥ_, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.4.1, etc.); “this, verily, is that” (_etad vai tat_, Kaṭha Upaniṣad 2.1.5). | For _idaṁ niccaṁ_ see _eṣa nityo_ (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.23); for _idaṁ dhuvaṁ_ see _etad apramayaṁ dhruvam_ (4.4.20). | “Whole” (_kevala_) is a Brahmanical term indicating complete union with Divinity.
sn6.4:2.1	Then the Buddha knew what Baka the Divinity was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that realm of divinity.	NA

[dn1:2.5.2]()). Second, the Buddha does not, in fact, claim to be one of “infinite vision” (_anantadassī_) in early Pali. Third, the text reads straightforwardly as a statement by Baka. Fourth, _bhagavā_ is widely used as a term of respectful address in the Upaniṣads, while later Sanskrit uses _anantadṛṣṭi_ as an epithet of Indra or Śiva. The rhetorical posture is similar to [dn11:83.6](); Baka is overcompensating, his bluster betraying his insecurity.

sn6.4:6.3	What was my past practice of precept and observance?

sn6.4:7.4	I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep.	This unusual phrase is, I think, suggestive of a key difference between the Upaniṣads and the Buddha. The Upaniṣads frequently treat the state of sleep and dream as a mystical union, where a person draws closer to divinity, and which appears as a mysterious analogue or manifestation of deep contemplation or realization (eg. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.1.16 ff.). I believe the Buddha is called the “Awakened One” in deliberate contrast with that way of knowing.

sn6.5:1.3	“No ascetic or brahmin can come here!”	“Here” is the realm of divinity. It is characteristic of Indian religion to depict a struggle for supremacy between sages and the gods. From a Buddhist point of view, all the gods are simply beings who did good things in the past and hence will enjoy an exalted status for a while.

When these verses were quoted by Moggallāna in a list of his great deeds at [mn50:29.3]() and [thag20.1:59.3](), the prose narrative is omitted, avoiding this problem. Moreover, both those passages identify the location as “the Hall of Justice before the assembly”, which does not fit the current discourse. It seems the verses and prose may have different origins.

sn6.10:1.2	Then the mendicant Kokālika went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
sn6.10:1.3	“Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have corrupt wishes. They’ve fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes.”	NA

sn6.10:2.1	Then Kokālika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	NA
sn6.10:2.2	Not long after he left his body erupted with boils the size of mustard seeds.	NA
sn6.10:2.3	The boils grew to the size of mung beans, then chickpeas, then jujube seeds, then jujubes, then myrobalans, then unripe wood-apples, then ripe wood-apples. Finally they burst open, and pus and blood oozed out.	NA
sn6.10:2.4	Then the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness.	NA
sn6.10:2.5	He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.	NA
sn6.10:3.1	Then, late at night, the glorious divinity Sahampati, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	NA

sn6.10:5.1	When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha,	NA
sn6.10:5.2	“Sir, how long is the lifespan in the Pink Lotus hell?”	NA
sn6.10:5.3	“It’s long, mendicant.	NA
sn6.10:5.4	It’s not easy to calculate	NA

sn6.10:5.6	“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?”	NA
sn6.10:5.7	“It’s possible,” said the Buddha.	NA
sn6.10:6.1	“Suppose there was a Kosalan load of twenty packs of sesame seed. And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it.	Duration by the “Kosalan load” comes to either 150 billion years (using the Arthaśāstra _khāri_) or 25 billion years (using the Pali _khāri_). Neither of these results agrees with the other calculations in this Sutta. The correspondence is not in the result but the simple numbers: twenty packs each hundred years correspond to the twenty times ten of the hells.
sn6.10:6.2	By this means the Kosalan load of twenty packs of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell.	Ten hells are listed here, the names of which do not correspond with the 21 or 28 listed in Purāṇas, nor with the seven Jain hells, nor with the hells of [mn130](). The commentary offers three explanations for the obscure names of these hells: they are numbers reflecting the duration spent in Avīci; or they are the cries uttered by those suffering there; or they are simply the cold hells. | For other meanings of _abbuda_, see [sn10.1:3.2](), [sn1.77:1.4]().
sn6.10:6.3	Now, twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Nirabbuda hell.	The Sanskrit _nyarbuda_ (or _nirbuda_) is said, rather, to be ten times the _arbuda_. The expansion in a series of twenty is required to reach the final number, a multiple of 512.
sn6.10:6.4	Twenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Ababa hell.	NA
sn6.10:6.5	Twenty lifetimes in the Ababa hell equal one lifetime in the Aṭaṭa hell.	NA

sn6.10:6.9	Twenty lifetimes in the Fragrant Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the Blue Water Lily hell.	The “Fragrant Water Lily” (_sogandhika_) is variously identified as blue or white.
sn6.10:6.10	Twenty lifetimes in the Blue Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the White Lotus hell.	NA
sn6.10:6.11	Twenty lifetimes in the White Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Pink Lotus hell.	By this calculation, the Pink Lotus lasts for 10⁷ ×  20⁹ = 5.12 × 10¹⁸ years.
sn6.10:6.12	The mendicant Kokālika has been reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.”	NA

sn6.13:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans at Andhakavinda.	The Buddha taught Ānanda there ([an5.114]()). It lay to the west of Rājagaha on the road from Varanasi. Once, arriving there from Varanasi, the Buddha allowed porridge ([pli-tv-kd6:24.1.1](), cf. [an5.207]()). At [pli-tv-kd2:12.1.1](), Mahākassapa was swept away in a river while returning from Andhakavinda. That river is identified by the commentary as the Serpentine, but that is usually said to be the Panchane, which lies to the east of Rājagaha. Perhaps the river near Andhakavinda was, rather, the Paimar, which lies about three hours walk to the west of Rājagaha.

sn6.14:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
sn6.14:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
sn6.14:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
sn6.14:2.1	“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a king named Aruṇavā.	At [dn14:1.12.4]() he is called Aruṇa.
sn6.14:2.2	He had a capital named Aruṇavatī.	NA
sn6.14:2.3	Sikhī the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha lived supported by Aruṇavatī.	Sikhī means “halo” or “crown”. [dn14:1.12.4]() says Aruṇa was his father, and Pabhāvatī his mother. The son of King Dawn and Queen Radiant in the City of the Dawn, Sikhī is the streaming rays of sunrise. These names recall a solar myth.
sn6.14:2.4	Sikhī had a fine pair of chief disciples named Abhibhū and Sambhava.	Abhibhū (“Victor”) and Sambhava (“son of Śambhu the blessed”) are also at [dn14:1.9.2](). _Śambhu_ is commonly found in the Rig Veda in the sense, “blessing, benefit”, and became a common name or epithet of gods, etc.
sn6.14:2.5	Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū,	NA
sn6.14:2.6	‘Come, brahmin, let’s go to one of the realms of divinity until it’s time for our meal.’	Gotama occasionally addresses a mendicant as brahmin, but only by way of special encouragement (eg. [mn86:17.6]()).
sn6.14:2.7	‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū.	NA

sn6.14:3.3	‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Then he educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk.	NA
sn6.14:3.4	But the Divinity, his assembly, and his retinue complained, grumbled, and objected,	NA
sn6.14:3.5	‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! How on earth can a disciple teach Dhamma in the presence of the Teacher?’	NA

sn6.14:4.5	‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Then he taught Dhamma with his body visible; with his body invisible; with the lower half visible and the upper half invisible; and with the upper half visible and the lower half invisible.	This display is unique in the Suttas. It is referred to at [ps3.2:15.2](), which calls it “the power of transformation” (_vikubbanā iddhi_), for which see [dn18:22.3]() and [thag20.1:44.3]().

sn6.15:1.3	“Come now, mendicants, I say to you all:	NA
sn6.15:1.4	‘Conditions fall apart. Persist with diligence.’”	This is perhaps the briefest summary possible of the Buddha’s teaching. The world as it is, and all the beings in it, are created and sustained through conditions. Since the conditions that sustain them are finite, the conditioned phenomena are also finite and must come to an end. Reflecting on this gives rise to gratitude for the life we have and the opportunities it grants us, and determination to live and practice dedicated to the realization of the unconditioned, Nibbana.
sn6.15:1.5	These were the Realized One’s last words.	The commentary says this line was added at the Council.
sn6.15:2.1	Then the Buddha entered the first absorption. Emerging from that, he entered the second absorption. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the third absorption, the fourth absorption, the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Then he entered the cessation of perception and feeling.	Even on his deathbed, the Buddha retains mastery over his mind.| At this point in [dn16:6.8.2](), Ānanda and Anuruddha discuss whether the Buddha is dead.
sn6.15:3.1	Then he emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling and entered the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the dimension of nothingness, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of infinite space, the fourth absorption, the third absorption, the second absorption, and the first absorption. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the second absorption and the third absorption. Then he entered the fourth absorption.

sn7.1:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
sn7.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
sn7.1:1.3	Now at that time the wife of a certain brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan, a brahmin lady named Dhanañjānī, was devoted to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.	Bhāradvāja features as the default Brahmanical clan in the Suttas, especially as antagonists who nonetheless are liable for conversion. The clan founder Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya, who is occasionally mentioned as a deity ([dn32:10.3]()), authored Maṇḍala 6 of the Rig Veda ([dn13:13.1]()). It would seem their star had dimmed, for they are listed as a low family ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:2.1.18]()). | A devotee named Dhanañjānī appears in [mn100](). She is perhaps the same person, although the setting and most of the narrative details are different. | The two names have the same sense: _bhāradvāja_ is the “swift plunderer of booty”, while _dhanañjānī_ is the “winner of wealth”, an epithet of Indra (and the name of a tariff-skimming brahmin at [mn97:2.13]()). These recall a much earlier age, when a raider on horseback or chariot would descend on villages and make off with the booty. Compare Vedic _vājambhara_ (the swift “prize-winning” horse), and see O.H. De A. Wijesekera, *Buddhist and Vedic Studies*, p. 249.
sn7.1:1.4	Once, while she was bringing her husband his meal, she tripped and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times:	NA
sn7.1:2.1	“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	This now-ubiquitous phrase is spoken only nine times in the Suttas: seven times by brahmins, and once each by Indra and Pasenadi.
sn7.1:3.1	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	NA
sn7.1:4.1	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!”	NA
sn7.1:5.1	When she said this, the brahmin said to Dhanañjānī:	NA
sn7.1:5.2	“That’d be right. For the slightest thing this lowlife woman spouts out praise for that bald ascetic.	The term “lowlife” (_vasala_,  literally “little bullock”) is used of a degenerate gambler (Rig Veda 10.34.11). It is a word for one who violates _dharma_ (justice, duty, goodness) through one’s actions, rather than being a description of birth (Manu 8.16).
sn7.1:5.3	Right now, lowlife woman, I’m going to refute your teacher’s doctrine!”	NA
sn7.1:5.4	“Brahmin, I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who can refute the doctrine of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
sn7.1:5.5	But anyway, you should go. When you’ve gone you’ll understand.”	NA
sn7.1:6.1	Then the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan, angry and upset, went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
sn7.1:6.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,	NA

sn7.1:9.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	NA
sn7.1:9.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.

Its meaning is obscure, but I think the sense is _jāta_ (“those who have been born”, i.e. “mortals”) plus _vedas_ (“knowledge”), i.e. “one who brings knowledge to mortals”. This is the fire-god Agni, who comes down from the sun to the sacrificial fire, bringing light and awareness and Vedic knowledge to those who have been born, namely mortal humans. In this passage, it implies that anyone who “has been born” can “give birth” to “knowledge” regardless of their “birth”.

sn7.9:9.2	“Brahmin, I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who can properly digest these leftovers, except for the Realized One or one of his disciples.	At [snp3.4:34.4]() the Buddha recommends giving instead to arahants.
sn7.9:9.3	Well then, brahmin, throw out those leftovers where there is little that grows, or drop them into water that has no living creatures.”	In a text on the _agnihotra_, Prajāpatī is depicted as pouring the oblation on plants and water (Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 6.2). The Āpastamba Dharmasūtra says that the student must “not leave any food uneaten. If he is unable to do so, he should bury the leftovers in the ground, (or) throw them in the water” (1.4.12).
sn7.9:10.1	So Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā dropped the leftover oblation in water that had no living creatures.	NA
sn7.9:10.2	And when those leftovers were placed in the water, they sizzled and hissed, steaming and fuming.	NA

sn7.9:11.1	Then the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā, shocked and awestruck, went up to the Buddha, and stood to one side.	NA
sn7.9:11.2	The Buddha addressed him in verse:	In these verses, the Buddha systematically critiques and realigns the fire sacrifice.
sn7.9:12.1	“When you’re kindling the wood, brahmin,	NA
sn7.9:12.2	don’t imagine this is purity, for it’s just external.	NA
sn7.9:12.3	For those who are skilled say this is no way to purity,	NA

sn7.9:13.1	I’ve given up kindling firewood, brahmin,	NA
sn7.9:13.2	now I light only the inner flame.	NA
sn7.9:13.3	Always blazing, always serene,	This passage plays on the homonyms _samādahati_ (“kindle”, root meaning “to burn”) and _samādahati_ (“serene”, “stilled”, “immersed”, root meaning “to place”). He no longer “burns” the sacred flame, but “is serene” with the inner light of _samādhi_.
sn7.9:13.4	I am a perfected one leading the spiritual life.	NA
sn7.9:14.1	Conceit, brahmin, is the burden of your pack,	Such passages of equivalences or connections are characteristic of post-Vedic literature. For example, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.6 says the _juhū_ spoon is speech, the _upabhṛt_ cup  the mind, the dhruvā_ vessel the eye, the _sruvā_ ladle the mental power, the bath the truth, the conclusion heaven. | A “pack” (_khāri_) was originally “donkey-load”, but here it must be a heavy weight for a single person. The Buddha is saying that carrying around the cenceit of “self” is a heavy burden.
sn7.9:14.2	anger your smoke, and lies your ashes.	Smoke conveys the sacrifice to heaven (eg. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3.7.133, “May smoke rise to the sky, light to heaven, may ash fill the earth). For smoke in the sense of “fuming”, see [an4.200:13.1](), [mn23:2.1](). | Sacred ash, the purifying divine residue from the fire, was smeared on the forehead or body as a sign of holiness. Here, however, the implication is that when the “fuming” anger is cold, all that is left are the lies spoken in the heat of rage. The line plays with the curse that those who hate us should be reduced to ashes (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 6.6.3.10, see [mn93:18.19]()).
sn7.9:14.3	The tongue is the ladle, the heart the fireplace;	The _sujā_ (Sanskrit _sruvā_) is a small ladle of _udumbara_ fig wood. It is dipped into the ghee or milk, lapping like a tongue, a metaphor often deployed in the Rig Veda (1.61.5, 3.31.3, 5.1.3, 10.109.5). The sacrifice of ghee, honey, and milk is driven by the craving to experience such delicious tastes. | The _jotiṭhāna_ (“fireplace”) was a depression in the ground in which the fire was kindled. Here _joti_ must be translated “fire”, but it is the same word as “light” in the next line. The Buddha is saying that the light/fire is kindled in the heart (_hadayaṁ jotiṭhānaṁ_). This draws on Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.7, where the Self is the “light within the heart” (_hṛdyantarjyoti_).
sn7.9:14.4	a well-tamed self is a person’s light.	_Attā … purisassa joti_ is a direct reference to Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.2. Janaka asks Yājñavalkya, “What is this person’s light?” (_kiṃjyotirayaṃ puruṣa_). Yājñavalkya answers, “The self, indeed, is his light” (_ātmaivāsya jyotirbhavati_). The key difference is the term “well-tamed” (_sudanto_). For the Buddha, what is known as a “self” is conditioned and changing, so must be developed, and only then becomes a blessing. In such cases, “self” is practically equivalent to “mind”.
sn7.9:15.1	The teaching is a lake, brahmin, <j>into which ethics are the stairs,	The lake (_rahada_) was a pool of water into which the sacrificer descends seeking renewal or protection (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 4.1.5.12, 4.4.5.10). | The _tittha_ was the sacred bathing place, originally the stairs or descent that provided passage to the waters. | This verse occurs independently at [sn7.21:3.1]().
sn7.9:15.2	unclouded, praised by the fine to the good.	NA
sn7.9:15.3	There the knowledge masters go to bathe,	NA
sn7.9:15.4	and cross to the far shore with dry limbs.	The use of deliberate paradox—bathe without getting wet—is characteristic of Vedic verse. The water rolls off them as it does a lotus.
sn7.9:16.1	Truth, principle, restraint, the spiritual life,	See similar sets of virtues at [dn30:1.6.2]() and [sn24.6:1.7](). | This verse seems clumsy to me, and I retain that in the translation.
sn7.9:16.2	attaining divinity based on the middle, brahmin—	“Attainment of divinity” (_brahmapatti_) is found in Brahmanical sense at Katha Upaniṣad 6.18.
sn7.9:16.3	pay homage to the upright ones.	The commentary says the _t_ in _sat_ is a mere particle, and the pronoun should be read as second person. | The “upright ones” are the arahants.
sn7.9:16.4	I declare that man one who follows the teaching.”	_Dhammasārī_ is a unique phrase. Normally, _sārī_ means “one who follows”, making this an abbreviation of _dhammānusārī_, a “follower of teachings”. Elsewhere, however, this refers only to a specific stage prior to stream-entry ([sn25.1:2.1]()). We do find _dhammasāra_ elsewhere in the sense “heartwood of the teaching” ([sn55.43:5.3](), [thag16.3:18.2]()), and perhaps _sārī_ here means “having the essence of”. This form is not attested in Pali, but it is found in Sanskrit. Such an option is not endorsed by the commentary, which supplies two possibilities. One relies on the causative form _sāretvā_, “one who makes unskilful qualities leave”. The second is curious: one is “covered by the _sārī_ of Dhamma”. That this means the saree dress is confirmed by the subcommentary’s “dressed and decorated”. If correct, this may be the earliest occurrence of _sārī_ in this sense; the standard Pali spelling is _sāṭī_. By this reading we might translate, “draped in the teaching”. | “That man” according to the commentary refers to one who practices in such a way.

sn7.11:1.1	So I have heard.	This discourse recurs at [snp1.4]() with a longer narrative. Vedic hymns include invocations to the “Lord of the Field” to bless the plowing and the crops (Rig Veda 4.57.4), but it is unorthodox to see a brahmin farmer.
sn7.11:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans in the Southern Hills near the brahmin village of Ekanāḷa.	The Southern Hills (_dakkhiṇāgiri_, “Deccan”) is the Vindhya Range that lies on the southern border of Magadha, leading southwest to Avanti. The Buddha and his disciples visited there so rarely that people complained ([pli-tv-kd1:53.1.3]()). | Ekanāḷa (“one-stalk”) appears only here.
sn7.11:1.3	Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Farmer had harnessed around five hundred plows, it being the season for sowing.	NA
sn7.11:1.4	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to where Bhāradvāja the Farmer was working.	NA
sn7.11:2.1	Now at that time Bhāradvāja the Farmer was distributing food.	Atharvaveda 6.142.3 says that the “givers” of the grain shall be inexhaustible, perhaps suggesting a food distribution practice.
sn7.11:2.2	Then the Buddha went to where the distribution was taking place and stood to one side.	NA
sn7.11:2.3	Bhāradvāja the Farmer saw him standing for alms	NA

Often it is just an idiom expressing rainfall, while in other cases, as here, it has a religious connotation. For this reason I use “the heavens” for _deva_ in such cases. It is a Vedic idiom (eg. Rig Veda 5.84.3 _divo varṣanti_;  9.108.10 _vṛṣṭiṃ divaḥ pavasva_; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 4.3.1.16 _divo varṣati_).

sn7.13:1.2	Now at that time the Buddha was afflicted by winds.	_Vātehābādhika_ is a syntactic compound, “afflicted by winds” (_vātehi_). It is one of the illnesses noted at [an10.60:7.4](). In Ayurveda, diseases of the winds may have many causes, chief among them faulty digestion.
sn7.13:1.3	Venerable Upavāna was his carer.	In [dn16:5.4.5]() Upavāna was said to have been the Buddha’s carare for a long time. The events of this discourse are recalled by him in his verses at [thag2.33]().
sn7.13:1.4	Then the Buddha said to Upavāna,	NA
sn7.13:1.5	“Please, Upavāna, find some hot water for me.”	Typically ghee or other oil is recommended rather than hot water.
sn7.13:1.6	“Yes, sir,” replied Upavāna. He robed up, and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the brahmin Devahita, and stood silently to one side.	Devahita appears only here.

sn7.21:1.2	Now at that time there was a brahmin named Saṅgārava staying in Sāvatthī. He practiced purification by water, believing in purification by water. He lived committed to the practice of immersing himself in water at dawn and dusk.	A Saṅgārava of Sāvatthī appears in a number of discourses, and his spiritual progression can be traced. Here he practices purification in water, and (apparently later) asked the Buddha about sacrifice ([an3.60]()). He further asked how hymns are remembered ([sn46.55](), [an5.193]()). In all these discourses he was said to have gone for refuge at the end. Finally he asks the more meaningful spiritual question about the near shore and far shore ([an10.117](), [an10.169]()). It is possible that the teenage “student” (_māṇava_) Saṅgārava living at Caṇḍalakappa ([mn100]()) graduated and moved to nearby Sāvatthī where he became known as the “brahmin” Saṅgārava. This would only make sense, however, if we disregard the statements on going for refuge, as he clearly followed the Brahmanical path for quite some time.

This quasi-physical understanding of good and evil predates the Buddha, and is found among Jains as well. The practice of ritual bathing is also listed among the self-mortifications, but it seems to fit better here, as bathing in India is not unpleasant ([mn12:45.12]()).

sn7.22:0.3	At Khomadussa	NA
sn7.22:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
sn7.22:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, where they have a town named Khomadussa.	_Khomadussa_ (“linen-cloth”) was probably named for the main product of the town. Flax for linen prefers temperate climes and is grown in northern India.
sn7.22:1.3	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Khomadussa for alms.	NA
sn7.22:1.4	Now at that time the brahmins and householders of Khomadussa were gathered in the council hall for some business, while a gentle rain drizzled down.	_Brāhmaṇagahapatikā_ means “brahmins and householders” rather than “brahmin householders”. It is a term for the “landed gentry”. A householder is a landowner, not just a lay person. Council discussions were for the upper class, not the general populace (_negamajānapadā_).
sn7.22:1.5	Then the Buddha approached that council.	NA
sn7.22:1.6	The brahmins and householders saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,	NA
sn7.22:1.7	and said,	NA
sn7.22:1.8	“Who are these shavelings, these fake ascetics? Don’t they understand the council rules?”	“Council rules” (_sabhādhamma_) appears only here. The Buddha plays with it, punning _sabhā_ (“council”) with _sabbhi_ (“the virtuous”), and _dhamma_ (“rule”) with “principle, morality”. The text does not make clear what their problem was with the Buddha’s approach. If, as is usually understood, the rules of such councils were similar to the rules of the monastic code, the Council would be constituted of residents within the area, and once business was underway, it should not be interrupted.
sn7.22:1.9	Then the Buddha addressed the brahmins and householders of Khomadussa in verse:	NA
sn7.22:2.1	“If good people are not present it is no true council;	For this sentiment, see Manu 8.12.
sn7.22:2.2	and those whose speak against principle <j>are not good people.	NA
sn7.22:2.3	Having given up greed, hate, and delusion,	NA
sn7.22:2.4	speakers of principle are good people.”	NA
sn7.22:3.1	When he had spoken, the brahmins and householders of Khomadussa said to the Buddha,	NA
sn7.22:3.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	NA
sn7.22:3.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
sn7.22:3.4	We go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA

sn8.1:1.2	At one time Venerable Vaṅgīsa was staying near Āḷavī, at the Aggāḷava Tree-shrine, together with his mentor, Venerable Nigrodhakappa.	NA
sn8.1:1.3	Now at that time Vaṅgīsa was junior, recently gone forth. He had been left behind to look after the dwelling.	NA
sn8.1:1.4	Then several women dressed in all their finery went to the monastery at Aggāḷava in order to inspect the dwelling.	NA
sn8.1:1.5	When Vaṅgīsa saw them he became dissatisfied, with lust infecting his mind.	NA
sn8.1:1.6	Then he thought,	NA

sn8.2:1.1	At one time Venerable Vaṅgīsa was staying near Āḷavī, at the Aggāḷava Tree-shrine, together with his mentor, Venerable Nigrodhakappa.	The pe seems odd here.
sn8.2:1.2	Now at that time after Venerable Nigrodhakappa had finished his meal, on his return from almsround, he would enter his dwelling and not emerge for the rest of that day, or the next.	NA
sn8.2:1.3	And at that time Venerable Vaṅgīsa became dissatisfied, as lust infected his mind.	NA
sn8.2:1.4	Then he thought,	NA

sn8.3:1.1	At one time Venerable Vaṅgīsa was staying near Āḷavī, at the Aggāḷava Tree-shrine, together with his mentor, Venerable Nigrodhakappa.	NA
sn8.3:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Vaṅgīsa looked down upon other good-hearted mendicants because of his own poetic virtuosity.	I think BB’s “well-behaved” for pesala leans too heavily on the comm’s punning “piya-sila”, and sounds a bit patronizing. I think it’s more of an emotional quality.
sn8.3:1.3	Then he thought,	NA
sn8.3:1.4	“It’s my loss, my misfortune,	NA
sn8.3:1.5	that I look down on other good-hearted mendicants because of my own poetic virtuosity.”	NA
sn8.3:1.6	Then, on the occasion of arousing remorse in himself, he recited these verses:	NA

sn8.3:5.1	So don’t be hard-hearted, be energetic,	NA

sn8.3:5.3	Then with conceit given up completely,	NA

sn8.5:2.2	What four?	NA
sn8.5:2.3	It’s when a mendicant speaks well, not poorly; they speak on the teaching, not against the teaching; they speak pleasantly, not unpleasantly; and they speak truthfully, not falsely.	NA

sn8.5:2.5	That is what the Buddha said.	NA

Here we use monk for bhikkhu; as a formal sanghakamma, the bhikkhunis would not have been present.
sn8.7:1.2	Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks for the invitation to admonish.	NA

The problem is that this term appears to be restricted to this specific usage, which is hard to explain otherwise. Since sattama as superlative of sant is rare or absent elsewhere, while sattama as seventh is common, it seems that a strong argument is required to justify this reading. But so far as I can tell, the argument is, “I can’t imagine why a mythical term would be used”. Lacking a stronger argument, I translate as “seventh sage”.

sn9.5:1.2	Now at that time Ānanda was spending too much time informing the lay people.	Contra the comm., this does not mean “teaching”. Sannapeti is to inform or persuade, and so far as I know is never used in a teaching context. If we take it in the non-teaching sense of “instruct”, i.e. tell them what to do, this is also incorrect, as monks have no power of lay people. Also, the commentary’s story here has its problems. The setting in this section is standardized to Kosala, so perhaps we should not read too much into this. But it is highly unlikely that he left Rajagaha for Kosala just to find a quiet spot to meditate. Why not one of the many hills of Rajagaha? While it’s possible that this happened after the Buddha’s parinibbana, it would also fit with any time the Buddha was staying at Savatthi and Ananda got too caught up with lay business.

sn10.1:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
sn10.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on Mount Indra’s Peak, the haunt of the native spirit Indaka.	NA
sn10.1:1.3	Then the native spirit Indaka went up to the Buddha, and addressed him in verse:	NA
sn10.1:2.1	“The Buddhas say that form is not the soul.	NA
sn10.1:2.2	Then how does this body manifest?	NA
sn10.1:2.3	Where do the bones and liver come from?	Perhaps “organs” would be better for yakapinda here.
sn10.1:2.4	And how does one cling on in the womb?”	I disagree with BB’s reading of sajjati. The Skt root that he accepts, sṛj, rendered as “begotten”, has the basic meaning of “emit, discharge”. It’s attested in the context of procreation in the Rg Veda, where presumably it refers to the emission of semen. However the verses below are not concerned to answer the question of how procreation happens, but of how an embryo grows in the womb. I.e. not about “emission” but about “sticking around”.
sn10.1:3.1	“First there’s a drop of coagulate;	https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/anyone-have-some-medical-advice-on-embryonic-development/3607
sn10.1:3.2	from there a cyst appears;	“Cyst” is _abbuda_, otherwise used of a tumor or cancer. For other meanings, see notes on [sn1.77:1.4]() and [snp3.10:8.2]().

sn10.2:1.2	Then a spirit named Sakka went up to the Buddha, and addressed him in verse:	BB doesn’t comment on the name. A variant in the title says just Sakka, and he is addressed as Sakka by the Buddha. Perhaps he is called “named sakka” to differentiate him from THE Sakka.
sn10.2:2.1	“You’ve given up all ties,	NA

sn11.3:7.1	However, when they look up at those banner’s crests their fear and terror might go away or it might not.	NA
sn11.3:8.1	Why is that?	NA
sn11.3:8.2	Because Sakka is not free of greed, hate, and delusion. He is fearful, scared, nervous, quick to flee.	NA

sn11.3:10.2	‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’	NA
sn11.3:10.3	Then your fear and terror will go away.	NA
sn11.3:11.1	If you can’t recollect the teaching, then recollect the Saṅgha:	NA
sn11.3:11.2	‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’	NA
sn11.3:11.3	Then your fear and terror will go away.	NA
sn11.3:12.1	Why is that?	NA

Readings of apabyamato are highly uncertain.

This fits much better with the story. Vepacitti was not crudely trying to show arbitrary disrespect: why would he? He’s just come for a visit. No; he’s just repelled by the smell. Being a physical being he is affected by this, but the gods smell only the silagandha.

Rig Veda 3.39.09a, Atharva Veda 8.4.19a, Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 24.5.22). It is from the Vedic _magha_, “gift, bounty”. The name Māgha, with the same meaning, is a name of Sakka at [sn2.3](), while at [snp3.5:1.3]() a brahmin student Māgha asks about generosity. Finally, the good king of [mn83]() is named Maghadeva, “god of bounty”. The passage here attributes the name to his ancestry, but it goes on to praise his generosity.
sn11.12:2.1	In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he was first to give gifts.

The Buddha reforms it to _Purindada_ (“Firstgiver”) at [sn11.12:2.1](). But Indra’s generosity is long renowned, eg. Rig Veda 1.10.6c: “He is the able one, and he will be able for us—Indra who distributes the goods” (_sa śakra uta naḥ śakad indro vasu dayamānaḥ_).
sn11.12:3.1	In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave gifts ably. That’s why he’s called Sakka the Able.	NA
sn11.12:4.1	In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave the gift of a guest house. That’s why he’s called Vāsava the Houser.	Vāsava means “endowed with wealth” (_vasu_; see for example Rig Veda 1.9.9a _indraṁ vasupatiṁ_ “Indra, lord of wealth”). This passage, rather, plays on the word _āvasatha_ and calls him the “giver of a guesthouse”. Later Brahmanical texts enumerated eight Vasus, with Indra as their lord, who are reckoned among the thirty-three.

sn11.22:1.7	But the more the gods complained, the more attractive, good-looking, and lovely that spirit became.	NA
sn11.22:2.1	So the gods went up to Sakka and told him what had happened, adding,	NA

sn11.22:2.7	‘Surely, good fellow, that must be the anger-eating spirit!’	BB treats this line as if spoken by Sakka. MS treats it as concluding the deva’s speech. In this case, MS is correct. When addressing the gods collectively, Sakka uses the plural mārisā (SN 11.3, SN 11.4, SN 11.14, SN 35.248). In addition, the idiom “So hi nūna”, so far as I can tell, always occurs at the start of a new speaker’s statement.
sn11.22:3.1	Then Sakka went up to that spirit, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward the anger-eating spirit, and pronounced his name three times:	NA
sn11.22:3.2	‘Good fellow, I am Sakka, lord of gods! Good fellow, I am Sakka, the lord of gods!’	NA
sn11.22:3.3	But the more Sakka pronounced his name, the uglier and more deformed the spirit became,	NA
sn11.22:3.4	until eventually it vanished right there.	NA
sn11.22:3.5	Then Sakka, lord of gods, guiding the gods of the thirty-three, recited this verse:	NA
sn11.22:4.1	‘My mind isn’t easily upset;	NA
sn11.22:4.2	I’m not easily drawn into the maelstrom.	NA
sn11.22:4.3	I don’t get angry for long,	NA

sn11.23:0.3	The Sambari Sorcery	NA
sn11.23:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	NA
sn11.23:1.2	The Buddha said this:	NA
sn11.23:1.3	“Once upon a time, mendicants, Vepacitti, lord of titans, was sick, suffering, gravely ill.	NA
sn11.23:1.4	So Sakka went to see him to ask after his illness.	Sweet!
sn11.23:1.5	Vepacitti saw Sakka coming off in the distance,	NA
sn11.23:1.6	and said to him,	NA
sn11.23:1.7	‘Heal me, lord of gods!’	So the gods are healers.
sn11.23:1.8	‘Teach me, Vepacitti, the Sambari sorcery.’	Wow, that is stone cold, Sakka! The vedic Index on Śambara (http://sanskritdictionary.com/%C5%9Bambara/3160/6) has: Is the name of an enemy of Indra in the Rigveda. He is mentioned along with śuṣṇa, Pipru, and Varcin, being in one passage called a Dāsa, son of Kulitara. In another passage he is said to have deemed himself a godling (devaka). His forts, ninety, ninety-nine, or a hundred in number, are alluded to, the word itself in the neuter plural once meaning the ‘forts of śambara.’ His great foe was Divodāsa Ati-thigva, who won victories over him by Indra’s aid. It is impossible to say with certainty whether śambara was a real person or not. Hillebrandt is strongly in favour of the theory that he was a real chief as enemy of Divodāsa: he relies on the statistics of the mention of the name to show that, whereas he was conceived as a real foe in the hymns of the time of Divodāsa, later texts, like those of the seventh Maṇdala, make him into a demon, as a result of the change of scene from Arachosia to India. As a matter of fact, apart from this theory, śambara was quite possibly an aboriginal enemy in India, living in the mountains.
sn11.23:1.9	‘I can’t do that, good fellow, until I have consulted with the titans.’	Apparently demon society is quite democratic.
sn11.23:1.10	Then Vepacitti, lord of titans, asked the titans,	NA
sn11.23:1.11	‘Good fellows, may I teach the Sambari sorcery to Sakka, lord of gods?’	NA
sn11.23:1.12	‘Do not, good fellow, teach the Sambari sorcery to Sakka!’	NA
sn11.23:1.13	So Vepacitti addressed Sakka in verse:	NA
sn11.23:2.1	‘O Maghavā, O Sakka,	NA
sn11.23:2.2	king of gods, Sujā’s husband,	NA
sn11.23:2.3	a sorceror falls into the terrible hell—	NA

My guess is that the formula should be expanded for the remaining items. However the commentary gives an explanation for why “Ko nu kho, bhante, bhavatī” is not included, so if the abbreviations are lost, it was before that time. BB’s translation choices here confuse me, as well. He omits without comment the section on “who grasps”, although this is apparently found in all manuscripts, and is assumed in the commentary. And he includes the sentence “With feeling as condition, craving [comes to be]; with craving as condition, clinging; with clinging as condition, existence” which is not found in the Pali. I’m not sure if this is an oversight, or if he’s abbreviating. Also, note that the “cessation” sequence starting just below omits the vinnanahara, and begins with the salayatana. Perhaps the original text featured just the vinnanahara, and the subsequent sections were grafted on. This would explain the grammatically clumsy transition from vinnanahara to slayatana, with namarupa omitted.

sn12.15:1.4	How is right view defined?”	NA
sn12.15:2.1	“Kaccāna, this world mostly relies on the dual notions of existence and non-existence.	The Buddha is indicating that he is referring to a widely held belief. Compare the prominent saying: “This is twofold (_dvayaṁ_), there is no third: truth and falsehood. The gods are truth, humans are falsehood” (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.1.1.4, 3.3.2.2, 3.9.4.1). The word for “truth” here is _satya_ (Pali _sacca_), which like _atthitā_ (“existence”) is an abstract noun from the root _as_, “to exist”. The word for “falsehood” is _anṛta_, a form not used in this sense in Pali, which uses the simple negative. The gods are truly real because they are immortal, whereas transient humans are not truly real. _Satya_ and _anṛta_ are a standard pair in pre-Buddhist Sanskrit, harking back to Rig Veda 7.49.3a. Consider also the hymn of creation at Arthavaveda 10.2.14c: “Who placed truth in him, who falsehood, who mortality, who immortality?”

sn12.16:1.3	“Sir, they speak of a ‘Dhamma speaker’.	NA
sn12.16:1.4	How is a Dhamma speaker defined?”	NA
sn12.16:2.1	“If a mendicant teaches Dhamma for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding old age and death, they’re qualified to be called a ‘mendicant who speaks on Dhamma’.	Note that here bhikkhu can be read as either vocative or nominative. Given that such passages virtually always include a vocative, BB translates thus, taking the nominative as implied. Indeed, at the parallel passage in SN 35.155 the same phrase is punctuated as a vocative. However, at SN 12.67 we explicitly have “avuso, bhikkhu” i.e. the sentence takes bhikkhu as nominative. I suspect that when the text is addresed to “a bhikkhu” it resulted in a repeated “bhikkhu bhikkhu”, which came to be omitted as an error. Thus I take the syntax at SN 12.67 as correct, and insert the implied nominative.

sn12.33:1.2	“Mendicants, I will teach forty-four grounds for knowledge.	Nanavatthu is rendered by BB as “cases of knowledge”, thus taking vatthu as essentially meaningless, “item” or such. this is what the comm says “ñāṇameva ñāṇavatthūti veditabbaṁ”, but I cannot find any support for it. The PTS dict under it’s meaning 2 “object, item” lists a number of examples: niddasa-, dana-, aghata-, kusita-. Also see codana-, nijjara-, punnakiriya, sangaha-. But in each of these cases the meaning of “ground, basis” applies. It seems to me this meaning makes the current sutta more meaningful. instead of merely being an abhidhamma-type list of “cases”, it indicates that each of these things, while itself being dukkha, offers up the possibility of insight.

sn12.33:5.1	A noble disciple understands old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation. This is their knowledge of the present phenomenon.	BB translates dhamma as principle here, which I feel is a little confusing. Of course it is true that pattern of the truths is a principle, and this is a fine translation. However it seems to me that the primary emphasis of the term here is not its application to the truths, but it’s contrast with anvaye nanam later. the two appear in a list of four with no mention of the truths in DN 333 and DN 34. Thus I see it as having a closer affinity to the phrase ditthevadhamme. It is referring to what may be directly seen in this very life.
sn12.33:5.2	With this present phenomenon that is seen, known, immediate, attained, and fathomed, they infer to the past and future.	See BB’s note. Text should be corrected to atītānāgate nayaṁ neti. I’m not altogether convinced by the explanation of akalika as an adverb of manner here. It seems to me rather that the list is a little odd, and should be translated as such. Re nayam neti, this is a noun/verb repetition and should be translated according to the meaning of the idiom as a whole.

sn12.35:5.1	When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, then any twists, ducks, and dodges are given up:	Once again quotes in text are incorrect. Re visuka, visevita, vippandita, these are curiously hard to pin down as they only occur in this and one or two other passages that are equally unclear. “phandamana” is used in the context of a fish struggling in a dried up stream. (snp 4.15) In MN 65 the three are applied to a horse struggling against the bit. And at SN 4.24 the three are applied by Mara to himself. BB has “contortion, writhing, and vacillation”, or “distortions, manouevers and contortions “or” contortions, manouevers and vacillations”, without any apparent reason for the differences. At MN2 for visuka, vipphandita Ṭhānissaro has “contortion, writhing” where BB has “contortion, vacillation”. None of these are hugely satisfying. Given that we haven’t got much in the way of clear differentiation, we should assume that the terms are synonyms, but for example “contortions, manouevers and vacillations” are all three quite distinct ideas. Now, the horse is presumably twisting and turning to get away from the bit, while the fish out of water is the same. Mara is known for his deceits, for trying to get at the Buddha using any manner of deceitful tricks. It seems to me “tricks, dodges, and evasions” fits reasonably well.

sn12.52:1.2	“There are things that fuel grasping. When you concentrate on the gratification provided by these things, your craving grows.	This is one of those sentences that is straightforward in pali, and also straightforward to translate literally into English. But the resulting sentence doesn’t parse easily; it concatenates too many abstract ideas. I have broken it down and made it as concrete as possible. Note also that I use “concentrate” here, which having been freed from samadhi can be used more appropriately. regarding upadaniya and samyojaniya in the next sutta, I take these as having a stronger sense than BB. In his translation, they are merely things that can be grasped, whereas i take them, in line with CPD as things that are apt to, liable to, or “prone to” grasping. Note that BB’s translations are not really parallel. Upadaniya is things that “can be clung to”, i.e. the things are the subject of clinging. Samyojaniya are things that “can fetter”, i.e. the things are the agents that does the fettering. This difference is not found in the Pali, and my translation avoids it. “prone to being grasped “and” prone to being fettered” are admittedly clumsy, but at least the meaning is clear. It would be much better to use “graspable” for upadaniya, but we have no “fetterable”. Perhaps “bindable” could be used; it is used in programming specifically in the sense of “something that can be bound to”. But then should we replace fetter throughout with bond or binding?

sn12.61:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
sn12.61:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. …	NA
sn12.61:1.3	“Mendicants, when it comes to this body made up of the four principal states, an unlearned ordinary person might become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed.	NA
sn12.61:1.4	Why is that?	NA
sn12.61:1.5	This body made up of the four principal states is seen to accumulate and disperse, to be taken up and laid to rest.	NA
sn12.61:1.6	That’s why, when it comes to this body, an unlearned ordinary person might become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed.	Not sure why BB repeats “this body composed of the four great elements” in this sentence. It’s not in the Pali.
sn12.61:2.1	But when it comes to that which is called ‘mind’ and also ‘sentience’ and also ‘consciousness’, an unlearned ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned, dispassionate, or freed.	NA
sn12.61:2.2	Why is that?	NA
sn12.61:2.3	Because for a long time they’ve been attached to it, thought of it as their own, and mistaken it:	NA
sn12.61:2.4	‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’	NA
sn12.61:2.5	That’s why, when it comes to this mind, an unlearned ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed.	NA
sn12.61:3.1	But an unlearned ordinary person would be better off taking this body made up of the four principal states to be their self, rather than the mind.	NA
sn12.61:3.2	Why is that?	NA
sn12.61:3.3	This body made up of the four principal states is seen to last for a year, or for two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or a hundred years, or even longer.	NA
sn12.61:4.1	But that which is called ‘mind’ and also ‘sentience’ and also ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all night.	NA
sn12.61:4.2	It’s like a monkey moving through the forest. It grabs hold of one branch, lets it go, and grabs another; then it lets that go and grabs yet another.	NA
sn12.61:4.3	In the same way, that which is called ‘mind’ and also ‘sentience’ and also ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all night.	NA
sn12.61:5.1	In this case, a learned noble disciple carefully and rationally applies the mind to dependent origination itself:	NA
sn12.61:5.2	‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises.	NA
sn12.61:5.3	When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is:	NA
sn12.61:5.4	Ignorance is a condition for choices.	NA
sn12.61:5.5	Choices are a condition for consciousness. …	NA
sn12.61:5.6	That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.	NA
sn12.61:5.7	When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease.	NA
sn12.61:5.8	When choices cease, consciousness ceases. …	NA
sn12.61:5.9	That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’	NA
sn12.61:6.1	Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.	NA
sn12.61:6.2	Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.	NA
sn12.61:6.3	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’”	NA

sn12.66:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
sn12.66:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma.	NA
sn12.66:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
sn12.66:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
sn12.66:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
sn12.66:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
sn12.66:1.7	“Mendicants, do you perform inner self-examination?”	_Sammasa_ is an unusual term in the suttas. The root is _mas_, to touch or rub. I’m reminded of the medical idea of self examination, touching or rubbing your body to see if there’s a lump or pain, etc.
sn12.66:1.8	When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha,	NA
sn12.66:1.9	“Sir, I perform inner self-examination.”	NA
sn12.66:1.10	“But mendicant, how do you perform inner self-examination?”	NA
sn12.66:1.11	Then that mendicant answered,	NA
sn12.66:1.12	but the Buddha was not happy with the answer.	NA
sn12.66:2.1	When he had spoken, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,	NA
sn12.66:2.2	“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!	NA
sn12.66:2.3	Let the Buddha speak of the inner self-examination. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	NA
sn12.66:2.4	“Well then, Ānanda, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
sn12.66:2.5	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA

sn12.66:4.3	While examining they know:	NA

sn12.66:5.1	They perform further inner self-examination:	NA

sn12.66:5.3	While examining they know:	NA
sn12.66:5.4	‘That craving arises and settles on whatever in the world seems nice and pleasant.	NA

sn16.10:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
sn16.10:1.2	At one time Venerable Mahākassapa was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
sn16.10:1.3	Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Mahākassapa and said,	NA
sn16.10:1.4	“Kassapa, come, sir. Let’s go to one of the nuns’ quarters.”	NA
sn16.10:1.5	“You go, Reverend Ānanda. You have many duties and responsibilities.”	NA
sn16.10:1.6	And a second time …	NA
sn16.10:1.7	NA	NA
sn16.10:1.8	NA	NA
sn16.10:1.9	And a third time, Ānanda said,	NA
sn16.10:1.10	“Come, Honorable Kassapa. Let’s go to one of the nuns’ quarters.”	NA
sn16.10:2.1	Then Venerable Mahākassapa robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went with Venerable Ānanda as his second monk to one of the nuns’ quarters, where he sat on the seat spread out.	BB has “companion” for pacchasamana, which doesn’t quite hit the mark. The term is not used of equals, but for a junior following behind.
sn16.10:2.2	And then several nuns went up to Mahākassapa, bowed, and sat down to one side.	NA
sn16.10:2.3	Mahākassapa educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired those nuns with a Dhamma talk,	NA
sn16.10:2.4	after which he got up from his seat and left.	NA
sn16.10:3.1	But the nun Thullatissā was upset and blurted out,	NA
sn16.10:3.2	“What is the worthy Mahākassapa thinking, that he’d teach Dhamma in front of the worthy Ānanda, the Videhan sage?	Ānanda was from Sakya, not Videha. The Pali commentary explains _vedeha_ as “learned”. The Mahāvastu says that after the Buddha went forth, Ānanda went to Videha and undertook a vow of silence (_maunavrata_, Mvu 83; Senart 3.176). The Mūlasarvastivāda Vinaya says that it was on Mount Videha that the Buddha entrusted Ānanda with the design for the robes (Mu Kd 7; GBM 6.814). None of these are cogent. The point of the passage is that Thullatissā was such an idiot, she didn’t even know where Ānanda came from.
sn16.10:3.3	He’s like a needle seller who thinks they can sell a needle to a needle maker!”	NA
sn16.10:3.4	NA	NA
sn16.10:4.1	Mahākassapa heard Thullatissā say these words,	NA
sn16.10:4.2	and he said to Ānanda,	NA
sn16.10:4.3	“Is that right, Reverend Ānanda? Am I the needle seller and you the needle maker?	NA
sn16.10:4.4	Or am I the needle maker and you the needle seller?”	NA
sn16.10:4.5	“Forgive her, sir. The woman’s a fool.”	Matugama is regularly used both for “females “and “a female”. For the latter use, see eg AN 5.75, AN 5.76, AN 4.122, AN 4.197, and so on. In the patimokkha it is always used in this sense. In this case, the problem is clearly with one individual, and there is no cause to make it a snarky remark about all women. One of the basic principles of translation is compassion. Unless there is good reason, we should assume that our texts make sense. There are many cases where it is possible to translate a text in a way that appears meaningless, but we don’t, because we assume that those who created the texts had at minimum a reasonable degree of common sense. Moreover, we have seen Ānanda’s character in countless texts, and this was not the kind of man he was. Thus I disagree with BB’s assertion that his translation “women are foolish” is the only possible one. My translation is not merely possible, it is more likely. Full disclosure: I was the “consultant” that BB refers to in his notes.

sn16.10:9.1	Reverend, you might as well think to hide a bull elephant that’s three or three and a half meters tall behind a palm leaf as to hide my six insights.”	Text’s sattaratana, if we take as seven cubits, then a cubit is 18 inches, so 10.5 feet.

sn16.11:8.8	After some time I made an outer robe of patches and, in the name of the perfected ones in the world, I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.

BB has dreadful, bitter and vile for daruna, katuka, and pharusa. But the three words are in meaning and metaphor similar in Pali and completely unrelated in English. The underlying sense is not of “causing fear” although they certainly do that. It is of “hard (daru=wood), harsh, unyielding, rough”, and more metaphorically, “vicious, violent, brutal”. In other words, they are qualities of the damage things can do, not of the emotions they can arouse.

In this and similar passages, the handling of abbreviations in MS seems to be incorrect. When dealing with extended sets of phenomena associated with the ayatana, ellipsis is required. Here, however, the text deals only with the interior ayatanas—eye, ear, nose, etc. So there seems to be no call for ellipsis, and the practice is inherited incorrectly. Nevertheless, as it doesn’t affect the meaning, I don’t change the text.

sn19.1:0.3	A Skeleton	NA
sn19.1:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
sn19.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
sn19.1:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Lakkhaṇa and Venerable Mahāmoggallāna were staying on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.	NA
sn19.1:1.4	Then Mahāmoggallāna robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Lakkhaṇa and said to him,	NA
sn19.1:1.5	“Come, Reverend Lakkhaṇa, let’s enter Rājagaha for alms.”	NA
sn19.1:1.6	“Yes, reverend,” Lakkhaṇa replied.	NA
sn19.1:1.7	As Mahāmoggallāna was descending from Vulture’s Peak Mountain he smiled at a certain spot.	NA
sn19.1:1.8	So Lakkhaṇa said to Mahāmoggallāna,	NA
sn19.1:1.9	“What is the cause, Reverend Moggallāna, what is the reason you smiled?”	NA
sn19.1:1.10	“Reverend Lakkhaṇa, it’s the wrong time for this question.	NA
sn19.1:1.11	Ask me when we’re in the Buddha’s presence.”	NA
sn19.1:2.1	Then Lakkhaṇa and Mahāmoggallāna wandered for alms in Rājagaha. After the meal, on their return from almsround, they went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Lakkhaṇa said to Mahāmoggallāna:	NA
sn19.1:2.2	“Just now, as Mahāmoggallāna was descending from Vulture’s Peak Mountain he smiled at a certain spot.	NA
sn19.1:2.3	What is the cause, Reverend Moggallāna, what is the reason you smiled?”	NA
sn19.1:3.1	“Just now, reverend, as I was descending from Vulture’s Peak Mountain I saw a skeleton flying through the air.	NA
sn19.1:3.2	Vultures, crows, and hawks kept chasing it, pecking, clawing, and stabbing it in the ribs	The verbs here are uncertain, and readings vary considerably, both here and in the other occurrence in MN 54. There the comm. glosses clearly in the sense of “pecking and clawing” and I think it’s best to just stick to that.
sn19.1:3.3	as it screeched in pain.	NA
sn19.1:3.4	It occurred to me:	NA
sn19.1:3.5	‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!	NA
sn19.1:3.6	That there can be such a sentient being,	NA
sn19.1:3.7	such an entity,	NA
sn19.1:3.8	such an incarnation!’”	NA
sn19.1:4.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:	NA
sn19.1:4.2	“Mendicants, there are disciples who live full of vision and knowledge,	NA
sn19.1:4.3	since a disciple knows, sees, and witnesses such a thing.	NA
sn19.1:4.4	Formerly, I too saw that being, but I did not speak of it.	NA
sn19.1:4.5	For if I had spoken of it others would not have believed me,	NA
sn19.1:4.6	which would be for their lasting harm and suffering.	NA
sn19.1:4.7	That being used to be a cattle butcher right here in Rājagaha.	NA
sn19.1:4.8	As a result of that deed he burned in hell for many years, many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of years. Now he experiences the residual result of that deed in such an incarnation.”	NA

sn19.8:1.3	as he screamed in pain. …” …	NA
sn19.8:1.4	“That being used to be a war herald right here in Rājagaha. …”	See BB’s note for variants. I find it hard to accept that a horse trainer should be included here among what are obviously unskillful activities. And if it does just mean horse trainer, why use such an obscure term? In Sanskrit the sūta is an honorary title, usually used for a special groom functionary of a king. It seems he was some kind of herald, proclaiming the king’s deeds as he drove into battle. However, in SA 513 a 調象 “elephant trainer” is mentioned.

sn21.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
sn21.1:1.3	There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants:	NA
sn21.1:1.4	“Reverends, mendicants!”	NA
sn21.1:1.5	“Reverend,” they replied.	NA
sn21.1:2.1	Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:	NA
sn21.1:2.2	“Just now, reverends, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind:	NA
sn21.1:2.3	‘They speak of this thing called “noble silence”.	NA
sn21.1:2.4	What then is this noble silence?’	NA
sn21.1:2.5	It occurred to me:	NA
sn21.1:2.6	‘As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
sn21.1:2.7	This is called noble silence.’	NA
sn21.1:2.8	And so, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I was entering and remaining in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	The tenses here and in the parallel passages at SN 40.1ff are confused. Comparing the case here and in the recapitulation after the Buddha’s advice we have (in PTS and MS, incl variants): Before: _vihariṁ_ or _viharāmi_. After: _vihāsiṁ_ or _viharāmi_. BB ignores the differences, translating as “dwelt” in all cases. It seems to me that it makes more sense to think of the “before” case as a “historical present”, as in the standard “was staying at …” for _viharati_. The sense of the “before” case then conveys more of an ongoing process, a development. The “after” case, in aorist, then has a “perfect” sense.
sn21.1:2.9	While I was in that meditation, perception and focus accompanied by placing the mind beset me.	In the suttas, _saññāmanasikārā_ is only used in negative contexts, but later texts use it in a positive way as well, eg. [ps1.1:171.5](),  [pe8:3.3]().
sn21.1:3.1	Then the Buddha came up to me with his psychic power and said,	NA
sn21.1:3.2	‘Moggallāna, Moggallāna! Don’t neglect noble silence, brahmin! Settle your mind in noble silence; unify your mind and bring it to immersion in noble silence.’	NA
sn21.1:3.3	And so, after some time, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption …	NA

sn21.3:2.11	nor did he come to me.	NA
sn21.3:2.12	Rather, the Buddha cleared his clairvoyance and clairaudience towards me,	NA

sn21.3:2.14	“But what manner of Dhamma talk did you have together?”	NA
sn21.3:3.1	“Well, reverend, I said to the Buddha,	NA
sn21.3:3.2	‘Sir, they speak of one who is energetic.	NA
sn21.3:3.3	How is an energetic person defined?’	NA
sn21.3:3.4	When I said this, the Buddha said,	NA
sn21.3:3.5	‘Moggallāna, it’s when a mendicant lives with energy roused up:	NA
sn21.3:3.6	“Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.”	NA
sn21.3:3.7	That’s how a person is energetic.’	NA
sn21.3:3.8	That’s the Dhamma talk I had together with the Buddha.”	NA
sn21.3:4.1	“Reverend, next to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna I’m like a few pieces of gravel next to the Himalayas, the king of mountains.	NA
sn21.3:4.2	NA	NA
sn21.3:4.3	Venerable Mahāmoggallāna is so mighty and powerful he could, if he wished, live on for the proper lifespan.”	NA
sn21.3:5.1	“Reverend, next to Venerable Sāriputta I’m like a few grains of salt next to a mound of salt.	Ghata means either “pot “or” heap, mass”. BB prefers the former, but I find it gives a somewhat weak simile. I think Moggallana was referring something more like this (http://c8.alamy.com/comp/FMYC1W/picture-made-available-on-15-june-2010-showing-an-indian-salt-worker-FMYC1W.jpg) than like this (http://www.eatonvillenews.net/images/Bob/BOB%20FILTER%20PLANT%20TOUR%20SALT%20BARREL%20%20(OP)%20JAN.%2013,%2007%20012.jpg)
sn21.3:5.2	NA	NA
sn21.3:5.3	Venerable Sāriputta has been commended, complimented, and praised by the Buddha:	NA
sn21.3:6.1	‘Sāriputta is full of wisdom,	NA
sn21.3:6.2	ethics, and peace.	NA
sn21.3:6.3	Even a mendicant who has crossed over	NA
sn21.3:6.4	might at best equal him.’”	NA

sn21.4:0.3	A Junior Mendicant	NA
sn21.4:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	NA
sn21.4:1.2	Now at that time a certain junior monk, after his meal, on his return from almsround, entered his dwelling, where he adhered to passivity and silence. And he didn’t help the mendicants out when it was time to sew robes.	Saṅkasāyati is used only in this stock phrase, and in a slight variant at AN 2.39, and at Kd 3.1. BB translates as “keep”. The Dictionary is uncertain. At Kd 3.1 IBH has “prepare”, which is wrong. There, it is parallel with allīyati, “stick, cling, adhere”, and this surely is the meaning. In each case, it is not merely the case that the person “keeps” still, but that doing so goes against something. A monk “adheres” to silence when there is something they want to speak about, or they “stick to” one residence instead of wandering, or a turtle “makes themselves” stay still when a jackal comes hunting. Each case is slightly different, but the general sense is that the silence is a resistance against some force, there is a tension there.
sn21.4:1.3	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	NA
sn21.4:1.4	NA	NA

sn21.4:2.7	“Sir, I am doing my own work.”	NA

sn22.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.	NA
sn22.1:1.3	Then the householder Nakula’s father went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:	NA
sn22.1:2.1	“Sir, I’m an old man, elderly and senior. I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life. My body is ailing and I’m constantly unwell.	NA
sn22.1:2.2	I hardly ever get to see the esteemed mendicants.	NA
sn22.1:2.3	May the Buddha please advise me	NA
sn22.1:2.4	and instruct me.	NA
sn22.1:2.5	It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”	NA
sn22.1:3.1	“That’s so true, householder! That’s so true, householder!	NA
sn22.1:3.2	For this body is ailing, swaddled in its shell.	NA
sn22.1:3.3	If anyone dragging around this body claimed to be healthy even for an hour, what is that but foolishness?	NA
sn22.1:3.4	So you should train like this:	NA
sn22.1:3.5	‘Though my body is ailing, my mind will be healthy.’	NA
sn22.1:3.6	That’s how you should train.”	NA
sn22.1:4.1	And then the householder Nakula’s father approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went up to Venerable Sāriputta, bowed, and sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to him:	NA
sn22.1:4.2	“Householder, your faculties are so very clear,	NA
sn22.1:4.3	and your complexion is pure and bright.	NA
sn22.1:4.4	Did you get to hear a Dhamma talk in the Buddha’s presence today?”	NA
sn22.1:5.1	“What else, sir, could it possibly be?	This idiom is unusual, if not unique, and a translation should try to convery something of the dramatic quality of it. The force of it seems to be, “What else could possibly have had this effect on me?”, which is not well captured by BB’s “Why not”, and better by Ṭhānissaro’s “How could it be otherwise”.
sn22.1:5.2	Just now the Buddha anointed me with the deathless ambrosia of a Dhamma talk.”	Reinforcing the unique and dramatic quality of the previous line, amatena abhisitto is another unique usage. It is one of the few, if not only, places in the EBTs where the Rg Vedic sense of “ambrosia” for amata is prominent.
sn22.1:5.3	“But what kind of ambrosial Dhamma talk has the Buddha anointed you with?”	NA

sn22.2:0.3	At Devadaha	NA
sn22.2:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
sn22.2:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, where they have a town named Devadaha.	NA
sn22.2:1.3	Then several mendicants who were heading for the west went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
sn22.2:1.4	“Sir, we wish to go to a western land to take up residence there.”	NA
sn22.2:2.1	“But mendicants, have you taken leave of Sāriputta?”	NA
sn22.2:2.2	“No, sir, we haven’t.”	NA
sn22.2:2.3	“You should take leave of Sāriputta.	NA
sn22.2:2.4	He’s astute, and supports his spiritual companions, the mendicants.”	NA
sn22.2:2.5	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
sn22.2:3.1	Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far from the Buddha in a clump of golden shower trees.	The identification of elagala with cassia tora, found in BB, PTS dict, and ultimately probably derived from MW, is unsatisfactory. It is a weed, growing 50cm or so high, hardly a fitting place for meditation, and completely contradicting the commentary. The alternative, Cassia alata or Senna alata is better, since it grows 3-4 M tall, with a glorious golden flower. However it’s native to Mexico. The Chinese parallels don’t seem to offer any assistance. SA 108 has 坐一堅固樹下, where 堅固 might stand for gāḍha, and thus the compound ekagāḍha. But this gets us no further in understanding the sanskrit. Moreoever 堅固 may also stand for sāla or sāla-vṛkṣa, so it could just mean standing under “a” sal tree, where 一 stands for annatara. Sticking with the Cassia family, I’ve gone with cassia fistula, which would at lest be a nice place to meditate!
sn22.2:3.2	And then those mendicants approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA

The oka and niketa are the same basic meaning, but I have translated in line with the underlying etymology: oka from “place of comfort, shelter”, niketa as “heaping, settlement”. Sari means “wander, roam, drift”. Here it has a literal meaning, a homeless wanderer. But later one is said to be a “okasari” “house-wanderer”. How does this make sense? The root -sari is the same as the root for samsara, and so an okasari is one who wanders in samsara. Compare the standard simile for the dibbacakkhu, where a person walks out of one home down the street, and into another. Cf the modern idiom “couch-surfer”. I use the same term as i use for samsara to bring out this connection.

sn22.80:6.3	Yet earnest gentlemen take it up for a good reason.	The meaning of atthavasika is clarified at https://suttacentral.net/pi/pi-tv-pvr14. A mendicant who is approaching the sangha with some litigation should do so, maong a long list of reasons: atthavasikena bhavitabbaṁ no parisakappikena. To paraphrase, this seems to mean “looking for a genuinely good outcome for all concerned, not trying to get excused by the assembly”. I choose “earnest” as an English term with a similar sense.
sn22.80:6.4	Not to escape a summons by a king or a summons for a bandit, or because you were in debt or in fear, or in order to make a living.	The terms here follow the same sequence as in the Vinaya account of ordination. Generally, ordination should not be given in such cases, but if it is given, those performing it incur an offense of wrong-doing. | Soldiers joined the Sangha to escape military service, so the Buddha said one should not ordain those in service to a king ([pli-tv-kd1:40.1.1]()). | Several rules regarding ordination of criminals were passed, the thrust of which is that wanted outlaws should not be ordained ([pli-tv-kd1:41.1.1]()). | Another man ordained to escape debt ([pli-tv-kd1:46.1.1]()). | Seventeen boys ordained as novices to get a nice livelihood ([pli-tv-kd1:49.1.1]()). | The only item that does not straightforwardly correspond is “in fear” (_bhayaṭṭa_). In the Vinaya sequence, the ordination of slaves appears at this point ([pli-tv-kd1:47.1.1]()). The connection is suggested by the verses of the water-carrier Puṇṇikā, who speaks of living “in fear” of her masters’ abuse and beatings.

sn22.82:1.2	Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.	NA
sn22.82:2.1	Then one of the mendicants got up from their seat, arranged their robe over one shoulder, raised their joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:	NA
sn22.82:2.2	“Sir, I’d like to ask the Buddha about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”	NA
sn22.82:2.3	“Well then, mendicant, take your own seat and ask what you wish.”	NA
sn22.82:2.4	“Yes, sir,” replied that mendicant. He took his seat and said to the Buddha:	NA
sn22.82:2.5	“Sir, are these the five grasping aggregates, that is:	NA
sn22.82:2.6	form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?”	NA
sn22.82:3.1	“Yes, they are,” replied the Buddha.	NA
sn22.82:3.2	NA	NA
sn22.82:3.3	Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question:	NA
sn22.82:4.1	“But sir, what is the root of these five grasping aggregates?”	NA
sn22.82:4.2	“These five grasping aggregates are rooted in desire.” …	It looks like a sadhu passage has been elided here. Indeed, in the parallel at MN 109, this sadhu passage is omitted, and so are the ones following, while here, only this one is omitted.
sn22.82:4.3	“But sir, is that grasping the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates? Or is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates another?”	NA
sn22.82:4.4	“Neither. Rather, the desire and greed for them is the grasping there.”	NA
sn22.82:4.5	Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question:	NA
sn22.82:5.1	“But sir, can there be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates?”	NA
sn22.82:5.2	“There can,” said the Buddha.	NA
sn22.82:5.3	“It’s when someone thinks:	NA
sn22.82:5.4	‘In the future, may I be of such form, such feeling, such perception, such choices, or such consciousness!’	NA
sn22.82:5.5	That’s how there can be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates.”	MS question mark here is incorrect.
sn22.82:5.6	Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question:	NA
sn22.82:6.1	“Sir, what is the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates?”	BB’s “in what way” is not quite right here. kittavata means “to what extent” and is used to define or delineate. The question is whether there’s anything outside the khandhas.
sn22.82:6.2	“Any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of form.	NA
sn22.82:6.3	Any kind of feeling at all …	NA
sn22.82:6.4	Any kind of perception at all …	NA
sn22.82:6.5	Any kind of choices at all …	NA
sn22.82:6.6	Any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of consciousness.	NA
sn22.82:6.7	That’s the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates.”	NA
sn22.82:6.8	Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question:	NA
sn22.82:7.1	“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why the aggregate of form is found?	NA
sn22.82:7.2	What is the cause, what is the reason why the aggregate of feeling …	NA
sn22.82:7.3	perception …	NA

sn22.82:7.6	“The four principal states are the reason why the aggregate of form is found.	NA

sn22.82:7.8	perception,	NA
sn22.82:7.9	and choices are found.	NA
sn22.82:7.10	Name and form are the reasons why the aggregate of consciousness is found.”	NA
sn22.82:7.11	Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question:	NA
sn22.82:8.1	“Sir, how does substantialist view come about?”	NA
sn22.82:8.2	“It’s when an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.	NA

sn22.82:9.1	“But sir, how does substantialist view not come about?”	NA
sn22.82:9.2	“It’s when a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen true persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true persons.	NA

sn22.82:9.8	That’s how substantialist view does not come about.”	NA
sn22.82:9.9	Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant … asked another question:	NA
sn22.82:10.1	“Sir, what’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to form,	NA
sn22.82:10.2	feeling,	NA
sn22.82:10.3	perception,	NA
sn22.82:10.4	choices,	NA
sn22.82:10.5	and consciousness?”	NA
sn22.82:10.6	“The pleasure and happiness that arise from form: this is its gratification.	NA
sn22.82:10.7	That form is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback.	NA
sn22.82:10.8	Removing and giving up desire and greed for form: this is its escape.	NA

sn22.82:10.13	That consciousness is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback.	NA
sn22.82:10.14	Removing and giving up desire and greed for consciousness: this is its escape.”	NA
sn22.82:10.15	Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question:	NA
sn22.82:11.1	“Sir, how does one know and see so that there’s no I-making, mine-making, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli?”	NA
sn22.82:11.2	“One truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	NA
sn22.82:11.3	They truly see any kind of feeling …	NA
sn22.82:11.4	perception …	NA
sn22.82:11.5	choices …	NA
sn22.82:11.6	consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near, *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	NA
sn22.82:11.7	That’s how to know and see so that there’s no I-making, mine-making, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli.”	NA
sn22.82:12.1	Now at that time one of the mendicants had the thought:	NA
sn22.82:12.2	“So it seems, good fellow, that form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self.	Here and in the parallel passage at MN 108, BB omits the bho, without comment. Ṭhānissaro does likewise. However it appears in both cases, without variants. In fact the idiom iti kira is invariably followed by a vocative, so it can’t be a mistake. Horner translates it in MN 108, with the note: “This looks like a case where a monk, in thought, applies bho to himself. Or else he is thinking (as translated at K.S. iii. 88) “so then you say.” ”
sn22.82:12.3	Then what self will the deeds done by not-self affect?”	NA
sn22.82:12.4	Then the Buddha, knowing that monk’s train of thought, addressed the mendicants:	NA
sn22.82:13.1	“It’s possible that some futile person here—unknowing and ignorant, their mind dominated by craving—thinks they can overstep the teacher’s instructions. They think:	NA
sn22.82:13.2	‘So it seems, good fellow, that form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self.	NA
sn22.82:13.3	Then what self will the deeds done by not-self affect?’	NA
sn22.82:13.4	Now, mendicants, you have been educated by me in questioning with regards to all these things in all such cases.	Once again, BB translates tatra tatra as “here and there”, though it is barely intelligible. Clearly here, as usual, a strongly distributive sense is required.
sn22.82:14.1	What do you think, mendicants?	NA
sn22.82:14.2	Is form permanent or impermanent?”	NA
sn22.82:14.3	“Impermanent, sir.”	NA

sn22.82:14.5	perception …	NA
sn22.82:14.6	choices …	NA
sn22.82:14.7	consciousness permanent or impermanent?”	NA
sn22.82:14.8	“Impermanent, sir.”	NA
sn22.82:14.9	“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”	NA
sn22.82:14.10	“Suffering, sir.”	NA
sn22.82:14.11	“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:	NA
sn22.82:14.12	‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”	NA
sn22.82:14.13	“No, sir.”	NA

sn22.95:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Ayojjhā on the bank of the Ganges river.	This is apparently the city known as Ayodhya in Sanskrit, believed to be the legendary seat of the Okkāka (Sanskrit _ikṣvāku_) dynasty from which hailed many leading royal lineages in ancient India, including the Buddha’s. Ayodhya is often identified with Sāketa, which is however on the Sarabhū (Sanskrit _sarayu_) river, not the Ganges. Perhaps the text here is mistaken (compare [sn35.241:1.1]()).
sn22.95:1.2	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:	NA
sn22.95:2.1	“Mendicants, suppose this Ganges river was carrying along a big lump of foam. And a person with clear eyes would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully.

sn22.95:3.2	In the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of feeling at all … examining it carefully. And it appears to them as completely vacuous, hollow, and insubstantial. For what core could there be in feeling?	NA
sn22.95:4.1	Suppose that in the last month of summer, at noon, a shimmering mirage appears. And a person with clear eyes would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully.

sn22.95:4.2	In the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of perception at all … examining it carefully. And it appears to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what core could there be in perception?	NA
sn22.95:5.1	Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. Wandering in search of heartwood, they’d take a sharp axe and enter a forest. There they’d see a big banana tree, straight and young and grown free of defects. They’d cut it down at the base, cut off the top, and unroll the coiled sheaths. But they wouldn’t even find sapwood, much less heartwood. And a person with clear eyes would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully. And it would appear to them as completely vacuous, hollow, and insubstantial. For what core could there be in a banana tree?	Reading akukkuccajata. Here is my note on the corresponding passage at AN 9.196: BB has “without a fruit-bud core” for akukkuccakajāta. It’s not supported by comm or CPD. Evidently he’s following the comm for SN 22.95, where it refers to a banana tree. But I don’t even know what structure “fruit-bud core” refers to. There are multiple readings in the various contexts, but given that it follows ujum navam, I think it’s safe to assume that it’s meant to be the same word. I think it’s also safe to assume it doesn’t refer to any specific botanical structure, as these are very different trees. Most likely the term is a pseudo-synonym of uju and nava, and this fits the etymology of akukkucca, “not-ill-made”.
sn22.95:5.2	In the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of choices at all … examining them carefully. And they appear to them as completely vacuous, hollow, and insubstantial. For what core could there be in choices?	NA

Re. dukūlasandhanāni with vll. as noted here, BB at AN 9.20 has has “jute tethers”, noting “Mp does not provide a gloss and PED does not offer a useful definition under any of those readings. But in PED sandāna is defined as “cord, tether, fetter.””. At SN 22.96 he has “tethers of fine jute”. However, jute is a coarse cloth and can hardly be meant here. Skt dictionaries consistently say “Woven silk, silk-garment, a very fine garment in general”, which fits with our context. The only commentarial gloss I can find for this is that on SN 22.96, which says “Dukūlasandānānīti dukūlasantharāni”. But this yields the sense, “cover or mat”, which may be right, but is less than convincing. At MN 98, a reference missed by PTS dict, we have sandāna as part of the equipment of a horse that is cut by one who is freed. There I render as “reins”, and this seems apt here too.

sn22.136:1.2	“Mendicants, form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are burning chaff.	Kukkula is a rare term, and there is little early evidence for its meaning. In Pali it appears here and in SN 10.5 where it is parallel to a hell. Elsewhere too it is the name of a hell, so perhaps we should simply use “hellish”. In Skt it has the sense of “chaff, burning chaff”, but this too seems thinly attested. Nevertheless, the sight of burning off chaff of rice and other crops was probably a common one, so I accept this. See https://static.squarespace.com/static/4f334481cb12c1acadc57623/5177e444e4b0244b5f673736/5177e4a0e4b0244b5f67cd57/1266225113983/1000w/4-1.jpg I can’t find any support for BB’s “hot embers”, though.

sn24.1:4.10	“No, sir.”	NA
sn24.1:4.11	“That which is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, and explored by the mind: is that permanent or impermanent?”	BB calls this the “tetrad of sense objects”. Except it’s a septad not a tetrad; it deals largely with cognitive not sense experience; and there is no mention, here or elsewhere in the EBTs, of “objects”. BB’s explanations of this group show the extent to which it has simply been not listened to by the tradition, concerned only with fitting it into the major categories. But it appears in this specific context for an important reason: it deals, not with sense experience in general, but with the ways in which religious and philosophical views are acquired.

The commentary says ‘ayaṁ evaṁ sīlavā ahosi, evaṁ dussīlo’’tiādinā nayena pavattāni guṇāguṇapadāni. Which sounds frankly like a monk’s fantasy. But the commentary also says: Sarīrameva vā ettha padānīti adhippetaṁ. I’m not entirely sure of the force of this, but I think it means “Or in this context the corpse itself is intended as padani”. In any case they acknowledge the ambiguity. I think here padani has the meaning of “footprints”, which may be followed, as in MN 27.

sn24.8:1.3	‘There are these seven substances that are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar.	Best to translate kaya according to sense in such philosophical contexts. For akatavidha, the idea here is that the “10,000 things” of the world are derived from these fundamental substances.
sn24.8:1.4	They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain to each other.	BB’s rendering “to others” allows the interpretation that they can’t cause pain to things outside the seven. But the meaning is as I state.

sn24.8:1.10	The sword simply passes through the gap between the seven substances.	NA
sn24.8:1.11	There are 1.4 million main wombs, and 6,000, and 600. There are 500 deeds, and five, and three. There are deeds and half-deeds. There are 62 paths, 62 sub-eons, six classes of rebirth, and eight stages in a person’s life. There are 4,900 Ājīvaka ascetics, 4,900 wanderers, and 4,900 naked ascetics. There are 2,000 faculties, 3,000 hells, and 36 realms of dust. There are seven percipient embryos, seven non-percipient embryos, and seven knotless embryos. There are seven gods, seven humans, and seven goblins. There are seven lakes, seven rivers, 700 rivers, seven cliffs, and 700 cliffs. There are seven dreams and 700 dreams. There are 8.4 million great eons through which the foolish and the astute transmigrate before making an end of suffering.	This strange cosmology lays out the course through which souls must proceed before their final liberation. | Since _nāgāvāsa_ (“abode of dragons”) occurs in a list of kinds of ascetics, I think it is a corruption of _naggāvāsa_ (“abode of naked ascetics”) and translate accordingly. Each of these refers to the number of times one will be reborn in each of these states. | _Nigaṇṭhigabbha_ could mean “rebirth as a Jain ascetic” but here we have moved on from listing ascetics, and I think it refers to one who is born free of attachments. Compare the Buddhist idea of “four kinds of conception” ([dn33:1.11.175]()). | _Pavuṭā_ is explained by the commentary as _gaṇṭhikā_ (“knot”). However, Rig Veda 9.54.2 mentions “seven rivers” (_sapta pravata_) that flow from heaven, preceded by the mention of _sarā_ (“lakes”). This detail suggests a Vedic influence.

sn35.1:0.2	1. Impermanence	NA
sn35.1:0.3	The Interior as Impermanent	See BB’s note on ajjhattika/bahira vs ajjhatta/bahiddha. They have a subtly different meaning. While BB notes this difference, he translates them both as internal/external. The much more common terms ajjhatta/bahiddha refer to what is inside oneself as opposed to what is outside oneself. Ajjhattika/bahira refer to the subjective aspect of the senses and what is perceived. The senses of other people are ajjhattika but bahiddha. The sense percepts evident on oneself, such as the sound of one’s own voice, are ajjhatta but bahira. There is unfortunately no simple way to capture this distinction in English. For ajjhattika we might use “subjective”. But it is very hard then to avoid using “object” for bahira. But in the EBTs, the whole point of the analysis of sense experience is to show that it only exists in relation. An “object”—which was accepted by the abhidhamma but rightly rejected by Nagarjuna—specifies that a thing exists “objectively” and thus ties you to a realist stance. Lacking a more meaningful option, I have chosen to render ajjhattika/bahira consistently as “interior/exterior”. Since these, like ajjhattika/bahira, are derived forms, they tend to stick out a little bit. I don’t think this is a problem, as they only occur occasionally. Ajjhatta/bahiddha are rendered flexibly according to context.

sn35.103:1.2	‘Herewith! Absolutely the knowledge master!	The idiom of this verse is very unlike the suttas. Its obscurity is intentional, for “the gods love hidden things”. There seems no reason to doubt it is a genuine quote, but I have not been able to trace it. | The initial pronoun _idaṁ_ is neuter, and serves as an emphatic particle disconnected from the masculine nouns. Compare the use of _idam_ at Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3.6.1.5, 3.7.1.2, 13.8.2.15. | A similar phrasing is employed by Brahmā Sahampati at [sn6.13:5.1](), where it emphasizes direct experience. | In early Sanskrit and Pali, _jātu_ usually has the sense “ever” or the emphatic “absolutely” (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.2.2.20, 14.6.8.1).

sn35.103:1.5	boil’s root is dug out!’	We should perhaps read _kaṇṭa_ (“thorn”) for text’s _gaṇḍa_ (“boil”); compare Āśvalāyanagṛhyasūtra 2.7.5, _kaṇṭaki kṣīriṇastu samūlān parikhāya udvāsayet_ (“one should dig out and remove to the root plants with thorns and sap”). But _gaṇḍamūla_ is also attested at [thag4.10:4.1]() where the context supports “boil’s root”.
sn35.103:1.6	Even though Uddaka son of Rāma was no knowledge master, he said ‘I’m a knowledge master.’ Though he was no conqueror of all, he said ‘I’m conqueror of all.’ And though the boil’s root was not dug out, he said ‘I’ve dug out the boil’s root.’	The story of the Bodhisatta’s studentship under Uddaka implies that he had not attained the highest meditation that he taught ([mn26:16.9](), etc.). Nonetheless, the Buddha respected him, which suggests that in making these claims he was not knowingly lying. He likely believed that he had attained, but his understanding was insufficient by the Buddha’s standards.

sn35.133:1.1	At one time Venerable Udāyī was staying near Kāmaṇḍā in the brahmin Todeyya’s mango grove.	NA
sn35.133:1.2	Then a boy who was a pupil of the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan went up to Udāyī and exchanged greetings with him.	A brahmin woman with a student? Wow, is this unique?

sn35.133:2.3	“Sir, might the worthy Udāyī please accept an offering of tomorrow’s meal from my tutor’s wife, the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan.”	BB follows CPD (and Cone) in taking acariyabhariya here in the sense of “female teacher”. Much as I would like to, I don’t find this convincing. It seems to me that the meaning as “teacher’s wife” is well established and we need a good reason to think it means something else here. The issue is, of course, that earlier the student is said to be the antevasi of the lady, hence she must be his acariya. But I don’t think this conflicts with the idea that she is his “teacher’s wife”; in fact I think it’s the most likely explanation. The youth was a student of a brahmin, who most likely passed away. But the wife was also learned, so he kept studying with her. This explains the linguistic situation, but more importantly, why there’s a female teacher in the first place. | Compare CU 4.10.2 ff., where a brahmin’s wife takes part in advising and caring for the student who lives with them.

More literally, it would “as far as there is a place of rebirth for form …” The point is similar to the notion that it is only the aggregates that get reborn. The mendicant is searching all states of rebirth and finding only khandhas, just as the king searched the vina and found only parts.

sn41.1:0.3	The Fetter	NA
sn41.1:1.1	At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove.	Macchikāsaṇḍa was a township in Kāsī.
sn41.1:1.2	Now at that time, after the meal, on return from almsround, several senior mendicants sat together in the pavilion and this discussion came up among them:	NA
sn41.1:1.3	“Reverends, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’: do these things differ in both meaning and phrasing? Or do they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing?”	NA
sn41.1:1.4	Some senior mendicants answered like this:	NA
sn41.1:1.5	“Reverends, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’: these things differ in both meaning and phrasing.”	NA
sn41.1:1.6	But some senior mendicants answered like this:	NA
sn41.1:1.7	“Reverends, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’ mean the same thing; they differ only in the phrasing.”	NA
sn41.1:2.1	Now at that time the householder Citta had arrived at Migapathaka on some business.	NA
sn41.1:2.2	He heard about what those senior mendicants were discussing.	Note the use of kira; Citta didn’t hear them discussing, he heard a report of it. BB expresses this by using quote marks, I phrase more economically. This relates to the “sutam metam” idiom used below, which, like evam me sutam, applies in a situation where you did not hear things directly.

sn41.1:4.9	The yoke there is the single harness or yoke that they’re yoked by.”	NA
sn41.1:4.10	“In the same way, the eye is not the fetter of sights, nor are sights the fetter of the eye.	NA

sn41.2:1.4	They consented with silence.	NA
sn41.2:1.5	Knowing that the senior mendicants had consented, Citta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled them, keeping them on his right, before leaving.	NA
sn41.2:1.6	Then when the night had passed, the senior mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, went to Citta’s home, and sat down on the seats spread out.	NA
sn41.2:2.1	Then Citta went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and asked the senior venerable,	NA

sn41.2:2.3	In what way did the Buddha speak of the diversity of elements?”	NA

Note also that the peculiar context of this, where Citta, normally so precise in his questions, throws in a random set of dhammas and then leaves, echoes the similar passage at AN 10.27.

The “western brahmins” (_brāhmaṇā pacchā bhūmakā_) hail from lands such as Kuru and Pañcālā or further west to Gandhārā. They are depicted in the suttas as adherents of ritualism, in contrast with the brahmins of the lands of the Buddha, especially Kosala, who were more influenced by the contemplative and philosophical teachings of the Upaniṣads. This tension is felt in the Upaniṣads themselves, as Yājñavalkya for example is accused of flouting the teachings of the Vedic scholars of Kuru and Pañcālā (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.9.19).

In the former case, the speaker is distancing himself from this view, in the latter, supporting it.

sn42.13:22.1	“Chief, there is immersion based on understanding of principle.	Dhammasamadhi is a unique term. The various meanings given in the commentary (see BB) betray a lack of clarity in the meaning. MA 20 has 有法之定，名曰遠離, transl. by Analayo/Bucknell as “there is a Dharma meditation called abandoning.” BB’s “concentration of the Dhamma” is unclear and incorrect. From the explanation below it is clear that “samadhi” here has it’s usual meaning. The “dhamma” means “principle” of cause and effect. It’s talking about how you can use wisdom to reflect on the principles of causality, which gives rise to joy and samadhi. This use of “dhamma” is the normal meaning of dhamma in such meditation contexts, eg dhammanupassana or dhammavicaya. BB’s translation “in that” for tatra ce below is overly literal, and it reinforces the perception in the comm that dhammasamadhi and cittasamadhi are different things. They’re not. Tatra ce (below) is not a common idiom, but when BB translates it elsewhere he typically uses just “if” (AN 4.129, AN 6.64). The tatra here does not mean “in that meditation object”, but “in this context, regarding this” and must be idiomatically rendered or omitted.

sn44.1:0.3	With Khemā	NA
sn44.1:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
sn44.1:1.2	Now at that time the nun Khemā was wandering in the land of the Kosalans between Sāvatthī and Sāketa when she took up residence in Toraṇavatthu.	NA
sn44.1:1.3	Then King Pasenadi was traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī, and he too stayed in Toraṇavatthu for a single night.	NA
sn44.1:1.4	Then King Pasenadi addressed a man,	NA
sn44.1:1.5	“Please, worthy man, check if there’s a suitable ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu to whom I can pay homage.”	NA
sn44.1:2.1	“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied that man. He searched all over Toraṇavatthu, but he couldn’t see a suitable ascetic or brahmin for the king to pay homage to.	NA
sn44.1:2.2	But he saw that the nun Khemā was staying there,	NA
sn44.1:2.3	so he went to the king and said to him,	NA
sn44.1:3.1	“Your Majesty, there’s no ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu for the king to pay homage to.	NA
sn44.1:3.2	But there is the nun Khemā, who’s a disciple of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
sn44.1:3.3	She has a good reputation as being	NA
sn44.1:3.4	astute, competent, clever, learned, a brilliant speaker, and eloquent.	NA
sn44.1:3.5	Your Majesty may pay homage to her.”	NA
sn44.1:4.1	Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the nun Khemā, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to her:	NA
sn44.1:4.2	“Ma’am, does a realized one still exist after death?”	NA
sn44.1:4.3	“Great king, this has not been declared by the Buddha.”	NA
sn44.1:4.4	NA	NA

sn44.1:6.3	Do you have any accountant or finger-tallier or reckoner who can count the grains of sand in the Ganges, that is,	NA

sn44.1:6.5	“No, ma’am.”	NA
sn44.1:6.6	“Do you have any accountant or finger-tallier or reckoner who can count the water in the ocean, that is,	BB’s “mathemeticisn” is misleading. A mathemeticisn doesn’t count things, they study mathematics. What’s meant here is those who specialize in estimating or tallying things. In the past these were known as “computers”.

sn44.1:6.8	“No, ma’am.	NA
sn44.1:6.9	Why is that?	NA
sn44.1:6.10	Because the ocean is deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom.”	NA
sn44.1:6.11	“In the same way, great king, any form by which a realized one might be described has been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.	NA
sn44.1:6.12	A realized one is freed from reckoning in terms of form. They’re deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom,	NA

sn44.1:9.5	Then King Pasenadi approved and agreed with what the nun Khemā said. Then he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled her, keeping her on his right, before leaving.	NA
sn44.1:10.1	Then on a later occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. He asked the Buddha exactly the same questions he had asked the nun Khemā, and received the same answers.	NA

sn44.1:13.3	This one time I went to the nun Khemā and asked her about this matter.	NA
sn44.1:13.4	And she explained it to me with these words and phrases, just like the Buddha.	Compare AN 10.115

sn44.2:0.3	With Anurādha	NA
sn44.2:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	NA
sn44.2:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Anurādha was staying not far from the Buddha in a wilderness hut.	NA
sn44.2:1.3	Then several wanderers of other religions went up to Venerable Anurādha and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
sn44.2:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him:	NA
sn44.2:1.5	“Reverend Anurādha, when a realized one is describing a realized one—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them in these four ways:	NA
sn44.2:1.6	After death, a realized one still exists, or no longer exists, or both still exists and no longer exists, or neither still exists nor no longer exists.”	NA
sn44.2:1.7	“Reverends, when a realized one is describing a realized one—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them other than these four ways:	NA
sn44.2:1.8	After death, a realized one still exists, or no longer exists, or both still exists and no longer exists, or neither still exists nor no longer exists.”	NA
sn44.2:1.9	When he said this, the wanderers said to him,	NA
sn44.2:1.10	“This mendicant must be junior, recently gone forth, or else a foolish, incompetent senior mendicant.”	NA
sn44.2:1.11	Then, after rebuking Venerable Anurādha by calling him “junior” and “foolish”, the wanderers got up from their seat and left.	NA
sn44.2:2.1	Soon after they had left, Anurādha thought,	NA
sn44.2:2.2	“If those wanderers were to inquire further,	NA
sn44.2:2.3	how should I answer them so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should I explain in line with his teaching, so that there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?”	NA

I follow him accepting the amended reading katthakalingara. However I am puzzled at why he renders avassajjati as “fastens”, saying this “follows the verb”. I’m not aware of any context where this verb means that. In fact, avassajjati/ossajjati (and its many variant spellings) means to opposite: to release, send off, etc. Why would the hunter walk off carrying the block of tarred wood? Surely it means that he released the monkey from the wood, thus achieving what the monkey could not. A similar sense is associated with yena kamam pakkamati at AN 5.75.

sn47.8:0.3	Cooks	NA
sn47.8:1.1	“Mendicants, suppose a foolish, incompetent, unskillful cook was to serve a ruler or their chief minister with an extravagant variety of curries:	nanaccaya is not entirely satisfactory. BB has no note. Woodward says: “Nānā-ccayehi (not accayehi) = nānā-sayehi, nānā-vidhehi. Comy.” However Comy as VRI has: “Nānaccayehīti nānācayehi, nānāvidhehīti attho. Ayameva vā pāṭho.” I don’t understand where the double cc comes from; and why use such an obscure word where there are much better known terms? SA 616 has no comparable terms. I think what is happening here is similar to the procedure for tooth woods described in the commentary for Kd1. A student is to supply the teacher with different lengths of tooth woods, notice which the teacher uses, then provide only them. This makes more sense to me in the current context; otherwise what’s the point? if they’re just going to offer every kind of curry every day, who cares which the master uses? Thus I suspect we should, in fact, read nana-accaya in the sense of “too many kinds”. The cook is to observe which the master likes, and only offer them.
sn47.8:1.2	superbly sour, bitter, pungent, and sweet; hot and mild, and salty and bland.	the switch from -agga to no -agga is curious here. BB doesn’t represent this, probably taking it to be a mere verbal distinction. Woodward has “soups to be classified as …” following comms “-kotthasa”; but he includes all within this. I find “kotthasa” an unsatisfactory gloss. Ṭhānissaro distinguishes them, using “mainly” for “agga”; again I find it unpersuasive. While most of these terms don’t occur elsewhere, madhuragga appears twice. In a stock phrase in the Sagathavagga we have Kodhassa visamūlassa, madhuraggassa “anger’s poisoned root and honeyed tip”. In Ja 511 we have, in the context of a mango of surpassing deliciousness, “Ambaṁ yassa phalaṁ sādu, madhuraggaṁ manoramaṁ”. In both these contexts the “point” (see what I did there?) is the deliciousness of the sweet flavor. And I think the two halves of the list are meant to complement each other. Sour curries may be hot or mild, salty or bland, and so on. Thus the difference is not merely verbal.

sn47.9:1.6	“Yes, sir,” those mendicants replied. They did as the Buddha said,	NA

sn47.9:2.1	After the Buddha had commenced the rainy season residence, he fell severely ill, struck by dreadful pains, close to death.	NA
sn47.9:2.2	But he endured unbothered, with mindfulness and situational awareness.	NA
sn47.9:2.3	Then it occurred to the Buddha:	NA
sn47.9:2.4	“It would not be appropriate for me to be fully extinguished before informing my attendants and taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
sn47.9:2.5	Why don’t I forcefully suppress this illness, stabilize the life force, and live on?”	NA
sn47.9:2.6	So that is what he did.	NA
sn47.9:2.7	Then the Buddha’s illness died down.	NA
sn47.9:3.1	Soon after the Buddha had recovered from that sickness, he left his dwelling and sat in the shade of the porch on the seat spread out.	BB has “shade behind the dwelling”, evidently accepting PTS’s vihārapacchāchāyāyaṁ. However vihārapacchāyāyaṁ occurs in several other similar contexts, without variants that I know of. The Buddha would regularly receive visitors there, so it meant something more than just the dwelling’s shade; it must have been a covered area outside the hut, i.e. a porch.
sn47.9:3.2	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	NA

sn47.12:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Nāḷandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove.	This was apparently the last time that the Buddha met Sāriputta. This encounter is recorded as part of the Mahāparinibbānasutta at [dn16:1.61.1]() and expanded into a long discourse at [dn28]().

For some reason these events were omitted from the Mahāparinibbānasutta, even though they fit well thematically.

It thus seems to me that it can’t mean a particularly deep insight, such as is unique to Sariputta. The other striking characteristic of the term is that it always occurs in connection with the Buddha personally. In MN 89, Pasenadi sees various things such as the behavior of the monks, then makes his inference. Similarly, here it is inferred from characteristics of the teaching. Thus it seems it means an inference (about the Buddha) as implied by his teaching and the way it’s practiced.

But as inner qualities, it seems more like a reflective idiom, where the parallelism of the phrases, rather then being stricttly literal, is meant in the sense of” I fully embody these things'. Anyway, I translate literally.

sn47.43:3.2	He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:	NA

sn48.58:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain in the Boar’s Cave.	NA
sn48.58:1.2	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta:	NA
sn48.58:1.3	“Sāriputta, considering what benefit does a mendicant with defilements ended, while still alive, continue to show utmost devotion for the Realized One or his instructions?”	NA
sn48.58:1.4	“Sir, it is considering the supreme sanctuary from the yoke that a mendicant with defilements ended, while still alive, continues to show utmost devotion for the Realized One or his instructions.”	See BB’s note. The interpretation of this sutta is difficult; it is one of those texts whose linguistic meaning is obvious but the sense of which is oddly obscure. Neither comm nor tika are of help, and there is no Chinese parallel. The idiom pavattamāno pavattati, so far as I know, doesn’t occur elsewhere. I think it means “while still alive”, and the sutta as a whole is comparable to SN 16.5, where Mahakassapa explains why he continues to keep the dhutangas. Thus the topic is why an arahant does these things—shows devotion, practice the faculties, and so on—when they really don’t need to. And the answer is that it’s of benefit for the enlightenment of others, although this is not made clear. It is, I think, supported by the conclusion of the sutta, where Sariputta mentions a set of dhammas that elsewhere are said to be for the long lasting of the sasana. BB translates this and following passages as “considering as benefit the …” thus seemingly translating atthavasam, but it is absent.

sn51.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	NA
sn51.10:1.3	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.	NA
sn51.10:1.4	Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Ānanda:	NA
sn51.10:1.5	“Ānanda, get your sitting cloth.	NA
sn51.10:1.6	Let’s go to the Cāpāla Shrine for the day’s meditation.”	NA
sn51.10:1.7	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha.	NA
sn51.10:2.1	Then the Buddha went up to the Cāpāla Shrine, and sat down on the seat spread out.	NA
sn51.10:2.2	Ānanda bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.	NA
sn51.10:2.3	The Buddha said to him:	NA
sn51.10:3.1	“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Seven Maidens, Many Sons, Sārandada, and Cāpāla Tree-shrines are all lovely.	NA
sn51.10:3.2	Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.	Normally _kappa_ as a period of time means “eon”, but the late canonical texts Kathāvatthu ([Kv 11.5](https://suttacentral.net/kv11.5)) and Milindapañha ([Mil 5.1.10](https://suttacentral.net/mil5.1.10)) argue that it means the “lifespan”, an interpretation followed by the commentaries. Support for this comes from [dn26:28.3](), which says that “long life” for a mendicant is the four bases of psychic power which enable you to remain for the _kappa_. Here it is surely talking about a full lifespan. Underlying this is the idea that in different epochs the “proper lifespan” varies; in the Buddha’s day it was one hundred years ([dn14:1.7.7]()). We can resolve the problem if we read _kappa_ here, not as a period of time, but as “proper, fitting”, i.e. the “proper” lifespan of a hundred years.
sn51.10:3.3	The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.”	NA
sn51.10:4.1	But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign.	NA
sn51.10:4.2	He didn’t beg the Buddha,	NA
sn51.10:4.3	“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra.	NA
sn51.10:5.1	For a second time …	NA
sn51.10:5.2	and for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda:	NA
sn51.10:5.3	“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Seven Maidens, Many Sons, Sārandada, and Cāpāla Tree-shrines are all lovely.	NA
sn51.10:5.4	Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.	NA
sn51.10:5.5	The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.”	NA

sn51.10:6.2	He didn’t beg the Buddha,	NA
sn51.10:6.3	“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra.	NA
sn51.10:7.1	Then the Buddha said to him,	NA
sn51.10:7.2	“Go now, Ānanda,	NA
sn51.10:7.3	at your convenience.”	NA
sn51.10:7.4	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He rose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before sitting at the root of a tree close by.	NA
sn51.10:8.1	And then, not long after Ānanda had left, Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and said to him:	NA
sn51.10:9.1	“Sir, may the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One now be fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment of the Buddha.	NA

sn51.10:16.1	When this was said, the Buddha said to Māra,	NA
sn51.10:16.2	“Relax, Wicked One. The full extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon.	NA
sn51.10:16.3	Three months from now the Realized One will be fully extinguished.”	NA
sn51.10:17.1	So at the Cāpāla Tree-shrine the Buddha, mindful and aware, surrendered the life force.	NA

Given the context (Anuruddha’s psychic power) I think his suggestion that we interpret in line with AN 3.76 is a good one. If this is the case, then here dhamma=dhatu=loka. I have preserved the parallelism in the translations, even though the terminology of the Pali is slightly different (dhamma vs. dhatu).

sn52.8:0.3	The Frankincense-Tree Hut	NA
sn52.8:1.1	At one time Venerable Anuruddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the frankincense-tree hut.	The identification with salala is uncertain. It may be a variant of sallakī, which has been identified as Boswellia serrata, which is an Indian source of frankincense. The main textual references to salala are in the Apadanas, where salala is frequently identified as a source of fragrant flowers to offer to the Buddha. MN 93 speaks of the fire from the salala. Taken together these references suggest that a variety of frankincense tree is likely to be not too far off. Such trees, however, are fairly straggly, barely more than shrubs, and I don’t think could serve as timber. Perhaps it was used for wattle-and-daub, or else the hut was simply near the tree.
sn52.8:1.2	There Venerable Anuruddha addressed the mendicants:	NA
sn52.8:1.3	“Reverends, suppose that, although the Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east,	NA
sn52.8:1.4	a large crowd were to come along with a spade and basket, saying:	NA
sn52.8:1.5	‘We’ll make this Ganges river slant, slope, and incline to the west!’	NA
sn52.8:1.6	What do you think, reverends? Would they succeed?”	NA
sn52.8:1.7	“No, reverend.	NA
sn52.8:1.8	Why is that?	NA
sn52.8:1.9	The Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east.	NA
sn52.8:1.10	It’s not easy to make it slant, slope, and incline to the west.	NA
sn52.8:1.11	That large crowd will eventually get weary and frustrated.”	NA
sn52.8:2.1	“In the same way, while a mendicant develops and cultivates the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, if rulers or their chief ministers, friends or colleagues, relatives or family should invite them to accept wealth, saying:	NA
sn52.8:2.2	‘Please, worthy man, why let these ocher robes torment you?	NA
sn52.8:2.3	Why follow the practice of shaving your head and carrying an alms bowl?	NA
sn52.8:2.4	Come, return to a lesser life, enjoy wealth, and make merit!’	NA
sn52.8:3.1	It is quite impossible for a mendicant who is developing and cultivating the four kinds of mindfulness meditation to resign the training and return to a lesser life.	NA
sn52.8:3.2	Why is that?	NA
sn52.8:3.3	Because for a long time that mendicant’s mind has slanted, sloped, and inclined to seclusion. So it’s impossible for them to return to a lesser life.	BB mistakenly inserts “give up the training” here and in the parallel passage at SN 35.244. At SN 45.160, he correctly omits it.

sn54.12:0.3	In Doubt	NA
sn54.12:1.1	At one time Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.	Malalasekera in his *Dictionary of Pali Proper Names* says that this monk, whose name is spelled _lomasavangīsa_ in Sinhalese manusripts, is probably the same person as the _lomasakaṅgiya_ of [mn133]() and [thag1.37](). This suggestion is supported by the fact that that the name is spelled _lomasakaṁbhiya_ in Burmese editions. I take the plunge and read _lomasakaṅgiya_ here. The name means “hairy-limbs”.
sn54.12:1.2	Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
sn54.12:1.3	“Sir, is the meditation of a trainee just the same as the meditation of a realized one? Or is the meditation of a trainee different from the meditation of a realized one?”	NA
sn54.12:2.1	“Reverend Mahānāma, the meditation of a trainee and a realized one are not the same;	NA
sn54.12:2.2	they are different.	NA
sn54.12:2.3	Those mendicants who are trainees haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring for the supreme sanctuary from the yoke. They meditate after giving up the five hindrances.	I.e. they get _jhāna_. This confirms that vihara here, as so often, means “meditate”.

This clearly shows that tathagata in such contexts means any arahant. Thus BB’s “the Tathagata” is incorrect—an object lesson in the principles that the mere retaining of Pali words does not guarantee accuracy.

sn55.1:0.3	A Wheel-Turning Monarch	NA
sn55.1:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	NA
sn55.1:1.2	There the Buddha … said:	NA
sn55.1:1.3	“Mendicants, suppose a wheel-turning monarch were to rule as sovereign lord over these four continents. And when his body breaks up, after death, he’s reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the thirty-three. There he entertains himself in the Garden of Delight, escorted by a band of nymphs, and supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation. Still, as he’s lacking four things, he’s not exempt from hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm. He’s not exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld.	NA
sn55.1:1.4	Now suppose a noble disciple wears rags and feeds on scraps of almsfood. Still, as they have four things, they’re exempt from hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld.	NA
sn55.1:2.1	What four?	NA
sn55.1:2.2	It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha:	NA
sn55.1:2.3	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
sn55.1:2.4	They have experiential confidence in the teaching:	NA
sn55.1:2.5	‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’	NA
sn55.1:2.6	They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha:	NA
sn55.1:2.7	‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’	NA
sn55.1:2.8	Furthermore, a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.	NA
sn55.1:2.9	These are the four qualities that they have.	NA
sn55.1:2.10	And, mendicants, gaining these four continents is not worth a sixteenth part of gaining these four things.”	NA

sn55.3:1.2	Now at that time the lay follower Dīghāvu was sick, suffering, gravely ill.	NA

sn55.3:1.6	He bows with his head to your feet.’	NA

sn55.3:1.14	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
sn55.3:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the lay follower Dīghāvu, sat down on the seat spread out, and said to him,	NA
sn55.3:2.2	“I hope you’re keeping well, Dīghāvu; I hope you’re all right. I hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”	NA
sn55.3:2.3	“Sir, I’m not keeping well, I’m not getting by. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.”	NA
sn55.3:2.4	“So, Dīghāvu, you should train like this:	NA
sn55.3:2.5	‘I will have experiential confidence in the Buddha …	NA
sn55.3:2.6	the teaching …	NA
sn55.3:2.7	the Saṅgha …	NA

sn55.3:2.9	That’s how you should train.”	NA
sn55.3:3.1	“Sir, these four factors of stream-entry that were taught by the Buddha are found in me, and I exhibit them.	NA

sn55.3:3.6	“In that case, Dīghāvu, grounded on these four factors of stream-entry you should further develop these six things that play a part in realization.	NA
sn55.3:3.7	You should meditate observing the impermanence of all conditions, perceiving suffering in impermanence, perceiving not-self in suffering, perceiving giving up, perceiving fading away, and perceiving cessation.	See AN 6.35
sn55.3:3.8	That’s how you should train.”	NA

sn55.3:4.2	For I meditate observing the impermanence of all conditions, perceiving suffering in impermanence, perceiving not-self in suffering, perceiving giving up, perceiving fading away, and perceiving cessation.	NA

sn55.3:4.4	‘I hope Jotika doesn’t suffer distress when I’ve gone.’”	NA
sn55.3:4.5	Jotika said, “Dear Dīghāvu, don’t focus on that.	text doesn’t identify the speaker, and BB has no note.

sn55.3:5.5	Where has he been reborn in his next life?”	NA
sn55.3:5.6	“Mendicants, the lay follower Dīghāvu was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings.	NA

sn55.6:0.3	The Chamberlains	NA
sn55.6:1.1	At Sāvatthī.	NA
sn55.6:1.2	At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that	NA
sn55.6:1.3	when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering.	NA
sn55.6:1.4	Now at that time the chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa were residing in Sādhuka on some business.	I was tempted to accept the Nett’s reading of saketa here, but i got the following from Rod Bucknell: On the Pali side, Malalasekera’s Dictionary (condensed on-line version, s.v. Sādhuka) reports the commentary (SN-a iii 215) as saying that this village belonged to Isidatta and Purāṇa. Checking the commentary, I find that what it actually says is this: Sādhuke paṭivisantī ti: Sādhuka-nāmake attano bhoga-gāmake vasanti. “were staying in their own tributary village named Sādhuka”. On the Chinese side, Akanuma’s Dictionary says that the “original” name of the village is “unclear”. Taken as a translation, 鹿徑澤would be “Deer path swamp”, which could well be the name of a village. Taken as a transcription, lu-jing-ze, it certainly doesn’t ring any bell. As to why the two chamberlains were there, SA 860 says: 修治田業, “to manage/oversee the farming”. It also mentions that they are brothers. The rest is as in the Pali, including details of how they attend on the king’s two wives when they go out (riding on an elephant), and the Buddha’s message about the benefits of renunciation versus the dustiness of the household life. Putting all this together, I think one can infer this: The brothers Isidatta and Purāṇa serve as chamberlains in Pasenadi’s court. They have been given the farming village Sādhuka as a feoffdom, and they occasionally visit it to check out the farming activity here, which provides them with a second source of income. This is why they happen to be in such an insignificant little place at the time represented in the sutta. (Sādhuka is apparently only two or three days’ walk from Sāvatthī, in contrast to Sāketa, which is seven chariot-rides away, according to MN 24.)

sn55.6:2.2	“My good man, let us know when you see the Blessed One coming, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.”	NA
sn55.6:2.3	And that person stood there for two or three days before they saw the Buddha coming off in the distance.	NA
sn55.6:2.4	When they saw him, they went to the chamberlains and said:	NA
sn55.6:2.5	“Sirs, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is coming.	NA
sn55.6:2.6	Please come at your convenience.”	NA
sn55.6:3.1	Then the chamberlains went up to the Buddha, bowed, and followed behind him.	NA

sn55.6:15.1	“Sir, it’s when King Pasenadi of Kosala wants to go and visit a park. We have to harness and prepare his royal elephants. Then we have to seat his dear and beloved wives on the elephants, one in front of us, and one behind.	This passage gives us an idea of the duties of the _thapati_ (“chamberlain”). Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.4.4.17–18 tells us that royal authority goes from the king, to the king’s brother, to the _thapati_, to the village head. Similarly, Atharva Veda 2.32.4a and 5.23.11a mention the _thapati_ directly after the king. The current passage shows they were trusted with the most intimate and sensitive duties of the court. Elsewhere we learn that they shared the meal and carriage with the king, accompanying him on military campaigns ([mn89:18.1]()), while the current sutta shows them engaged in governing the provinces. Thus the _thapati_ was the highest non-royal official in the court, entrusted with governing, advising, and security of the household.
sn55.6:15.2	Those sisters smell like a freshly opened perfume box; that’s how the royal ladies smell with makeup on.	BB renders both bhagini and kañña as “lady”. I am not sure of the significance of bhagini here: does it mean they are actually sisters (as Maya and Majapajapati)? Or is is simply an honorific?
sn55.6:15.3	The touch of those sisters is like a tuft of cotton-wool or kapok; that’s how dainty the royal ladies are.	The exact sense of sukhedhita is a little obscure. i think BB’s “delicately nurtured” is derived from MN 82/Pj1. However at Ja 547 we have “Yassā mudutalā hatthā, caraṇā ca sukhedhitā; … Yassā mudutalā pādā, caraṇā ca sukhedhitā;” and at Ja 543 “hatthapādā sukhedhitā”. In neither case does the concept of “nurtured” seem relevant; the point is simply that their feet and hands, or their life, is “delicate”.

sn55.7:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
sn55.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Bamboo Gate.	NA
sn55.7:1.3	The brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate heard:	NA
sn55.7:1.4	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Bamboo Gate, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	NA
sn55.7:1.5	He has this good reputation:	NA
sn55.7:1.6	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
sn55.7:1.7	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	NA
sn55.7:1.8	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
sn55.7:1.9	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	NA
sn55.7:2.1	Then the brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Seated to one side they said to the Buddha:	NA
sn55.7:2.2	“Worthy Gotama, these are our wishes, desires, and hopes.	NA
sn55.7:2.3	We wish to live at home with our children; to use sandalwood imported from Kāsi; to wear garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and to accept gold and currency. And when our body breaks up, after death, we wish to be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	NA
sn55.7:2.4	Given that we have such wishes, may the Buddha teach us the Dhamma so that we may achieve them.”	NA
sn55.7:3.1	“Householders, I will teach you an explanation of the Dhamma that applies to oneself.	NA
sn55.7:3.2	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
sn55.7:3.3	“Yes, worthy sir,” they replied.	NA
sn55.7:3.4	The Buddha said this:	NA

sn55.7:4.2	It’s when a noble disciple reflects:	NA

sn55.7:4.4	Since this is so, if someone were to take my life, I wouldn’t like that.	NA

sn56.11:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana.	NA
sn56.11:1.2	There the Buddha addressed the group of five mendicants:	NA
sn56.11:2.1	“Mendicants, these two extremes should not be cultivated by one who has gone forth.	NA
sn56.11:2.2	What two?	NA
sn56.11:2.3	Indulgence in sensual pleasures, which is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And indulgence in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless.	NA
sn56.11:2.4	Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One understood the middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment.	NA
sn56.11:3.1	And what is that middle way of practice?	NA
sn56.11:3.2	It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:	NA
sn56.11:3.3	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.	NA
sn56.11:3.4	This is that middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment.	NA
sn56.11:4.1	Now this is the noble truth of suffering.	NA
sn56.11:4.2	Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; illness is suffering; death is suffering; association with the disliked is suffering; separation from the liked is suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering.	NA
sn56.11:4.3	Now this is the noble truth of the origin of suffering.	NA
sn56.11:4.4	It’s the craving that leads to future lives, mixed up with relishing and greed, taking pleasure wherever it lands. That is,	NA
sn56.11:4.5	craving for sensual pleasures, craving to continue existence, and craving to end existence.	NA
sn56.11:4.6	Now this is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering.	NA
sn56.11:4.7	It’s the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not clinging to it.	NA
sn56.11:4.8	Now this is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.	NA
sn56.11:4.9	It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:	NA
sn56.11:4.10	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.	NA
sn56.11:5.1	‘This is the noble truth of suffering.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another.	NA

sn56.11:8.3	‘This noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering has been developed.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another.	NA
sn56.11:9.1	As long as my true knowledge and vision about these four noble truths was not fully purified in these three rounds and twelve aspects, I didn’t announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.	The related passage at AN 8.64 suggests that the tiparivaṭṭaṁ dvādasākāraṁ apply to the knowledge, not the truths.
sn56.11:10.1	But when my true knowledge and vision about these four noble truths was fully purified in these three rounds and twelve aspects, I announced my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.	NA
sn56.11:10.2	Knowledge and vision arose in me:	NA
sn56.11:10.3	‘My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.’”	NA
sn56.11:10.4	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
sn56.11:10.5	Satisfied, the group of five mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA
sn56.11:11.1	And while this discourse was being spoken, the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in Venerable Koṇḍañña:	NA
sn56.11:11.2	“Everything that has a beginning has an end.”	NA
sn56.11:12.1	And when the Buddha rolled forth the Wheel of Dhamma, the earth gods raised the cry:	NA
sn56.11:12.2	“Near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world.”	NA
sn56.11:12.3	Hearing the cry of the earth gods, the gods of the four great kings …	NA
sn56.11:12.4	NA	NA
sn56.11:12.5	the gods of the thirty-three …	NA
sn56.11:12.6	the gods of Yama …	NA
sn56.11:12.7	the joyful gods …	NA
sn56.11:12.8	the gods who love to imagine …	NA
sn56.11:12.9	the gods who control what is imagined by others …	NA
sn56.11:12.10	the gods of the Divinity’s host raised the cry:	NA
sn56.11:12.11	“Near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world.”	NA
sn56.11:13.1	And so at that moment, that second, that hour, the cry soared up to the realm of divinity.	NA
sn56.11:13.2	And this ten-thousandfold galaxy shook and rocked and trembled. And an immeasurable, magnificent light appeared in the world, surpassing the glory of the gods.	NA
sn56.11:14.1	Then the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
sn56.11:14.2	“Koṇḍañña has really understood! Koṇḍañña has really understood!”	NA
sn56.11:14.3	And that’s how Venerable Koṇḍañña came to be known as “Koṇḍañña Who Understood”.	NA

sn56.45:1.3	He saw several Licchavi youths practicing archery near the town hall. They were shooting arrows from a distance through a small keyhole, shot after shot without missing.	BB has “head through butt”, which apart from the double entendre, is perhaps overly literal. While _poṅkha_ means “feathered shaft”, the expression _poṅkhānupoṅkha_ is treated in the Niddesas as a standard synonym meaning “repeatedly, continuously”. Hence I chose “shot after shot” as somewhere between a literal and figurative expression.

Koti, of course, could refer to an arrow’s point, but it is not a standard term. Also, it seems odd to take the phrase kotiya kotim to refer to two completely different kinds of things.
