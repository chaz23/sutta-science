Yogakkhema is a hard idiom to get right. I agree with the theory of Witzel, who traces it to an “oasis”, deriving from the very old days of the Indo-euopean wanderers. They’d trudge through the desert and hardlands, and after a very long time they’d come to a lake, an oasis, with grass for the cattle and horses, and shade and water. There they’d stop for the night, make a safe place, and find relief both for themselves and their beasts. This meaning is still prominent in the Jatakas, where a number of the old, mythic Jatakas features a lake Khema that is a sanctuary for living creatures. I translate directly as sanctuary, and use “sanctuary from the yoke” or similar when need in context.

an2.1:0.2	The Chapter on Punishments	NA
an2.1:1.0	1. Faults	NA
an2.1:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
an2.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
an2.1:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
an2.1:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
an2.1:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
an2.1:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
an2.1:2.1	“There are, mendicants, these two faults.	NA
an2.1:2.2	What two?	NA
an2.1:2.3	The fault apparent in this life, and the fault to do with lives to come.	NA
an2.1:2.4	What is the fault apparent in this life?	NA
an2.1:2.5	It’s when someone sees that kings have arrested a bandit, a criminal, and subjected them to various punishments—	NA
an2.1:2.6	whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘Rāhu’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘bulrush twist’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded.	The commentary explains these punishments thus. “Porridge pot”: remove the top of the skull and drop in a hot iron ball so that the brains boil over. “Shell-shave”: grind the skull with gravel until it is smooth. “Rāhu”s mouth’: force open the mouth with a skewer, put in oil and wick, and light it so it burns like the sun swallowed by the titan Rāhu ([sn2.8]()). “Garland of fire”: smear the body with oil and set it alight. “Burning hand”: wrap the hand with oiled rags and set it alight. “Bulrush twist”: flay the skin from the neck down, then twist it into a band by which to hang the victim. “Bark dress”: cut the skin in strips and make it into a garment. “Antelope”: pin the bound victim to the ground and roast them alive. “Meat hook”: flay with double fish-hooks. “Coins”: slice off disks of flesh like coins. “Caustic pickle”: beat the victim, then rub the wounds with caustic solution. “Twisting bar”: pin the victim to the ground by the ears and twirl them by the feet. “Straw mat”: beat them until every bone is broken and the body becomes limp as a mattress.
an2.1:3.1	It occurs to them:	NA
an2.1:3.2	‘If I were to commit the kinds of bad deeds for which the kings arrested that bandit, that criminal,	NA
an2.1:3.4	the rulers would arrest me and subject me to the same punishments.	NA
an2.1:3.6	Afraid of the fault apparent in this life, they do not steal the belongings of others.	NA
an2.1:3.7	This is called the fault apparent in this life.	NA
an2.1:4.1	What is the fault to do with lives to come?	NA
an2.1:4.2	It’s when someone reflects:	NA
an2.1:4.3	‘Bad conduct of body, speech, or mind has a bad, painful result in the next life.	NA
an2.1:4.4	If I conduct myself badly,	NA
an2.1:4.5	then, when my body breaks up, after death, won’t I be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell?’	NA
an2.1:4.6	Afraid of the fault to do with lives to come, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure.	NA
an2.1:4.7	This is called the fault to do with lives to come.	NA
an2.1:4.8	These are the two faults.	NA
an2.1:4.9	So you should train like this:	NA
an2.1:4.10	‘We will fear the fault apparent in this life, and we will fear the fault to do with lives to come. We will fear faults, seeing the danger in faults.’	NA
an2.1:4.11	That’s how you should train.	NA
an2.1:4.12	If you fear faults, seeing the danger in faults, you can expect to be freed from all faults.”	NA
an2.2:1.0	2. Endeavor	NA
an2.2:1.1	“These two endeavors are challenging in the world.	NA
an2.2:1.2	What two?	NA
an2.2:1.3	The endeavor of laypeople staying in a home to provide robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And the endeavor of those gone forth from the lay life to homelessness to let go of all attachments.	NA
an2.2:1.4	These are the two endeavors that are challenging in the world.	NA
an2.2:2.1	The better of these two endeavors is the effort to let go of all attachments.	NA
an2.2:2.2	So you should train like this:	NA
an2.2:2.3	‘We shall endeavor to let go of all attachments.’	NA
an2.2:2.4	That’s how you should train.”	NA
an2.3:1.0	3. Mortifying	NA
an2.3:1.1	“These two things, mendicants, are mortifying.	NA
an2.3:1.2	What two?	NA
an2.3:1.3	It’s when someone has done bad things and not done good things, by way of body, speech, and mind.	NA
an2.3:1.6	Thinking, ‘I’ve done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind’, they’re mortified. Thinking, ‘I haven’t done good things by way of body, speech, and mind’, they’re mortified.	NA
an2.3:1.9	These are the two things that are mortifying.”	NA
an2.4:1.0	4. Not Mortifying	NA
an2.4:1.1	“These two things, mendicants, are not mortifying.	NA
an2.4:1.2	What two?	NA
an2.4:1.3	It’s when someone has done good things and not done bad things, by way of body, speech, and mind.	NA
an2.4:1.6	Thinking, ‘I’ve done good things by way of body, speech, and mind’, they’re not mortified. Thinking, ‘I haven’t done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind’, they’re not mortified.	NA
an2.4:1.9	These are the two things that are not mortifying.”	NA
an2.5:1.0	5. Learned for Myself	NA
an2.5:1.1	“Mendicants, I have learned these two things for myself—	NA
an2.5:1.2	to never be content with skillful qualities, and to never stop trying.	NA
an2.5:1.3	I never stopped trying, thinking:	NA
an2.5:1.4	‘Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.’	NA
an2.5:1.5	It was by diligence that I achieved awakening, and by diligence that I achieved the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.	NA
an2.5:1.6	If you too never stop trying, thinking:	NA
an2.5:1.7	‘Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.’	NA
an2.5:1.8	You will soon realize the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
an2.5:1.9	So you should train like this:	NA
an2.5:1.10	‘We will never stop trying, thinking:	NA
an2.5:1.11	“Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.”’	NA
an2.5:1.12	That’s how you should train.”	NA
an2.6:1.0	6. Fetters	NA
an2.6:1.1	“There are, mendicants, these two things.	NA
an2.6:1.2	What two?	NA
an2.6:1.3	Seeing things that are prone to being fettered as gratifying, and seeing things that are prone to being fettered as boring.	NA
an2.6:1.4	When you keep seeing things that are prone to being fettered as gratifying, you don’t give up greed, hate, and delusion.	NA
an2.6:1.5	When these are not given up, you’re not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.	NA
an2.6:1.6	You’re not freed from suffering, I say.	NA
an2.6:2.1	When you keep seeing things that are prone to being fettered as boring, you give up greed, hate, and delusion.	NA
an2.6:2.2	When these are given up, you’re freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.	NA
an2.6:2.3	You’re freed from suffering, I say.	NA
an2.6:2.4	These are the two things.”	NA
an2.7:1.0	7. Dark	NA
an2.7:1.1	“These two things, mendicants, are dark.	NA
an2.7:1.2	What two?	NA
an2.7:1.3	Lack of conscience and prudence.	NA
an2.7:1.4	These are the two things that are dark.”	NA
an2.8:1.0	8. Bright	NA
an2.8:1.1	“These two things, mendicants, are bright.	NA
an2.8:1.2	What two?	NA
an2.8:1.3	Conscience and prudence.	NA
an2.8:1.4	These are the two things that are bright.”	NA
an2.9:1.0	9. Conduct	NA
an2.9:1.1	“These two bright things, mendicants, protect the world.	NA
an2.9:1.2	What two?	NA
an2.9:1.3	Conscience and prudence.	NA
an2.9:1.4	If these two bright things did not protect the world, there would be no recognition of the status of mother, aunts, or wives and partners of tutors and respected people.	Compare [dn26:20.1]().
an2.9:1.5	The world would become dissolute, like goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and dogs and jackals.	For _sambheda_ in the sense of “dissolving, leaking”, see [dn3:1.15.11](), [an5.103:6.4](), [an10.45:4.1](). The commentary to DN 26 says “mixedness, breaking of boundaries”.
an2.9:1.6	But because the two bright things protect the world, there is recognition of the status of mother, aunts, and wives and partners of tutors and respected people.”	NA

an2.11:1.4	And what, mendicants, is the power of reflection?	NA

an2.11:2.1	And what, mendicants, is the power of development?	NA
an2.11:2.2	In this context, the power of development is the power of the trainees.	NA
an2.11:2.3	For when you rely on the power of a trainee, you give up greed, hate, and delusion.	NA
an2.11:2.4	Then you don’t do anything unskillful, or practice anything bad.	NA

an2.17:1.12	“Yes, worthy sir,” Jānussoṇi replied.	NA
an2.17:1.13	The Buddha said this:	NA
an2.17:2.1	“Firstly, brahmin, someone has done bad things and not done good things by way of body, speech, and mind.	NA
an2.17:2.4	So what they’ve done and what they’ve not done is why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	NA
an2.17:2.5	Furthermore, brahmin, someone has done good things and not done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.	NA
an2.17:2.8	So what they’ve done and what they’ve not done is why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”	NA

an2.18:1.0	18	NA
an2.18:1.1	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	NA
an2.18:1.2	“Ānanda, I absolutely say that you should not do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.”	NA
an2.18:1.3	“But, sir, if someone does these things that should not be done, what drawbacks should they expect?”	NA
an2.18:1.4	“They should expect these drawbacks.	NA
an2.18:1.5	They blame themselves.	NA
an2.18:1.6	After examination, sensible people criticize them.	NA
an2.18:1.7	They get a bad reputation.	NA
an2.18:1.8	They feel lost when they die.	NA
an2.18:1.9	And when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	NA
an2.18:1.10	These are the drawbacks they should expect.”	NA
an2.18:2.1	“Ānanda, I absolutely say that you should do good things by way of body, speech, and mind.”	NA
an2.18:2.2	“But, sir, if someone does these things that should be done, what benefits should they expect?”	NA
an2.18:2.3	“They should expect these benefits.	NA
an2.18:2.4	They don’t blame themselves.	NA
an2.18:2.5	After examination, sensible people praise them.	NA
an2.18:2.6	They get a good reputation.	NA
an2.18:2.7	They don’t feel lost when they die.	NA

an2.32:1.2	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
an2.32:1.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA

an2.34:1.0	34	NA
an2.34:1.1	Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,	NA
an2.34:1.2	“What does the worthy Gotama teach? What does he explain?”	NA
an2.34:1.3	“Brahmin, I teach action and inaction.”	NA
an2.34:1.4	“But in what way does the worthy Gotama teach action and inaction?”	NA

an2.35:1.0	35	NA
an2.35:1.1	Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha,	NA
an2.35:1.2	“How many in the world are worthy of a religious donation? And where should a gift be given?”	NA
an2.35:1.3	“Householder, there are two in the world who are worthy of a religious donation:	NA
an2.35:1.4	the trainee and the adept.	NA
an2.35:1.5	These two in the world are worthy of a religious donation, and that’s where you should give a gift.”	NA
an2.35:2.1	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
an2.35:2.2	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	NA
an2.35:3.1	“In this world, the trainee and the adept,	NA
an2.35:3.2	are worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods.	NA
an2.35:3.3	They are sincere in body,	NA
an2.35:3.4	speech, and mind.	NA
an2.35:3.5	This is the field for sponsors of sacrifice—	NA
an2.35:3.6	what’s given here is very fruitful.”	NA
an2.36:1.0	36	NA
an2.36:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
an2.36:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
an2.36:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.	NA
an2.36:1.4	There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:	NA
an2.36:1.5	“Reverends, mendicants!”	NA
an2.36:1.6	“Reverend,” they replied.	NA
an2.36:1.7	Sāriputta said this:	NA
an2.36:1.8	“I will teach you about a person fettered internally and one fettered externally.	NA
an2.36:1.9	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
an2.36:1.10	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.	NA
an2.36:1.11	Sāriputta said this:	NA
an2.36:2.1	“Who is a person fettered internally?	NA
an2.36:2.2	It’s a mendicant who is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.	NA
an2.36:2.3	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in one of the orders of gods.	NA
an2.36:2.4	When they pass away from there, they’re a returner, who comes back to this place.	NA
an2.36:2.5	This is called a person who is fettered internally, a returner, who comes back to this place.	NA
an2.36:3.1	Who is a person fettered externally?	NA
an2.36:3.2	It’s a mendicant who is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.	NA
an2.36:3.3	They enter and remain in a certain peaceful state of freed mind.	NA
an2.36:3.4	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in one of the orders of gods.	NA
an2.36:3.5	When they pass away from there, they’re a non-returner, not coming back to this place.	NA
an2.36:3.6	This is called a person who is fettered externally, a non-returner, who does not come back to this place.	NA
an2.36:4.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is ethical … they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.	NA
an2.36:4.2	They simply practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding sensual pleasures.	NA
an2.36:4.3	They simply practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding future lives.	NA
an2.36:4.4	They practice for the ending of craving.	NA
an2.36:4.5	They practice for the ending of greed.	NA
an2.36:4.6	When their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in one of the orders of gods.	NA
an2.36:4.7	When they pass away from there, they are non-returners, not coming back to this place.	NA
an2.36:4.8	This is called a person who is fettered externally, a non-returner, who does not come back to this place.”	NA
an2.36:5.1	Then several peaceful-minded deities went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to the Buddha,	NA
an2.36:5.2	“Sir, Venerable Sāriputta is in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery, where he is teaching the mendicants about a person with internal fetters and one with external fetters.	NA
an2.36:5.3	The assembly is overjoyed!	NA
an2.36:5.4	Sir, please go to Venerable Sāriputta out of sympathy.”	NA
an2.36:5.5	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
an2.36:5.6	Then the Buddha, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery, in front of Sāriputta.	NA
an2.36:5.7	He sat on the seat spread out.	NA
an2.36:5.8	Sāriputta bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.	NA
an2.36:5.9	The Buddha said to him:	NA
an2.36:6.1	“Just now, Sāriputta, several peaceful-minded deities came up to me, bowed, and stood to one side. Those deities said to me:	NA
an2.36:6.2	‘Sir, Venerable Sāriputta is in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery, where he is teaching the mendicants about a person with internal fetters and one with external fetters.	NA
an2.36:6.3	The assembly is overjoyed!	NA
an2.36:6.4	Sir, please go to Venerable Sāriputta out of sympathy.’	NA
an2.36:6.5	Those deities, though they number ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or sixty, can stand on the point of a needle without bumping up against each other.	NA
an2.36:6.6	Sāriputta, you might think:	NA
an2.36:6.7	‘Surely those deities, since so many of them can stand on the point of a needle without bumping up against each other, must have developed their minds in that place.’	NA
an2.36:6.8	But you should not see it like this.	NA
an2.36:6.9	It was right here that those deities developed their minds.	NA
an2.36:6.10	So you should train like this:	NA
an2.36:6.11	‘We shall have peaceful faculties and peaceful minds.’	NA
an2.36:6.12	That’s how you should train.	NA
an2.36:6.13	When your faculties and mind are peaceful, your acts of body, speech, and mind will be peaceful, thinking:	NA
an2.36:6.14	‘We shall present the gift of peace to our spiritual companions.’	NA
an2.36:6.15	That’s how you should train.	NA
an2.36:6.16	Those wanderers of other religions, Sāriputta, who have not heard this exposition of the teaching are lost.”	NA
an2.37:1.0	37	NA
an2.37:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
an2.37:1.2	At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying at Varaṇā, on the bank of the Kaddama Lake.	This location is unknown and the readings uncertain. The following sutta finds Mahākaccāna in Madhurā. If the current sutta were in the same region, it would explain why Sāvatthī is said to lie in the east.
an2.37:1.3	Then the brahmin Ārāmadaṇḍa went up to Mahākaccāna, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
an2.37:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Mahākaccāna:	NA
an2.37:1.5	“What is the cause, worthy Kaccāna, what is the reason why aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, and householders fight with householders?”	NA
an2.37:1.6	“It is because of their insistence on sensual desire, their shackles, avarice, and attachment, that aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, and householders fight with householders.”	NA
an2.37:2.1	“What is the cause, worthy Kaccāna, what is the reason why ascetics fight with ascetics?”	NA
an2.37:2.2	“It is because of their insistence on views, their shackles, avarice, and attachment, that ascetics fight with ascetics.”	NA
an2.37:3.1	“Worthy Kaccāna, is there anyone in the world who has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views?”	NA
an2.37:3.2	“There is, brahmin.”	NA
an2.37:4.1	“Who in the world has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views?”	NA
an2.37:4.2	“In the eastern lands there is a city called Sāvatthī.	NA
an2.37:4.3	There the Blessed One is now staying, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
an2.37:4.4	He, brahmin, has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views.”	NA
an2.37:5.1	When this was said, the brahmin Ārāmadaṇḍa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times:	NA
an2.37:6.1	“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	NA
an2.37:7.1	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	NA
an2.37:8.1	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	NA
an2.37:9.1	He who has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views.	NA
an2.37:10.1	Excellent, worthy Kaccāna! Excellent!	NA
an2.37:10.2	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the worthy Kaccāna has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
an2.37:10.3	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
an2.37:10.4	From this day forth, may the worthy Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	NA
an2.38:1.0	38	NA
an2.38:1.1	At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying near Madhurā, in Gunda’s Grove.	NA
an2.38:1.2	Then the brahmin Kandarāyana went up to Mahākaccāna, and exchanged greetings with him … He sat down to one side and said to Mahākaccāna:	NA
an2.38:1.3	“I have heard, worthy Kaccāna, that the ascetic Kaccāna doesn’t bow to old brahmins, the elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat.	NA
an2.38:1.4	And this is indeed the case,	NA
an2.38:1.5	for the ascetic Kaccāna does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat.	NA
an2.38:1.6	This is not appropriate, worthy Kaccāna.”	NA
an2.38:2.1	“There is the stage of an elder and the stage of youth as explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
an2.38:2.2	If an elder, though eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old, still dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying them, consumed by thoughts of them, burning with fever for them, and eagerly seeking more,	The parallel passage occurs at MN 125 and AN 2.38. MS text has kāmamajjhāvasati at AN 2.38 and kāmamajjhe vasanto at MN 125. BB has “living in the midst of sensual pleasures” at MN 125 and “dwells in sensual pleasures” at AN 2.38, with the note: “I follow Ce and Be kāmamajjhāvasati (= kāmaṁ ajjhāvasati), as against Ee kāmamajjhe vasati.” Notably, the first two terms in the sequence are reversed. the sequence in MN 125 makes better sense: it starts with where they live, what they do, what they think about, and gradually moves up to being consumed and seeking more. I take this as the correct sense and translate both passages accordingly.
an2.38:2.3	they are reckoned as a child, not a senior.	BB has “childish elder”, evidently not reading “na”.

an3.1:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
an3.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
an3.1:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
an3.1:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
an3.1:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
an3.1:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
an3.1:2.1	“Whatever dangers there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.	NA
an3.1:2.2	Whatever perils there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.	Upaddava and upasagga appear at AN 3.1, in a parallel at MN 115, and upaddava recurs in related passages at MN 122 and SN 16.8. See too Ss 8. In each case they seem to be a synonym of bhaya in the sense of “danger”, which in both upaddava and upasagga is related to the basic sense of “being rushed upon by something”. At MN 122 it is better to read in this sense rather than “undoing”; the undoing comes later. Notably, both upaddava and upasagga are terms for an eclipse, and possibly convey an echo of “ill-omened”. I translate “peril “and” hazard”.
an3.1:2.3	Whatever hazards there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.	NA
an3.1:2.4	It’s like a fire that spreads from a hut made of reeds or grass, and burns down even a bungalow, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with doors fastened and windows shuttered.	NA
an3.1:2.5	In the same way, whatever dangers there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.	NA

an3.15:0.3	About Pacetana	NA
an3.15:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana.	NA
an3.15:1.2	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
an3.15:1.3	“Mendicants!”	NA
an3.15:1.4	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
an3.15:1.5	The Buddha said this:	NA
an3.15:2.1	“Once upon a time there was a king named Pacetana.	The Sinhalese manuscript reading _pacetana_ should be preferred over Burmese _sacetana_. Sanskrit dictionaries note the term _pracetṛ_ (“charioteer”), which is evidently a misreading of _pravetṛ_ (see Patañjali Vyākaraṇamahābhāṣya: _rathasya pravetā_).
an3.15:2.2	Then King Pacetana addressed his chariot-maker,	NA
an3.15:2.3	‘In six months’ time, my good chariot-maker, there will be a battle.	NA
an3.15:2.4	Are you able to make me a new pair of wheels?’	NA
an3.15:2.5	‘I can, Your Majesty,’ replied the chariot-maker.	NA
an3.15:2.6	Then, when it was six days less than six months later, the chariot-maker had finished one wheel.	NA
an3.15:2.7	Then King Pacetana addressed his chariot-maker,	NA
an3.15:2.8	‘In six days’ time there will be a battle. Is my new pair of wheels finished?’	NA
an3.15:2.9	‘Now that it is six days less than six months, Your Majesty, I have finished one wheel.’	NA
an3.15:2.10	‘Are you able to finish the second wheel in these six days?’	NA
an3.15:2.11	Saying, ‘I can, Your Majesty,’ the chariot-maker finished the second wheel in six days. Taking the pair of wheels he went up to King Pacetana, and said this to the king,	NA
an3.15:2.12	‘Your Majesty, these are your two new wheels, finished.’	NA
an3.15:2.13	‘But, my good chariot-maker, what is the difference between the wheel that was finished in six days less than six months, and the wheel finished in just six days?	NA
an3.15:2.14	Because I can’t see any difference between them.’	NA
an3.15:2.15	‘But, Your Majesty, there is a difference.	NA
an3.15:2.16	See now what it is.’	NA
an3.15:3.1	Then the chariot-maker rolled forth the wheel that had been finished in six days.	NA
an3.15:3.2	It rolled as far as the original impetus took it, then wobbled and fell down.	NA
an3.15:3.3	Then he rolled forth the wheel that had been finished in six days less than six months.	NA
an3.15:3.4	It rolled as far as the original impetus took it, then stood still as if fixed to an axle.	NA
an3.15:4.1	‘But what is the cause, my good chariot-maker, what is the reason why the wheel that was finished in six days wobbled and fell,	NA
an3.15:4.2	while the one that was finished in six days less than six months stood still as if fixed to an axle?’	NA
an3.15:4.3	‘The wheel that was finished in six days, Your Majesty, is crooked, flawed, and defective in rim, spoke, and hub.	NA
an3.15:4.4	That’s why it wobbled and fell.	NA
an3.15:4.5	The wheel that was finished in six days less than six months, Your Majesty, is not crooked, flawed, and defective in rim, spoke, and hub.	NA
an3.15:4.6	That’s why it stood still as if fixed to an axle.’	NA
an3.15:5.1	Now, mendicants, you might think:	NA
an3.15:5.2	‘Surely that chariot-maker must have been someone else at that time?’	NA
an3.15:5.3	But you should not see it like that.	NA
an3.15:5.4	I myself was the chariot-maker at that time.	NA
an3.15:5.5	Then I was skilled in the crooks, flaws, and defects of wood.	NA
an3.15:5.6	Now that I am a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, I am skilled in the crooks, flaws, and defects of actions by body, speech, and mind.	NA
an3.15:5.7	Whatever monk or nun has not given up the crooks, flaws, and defects of body, speech, and mind has fallen from the teaching and training, just like the wheel that was finished in six days.	NA
an3.15:6.1	Whatever monk or nun has given up the crooks, flaws, and defects of body, speech, and mind is established in the teaching and training, just like the wheel that was finished in six days less than six months.	NA

an3.16:1.1	“Mendicants, when a mendicant has three things their practice is unfailing, and they have laid the groundwork for ending the defilements.	BB has “unmistakeable”, which would mean “you can’t mistake it for something else”, which is incorrect. The basic meaning is it’s “win-win”, a situation where you can’t lose or fail.
an3.16:1.2	What three?	NA
an3.16:1.3	It’s when a mendicant guards the sense doors, eats in moderation, and is dedicated to wakefulness.	NA
an3.16:2.1	And how does a mendicant guard the sense doors?	NA
an3.16:2.2	When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.	NA
an3.16:2.3	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.	NA
an3.16:2.4	When they hear a sound with their ears …	NA
an3.16:2.5	When they smell an odor with their nose …	NA
an3.16:2.6	When they taste a flavor with their tongue …	NA

an3.16:2.10	That’s how a mendicant guards the sense doors.	NA
an3.16:3.1	And how does a mendicant eat in moderation?	NA
an3.16:3.2	It’s when a mendicant reflects rationally on the food that they eat:	NA
an3.16:3.3	‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will have the means to keep going, blamelessness, and a comfortable abiding.’	NA
an3.16:3.4	That’s how a mendicant eats in moderation.	NA
an3.16:4.1	And how is a mendicant dedicated to wakefulness?	NA
an3.16:4.2	It’s when a mendicant practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind from obstacles. In the first watch of the night, they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation. In the middle watch, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. In the last watch, they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying their mind from obstacles.	NA

an3.20:2.1	And how is a shopkeeper indefatigable?	_Vidhura_ only occurs here, and as an epithet of the Buddha at snp5.1:21.3. The Sanskrit meanings of _vidhura_ are mostly negative and it doesn’t seem to be the same word (√vidh). The only real guide we have to meaning is here, where it stands for the energy of the shopkeeper or later the mendicant. Apparently it is the same sense as _anikkhittadhuro_, glossed by the commentary as _visiṭṭhadhuro uttamadhuro ñāṇasampayuttena vīriyena samannāgato_. The commentary at snp5.1:21.3 gives the opposite sense there (_vigatadhuro, appaṭimo_), but there seems no reason not to read it the same way in both places.

an3.20:3.3	‘This good shopkeeper sees clearly and is indefatigable. They are capable of providing for their wives and children, and paying us back from time to time.’	BB usually translates _puttadāra_ as “wife and children”. However when the compound is resolved, _dāra_ is usually in plural, “wives”. I render with the gender-neutral “partner” except where the context is gendered. Also note that notions of marriage have always been more flexible in English than in Christian lands, and arrangements that we might consider defacto partnerships might also be known by the same terms.

an3.32:4.3	That’s how, Ānanda, a mendicant might gain a state of immersion such that there’s no I-making, mine-making, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body; and no I-making, mine-making, or underlying tendency to conceit for all external stimuli;	NA

an3.35:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Āḷavī, on a mat of leaves by a cow-path in a grove of Indian Rosewood.	NA

an3.35:2.1	“The winter nights are cold, sir, and it’s the week of mid-winter, when the snow falls. Rough is the ground trampled under the cows’ hooves, and thin is the mat of leaves. The leaves are sparse on the trees, the ocher robes are cold, and cold blows the north wind.	NA

an3.37:1.1	“On the eighth day of the fortnight, mendicants, the ministers and councillors of the four great kings wander about the world, thinking:	NA
an3.37:1.2	‘Hopefully most humans are paying due respect to their parents, ascetics and brahmins, honoring the elders in their families, observing and keeping vigil on the sabbath, and making merit.’	Following Kuan, _paṭijāgaronti_ = BHSK _pratijāgarti_ “to wakefully watch over”, i.e. “keep vigil”. The commentarial sense of “extra uposathas” is hardly credible.
an3.37:1.3	And on the fourteenth day of the fortnight, the sons of the four great kings wander about the world, thinking:	NA

an3.39:0.3	A Delicate Lifestyle	NA
an3.39:1.1	“My lifestyle was delicate, mendicants, most delicate, extremely delicate.	NA
an3.39:1.2	In my father’s home, lotus ponds were made just for me.	NA
an3.39:1.3	In some, blue water lilies blossomed, while in others, there were pink or white lotuses, just for my benefit.	NA
an3.39:1.4	I only used sandalwood from Kāsi, and my turbans, jackets, sarongs, and upper robes also came from Kāsi.	From this it would appear that the nivasana is comparable to what bhikkhus call antaravasaka, i.e. a robe that covers the lower parts, worn indoors, i.e. a dhoti or sarong.
an3.39:1.5	And a white parasol was held over me night and day, with the thought:	NA
an3.39:1.6	‘Don’t let cold, heat, grass, dust, or damp bother him.’	NA
an3.39:2.1	I had three stilt longhouses—one for the winter, one for the summer, and one for the rainy season.	NA
an3.39:2.2	I stayed in a stilt longhouse without coming downstairs for the four months of the rainy season, where I was entertained by musicians—none of them men.	NA
an3.39:2.3	While the bondservants, workers, and staff in other houses are given rough gruel with false black pepper to eat, in my father’s home they are given fine rice with meat.	_Bilaṅga_ is allowed with other medicinal fruits at [pli-tv-kd6:6.1.4](). It is Sanskrit _viḍaṅga_, identified as *embelia ribes* or “false black pepper”.
an3.39:3.1	Amid such prosperity and such a delicate lifestyle, I thought:	NA
an3.39:3.2	‘When an unlearned ordinary person—who is liable to grow old, not being exempt from old age—sees someone else who is old, they’re horrified, repelled, and disgusted, overlooking the fact that they themselves are in the same situation.	NA
an3.39:3.3	But since I, too, am liable to grow old, it would not be appropriate for me to be horrified, embarrassed, and disgusted, when I see someone else who is old.’	NA

an3.40:1.5	It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this:	NA

an3.40:1.13	Putting themselves in charge, they give up the unskillful and develop the skillful, they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless, and they keep themselves pure.	NA

an3.56:1.2	“Worthy Gotama, I have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior, the tutors of tutors, said:	NA
an3.56:1.3	‘In the old days this world was so full of humans you’d think they were squashed together. The villages, towns and capital cities were no more than a chicken’s flight apart.’	Here _avīci_ means “uninterrupted” rather than being a name for hell.

an3.56:2.1	“These days, brahmin, humans just love illicit desire. They’re overcome by immoral greed, and mired in wrong custom.	These three terms recur in a similar context at [dn26:17.16](); the commentaries to the two passages give quite different explanations. “Illicit desire” (_adhammarāgo_) probably refers to any form of desire that is illegal or transgressive, such as incest, rape, or pedophilia. “Immoral greed” (_visamalobho_) implies excess and imbalance. Both are explained in the commentary this passage as desire for the belongings of others. _Micchādhammo_ is hard to pin down. Its opposite, _sammā dhammo_ always means “right teaching”. The commentary at [dn26:17.16]() explains it as homosexuality, but this must be rejected as there is no hint anywhere in early Pali (or elsewhere in early Indian culture) that homosexuality was considered immoral. The commentary here explains it as “indulgence in what is reckoned as an inappropriate basis” (_avatthupaṭisevanasaṅkhātena_). This implies intercourse with one of women mentioned at [mn41:8.4](), which includes those who are “protected by principle” (_dhammarakkhitā_). This sense of _dhamma_ is explained at [pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:4.2.16]() as “religion”. Here I think the sense is similar: customs or beliefs that legitimize immorality.

an3.58:2.2	“Worthy Gotama, it’s when a brahmin is well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation. He recites and remembers the hymns, and has mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth.

an3.58:3.4	“Well then, brahmin, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
an3.58:3.5	“Yes, worthy sir,” Tikaṇṇa replied.	NA
an3.58:3.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
an3.58:4.1	“Brahmin, it’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
an3.58:4.2	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
an3.58:4.3	And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA
an3.58:4.4	With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
an3.58:5.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives.	NA
an3.58:5.2	They recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food.

an3.58:6.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place.

an3.60:1.5	Now, worthy Gotama, both of these people—the one who sacrifices and the one who encourages others to sacrifice—are doing good for many people on account of that sacrifice.	NA
an3.60:1.6	But, worthy Gotama, when someone has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness, they tame, calm, and extinguish themselves alone. That being so, they are doing good for just one person on account of that going forth.”	NA
an3.60:2.1	“Well then, brahmin, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.	NA
an3.60:2.2	What do you think, brahmin?	NA
an3.60:2.3	A Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.	NA

an3.60:7.7	‘Formerly, it seems, there were fewer mendicants, but more of them displayed superhuman demonstrations of psychic power;	NA
an3.60:7.8	while these days, there are more mendicants, but fewer display superhuman demonstrations of psychic power.’	NA
an3.60:7.9	This is what came up in the conversation among the king’s retinue today, while sitting together in the royal compound.”	NA
an3.60:8.1	“Brahmin, there are three kinds of demonstration.	NA
an3.60:8.2	What three?	NA
an3.60:8.3	A demonstration of psychic power, a demonstration of revealing, and a demonstration of instruction.	NA
an3.60:8.4	And what is the demonstration of psychic power?	NA
an3.60:8.5	It’s when someone wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. They control the body as far as the realm of divinity.	NA
an3.60:8.6	This is called the demonstration of psychic power.	NA
an3.60:9.1	And what is the demonstration of revealing?	NA
an3.60:9.2	In one case, someone reveals by means of a sign:	NA
an3.60:9.3	‘This is what you’re thinking, such is your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’	NA
an3.60:9.4	And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise.	NA
an3.60:10.1	In another case, someone reveals after hearing it from humans or non-humans or deities:	NA
an3.60:10.2	‘This is what you’re thinking, such is your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’	NA
an3.60:10.3	And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise.	NA
an3.60:11.1	In another case, someone reveals by hearing the sound of thought spreading as someone thinks and considers:	NA
an3.60:11.2	‘This is what you’re thinking, such is your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’	NA
an3.60:11.3	And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise.	NA
an3.60:12.1	In another case, someone comprehends the mind of a person who has attained the immersion that’s free of placing the mind and keeping it connected. They understand:	NA
an3.60:12.2	‘Judging by the way this person’s intentions are directed, immediately after this mind state, they’ll think this thought.’	NA
an3.60:12.3	And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise.	NA
an3.60:12.4	This is called the demonstration of revealing.	NA
an3.60:13.1	And what is a demonstration of instruction?	NA
an3.60:13.2	It’s when someone instructs others like this:	NA
an3.60:13.3	‘Think like this, not like that. Focus your mind like this, not like that. Give up this, and live having achieved that.’	NA
an3.60:13.4	This is called a demonstration of instruction.	NA
an3.60:13.5	These are the three kinds of demonstration.	NA
an3.60:13.6	Of these three kinds of demonstration, which do you consider to be the finest?”	NA
an3.60:14.1	“Regarding this, worthy Gotama, a demonstration of psychic power	NA
an3.60:14.2	NA	NA
an3.60:14.3	is experienced only by the one who performs it, occurring only to them.	NA
an3.60:14.4	This seems to me like a magic trick.	NA
an3.60:15.1	And the demonstration where someone reveals something by means of a sign,	NA
an3.60:15.2	NA	NA
an3.60:15.3	or after hearing it from humans, non-humans, or deities,	NA
an3.60:15.4	or by hearing the sound of thought spreading as someone thinks and considers,	NA
an3.60:15.5	or by comprehending the mind of another person,	NA
an3.60:15.6	NA	NA

an3.60:15.8	This also seems to me like a magic trick.	NA

an3.60:16.2	‘Think like this, not like that. Focus your mind like this, not like that. Give up this, and live having achieved that.’	NA
an3.60:16.3	I prefer this demonstration, worthy Gotama. It’s the finest of the three kinds of demonstration.	NA
an3.60:17.1	It’s incredible, worthy Gotama, it’s amazing,	NA
an3.60:17.2	how well this was said by the worthy Gotama. We regard the worthy Gotama as someone who possesses these three kinds of demonstration.	NA
an3.60:17.3	For the worthy Gotama wields the many kinds of psychic power … controlling the body as far as the realm of divinity.	NA
an3.60:17.4	And the worthy Gotama comprehends the mind of another person who has attained the immersion that is free of placing the mind and keeping it connected. He understands:	NA
an3.60:17.5	‘Judging by the way this person’s intentions are directed, immediately after this mind state they’ll think this thought.’	NA
an3.60:17.6	And the worthy Gotama instructs others like this:	NA
an3.60:17.7	‘Think like this, not like that. Focus your mind like this, not like that. Give up this, and live having achieved that.’”	NA
an3.60:18.1	“Your words are clearly invasive and intrusive, brahmin.	NA

an3.63:1.1	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Venāgapura.	NA
an3.63:1.2	The brahmins and householders of Venāgapura heard:	NA
an3.63:1.3	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Venāgapura.	NA
an3.63:1.4	He has this good reputation:	NA
an3.63:1.5	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
an3.63:1.6	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	NA
an3.63:1.7	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA

an3.63:2.1	Then the brahmins and householders of Venāgapura went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Then the brahmin Vacchagotta of Venāgapura said to the Buddha:	NA

an3.63:3.7	or a pendant of Black Plum River gold, fashioned by a deft smith, well-wrought in the forge, and placed on a cream rug where it shines and glows and radiates.	Legend has it that on the slopes of Mount Meru grows the vast Jambu tree that gives the continent of India her name, “the land of the black plum tree”. The fruits of that tree are as big as elephants, and when they fall, their juice flows forth as a river named Jambu. The dried mud of that river yields gold nuggets whose unparalleled lustre is highly sought-after among the gods. This is that gold (Śiva Purāṇa 17.16–19).
an3.63:3.8	In the same way, your faculties are so very clear, and the complexion of your skin is pure and bright.	NA
an3.63:3.9	Surely the worthy Gotama gets when he wants, without trouble or difficulty, various kinds of high and luxurious bedding, such as:	NA
an3.63:3.10	sofas, couches, woolen covers—shag-piled, colorful, white, embroidered with flowers, quilted, embroidered with animals, double-or single-fringed—and silk covers studded with gems, as well as silken sheets, woven carpets, rugs for elephants, horses, or chariots, antelope hide rugs, and spreads of fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red cushions at both ends.”	NA
an3.63:4.1	“Brahmin, these various kinds of high and luxurious bedding	NA
an3.63:4.2	NA	NA
an3.63:4.3	are hard for renunciates to find. And even if they do get them, they’re not allowed.	NA

an3.63:6.3	After the meal, on my return from almsround, I enter within a forest.	NA
an3.63:6.4	I gather up some grass or leaves into a pile and sit down cross-legged, setting my body straight, and establishing mindfulness in my presence.	NA
an3.63:6.5	Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
an3.63:6.6	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, I enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
an3.63:6.7	And with the fading away of rapture, I enter and remain in the third absorption, where I meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA
an3.63:6.8	With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
an3.63:6.9	When I’m practicing like this, if I walk, at that time my walking is heavenly.	See BB’s note here. His reading “in such a state” is neither literal nor necessary, and results in the interpretive difficulties he discusses. The phrase evambhuta only seems to occur once elsewhere in the EBTs, at AN 4.11, where BB has not really translated it. However, there it would seem to refer to a monk “like this … “or” of such a sort …”, and so I translate it here.
an3.63:6.10	When I’m practicing like this, if I stand, at that time my standing is heavenly.	NA

an3.64:0.3	With Sarabha	NA
an3.64:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
an3.64:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.	NA
an3.64:1.3	Now at that time a wanderer called Sarabha had recently left this teaching and training.	NA
an3.64:1.4	He was telling a crowd in Rājagaha,	NA
an3.64:1.5	“I learned the teaching of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan,	NA
an3.64:1.6	then I left their teaching and training.”	NA
an3.64:1.7	Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Rājagaha for alms.	NA
an3.64:1.8	They heard what Sarabha was saying.	NA
an3.64:1.9	NA	NA
an3.64:1.10	NA	NA
an3.64:2.1	Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
an3.64:2.2	“The wanderer called Sarabha has recently left this teaching and training.	NA
an3.64:2.3	He was telling a crowd in Rājagaha:	NA
an3.64:2.4	‘I learned the teaching of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan,	NA
an3.64:2.5	then I left their teaching and training.’	NA
an3.64:2.6	Worthy sir, please go to the wanderers’ monastery on the banks of the Serpentine river to see Sarabha the wanderer out of sympathy.”	NA
an3.64:2.7	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
an3.64:3.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the wanderers’ monastery on the banks of the Serpentine river to visit Sarabha the wanderer. He sat on the seat spread out, and said to the wanderer Sarabha,	NA
an3.64:3.2	“Is it really true, Sarabha, that you’ve been saying:	NA
an3.64:3.3	‘I learned the teaching of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan,	NA
an3.64:3.4	then I left their teaching and training.’”	NA
an3.64:3.5	When he said this, Sarabha kept silent.	NA
an3.64:4.1	For a second time, the Buddha said to Sarabha,	NA
an3.64:4.2	“Tell me, Sarabha, what exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan?	NA
an3.64:4.3	If you’ve not learned it fully, I’ll fill you in.	NA
an3.64:4.4	But if you have learned it fully, I’ll agree.”	NA
an3.64:4.5	For a second time, Sarabha kept silent.	NA
an3.64:5.1	For a third time, the Buddha said to Sarabha,	NA
an3.64:5.2	“Sarabha, the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan are clear to me. What exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan?	NA
an3.64:5.3	If you’ve not learned it fully, I’ll fill you in.	NA
an3.64:5.4	But if you have learned it fully, I’ll agree.”	NA
an3.64:5.5	For a third time, Sarabha kept silent.	NA
an3.64:6.1	Then those wanderers said to Sarabha,	NA
an3.64:6.2	“The ascetic Gotama has offered to tell you anything you ask for.	NA
an3.64:6.3	Speak, reverend Sarabha, what exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan?	NA
an3.64:6.4	If you’ve not learned it fully, he’ll fill you in.	NA
an3.64:6.5	But if you have learned it fully, he’ll agree.”	NA
an3.64:6.6	When this was said, Sarabha sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.	NA
an3.64:7.1	Knowing this, the Buddha said to the wanderers:	NA
an3.64:8.1	“Wanderers, someone might say to me:	NA
an3.64:8.2	‘You claim to be a fully awakened Buddha, but you don’t understand these things.’ Then I’d carefully pursue, press, and grill them on that point.	NA
an3.64:8.3	When grilled by me, they would, without a doubt, fall into one of these three categories. They’d dodge the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points. They’d display annoyance, hate, and bitterness. Or they’d sit silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say, like Sarabha.	NA
an3.64:9.1	Wanderers, someone might say to me:	NA
an3.64:9.2	‘You claim to have ended all defilements, but you still have these defilements.’ Then I’d carefully pursue, press, and grill them on that point.	NA
an3.64:9.3	When grilled by me, they would, without a doubt, fall into one of these three categories. They’d dodge the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points. They’d display annoyance, hate, and bitterness. Or they’d sit silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say, like Sarabha.	NA
an3.64:10.1	Wanderers, someone might say to me:	NA
an3.64:10.2	‘Your teaching does not lead someone who practices it to the complete ending of suffering, the goal for which it is taught.’ Then I’d carefully pursue, press, and grill them on that point.	NA
an3.64:10.3	When grilled by me, they would, without a doubt, fall into one of these three categories. They’d dodge the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points. They’d display annoyance, hate, and bitterness. Or they’d sit silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say, like Sarabha.”	NA
an3.64:10.4	Then the Buddha, having roared his lion’s roar three times in the wanderers’ monastery on the bank of the Serpentine river, rose into the air and flew away.	NA
an3.64:11.1	Soon after the Buddha left, those wanderers beset Sarabha on all sides with sneering and jeering.	NA
an3.64:11.2	“Reverend Sarabha, you’re just like an old jackal in the formidable wilderness who thinks, ‘I’ll roar a lion’s roar!’ but they still only manage to squeal and yelp like a jackal.	NA
an3.64:11.3	In the same way, when the ascetic Gotama wasn’t here you said ‘I’ll roar a lion’s roar!’ but you only managed to squeal and yelp like a jackal.	NA
an3.64:11.4	You’re just like a marsh hen who thinks, ‘I’ll cry like a cuckoo!’ but they still only manage to cry like a marsh hen.	NA
an3.64:11.5	In the same way, when the ascetic Gotama wasn’t here you said ‘I’ll cry like a cuckoo!’ but you still only managed to cry like a marsh hen.	NA
an3.64:11.6	You’re just like a bull that thinks to bellow only when the cowstall is empty.	NA
an3.64:11.7	In the same way, you only thought to bellow when the ascetic Gotama wasn’t here.”	NA
an3.64:11.8	That’s how those wanderers beset Sarabha on all sides with sneering and jeering.	NA
an3.65:0.1	Numbered Discourses 3.65	NA
an3.65:0.2	7. The Great Chapter	NA
an3.65:0.3	With the Kālāmas of Kesamutta	NA
an3.65:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
an3.65:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Kālāmas named Kesamutta.	NA
an3.65:1.3	The Kālāmas of Kesamutta heard:	NA
an3.65:1.4	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Kesamutta.	NA
an3.65:1.5	He has this good reputation:	NA
an3.65:1.6	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha …’	NA
an3.65:1.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	NA
an3.65:2.1	Then the Kālāmas went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Seated to one side the Kālāmas said to the Buddha:	NA
an3.65:3.1	“There are, sir, some ascetics and brahmins who come to Kesamutta.	NA
an3.65:3.2	They explain and promote only their own doctrine, while they attack, badmouth, disparage, and smear the doctrines of others.	NA
an3.65:3.3	Then some other ascetics and brahmins come to Kesamutta.	NA
an3.65:3.4	They too explain and promote only their own doctrine, while they attack, badmouth, disparage, and smear the doctrines of others.	NA
an3.65:3.5	So, sir, we’re doubting and uncertain:	NA
an3.65:3.6	‘I wonder who of these respected ascetics and brahmins speaks the truth, and who speaks falsehood?’”	NA
an3.65:3.7	“It is enough, Kālāmas, for you to be doubting and uncertain.	NA
an3.65:3.8	Doubt has come up in you about an uncertain matter.	NA
an3.65:4.1	Please, Kālāmas, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned train of thought, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after deliberation, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’	NA
an3.65:4.2	But when you know for yourselves:	NA
an3.65:4.3	‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering’, then you should give them up.	NA
an3.65:5.1	What do you think, Kālāmas?	NA
an3.65:5.2	Does greed come up in a person for their welfare or harm?”	NA
an3.65:6.1	“Harm, sir.”	NA
an3.65:7.1	“A greedy individual, overcome by greed, kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”	NA
an3.65:8.1	“Yes, sir.”	NA
an3.65:9.1	“What do you think, Kālāmas?	NA
an3.65:9.2	Does hate come up in a person for their welfare or harm?”	NA
an3.65:10.1	“Harm, sir.”	NA
an3.65:11.1	“A hateful individual, overcome by hate, kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”	NA
an3.65:12.1	“Yes, sir.”	NA
an3.65:13.1	“What do you think, Kālāmas?	NA
an3.65:13.2	Does delusion come up in a person for their welfare or harm?”	NA
an3.65:14.1	“Harm, sir.”	NA
an3.65:15.1	“A deluded individual, overcome by delusion, kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”	NA
an3.65:16.1	“Yes, sir.”	NA
an3.65:17.1	“What do you think, Kālāmas, are these things skillful or unskillful?”	NA
an3.65:18.1	“Unskillful, sir.”	NA
an3.65:19.1	“Blameworthy or blameless?”	NA
an3.65:20.1	“Blameworthy, sir.”	NA
an3.65:21.1	“Criticized or praised by sensible people?”	NA
an3.65:22.1	“Criticized by sensible people, sir.”	NA
an3.65:23.1	“When you undertake them, do they lead to harm and suffering, or not?	NA
an3.65:23.2	Or how do you see this?”	NA
an3.65:24.1	“When you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering.	NA
an3.65:24.2	That’s how we see it.”	NA
an3.65:25.1	“So, Kālāmas, when I said:	NA
an3.65:25.2	‘Please,	NA
an3.65:25.3	don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned train of thought, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after deliberation, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think “The ascetic is our respected teacher.”	NA
an3.65:25.4	But when you know for yourselves:	NA

an3.65:25.6	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA
an3.65:26.1	Please, Kālāmas, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned train of thought, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after deliberation, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’	NA
an3.65:26.2	But when you know for yourselves:	NA
an3.65:26.3	‘These things are skillful, blameless, praised by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness’, then you should acquire them and keep them.	NA
an3.65:27.1	What do you think, Kālāmas?	NA
an3.65:27.2	Does contentment come up in a person for their welfare or harm?”	NA
an3.65:28.1	“Welfare, sir.”	NA
an3.65:29.1	“An individual who is content, not overcome by greed, doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie, or encourage others to do the same. Is that for their lasting welfare and happiness?”	NA
an3.65:30.1	“Yes, sir.”	NA
an3.65:31.1	“What do you think, Kālāmas?	NA
an3.65:31.2	Does love come up in a person for their welfare or harm? …	NA
an3.65:31.3	Does understanding come up in a person for their welfare or harm? …	NA
an3.65:31.4	Is that for their lasting welfare and happiness?”	NA

an3.65:36.1	“Blameless, sir.”	NA
an3.65:37.1	“Criticized or praised by sensible people?”	NA
an3.65:38.1	“Praised by sensible people, sir.”	NA
an3.65:39.1	“When you undertake them, do they lead to welfare and happiness, or not?	NA
an3.65:39.2	Or how do you see this?”	NA
an3.65:40.1	“When you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness.	NA
an3.65:40.2	That’s how we see it.”	NA
an3.65:41.1	“So, Kālāmas, when I said:	NA
an3.65:41.2	‘Please,	NA
an3.65:41.3	don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned train of thought, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after deliberation, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think “The ascetic is our respected teacher.”	NA

an3.65:41.6	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA
an3.65:42.1	Then that noble disciple is rid of desire, rid of ill will, unconfused, aware, and mindful.

an3.66:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Nandaka was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.	NA
an3.66:1.3	Then Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, and Rohaṇa, Pekhuṇiya’s grandson went up to Venerable Nandaka, bowed, and sat down to one side. Then Venerable Nandaka said to Sāḷha:	NA

an3.70:2.1	“There are, Visākhā, these three sabbaths.	Curiously, there is no mention of the Brahmanical _upavasatha_. This was the day of preparation before the Soma feast day, on which the site for the fires was swept and prepared, and the sponsor of the sacrifice and his wife undertook vows of abstinence (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.1.1). The sponsor “dwells close” to the sacred fire (_upa-vas_), to which the gods approach and thus dwell close to him (2.1.4.1, 3.9.2.7).
an3.70:2.2	What three?	NA
an3.70:2.3	The sabbath of the cowherds, the sabbath of the Jains, and the sabbath of the noble ones.	NA
an3.70:2.4	And what is the sabbath of the cowherds?	NA
an3.70:2.5	It’s just like a cowherd who, in the late afternoon, takes the cows back to their owners. They reflect:	NA
an3.70:2.6	‘Today the cows grazed in this spot and that, and they drank in this spot and that.	NA
an3.70:2.7	Tomorrow the cows will graze in this spot and that, and drink in this spot and that.’	NA
an3.70:2.8	In the same way, someone keeping the sabbath reflects:	NA
an3.70:2.9	‘Today I ate this and that, and had a meal of this and that.	NA
an3.70:2.10	Tomorrow I’ll eat this and that, and have a meal of this and that.’	NA
an3.70:2.11	And so they spend their day with a mind full of covetousness.	NA
an3.70:2.12	That’s the sabbath of the cowherds.	NA
an3.70:2.13	When the cowherd’s sabbath is observed like this it’s not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or bountiful.	NA
an3.70:3.1	And what is the sabbath of the Jains?	NA
an3.70:3.2	There’s a kind of ascetic belonging to a group called the Jains.	NA
an3.70:3.3	They encourage their disciples:	Rendered as plural by BB. At SN55.12 the text is also singular, but at AN 10.176 there is a variant in plural. To me the plural reads better in English.
an3.70:3.4	‘Please, good people, don’t hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the east.	NA
an3.70:3.5	Don’t hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the west.	NA
an3.70:3.6	Don’t hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the north.	NA
an3.70:3.7	Don’t hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the south.’	NA
an3.70:3.8	So they encourage kindness and sympathy for some creatures and not others.	NA
an3.70:3.9	On the sabbath, they encourage their disciples:	NA
an3.70:3.10	‘Please, good people, take off all your clothes and say:	NA
an3.70:3.11	“I don’t belong to anyone anywhere! And nothing belongs to me anywhere!”’	This reflection occurs three times in the Pali. At [an4.185:7.2]() it leads to the dimension of nothingness for a brahmin. It leads to the same attainment in a Buddhist context at [mn106:8.2](). Here it is said to be a Jain practice, which they understand as asking people to eliminate attachment by going naked. A similar reflection is found in the Jain Ācārāṅgasūtra: “I am alone, no-one belongs to me, and I do not belong to anyone” (_ego aham aṁsi, na me atthi koi, na yāham avi kassai_, 1.7.6.1). There, as here, the saying is presented as a quoted formula. It is a reflection at the start of the hot season, when a mendicant should cast aside their old robes and go either naked or in one cloth. While male Jain ascetics of the Digambara sect do indeed go naked, this is not a practice enjoined on lay folk in general. It is possible that the practice changed, as the Ācārāṅgasūtra is considerably later than the Pali suttas. Or else, perhaps the passage here is an exaggeration.
an3.70:3.12	But their mother and father still know,	NA
an3.70:3.13	‘This is our child.’	NA
an3.70:3.14	And they know,	NA
an3.70:3.15	‘This is my mother and father.’	NA
an3.70:3.16	Partner and child still know,	NA

an3.70:3.22	And they know,	NA
an3.70:3.23	‘These are my bondservants, workers, and staff.’	NA
an3.70:3.24	So, at a time when they should be encouraged to speak the truth, the Jains encourage them to lie.	NA
an3.70:3.25	This, I say, is lying.	NA
an3.70:3.26	When the night has passed they use their possessions once more, though they’ve not been given back to them.	NA
an3.70:3.27	This, I say, is stealing.	NA
an3.70:3.28	That’s the sabbath of the Jains.	NA
an3.70:3.29	When the Jain’s sabbath is observed like this it’s not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or bountiful.	NA
an3.70:4.1	And what is the sabbath of the noble ones?	Here the Buddhist sabbath is described in terms of meditative and ethical practices. For the Saṅgha, it was also a day of gathering together for a communal recitation, thus adhering to the original sense of “dwelling close”. The meditations taught here focus on the recollections, and at [snp5.19:8.1]() to  recollect the Buddha is said to be like living close to him. Moreover, the undertaking of precepts is also done with the perfected ones in mind. Thus while the practices are individual, they maintain the sense of “dwelling close” in mind.

This famous list of the sixteen _mahājanapadā_ is one of the most important records of the political structure of the Buddha’s India. Of the many spelling variations, the trickiest to sort out is Vaccha. The Mahāsaṅgīti and Buddhajayanthi editions have Vaṅga, but this seems unlikely, as Vaṅga is another country (= Bangla), and it is in the wrong place in the list, which rises with the sun in the east and moves west. The PTS edition has Vaṁsa, a reading that is also found in Sanskrit sources. The preferred term in Sanskrit, however, is Vatsa, which appears to also be the basis for some of the Chinese transliterations of this name.

Kauṭilya mentions a form of gold that is _śṛṅgaśūktija_, “occurring on mount Śūkti” (Arthaśāstra 2.13.3). The commentary to that passage says it had the color of red arsenic, so it was a rose gold. | The same chapter tells us that _kañcana_ (“lustrous gold”) is of high purity which may be alloyed for making jewelery.
an3.70:38.4	or the native gold called ‘coruscant’—	The commentary, deriving _haṭaka_ from “take”, says this is gold extracted by ants. This echoes a fable well-known in the West from Herodotus; it seems the commentaries were listening to the same tales. Perhaps the fable originated with the Himalayan marmot, whose leavings are in fact sifted for gold by locals. Alas, Kautilya also mentions _hāṭaka_ as a form of gold, and the root is rather Sanskrit _haṭ_, “shine”. See also _hāṭaka_ at [thig14.1:17.2]().

an3.80:3.8	“Well then, Ānanda, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
an3.80:3.9	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
an3.80:3.10	The Buddha said this:	NA
an3.80:4.1	“Ānanda, a galaxy extends a thousand times as far as the moon and sun revolve and the shining ones light up the quarters.	https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/on-the-travels-of-the-gods-and-the-sun-and-moon/4086
an3.80:4.2	In that galaxy there are a thousand moons, a thousand suns, a thousand Sinerus king of mountains, a thousand Black Plum Tree Lands, a thousand lands west of Godāvarī, a thousand lands north of Kuru, a thousand lands east of Videha, four thousand oceans, four thousand great kings, a thousand realms of the gods of the four great kings, a thousand realms of the gods of the thirty-three, of the gods of Yama, of the joyful gods, of the gods who love to imagine, of the gods who control what is imagined by others, and a thousand realms of divinity.	Pali texts here read “west of Goyāna” (“cow-cart”), but no Goyāna is found elsewhere. The Sanskrit spelling is _godānīya_, “cow-donation”, i.e. a land abundant in the wealth typified by cows. Now, _godānīya_ is a mere verbal variation of _godāvarī_, the name of the famed river that arises near Nashik, not far from modern Mumbai on the west coast ([snp5.1:2.3]()). Lands further west were reached by ship from that shore, and the river sometimes loaned its name to the place and people of Nashik. I propose we emend to “west of Godāvarī”.

an3.84:1.3	“Sir, each fortnight over a hundred and fifty training rules are recited.	The count of “over a hundred and fifty rules” is found also at [an3.86:1.1](), [an3.87:1.1](), and [an3.88:1.1]()). The Pali _pātimokkha_ has 227 rules, and other Vinayas have similar numbers. Of these, the “Trainings” (_sekhiyas_) are the portion that exhibits by far the most variation between different Vinayas. They deal with matters of etiquette and have no special penalty when broken. The Pali has 75 _sekhiyas_, and if we subtract these from the 227 we are left with 152, thus agreeing with the count in the suttas. It’s likely, then, that these were not included in the earliest recitation. That does not mean, however, that they were a later invention, for many _sekhiyas_ are found elsewhere in the suttas and Vinaya. It is, rather, that they were formalized and added to the recitation at a later date.

an3.101:1.1	“Native gold has coarse corruptions: sand, soil, and gravel.	Often _jātarūpa_ is simply one of the several Pali words for “gold”, but sometimes, as here, it refers to the natural, unworked gold, for which the technical term is “native gold” (see also [an3.70:38.4]()). I believe _jātarūpa_ stems from the common Vedic sense of _rūpa_ as “form” or “manifestation” of the gods. _Jāta_ is what is “born” or what is part of the “natural” order. Thus _jātarūpa_ is the manifestation of the divine form (of the sun) in nature. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.25 says that when a child is born, the father whispers “speech” in his ear, then feeds him butter and honey with a piece of _jātarūpa_. Thus he brings into his child at birth the wisdom of the Vedas and the divine radiance. Compare _jātaveda_, which is the divine knowledge brought to mortals in nature in the form of “fire”.

an3.126:1.3	He went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. The Buddha said to him,	NA
an3.126:2.1	“Go into Kapilavatthu, Mahānāma, and check if there’s a suitable guest house where I can spend the night.”	NA
an3.126:2.2	“Yes, sir,” replied Mahānāma. He returned to Kapilavatthu and searched all over the city, but he couldn’t see a suitable guest house for the Buddha to spend the night.	NA
an3.126:3.1	Then Mahānāma went up to the Buddha, and said to him,	NA
an3.126:3.2	“Sir, there’s no suitable guest house in Kapilavatthu for you to spend the night.	NA
an3.126:3.3	But there is this Bharaṇḍu the Kālāma, who used to be the Buddha’s spiritual companion.	This suggests that they were part of the same spiritual community during the six years before the Buddha’s awakening. The commentary says that he was in fact a student of Āḷāra Kālāma.
an3.126:3.4	Why don’t you spend the night at his hermitage?”	NA
an3.126:3.5	“Go, Mahānāma, and set out a mat.”	NA
an3.126:3.6	“Yes, sir,” replied Mahānāma. He went to Bharaṇḍu’s hermitage, where he set out a mat, and got foot-washing water ready. Then he went back to the Buddha and said to him,	NA

an3.126:5.1	Then, when the night had passed, Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:	NA
an3.126:5.2	“Mahānāma, there are these three teachers found in the world.	NA
an3.126:5.3	What three?	NA
an3.126:5.4	One teacher advocates the complete understanding of sensual pleasures,	These three are treated in detail at [mn13]().

an3.126:6.1	When he said this, Bharaṇḍu said to Mahānāma,	NA
an3.126:6.2	“Say they’re the same, Mahānāma!”	If this is an accurate depiction of Āḷāra Kālāma’s teachings, it suggests that he was a teacher of “oneness” not “diversity”. Presumably, in line with Upaniṣadic philosophy, he saw the differences between them as partial manifestations of the immanent cosmic self (see eg. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.14).

an3.130:1.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him:	NA
an3.130:1.3	“Here’s the thing, Reverend Sāriputta. With clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human, I survey the thousandfold galaxy.	NA
an3.130:1.4	My energy is roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness is established and lucid, my body is tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind is immersed in samādhi and unified.	NA

an3.130:2.1	“Well, Reverend Anuruddha, when you say:	NA
an3.130:2.2	‘With clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human, I survey the thousandfold galaxy,’ that’s your conceit.	NA
an3.130:2.3	And when you say:	NA

an3.130:2.7	It would be good to give up these three things. Ignore them and apply your mind to freedom from death.”	NA
an3.130:3.1	After some time Anuruddha gave up these three things. Ignoring them, he applied his mind to freedom from death.	NA
an3.130:3.2	Then Anuruddha, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA

an3.131:1.1	“Mendicants, three things are conveyed under cover, not in the open.	Pretty sure BB is wrong to translate āvahanti as “flourish” here. The basic meaning is to “bring” or “convery”, as in traded goods and the like. That meaning works well for mantras and wrong views, better than “flourish”. As for “females”, “conveys” perhaps means that women normally travel discreetly. Unlike “flourish”, “convey” is a neutral term avoids implying that this is good for them. But I suspect there’s something else going on. Avahana is the normal word for “marriage”, and I wonder if there isn’t a pun intended. Perhaps: “Women are married with veils, not unveiled”?

SUTTA=statement: Normally all of these fall within the suttas, so clearly sutta here has a narrower meaning. In Indic use generally it means “short doctrinal statement, epitome”, and that use is found in Buddhism too, eg the patimokkha is called the sutta. GEYYA=song: The comm explains as mixed prose and vers, hence BB’s trans. May well be correct, but the word can only mean “song”. VEYYAKARANA: the normal meaning of vyakarana is “answer”, and discourses in Q&A format are very common, in fact almost everything longer than a basic “statement” is in this form. BB’s “exposition” is misleading, as an exposition is essentially a long monologue, which is quite rare, and in any case it’s not what vyakarana means. GATHA: Thera-Theri, etc UDANA: possibly includes Dhammapada ITIVUTTAKA: BB has “quotation”, which is literal. But i suspect it actually means “legend”, i.e tales of the past, “so it was said…”. cf. itihāsa JATAKA and ABBHUTADHAMMA are uncontroversial. VEDALLA: BB has Q&A, but there are only a couple of explicit Vedallas, and lots of Q&As. Anyway, vyakarana literally means answer, while vedalla means “vi-dala”, to split apart, i.e to analyse.

an4.14:4.2	It’s when a mendicant preserves a meditation subject that’s a fine basis of immersion: the perception of a skeleton, a worm-infested corpse, a livid corpse, a split open corpse, or a bloated corpse.	BB’s “object of concentration” is wrong. A) samadhi isn’t concentration B) nimitta isn’t object C) samadhinimitta is elsewhere defined as satipatthana, and since the corpse meditations are part of satipatthana, it must have the same meaning here. Satipatthana is normally the seventh factor of the 8fold path, leading to the 8th factor, samadhi. A normal, in fact very common, meaning of nimitta is “cause, ground, basis”, a meaning that stems from “precursor” as in “dawn is the precursor of the sunrise”. That’s obviously the meaning here: the samadhinimitta is that which is the precursor or basis for samadhi, i.e. it’s the meditation (satipatthana) that you do to get into _jhāna_.

an4.21:0.3	At Uruvelā (1st)	NA
an4.21:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
an4.21:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
an4.21:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
an4.21:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
an4.21:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
an4.21:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
an4.21:2.1	“Mendicants, this one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying in Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.	NA
an4.21:2.2	As I was in private retreat this thought came to mind:	The term rahogata is rendered by BB as “alone “, but it doesn’t quite mean that. In the Vinaya, one may be “rahogata” with a member of the opposite sex, where it is” private to the eye and ear”.
an4.21:2.3	‘One without respect and reverence lives in suffering.	NA
an4.21:2.4	What ascetic or brahmin should I honor and respect and rely on?’	BB has the more literal “live in dependence on”. the term is more normally used for the town that an ascetic lives near. Like many upa-words, it conveys something of “closeness”, a certain warmth. As an accomplished, mature man, to say that he would live “as a dependent” is too strong. What’s conveyed is more of a sense of mentorship, someone who you can turn to when you need, not someone you necessarily “depend” on in the narrow sense.
an4.21:3.1	Then it occurred to me:	NA
an4.21:3.2	‘I would honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of ethics, if it were incomplete.	NA
an4.21:3.3	But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in ethics, who I should honor and respect and rely on.	NA

an4.21:8.6	May the Blessed One, who is the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present, also honor and respect and rely on this same teaching.’	NA
an4.21:8.7	That’s what the divinity Sahampati said.	NA
an4.21:8.8	Then he went on to say:	NA
an4.21:9.1	‘All Buddhas, whether in the past,	NA
an4.21:9.2	the Buddhas of the future,	NA

an4.22:1.1	“Mendicants, this one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying in Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.	NA
an4.22:1.2	Then several old brahmins—elderly and senior, who were advanced in years and had reached the final stage of life—came up to me, and exchanged greetings with me.	NA
an4.22:1.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side, and said to me:	NA
an4.22:1.4	‘Worthy Gotama, , we have heard this:	NA
an4.22:1.5	“The ascetic Gotama does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat.”	NA
an4.22:1.6	And this is indeed the case,	NA
an4.22:1.7	for the worthy Gotama does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat.	NA
an4.22:1.8	This is not appropriate, worthy Gotama.’	NA
an4.22:2.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
an4.22:2.2	‘These venerables don’t know what a senior is, or what qualities make you a senior.’	NA
an4.22:2.3	Mendicants, suppose you’re eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old.	NA
an4.22:2.4	But your speech is untimely, false, meaningless, and against the teaching or training. You say things at the wrong time which are worthless, unreasonable, rambling, and unbeneficial.	NA
an4.22:2.5	Then you’ll be considered a ‘childish senior’.	NA
an4.22:3.1	Now suppose you’re a youth, young, with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life.	NA
an4.22:3.2	But your speech is timely, true, meaningful, and in line with the teaching and training. You say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.	NA
an4.22:3.3	Then you’ll be considered an ‘astute senior’.	NA
an4.22:4.1	There are these four qualities that make a senior.	NA
an4.22:4.2	What four?	NA
an4.22:4.3	A mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.	NA
an4.22:4.4	They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, rehearsing them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.	BB’s “recited verbally” for vacasa paricita, apart from being tautologous, misses the point. paricita is regularly used in the sense of “build up, reinforce, consolidate”, and the point here is that by regular practice the texts are consolidated in the mind.
an4.22:4.5	They get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in this life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.	NA
an4.22:4.6	They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.	NA
an4.22:4.7	These are the four qualities that make a senior.	NA
an4.22:5.1	The creature with a restless mind	NA
an4.22:5.2	speaks a lot of nonsense.	NA
an4.22:5.3	Their thoughts are unsettled,	NA
an4.22:5.4	and they don’t like the true teaching.	NA
an4.22:5.5	They’re far from seniority, with their bad views	NA
an4.22:5.6	and their lack of regard for others.	NA
an4.22:6.1	But one accomplished in ethics,	NA
an4.22:6.2	learned and eloquent, that wise one	NA
an4.22:6.3	is restrained when experiencing phenomena,	This line is difficult, and I have rendered according to my main text rather than the Sinhala as with BB. Note that the Sinhala reading used by BB is a combination of the BJ and S readings here. I find BB’s rendering incomprehensible both in Pali and English. If “thiradhamma” refers to samadhi—which so far as I can tell it does nowhere else—then this is not really conveyed by “factors of firmness”. And how is one “restrained” in these? As BB points out, the line falls between sila and wisdom, and so should refer to samadhi in some way. I’ve taken my cue from saññata, which normally refers to sense restraint or similar, and this gives us a meaningful role for “dhammesu”; i.e., among distracting phenomena that you experience'. This also falls in the right place in the gradual training.

an4.24:1.4	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
an4.24:1.5	The Buddha said this:	NA

an4.24:3.2	That has been known by a Realized One, but a Realized One is not subject to it.	NA
an4.24:4.1	If I were to say that ‘I do not know … the world with its gods’, I would be lying.	NA

an4.24:6.1	If I were to say that ‘I neither know nor do not know … the world with its gods’, that would be my fault.	NA
an4.24:7.1	So a Realized One sees what is to be seen, but does not conceive what is seen, does not conceive what is unseen, does not conceive what is to be seen, and does not conceive a seer.	NA
an4.24:7.2	He hears what is to be heard, but does not conceive what is heard, does not conceive what is unheard, does not conceive what is to be heard, and does not conceive a hearer.	NA

an4.38:1.3	Different ascetics and brahmins have different idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth. For example:	NA
an4.38:1.4	the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a realized one still exists, or no longer exists, or both still exists and no longer exists, or neither still exists nor no longer exists.	For tam jivan tam sariram, BB has “the same”. I used to have “identical”. However, one two things may be identical but not the same thing, eg. copies of a book. The point of this idiom is not that “the soul and the body are identical kinds of things” but that they are literally the same thing.

an4.41:2.1	And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in this life?	NA
an4.41:2.2	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.	NA
an4.41:2.3	This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in this life.	NA
an4.41:3.1	And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision?	NA
an4.41:3.2	It’s when a mendicant applies their mind to the perception of light, focusing on the perception of day:	NA
an4.41:3.3	as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.	NA
an4.41:3.4	And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance.	NA
an4.41:3.5	This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision.	NA
an4.41:4.1	And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness?	NA
an4.41:4.2	It’s when a mendicant knows feelings as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away.	NA
an4.41:4.3	They know perceptions as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. They know thoughts as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away.	NA

an4.51:1.2	“Mendicants, there are these four kinds of overflowing merit, overflowing goodness. They nurture happiness and are conducive to heaven, ripening in happiness and leading to heaven. They lead to what is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness.	Abhisanda is a curiously obscure term, only found in this context. BB has “stream”, which doesn’t seem to quite hit the mark. When used in Skt it doesn’t mean a stream generally, but an “overflow”, typically used for conjunctivitis. Kalidasa uses it twice (Raghuvamsa 15.29, Kumarasambhava 6.37) in the sense of a population that has been multiplied by the overflow from heaven (https://sanskritdocuments.org/sites/giirvaani/giirvaani/rv/sargas/15_rv.htm) The point is that when you offer something, you get merit, and when the mendicant uses it well, your merit multiplies. A derived passage is found in Mahavastu, 2.276: yo yaṁ mama deyadharmaparityāgāt puṇyābhisyandaḥ kuśalābhisyandaḥ sukhasyādhāraṇaṁ me divyaṁ upabhogaṁ bhaveyā… Notice that this reads “bearers of happiness” rather than “food for happiness.”

I retain the difference, since it seems to be systematic.
an4.51:6.1	It’s like trying to grasp how much water is in the ocean. It’s not easy to say how many gallons, how many hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of gallons there are. It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water.	NA

His use of “nature” follows the comm “sabhāva”, which is the gloss for santa. But the idea of an essential “own nature” is alien to the suttas, and I think it is the opposite of what’s intended. It’s not that they somehow “are” like this, it’s that when they act out these “dhammas” (correctly, I think, identified in the comms as “lust and so on” ) they become the person that they’ve created.

an4.70:1.1	“At a time when kings are unprincipled, royal officials become unprincipled.	NA
an4.70:1.2	When royal officials are unprincipled, brahmins and householders become unprincipled.	_Brāhmaṇagahapatikā_ means “brahmins and householders” rather than “brahmin householders”. It is a term for the “landed gentry”. A householder is a landowner, not just a lay person. Thus here they come between the royal officials and the general populace.
an4.70:1.3	When brahmins and householders are unprincipled, the people of town and country become unprincipled.	Here, “brahmins and householders” and “people of town and country” are separate groups of people. At [dn5:12.1](), however, the phrase “of both town and country” qualifies each group. Elsewhere the context does not always decide between these two possibilities. Generally the idiom aims at inclusivity, as opposed to DN 5 where the king is consulting the rich and powerful, so I treat them as two separate groups, thus including the common folk.
an4.70:1.4	When the people of town and country are unprincipled, the courses of the moon and sun become erratic.	NA

an4.106:1.1	(This is a ghost sutta: there is no text for it in any available editions.)	The summary verse at the end of  the chapter (AN 4.110) mentions “two on mangoes”. The commentary notes the existence of a discourse here, but merely says that its meaning is clear. A note in the VRI edition says that there is a reading that has _obhāsa_ where the previous sutta has _vaṇṇa_.

an4.111:1.1	Then Kesi the horse trainer went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	NA
an4.111:1.2	“Kesi, you’re known as a horse trainer.	NA
an4.111:1.3	Just how do you guide a horse in training?”	NA
an4.111:1.4	“Sir, I guide a horse in training sometimes gently, sometimes harshly, and sometimes both gently and harshly.”	NA
an4.111:1.5	“Kesi, what do you do with a horse in training that doesn’t follow these forms of training?”	Notice how BB’s tranl. first uses “discipline” (which implies punishment), then “submit” for upeti. The combination implies a forcefulness that’s absent in the Pali. Vinaya doesn’t imply punishment, so “guidance” is better; and upeti means more to “fit in, go along with, comply” rather than submit, which again implies force. The inappropriateness of this implication is heightened here, because of course some forms of guidance are specifically said to be “gentle”.

an4.111:2.2	Just how do you guide a person in training?”	NA
an4.111:2.3	“Kesi, I guide a person in training sometimes gently, sometimes harshly, and sometimes both gently and harshly.	NA
an4.111:2.4	The gentle way is this:	NA
an4.111:2.5	‘This is good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. This is the result of good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. This is life as a god. This is life as a human.’	NA
an4.111:2.6	The harsh way is this:	NA
an4.111:2.7	‘This is bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. This is the result of bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. This is life in hell. This is life as an animal. This is life as a ghost.’	NA
an4.111:3.1	The both gentle and harsh way is this:	NA

an4.111:4.2	“In that case, Kesi, I kill them.”	NA
an4.111:4.3	“Sir, it’s not appropriate for the Buddha to kill living creatures.	kappati in this sense is not common in the suttas. Compare SN 42.10. I’m not convinced that BB’s “allowable” is appropriate outside of a Vinaya context: who tells the Buddha what he’s “allowed” to do?

an4.117:1.1	“Mendicants, in your own way you should practice diligence, mindfulness, and guarding of the mind in four situations.	Attarūpa is not obvious. Literally it would be “like oneself, ones’ own type”. BB follows the comm, but note that he follows the comms secondary expln, “by one who desires his own benefit”, which the comm itself says is the “meaning”, i.e. the interpretation rather than the gloss. The term appears in, so far as I know, three cases in the suttas. At SN 35.117 it appears in precisely the same context as here, except the Buddha applies it to himself and the monks. In DN 27, however, it is used in a different context, transl. by RD as “characteristic”, as in “the abuse characteristic of the brahmins”, which I think is correct. In this case “for your own benefit” cannot be right. So here the comm omits this interpretation and merely gives the primary gloss: attano anurūpāya “conforming to one’s own nature”. What I think it means is that there are characteristic or individual ways of doing things, and we have to practice in accord with that. That’s what the Buddha is teaching the monks at SN 35.117: they have to find what works for them. Lit. the sentence would be: “By one who conforms with their own nature, diligence, mindfulness, and guarding of the mind are to be practiced …” See too attakāmarūpa

an4.127:1.1	“Mendicants, with the appearance of a Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, four incredible and amazing things appear.	A  similar teaching is found in the Jain Ṭhāṇaṅga 4.324, which says a great radiance manifests on four occasions: when arahants-to-be are born, when they go forth, when they attain enlightenment, and when they pass away.
an4.127:1.2	What four?	NA
an4.127:1.3	When the being intent on awakening passes away from the host of joyful gods, he’s conceived in his mother’s womb, mindful and aware. And then—in this world with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—an immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the gods.	Bodhisatta means either “awakening-being” or, more likely “one intent on awakening”. Whatever it means, it certainly doesn’t mean what the Buddhist traditions later took it to mean, so any translation is better than keeping the Pali.
an4.127:1.4	Even in the boundless void of interstellar space—so utterly dark that even the light of the moon and the sun, so mighty and powerful, makes no impression—an immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the gods.	See https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/the-boundless-desolation-of-interstellar-space/2248 Ābhā nanubhonti is glossed in MN 79 as obhāsaṁ na vaḷañjanti. This is a difficult term, but acc. to PTS dict means “leave a mark”. In AN 4.127 the same phrase is glossed pabhā nappahonti, i.e. “light is ineffective”. Neither gloss supports “matches” or “reaches”.

an4.157:2.1	There are four kinds of illness for those gone forth.	NA
an4.157:2.2	What four?	NA
an4.157:2.3	To start with, a mendicant has many wishes, is frustrated, and is not content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	NA
an4.157:2.4	Because of this, they focus their corrupt wishes on status, and on getting material things, honor, and popularity.	NA
an4.157:2.5	They try hard, strive, and make an effort to get these things.	NA
an4.157:2.6	They have an ulterior motive when they visit families. They have an ulterior motive when they sit down, when they speak on Dhamma, and even when they hold it in when they need to go to the toilet.	NA
an4.157:2.7	These are the four kinds of illness for those gone forth.	NA
an4.157:3.1	So you should train like this:	NA
an4.157:3.2	‘We will not have many wishes or be frustrated. We will be content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. We won’t focus our corrupt wishes on status, and on getting material things, honor, and popularity. We won’t try hard, strive, and make an effort to get these things. We will endure cold, heat, hunger, and thirst. We will endure the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. We will endure rude and unwelcome criticism.

an4.159:1.5	‘Sir, the nun named so-and-so is sick, suffering, and gravely ill.	NA

an4.159:3.3	She wrapped herself up from head to foot and laid down on her cot.	NA
an4.159:3.4	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to her, and sat down on the seat spread out. Then Ānanda said to the nun:	NA

an4.159:5.5	‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice.

an4.160:5.2	This is the second thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching.	NA
an4.160:6.1	Furthermore, the mendicants who are very learned—inheritors of the heritage, who have memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the outlines—don’t carefully make others recite the discourses.	Here 'Vinaya' clearly refers to the texts on monastic law.
an4.160:6.2	When they pass away, the discourses are cut off at the root, with no-one to preserve them.	NA
an4.160:6.3	This is the third thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching.	NA
an4.160:7.1	Furthermore, the senior mendicants are indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, not rousing energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.	NA

an4.160:8.3	Firstly, the mendicants memorize discourses that have been learned correctly, with well placed words and phrases.	NA
an4.160:8.4	When the words and phrases are well placed, the meaning is interpreted correctly.	NA
an4.160:8.5	This is the first thing that leads to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching.	NA
an4.160:9.1	Furthermore, the mendicants are easy to admonish, having qualities that make them easy to admonish. They’re patient, and take instruction respectfully.	NA
an4.160:9.2	This is the second thing that leads to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching.	NA
an4.160:10.1	Furthermore, the mendicants who are very learned—inheritors of the heritage, who have memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the outlines—carefully make others recite the discourses.	NA
an4.160:10.2	When they pass away, the discourses aren’t cut off at the root, and they have someone to preserve them.	NA
an4.160:10.3	This is the third thing that leads to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching.	NA
an4.160:11.1	Furthermore, the senior mendicants are not indulgent or slack, nor are they backsliders; instead, they take the lead in seclusion, rousing energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.	NA
an4.160:11.2	Those who come after them follow their example.	NA

an4.163:2.8	Because of this, they only slowly attain the conditions for ending the defilements in the present life.	See BB’s note. He interprets anantara following the Abhidhamma idea of “instant enlightenment”, which does not exist in the suttas. I interpret this and similar phrases as essentially synonyms of akalika, sanditthika, and ditthevadhamme: in this very life. The “interval” here is not the interval between path and fruit—another inappropriate Abhidhamma concept—but between one life and the next (bhavantara).

an4.180:0.3	The Four Great References	NA
an4.180:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Bhoga City, at the Ānanda Tree-shrine.	NA
an4.180:1.2	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
an4.180:1.3	“Mendicants!”	NA
an4.180:1.4	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
an4.180:1.5	The Buddha said this:	NA
an4.180:1.6	“Mendicants, I will teach you the four great references.	“Great references” is _mahāpadesa_; also at [dn16.4.7.3](). A different set of four _mahāpadesas_ are [pli-tv-kd6:40.1.1](), which provide criteria so that mendicants may judge what is and is not allowable.
an4.180:1.7	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
an4.180:1.8	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
an4.180:1.9	The Buddha said this:	NA
an4.180:2.1	“Mendicants, what are the four great references?	NA
an4.180:2.2	Take a mendicant who says:	NA
an4.180:2.3	‘Reverend, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:	The standard phrase used in the suttas when reporting a teaching heard directly from the Buddha, eg. [sn55.52:5.1](), [sn22.90:9.1](), [mn47:10.7](), etc.
an4.180:2.4	this is the teaching, this is the training, this is the Teacher’s instruction.’	_Dhamma_, _vinaya, and _satthusāsana_ are used in the suttas in the general sense of the entirety of the Buddha’s teachings. In his advice to Mahāpajāpatī ([an8.53]()) and Upāli ([an7.83]()), they are said to be whatever conforms with letting go. A stream-enterer who is a lay person is grounded in them ([an6.16:7.2]()). They are more frequent in the Vinaya, being used as a general qualifier of a legitimate legal procedure ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc63:2.1.8]()). Due to this fact, the fact that there are three items, and the fact that _dhamma_ and _sutta_ are different words, we should not take _dhamma_ and _vinaya_ here as equivalent to _sutta_ and _vinaya_ below. Rather, they are a general claim to authenticity and do not specify particular texts.
an4.180:2.5	You should neither approve nor dismiss that mendicant’s statement.	As at [mn112:3.1]() and [dn29:18.4]().
an4.180:2.6	Instead, having carefully memorized those words and phrases, you should make sure they fit in the discourse and are exhibited in the training.	It is tempting to assume that _sutta_ here means the Suttapiṭaka and _vinaya_ means the Vinayapiṭaka, or at least an earlier version of these texts; but this is not supported by tradition. The late canonical Netti explains _sutta_ as “the four noble truths” and _vinaya_ as “the removal of greed, hate, and delusion” ([ne6]()). The commentaries discuss many interpretations; ultimately they agree with the Netti for _vinaya_, but say _sutta_ means the entire Tipiṭaka. I think the Netti is correct: teachings should “fit in” with the four noble truths (like other footprints fit in to an elephant’s footprint, [mn28]()), and they should “be evident” in that the results of practice should be apparent (_sandiṭṭhika_). “Memorize” (_uggahetvā_), because in an oral tradition a text is not learned until it is known by heart; such claims must be taken seriously. For _osāreti_ read _otāreti_ per [an4.180]().
an4.180:2.7	If they do not fit in the discourse and are not exhibited in the training, you should draw the conclusion:	NA
an4.180:2.8	‘Clearly this is not the word of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
an4.180:2.9	It has been incorrectly memorized by that mendicant.’	NA
an4.180:2.10	And so you should reject it.	NA
an4.180:3.1	Take another mendicant who says:	NA
an4.180:3.2	‘Reverend, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:	NA
an4.180:3.3	this is the teaching, this is the training, this is the Teacher’s instruction.’	NA
an4.180:3.4	You should neither approve nor dismiss that mendicant’s statement.	NA
an4.180:3.5	Instead, having carefully memorized those words and phrases, you should make sure they fit in the discourse and are exhibited in the training.	NA

an4.180:3.7	‘Clearly this is the word of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
an4.180:3.8	It has been correctly memorized by that mendicant.’	NA
an4.180:3.9	You should remember it. This is the first great reference.	The Pali text appears to say that one should remember the _mahāpadesa_, whereas the Sanskrit clearly says one should remember the passage (_ayaṁ dharmo’yaṁ vinaya idaṁ śāstuḥ śāsanam iti viditvā dhārayitavyāḥ_). It seems as if this pattern should underlie the Pali too, for the passage is false, one “should reject it” (_chaḍḍeyyātha_). If the passage is correct we should expect a parallel injunction that one “should remember it” (_dhāreyyātha_). But if this applies to the _mahāpadesa_ there is no such injunction. Thus it seems as if the Sanskrit is correct here and the Pali corrupt. I restore it by reversing the order of the phrases.

an4.185:1.1	Once the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.	NA
an4.185:1.2	Now at that time several very well-known wanderers were residing in the monastery of the wanderers on the bank of the Serpentine river. They included Annabhāra, Varadhara, Sakuludāyī, and other very well-known wanderers.	NA
an4.185:1.3	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the wanderer’s monastery on the bank of the Serpentine river.	NA
an4.185:2.1	Now at that time this discussion came up while those wanderers of other religions were sitting together,	NA
an4.185:2.2	“The truths of the brahmins are like this; the truths of the brahmins are like that.”	NA
an4.185:2.3	Then the Buddha went up to those wanderers, sat down on the seat spread out, and said to them,	NA
an4.185:3.1	“Wanderers, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	NA
an4.185:3.2	“Well, worthy Gotama, this discussion came up among us while we were sitting together:	NA

an4.185:4.3	Take a brahmin who says:	NA

an4.185:4.5	Saying this, a brahmin speaks the truth, not lies.	NA
an4.185:4.6	But they don’t think of themselves as an ‘ascetic’ or ‘brahmin’ because of that. Nor do they think ‘I’m better’ or ‘I’m equal’ or ‘I’m worse’.	NA

an4.185:6.2	‘All states of existence are impermanent, suffering, and perishable.’ … They simply practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding future lives, having had insight into the truth of that.	NA
an4.185:7.1	Take another brahmin who says:	NA
an4.185:7.2	‘I don’t belong to anyone anywhere. And nothing belongs to me anywhere.’	This reflection occurs three times in the Pali. Here it leads to the dimension of nothingness for a brahmin. It leads to the same attainment in a Buddhist context at [mn106:8.2](). At [an3.70:3.11]() it is said to be a Jain practice, which they understand as asking people to eliminate attachment by going naked.
an4.185:7.3	Saying this, a brahmin speaks the truth, not lies.	NA

an4.187:4.2	‘This King Eḷeyya is a fool to be so devoted to the ascetic Rāmaputta. He even shows him the utmost deference by bowing down to him, rising up for him, greeting him with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for him.	King Eḷeyya appears to be unknown elsewhere. (From Sanskrit Ila? https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/ila | The ascetic Rāmaputta is probably Uddaka son of Rāma, under whom the Bodhisatta practiced before awakening ([mn26:16.1]()). As to why his assembly disliked Rāmaputta, it may be because he was a contemplative who embraced the renunciate and philosophical path rather than reliance on ritual, which provided brahmins with their income. In coming to his defense, Todeyya represents the forward-looking brahmins of Kosala who, like his peer Pokkharasāti, were more open to such ideas.
an4.187:4.3	And these king’s men are fools too—	NA
an4.187:4.4	Yamaka, Moggalla, Ugga, Nāvindakī, Gandhabba, and Aggivessa—for they show the same kind of deference to Rāmaputta.’	NA

an4.188:3.3	‘This is another way of saying that this is unskillful.’	BB here has “for such and such reasons”. In the parallel passage at SN56.19 he had: “In this statement,”. I can’t see that either rendering is justified. It seems to me that here the construction itipi has a literal meaning “thus also …”, i.e. “this is another way of explaining that this is akusala.” It simply expands the previous phrase.

an4.191:1.1	“Mendicants, you can expect four benefits when the teachings have been followed by ear, rehearsed, examined by the mind, and well comprehended theoretically.	See BB’s note on variants here. Note that our text gives the BJ reading as sotānudhana, whereas BB says Ce reads sotānudhata. Also note that, in addition to the sources cited by BB, the Tika and Pe both support anugata. Anudhata in fact doesn’t appear to occur anywhere.
an4.191:1.2	What four?	NA
an4.191:1.3	Take a mendicant who memorizes the teaching—	NA
an4.191:1.4	statements, mixed prose & verse, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and elaborations.	NA
an4.191:1.5	They’ve followed those teachings by ear, rehearsed them, examined them by the mind, and well comprehended them theoretically.	NA
an4.191:1.6	But they die unmindful and are reborn in one of the orders of gods.	NA
an4.191:1.7	Being happy there, passages of the teaching come back to them.	This is a curious and interesting phrase, see BB’s note. Here I have gone with the comms, though note that I don’t have Norman’s arguments with me. BB’s reading relies on a extremely rare grammatical form (neuter accusative plural in ā), and it just doesn’t read as well to me. I’m also not aware of any passage where the devas are sukhino. The comm interpretation is that the teachings are forgotten in the in-between state (!) and then “float back like shadows in a clear mirror”.

an4.196:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	NA
an4.196:1.2	Then Sāḷha and Abhaya the Licchavis went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	NA
an4.196:2.1	“There are, sir, some ascetics and brahmins who advocate crossing the flood by means of two things:	NA
an4.196:2.2	purification of ethics, and mortification in disgust of sin.	See BB’s note both here and at SN 2.30. Tapojiguccha is an idiom that refers to the various kinds of self-torture (see DN 25). Since both here and there it is taken as a single thing, i doubt if it should be resolved as a dvanda, although that’s by no means impossible. The key is the comm gloss “papajiguccha”. But this has to be understood in terms of the primitive idea of papa, as held by the Jains and others, not the ethical/psychological Buddhist notion. In primitive thought evil was a substance or entity that existed in the world in a quasi-physical sense. In the Jatakas it talks of washing evil off oneself, literally. The Greeks had the same notion: evil literally inhered in the “blood on the hands”. At MN 12 the bodhisatta’s practice of “jeguccha” is separated from tapo, and it means being careful not to tread on any insect, i.e. the Jain idea that even unintentional acts create “papa” which will cause suffering. So yes, it means “horror of evil”, but not horror of intentional evil in the Buddhist sense. The term sin, while strongly bound to its Abrahamin roots, is perhaps the only term in English that conveys something of this primitive, physical sense of evil.

an4.196:3.1	“Sāḷha, purification of ethics is one of the factors of the ascetic life, I say.	NA

Evidently he’s following the comm for SN 22.95, where it refers to a banana tree. But I don’t even know what structure “fruit-bud core” refers to. There are multiple readings in the various contexts, but given that it follows ujum navam, I think it’s safe to assume that it’s meant to be the same word. I think it’s also safe to assume it doesn’t refer to any specific botanical structure, as these are very different trees. Most likely the term is a pseudo-synonym of uju and nava, and this fits the etymology of akukkucca, “not-ill-made”.

an4.198:1.1	“Mendicants, these four people are found in the world.	NA
an4.198:1.2	What four?	NA
an4.198:1.3	One person mortifies themselves, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves.	NA
an4.198:1.4	One person mortifies others, pursuing the practice of mortifying others.	NA
an4.198:1.5	One person mortifies themselves and others, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves and others.	NA
an4.198:1.6	One person neither mortifies themselves nor others, pursuing the practice of not mortifying themselves or others.	NA
an4.198:1.7	They live without wishes in this very life, quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine.	NA
an4.198:2.1	And how does one person mortify themselves, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves?	NA
an4.198:2.2	It’s when someone goes naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on their behalf, or an invitation for a meal.	NA
an4.198:2.3	They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who lives with a man; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or beer or wine, and drink no fermented gruel.	NA
an4.198:2.4	They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls.	NA
an4.198:2.5	They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day.	NA
an4.198:2.6	They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live pursuing the practice of eating food at set intervals.	NA
an4.198:3.1	They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.	NA
an4.198:4.1	They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings.	NA
an4.198:4.2	They tear out hair and beard, pursuing this practice.	NA
an4.198:4.3	They constantly stand, refusing seats.	NA
an4.198:4.4	They squat, committed to the endeavor of squatting.	NA
an4.198:4.5	They lie on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns their bed.	NA
an4.198:4.6	They’re devoted to ritual bathing three times a day, including the evening.	NA
an4.198:4.7	And so they live pursuing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body.	NA
an4.198:4.8	That’s how one person mortifies themselves, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves.	NA
an4.198:5.1	And how does one person mortify others, pursuing the practice of mortifying others?	NA
an4.198:5.2	It’s when a person is a slaughterer of sheep, pigs, poultry, or deer, a hunter or fisher, a bandit, an executioner, a butcher of cattle, a jailer, or has some other cruel livelihood.	NA
an4.198:5.3	That’s how one person mortifies others, pursuing the practice of mortifying others.	NA
an4.198:6.1	And how does one person mortify themselves and others, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves and others?	NA
an4.198:6.2	It’s when a person is an anointed aristocratic king or a well-to-do brahmin.	NA
an4.198:6.3	He has a new ceremonial hall built to the east of the citadel. He shaves off his hair and beard, dresses in a rough antelope hide, and smears his body with ghee and oil. Scratching his back with antlers, he enters the hall with his chief queen and the brahmin high priest.	NA
an4.198:6.4	There he lies on the bare ground strewn with grass.	NA
an4.198:6.5	The king feeds on the milk from one teat of a cow that has a calf of the same color. The chief queen feeds on the milk from the second teat. The brahmin high priest feeds on the milk from the third teat. The milk from the fourth teat is served to the sacred flame. The calf feeds on the remainder.	NA
an4.198:6.6	He says:	NA
an4.198:6.7	‘Slaughter this many bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, rams, and horses for the sacrifice! Fell this many trees and reap this much grass for the sacrificial equipment!’	NA
an4.198:6.8	His bondservants, servants, and workers do their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping, with tearful faces.	NA
an4.198:6.9	That’s how one person mortifies themselves and others, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves and others.	NA
an4.198:7.1	And how does one person neither mortify themselves nor others, pursuing the practice of not mortifying themselves or others,	NA
an4.198:7.2	living without wishes in this very life, quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine?	NA
an4.198:7.3	It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.	NA
an4.198:7.4	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	NA
an4.198:7.5	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
an4.198:7.6	A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in a good family.	NA
an4.198:7.7	They gain faith in the Realized One	NA
an4.198:7.8	and reflect:	NA
an4.198:7.9	‘Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide open.	For rajapatha, see MN 5, where it means a dirty, dusty place inside a house, an attic or similar.
an4.198:7.10	It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	NA
an4.198:7.11	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	NA
an4.198:7.12	After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
an4.198:8.1	Once they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings.	NA
an4.198:8.2	They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving.	NA
an4.198:8.3	They give up unchastity. They are chaste, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex.	Note the apparently unique reading virato asaddhammā gāmadhammā, as opposed to the standard virato methunā gāmadhammā. No variant is recorded here, and none in PTS, which has the standard reading only. At https://suttacentral.net/pi/mnd7 asadhamma is a gloss on methuna, so presumably this reading has slipped in from a commentary.
an4.198:8.4	They give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and dependable, and don’t trick the world with their words.	NA
an4.198:8.5	They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.	NA
an4.198:8.6	They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable, and agreeable to the people.	NA
an4.198:8.7	They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.	NA

an4.198:10.3	In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.	NA

an4.198:11.2	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving restraint over it.	NA

an4.198:11.9	When they have this noble sense restraint, they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves.	NA
an4.198:12.1	They act with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.	NA
an4.198:13.1	When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, this noble contentment, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness,	NA
an4.198:13.2	they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.	NA
an4.198:13.3	After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in their presence.	NA
an4.198:13.4	Giving up covetousness for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness.	NA
an4.198:13.5	Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of sympathy for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will.	NA
an4.198:13.6	Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness.	NA
an4.198:13.7	Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.	NA
an4.198:13.8	Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.	NA
an4.198:13.9	They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.	NA
an4.198:13.10	Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.	NA

an4.199:0.3	Craving, the Weaver	NA
an4.199:1.1	The Buddha said this:	NA
an4.199:1.2	“Mendicants, I will teach you about craving—the weaver, the migrant, the creeping, the clinging. This world is choked by it, engulfed by it. It makes the world tangled like yarn, knotted like a ball of thread, and matted like rushes and reeds, not escaping the places of loss, the bad places, the underworld, transmigration.	These phrases are evocative, and they should remain so in translation, rather than being too explicit. Jalini is a particularly feminine form, which relates to the widespread image in myth of women who weave the thread of worlds fates (eg http://www.creativitypost.com/arts/myth_and_creativity_ariadnes_thread_and_a_path_through_the_labyrinth). Sarita is, I think, correctly glossed in the comm (Saritanti tattha tattha saritvā saṁsaritvā ṭhitaṁ) but BB’s transl. of the comm in his note doesn’t quite catch it. I would translate: “Sarita means “it remains after migrating and transmigrating through many lives”.” By using migrant I hope to connect it with transmigration. For visata I think the sense is that it spreads or “creeps” like roots.
an4.199:1.3	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
an4.199:1.4	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
an4.199:1.5	The Buddha said this:	NA
an4.199:2.1	“And what is that craving …?	NA
an4.199:2.2	There are eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior, and eighteen that derive from the exterior.	NA
an4.199:3.1	What are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior?	NA
an4.199:3.2	When there is the concept ‘I am’, there are the concepts ‘I am such’, ‘I am thus’, ‘I am otherwise’; ‘I am fleeting’, ‘I am lasting’; ‘mine’, ‘such is mine’, ‘thus is mine’, ‘otherwise is mine’; ‘also mine’, ‘such is also mine’, ‘thus is also mine’, ‘otherwise is also mine’; ‘I will be’, ‘I will be such’, ‘I will be thus’, ‘I will be otherwise’.	Many of these expressions are obscure, although the overall intent is clear. BBs translation follows the comm, from which I have departed in a few cases. For asasmīti hoti, satasmīti I derive from sat rather than sid, following Woodward and Piya Tan. However, the implication of existence is “eternal existence” so the meaning ends up the same, except the terms are reversed. for “san-ti” I tak san=sa4 in PTS dict, i.e sva=own, whereas BB takes it as siyā.
an4.199:3.3	These are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior.	NA
an4.199:4.1	What are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the exterior?	NA
an4.199:4.2	When there is the concept ‘I am because of this’, there are the concepts ‘I am such because of this’, ‘I am thus because of this’, ‘I am otherwise because of this’; ‘I am fleeting because of this’, ‘I am lasting because of this’; ‘mine because of this’, ‘such is mine because of this’, ‘thus is mine because of this’, ‘otherwise is mine because of this’; ‘also mine because of this’, ‘such is also mine because of this’, ‘thus is also mine because of this’, ‘otherwise is also mine because of this’; ‘I will be because of this’, ‘I will be such because of this’, ‘I will be thus because of this’, ‘I will be otherwise because of this’.	NA
an4.199:4.3	These are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the exterior.	NA
an4.199:5.1	So there are eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior, and eighteen that derive from the exterior.	NA
an4.199:5.2	These are called the thirty-six currents of craving.	NA
an4.199:5.3	Each of these pertain to the past, future, and present,	NA
an4.199:5.4	making one hundred and eight currents of craving.	NA
an4.199:6.1	This is that craving—the weaver, the migrant, the creeping, the clinging. This world is choked by it, engulfed by it.

an4.200:1.1	“Mendicants, these four things are born.	The word _pemāni_ is inconsistently found in the editions; if included, this line would read, “These four fondnesses are born.” The Chinese parallel at SA 985 is not in the Fours and so does not have a corresponding sentence. Perhaps this sentence was added when the sutta was incorporated in the Fours.
an4.200:1.2	What four?	NA

an4.200:2.2	It’s when someone likes, loves, and cares for a person.	I found BBs translation hard to parse: I have tried to render the various nagations and clauses more clearly.
an4.200:2.3	Others treat that person with liking, love, and care.	NA
an4.200:2.4	They think:	NA
an4.200:2.5	‘These others like the person I like.’	NA
an4.200:2.6	And so fondness for them springs up.	NA
an4.200:2.7	That’s how fondness is born of fondness.	NA

an4.200:3.2	It’s when someone likes, loves, and cares for a person.	NA
an4.200:3.3	Others treat that person with disliking, loathing, and detestation.	NA

an4.200:4.1	And how is fondness born of hate?	NA
an4.200:4.2	It’s when someone dislikes, loathes, and detests a person.	This is a good example of how negative terms must have a positive force. If you merely don’t love someone, you don’t care what anyone thinks about them.

an4.200:8.2	At that time any fondness born of fondness, hate born of fondness, fondness born of hate, or hate born of hate is given up, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.	NA
an4.200:8.3	This is called a mendicant who doesn’t draw close or push back or fume or ignite or burn up.	For usseneti I follow CPD, this is the natural reading. For the last three factors I see a thematic continuity: one “fumes” from an internal heating, “is ignited” by some external cause, and “burns up” when these catch on. Surely we should trace sampajjhayati to jhayati2 here; the exact term doesn’t seem to occur elsewhere.
an4.200:9.1	And how does a mendicant draw close?	NA

an4.231:1.3	A poet who thoughtfully composes their own work, a poet who repeats the oral transmission, a poet who educates, and a poet who improvises.	I have no idea how BB gets “narrative” out of “suta”. It obviously refers to a poet who passes down the oral tradition (most of which, i.e. the Vedas, are not narrative at all). “Inspirational” is not as bad, but is unnecessarily ambiguous: do they inspire (which is the more common meaning, but shouldn’t apply here) or are they inspired? Even being inspired is not exactly what it means. You can give an inspired performance of a learned piece. What it means is that you make it up on the spot, i.e. improvise.

an4.234:0.3	About Soṇakāyana	NA
an4.234:1.1	Then Sikhāmoggallāna the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
an4.234:1.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, Sikhāmoggallāna sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:	NA
an4.234:2.1	“Worthy Gotama, a few days ago the student Soṇakāyana came to me and said:	NA
an4.234:2.2	‘The ascetic Gotama advocates not doing any deeds. So he teaches the annihilation of the world!’	NA
an4.234:2.3	The world exists through deeds, and it remains because deeds are undertaken.”	BB’s rendering of sacca as “substance” is straight out of the comm’s “svabhava”, a concept that is alien to the suttas. The suttas nowhere support an ontology that things exist because of an underlying “substance”. Also, I think BB is mistaken to include this as Sonakayana’s speech. Our text clearly closes the former segment with quote mark, showing that the editor thought it ended there, even though there’s no “ti”. Crucially, the vocative “bho” is used, which is regularly used by brahmins speaking with the Buddha, but not, so far as I know, by a brahmin student speaking with his teacher.

an4.245:1.1	“Mendicants, this spiritual life is lived with training as its benefit, with wisdom as its overseer, with freedom as its core, and with mindfulness as its ruler.	NA
an4.245:1.2	And how is training its benefit?	NA
an4.245:1.3	Firstly, I laid down for my disciples the training that deals with supplementary regulations in order to inspire confidence in those without it and to increase confidence in those who have it.	Abhisamacarika is a little tricky to translate. It’s more than “etiquette” and less than “proper conduct”. It is a technical term, found rarely in the EBTs, and should sound like it in translation. The Vinaya depicts thus: abhisamācārikāya sikkhāya sikkhāpetuṁ, ādibrahmacariyakāya sikkhāya vinetuṁ. In our sutta, too, the same contrast is made. Thus “abhi-” here must be in the sense of “extra” to the “fundamentals of the holy life”. This is contra the comms, which say eg “uttamo samācāro”, “higher conduct”. CPD doesn’t catch this meaning either.
an4.245:1.4	They undertake whatever supplementary regulations I have laid down, keeping them intact, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred.	NA
an4.245:2.1	Furthermore, I laid down for my disciples the training that deals with the fundamentals of the spiritual life in order to rightly end suffering in every way.	NA
an4.245:2.2	They undertake whatever training that deals with the fundamentals of the spiritual life I have laid down, keeping it intact, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred.	NA
an4.245:2.3	That’s how training is its benefit.	NA
an4.245:3.1	And how is wisdom its overseer?	NA
an4.245:3.2	I taught the Dhamma to my disciples in order to rightly end suffering in every way.	NA
an4.245:3.3	They examine with wisdom any teachings I taught them.	NA
an4.245:3.4	That’s how wisdom is its overseer.	NA

an4.245:4.3	They experience through freedom any teachings I taught them.	NA
an4.245:4.4	That’s how freedom is its core.	NA

BB follows the comm in translating ayatana as base (=cause=karana). But the “ayatana” doesn’t “cause” liberation, it is an opportunity for it. The root of ayatana means an extended or stretched out space, i.e. field, region, scope. Here it refers to the “occasion” or “opportunity” within which liberation can happen.

an5.28:2.1	“And how do you develop noble right immersion with five factors?	NA
an5.28:2.2	Firstly, a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption. It has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
an5.28:2.3	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.

an5.28:2.4	It’s like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out.	NA

an5.28:3.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption. It has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
an5.28:3.2	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion.	NA
an5.28:3.3	There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion.	NA
an5.28:3.4	It’s like a deep lake fed by spring water. There’s no inlet to the east, west, north, or south, and the heavens would not properly bestow showers from time to time.	NA

an5.28:3.8	This is the second way to develop noble right immersion with five factors.	NA

an5.28:5.2	They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind.	NA
an5.28:5.3	There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind.	NA

an5.33:2.1	“Sir, may the Buddha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me, together with three other monks.”	NA
an5.33:2.2	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
an5.33:2.3	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Uggaha got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	NA
an5.33:3.1	Then when the night had passed, the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Uggaha’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out.	NA
an5.33:3.2	Then Uggaha served and satisfied the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	NA

an5.33:3.6	May the Buddha please advise	NA
an5.33:3.7	and instruct them. It will be for their lasting welfare and happiness.”	NA
an5.33:4.1	Then the Buddha said to those girls:	NA
an5.33:4.2	“So, girls, you should train like this:	NA
an5.33:4.3	‘Our parents will give us to a husband wanting what’s best, out of kindness and sympathy. We will get up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely.’	NA
an5.33:4.4	That’s how you should train.	NA
an5.33:5.1	So, girls, you should train like this:	NA

an5.33:5.3	That’s how you should train.	NA
an5.33:6.1	So, girls, you should train like this:	NA
an5.33:6.2	‘We will be deft and tireless in doing domestic duties for our husband, such as knitting and sewing. We will have an understanding of how to go about things in order to complete and organize the work.’	NA
an5.33:6.3	That’s how you should train.	NA
an5.33:7.1	So, girls, you should train like this:	NA
an5.33:7.2	‘We will know what work our husband’s domestic bondservants, servants, and workers have completed, and what they’ve left incomplete. We will know who is sick, and who is fit or unwell. We will distribute to each a fair portion of fresh and cooked foods.’	NA
an5.33:7.3	That’s how you should train.	NA

an5.34:6.1	Furthermore, when a giver’s body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	NA
an5.34:6.2	This is a fruit of giving to do with lives to come.”	NA
an5.34:7.1	When he said this, General Sīha said to the Buddha,	NA
an5.34:7.2	“When it comes to those four fruits of giving that are apparent in the present life, I don’t have to rely on faith in the Buddha, for I know them too.	NA
an5.34:7.3	I’m a giver, a donor, and am dear and beloved to many people.	NA

In Buddhist cosmology, this agrees with the fact that Sakka’s realm is the third of the heavens (after the earth gods and the four great kings). Thus the Third Heaven is the heaven of the Thirty-Three. Both ideas spring from an old association of Indra, or divinity generally, with the number three. Agni Purāṇa lists _tridiva_ as a synonym for “heaven”, as does Amarakośa 1.1.11. Kṣīrasvāmin clarifies that three here means “third”, while also adding that some connect it with the Brahmā realm (Amarakośodghāṭana 1.1.6; see [sn7.18:4.2]()).

an5.41:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
an5.41:1.2	Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:	NA
an5.41:1.3	“Householder, there are these five reasons to get rich.	BB’s “utilization” echoes DPPN’s “use”, but comm says bhogānaṁ ādātabbakāraṇāni. It seems a big stretch to “utilization”. Ṭhānissaro has “benefits that can be obtained from wealth”. But I follow Hare.
an5.41:1.4	What five?	NA
an5.41:1.5	Firstly, with his legitimate wealth—earned by his efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow—a noble disciple makes himself happy and pleased, keeping himself properly happy.	NA
an5.41:1.6	He makes his mother and father happy …	NA
an5.41:1.7	He makes his children, partners, bondservants, workers, and staff happy …	NA
an5.41:1.8	This is the first reason to get rich.	NA
an5.41:2.1	Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he makes his friends and colleagues happy …	NA
an5.41:2.2	This is the second reason to get rich.	NA
an5.41:3.1	Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he protects himself against losses from such things as fire, water, kings, bandits, or unloved heirs.	NA
an5.41:3.2	NA	NA
an5.41:3.3	He keeps himself safe.	NA
an5.41:3.4	This is the third reason to get rich.	NA
an5.41:4.1	Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he makes five spirit-offerings:	NA
an5.41:4.2	to relatives, guests, ancestors, king, and deities.	NA
an5.41:4.3	This is the fourth reason to get rich.	NA
an5.41:5.1	Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he establishes an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins—those who refrain from intoxication and negligence, are settled in patience and sweetness, and who tame, calm, and extinguish themselves—that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven.	NA
an5.41:5.2	This is the fifth reason to get rich.	NA
an5.41:5.3	These are the five reasons to get rich.	NA
an5.41:6.1	Now if the riches a noble disciple gets for these five reasons run out, he thinks:	NA
an5.41:6.2	‘So, the riches I have obtained for these reasons are running out.’	NA
an5.41:6.3	And so he has no regrets.	NA
an5.41:6.4	But if the riches a noble disciple gets for these five reasons increase, he thinks:	NA
an5.41:6.5	‘So, the riches I have obtained for these reasons are increasing.’	NA
an5.41:6.6	And so he has no regrets in both cases.	NA
an5.41:7.1	‘I’ve enjoyed my wealth, <j>supporting those who depend on me;	NA
an5.41:7.2	I’ve overcome losses;	NA
an5.41:7.3	I’ve given uplifting religious donations;	NA

an5.54:1.2	What five?	NA
an5.54:1.3	Firstly, a mendicant is old, overcome with old age.	NA
an5.54:1.4	This is the first time that’s not good for meditation.	NA
an5.54:2.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is sick, overcome by sickness.	NA
an5.54:2.2	This is the second time that’s not good for meditation.	NA
an5.54:3.1	Furthermore, there’s a famine, a bad harvest, so it’s hard to get almsfood, and not easy to keep going by collecting alms.	NA
an5.54:3.2	This is the third time that’s not good for meditation.	NA
an5.54:4.1	Furthermore, there’s peril due to turmoil in the wilds, so the countryfolk mount their vehicles and flee everywhere.	NA
an5.54:4.2	This is the fourth time that’s not good for meditation.	NA
an5.54:5.1	Furthermore, there’s a schism in the Saṅgha.	NA
an5.54:5.2	When the Saṅgha is split, they abuse, insult, block, and forsake each other.	BB follows the comm in translating parikkhepa (see his note). But in the Vinaya it always has a meaning of “enclosure”, typically a fence that surrounds a monastery or village. It makes perfect sense here, either literally, with a sanghakamma that restricts movement as contrasted with pariccaja as expulsion, or else as “shutting down” in argument.
an5.54:5.3	This doesn’t inspire confidence in those without it, and it causes some with confidence to change their minds.	NA

BB translates and explains ugghatita based on the comm, but this seems implausible to me. A swollen corpse is precisely one of the things that does away with lust, not excites it. BB cites DOP in support, but the entry is no independent evidence: it merely refers to this very text and comm, and, in any case, questions this interpretation. The verses make it clear that the term is closely related to “dead”. Surely it makes sense for ugghatita to be a state between “crying” and “dead”, not something that happens after death. Ugghāṭeti and related forms can mean “hurt, injured”, and so I translate. Falling in love with a woman who is hurt or in need of rescue is an old trope: in fact a nun uses this very trick on Ananda.

I lead the spiritual life dissatisfied, and have doubts about the teachings.”	Note that the idiom dhamma nappatibhanti is closely similar to manta nappatibbhanti at AN 5.193. Thus here dhamma must mean “teachings”, and the sense is that one cannot recall them.

an5.58:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	NA

an5.58:1.3	Then after the meal, on his return from almsround, he plunged deep into the Great Wood and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation.	NA
an5.58:2.1	Now at that time several Licchavi youths took strung bows and, escorted by a pack of hounds, were going for a walk in the Great Wood when they saw the Buddha seated at the root of a tree.	NA
an5.58:2.2	When they saw him, they put down their strung bows, tied their hounds up to one side, and went up to him. They bowed and silently paid homage to the Buddha with joined palms.	There are surprisingly few contexts that make clear exactly what _payirupasati_ means. BB usually uses “attend”, but this connotes more “looking after”. But here it clearly means “paying homage”
an5.58:3.1	Now at that time Mahānāma the Licchavi was going for a walk in the Great Wood when he saw those Licchavi youths silently paying homage to the Buddha with joined palms.	NA
an5.58:3.2	Seeing this, he went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,	NA
an5.58:3.3	and expressed this heartfelt sentiment,	NA
an5.58:3.4	“They will become Vajjis! They will become Vajjis!”	The commentary has _vaḍḍhissanti_, “they will mature”. The Licchavīs were the most prominent clan among the Vajjīs, and this statement appears to be saying that these callow young princelings will grow up to become worthy members of the confederacy with its principles that were praised by the Buddha.
an5.58:4.1	“But Mahānāma, why do you say that	NA
an5.58:4.2	they will become Vajjis?”	NA

Pettanika (vl. pettaṇika) occurs only here and at AN 6.17. In both cases it occurs as part of the same sequence, hence must have the same meaning. However it is treated differently in the two cases. Here it seems to go with “ratthika”, while at AN 6.17 they are two separate items in the list. BB has no note, but translates “country gentleman” here and “Royal official … favorite son” at AN 6.17. ( “Favorite son” is, in any case, unjustified.) AN 6.17 makes it clear that a position of authority is meant.

The phrase _sati sati āyatane_, a locative absolute, is tricky. Bodhi follows the commentary in taking _āyatana_ in the sense of “reason”, and treats the locative absolute as conditional: “there being a suitable basis”. However this does not readily account for the repeated _sati_, which he takes as the locative present participle from the verb _atthi_ (“being”). Ānandajoti, by contrast, takes the first _sati_ as “being” and the second as “mindfulness”, and treats the absolute construction as temporal: “while there is a basis for mindfulness”. Both accept the commentary’s gloss of _āyatana_ as _kāraṇa_ (“reason, basis”), although this sense of _āyatana_ is rare in the suttas (but see [sn12.25:14.3]() = [an4.171:5.3]()). Both these read the absolute construction in a limiting sense; but the expression is used here by the Buddha of himself, so it seems odd that this applies in a limiting way. Indeed, the tenor of the whole phrase is not limiting but expansive, as emphasized by the repeated distributive reduplications: _yassa yassa … tatra tatreva … sati sati_. I therefore take _sati_ as “being” in both cases; the reduplication as aligned with the previous pronouns, emphasizing universality; the locative absolute as causal; and _āyatana_ in its normal sense of “scope, range”.

These similes all relate meaningfully to their explanations, but it’s not always possible to capture this in English. 1. “lifted the crossbar” = overcome ignorance, removed the blocks to knowledge. 2. “filled in the trench” = ended samsara. This one is obscure, but I think it means that you’re trapped by trenches, kept within the bounds of samsara, and when they’re filled in you can escape. 3. “pulled up the pillar” = give up craving. This one relies on a pun in the Pali: pillar = esika, which also means “seeking”. No pillar, no seeking, no craving. 4. Unbarred = giving up fiver lower fetters, a fetter is a bar. “lowering the flag” = giving up conceit. The flag is used as an identifier so you know who is who: no flag, no self.

an5.77:2.1	What five?	NA
an5.77:2.2	Firstly, a wilderness mendicant reflects:	NA
an5.77:2.3	‘Currently I’m living alone in a wilderness.	NA
an5.77:2.4	While living here alone	NA
an5.77:2.5	I might get bitten by a snake, a scorpion, or a centipede.	NA

an5.77:5.1	Furthermore, a wilderness mendicant reflects:	NA
an5.77:5.2	‘Currently I’m living alone in a wilderness.	NA
an5.77:5.3	While living here alone	Like BB I follow the comm here, otherwise it doesn’t make much sense. In the Vinaya and Niddesas it is common to find katakamma used in this sense. The comm, incidentally, offers a second, much grislier explanation, where “kamma” = ritual = sacrifice: taking the neck-blood from creatures to offer to the gods … or needing to get some …
an5.77:5.4	I might encounter youths escaping a crime or on their way to commit one, and they might take my life.	NA

an5.100:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery.	NA

an5.100:1.4	He was reincarnated in a life-form that was two or three times the size of a Magadhan village with its fields.	NA
an5.100:1.5	But with that life-form he didn’t obstruct himself or others.	NA
an5.100:2.1	Then the godling Kakudha went up to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	NA
an5.100:2.2	“Sir, this fixed desire arose in Devadatta:	BB doesn’t translate -gata. But I take it in the same sense as ditthigata, meaning “fixed, rigid, stuck”. BB has “involvement” for gata at AN 7.54, which feels too weak. In bacon and eggs, gata is the pig, not the chicken!
an5.100:2.3	‘I shall lead the mendicant Saṅgha.’	NA
an5.100:2.4	And as that thought arose, Devadatta lost that psychic power.”	See BB’s note for the context of “that”.

an5.102:2.1	What five?	NA
an5.102:2.2	It’s when a monk resorts to prostitutes, widows, voluptuous girls, eunuchs, or nuns for alms.	See BB’s comment here. This is a good example of what I think is a common mistake in reading the comms. I think their glosses are too readily taken as substitutes for words, when they are better read as explanations or elaborations. In this case “gocara” has a strong meaning in such contexts of “place to go for alms”, and the comm would not feel the need to explain this. However, the question arises: is it prohibited to go to such people for alms? Obviously not, since the Buddha for example accepted a meal from Ambapali. So what it must mean is “going frequently or regularly to such places for alms”. So “visiting frequently” is not a replacement for “alms-resort”, it is an explanation of the specific case. Also notice BB’s rendering of thullakumari as unmarried women, thus omitting the “thulla”. Also I don’t know that woman is really right for kumari, they are usually teens or younger. There’s a modern idiom “thick girls”, which means the same thing.

an5.157:1.1	“Mendicants, it is inappropriate to speak to five kinds of person by comparing that person with someone else.	This is a difficult idiom to get right. I follow the Comm. reading of “puggalam puggalam”. BB has “weigh one type of person against the other”. Upanidhaya normally has the meaning of “compare”, but I am not sure how that makes sense here. You’re not comparing people, you’re assessing what is approppriate for this specific person. Comm. says “taṁ taṁ puggalaṁ upanikkhipitvā, sakkhiṁ katvā”, which (I think!) implies specificity rather than distribution, i.e. “examining that specific person”.

an5.178:3.11	‘This person had sexual relations with women or maidens under someone else’s protection.’	This is apparently the only occurrence of paritthi and parakumari, and it is not commented on by Comm or BB. The meaning is straightforward enough and it should obviously be read beside the standard passage on the five precepts, for example AN 10.21. There, the emphasis is on guardianship. It is considered to be a transgression if a woman is under protection. Note the list of those who she might be under protection of: mother, father, brother, sister, family. Surprisingly, it is not a gendered list, and the husband only appears towards the end of it. Nor is there any implication, here or elsewhere, that a woman *should* be under one or other of these forms of protection, such as we find in some later Hindu texts. If a man has intercourse with a woman who is a free agent, it is not breaking precepts. It is important to avoid the impression of ownership here. Such women were not bondservants. Obviously there was some degree of restriction, but that is the case even today if a girl is under guardianship. BB’s “someone else’s women” is correct, but to me is apt to be read as implying ownership. Further, we have a problem with “kumari”. Often, of course, this just means “girl”. However the normal marriageable age at the time was 16, and there is, to my knowledge, no recognized custom of sexualizing or marrying younger girls. “Maiden” is a little archaic, but the “fair maiden” of fairy tales is, in fact, pretty much exactly what is meant here.

an5.179:1.3	“You should know this, Sāriputta, about those white-clothed laypeople whose actions are restrained in the five precepts, and who get four blissful meditations in this life belonging to the higher mind when they want, without trouble or difficulty.

an5.179:2.1	And what are the five precepts in which their actions are restrained?	NA
an5.179:2.2	It’s when a noble disciple doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.	NA

an5.179:3.1	And what are the four blissful meditations in this life belonging to the higher mind that they get when they want, without trouble or difficulty?	NA

an5.179:5.3	This is the third blissful meditation …	NA
an5.179:6.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.	NA

an5.180:0.3	About Gavesī	NA
an5.180:1.1	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	NA
an5.180:1.2	While traveling along a road the Buddha saw a large sal grove in a certain spot.	NA
an5.180:1.3	He left the road, went to the sal grove, and plunged deep into it. And at a certain spot he smiled.	NA
an5.180:2.1	Then Venerable Ānanda thought,	NA
an5.180:2.2	“What is the cause, what is the reason why the Buddha smiled?	NA
an5.180:2.3	Realized Ones do not smile for no reason.”	NA
an5.180:2.4	So Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,	NA
an5.180:2.5	“What is the cause, what is the reason why the Buddha smiled?	NA
an5.180:2.6	Realized Ones do not smile for no reason.”	NA
an5.180:3.1	“Once upon a time, Ānanda, there was a city in this spot that was successful and prosperous, populous, full of people.	NA
an5.180:3.2	And Kassapa, a blessed one, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, lived supported by that city.	NA
an5.180:3.3	He had a lay follower called Gavesī who had not fulfilled all the precepts.	NA
an5.180:3.4	And the five hundred lay followers who were taught and advised by Gavesī also had not fulfilled all the precepts.	NA
an5.180:3.5	Then Gavesī thought:	NA

an5.180:3.7	We’re the same, I’m in no way better.	NA

an5.180:4.11	We’re the same, I’m in no way better.	NA

an5.180:7.3	And he received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	NA
an5.180:7.4	Not long after his ordination, the mendicant Gavesī, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life.

an5.180:7.5	He understood: ‘Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.’	NA
an5.180:7.6	And the mendicant Gavesī became one of the perfected.	NA

an5.180:8.7	And they did receive the going forth and ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	NA
an5.180:9.1	Then the mendicant Gavesī thought:	NA

an5.180:9.3	Oh, may these five hundred mendicants do the same!’	NA
an5.180:9.4	Then those five hundred mendicants, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life.

an5.180:9.6	They understood: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’	NA

an5.191:0.3	Dogs	NA
an5.191:1.1	“Mendicants, these five ancient traditions of the brahmins are exhibited these days among dogs, but not among brahmins.	This discourse is perhaps a satirical response to Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1:12, which tells of dogs singing hymns for food. The Brahmanical tradition does not treat that story as derogatory; rather, the dogs are sages in disguise, and the story illustrates how even dogs would avoid eating unclean food.
an5.191:1.2	What five?	NA
an5.191:1.3	In the past brahmins had sex only with brahmin women, not with others.	NA
an5.191:1.4	These days brahmins have sex with both brahmin women and others.	NA
an5.191:1.5	But these days dogs have sex only with female dogs, not with other species.	NA
an5.191:1.6	This is the first ancient tradition of the brahmins exhibited these days among dogs, but not among brahmins.	NA
an5.191:2.1	In the past brahmins had sex only with brahmin women in the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle, not at other times.	See https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/menstruation-and-fertility-in-the-pali-texts/3042
an5.191:2.2	These days brahmins have sex with brahmin women both in the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle and at other times.	NA
an5.191:2.3	But these days dogs have sex only with female dogs when they are in heat, not at other times.	NA
an5.191:2.4	This is the second ancient tradition of the brahmins exhibited these days among dogs, but not among brahmins.	NA
an5.191:3.1	In the past brahmins neither bought nor sold brahmin women. They lived together because they loved each other and wanted their family line to continue.	Note that the similar passage in Snp 2.7 explicitly adds “mutual consent”.
an5.191:3.2	These days brahmins both buy and sell brahmin women. They live together whether they love each other or not and they want their family line to continue.	See BB’s note for the readings. I find it very strange that brahmins are said to buy and sell brahmin women: I am not aware of this being said elsewhere. I suspect it stems from a misinterpretation of Brihadarannyaka 6.4, which parallels this very closely, where a brahman is encouraged to bribe his wife for sex when need be, using the same verb kinati. It doesn’t refer to buying a wife, certainly not selling her. See the Puranic accounts of hell for examples where buying women leads to hell???
an5.191:3.3	But these days dogs neither buy nor sell female dogs. They live together because they’re attracted to each other and want their family line to continue.	“Love” is odd here, but it seems to me that “sampiya” is no less odd.
an5.191:3.4	This is the third ancient tradition of the brahmins exhibited these days among dogs, but not among brahmins.	NA
an5.191:4.1	In the past brahmins did not store up money, grain, silver, or gold.	The importance of this as an ethical principle for the ancients perhaps hints at the nomadic pastoral origins of the Indo-European peoples.
an5.191:4.2	These days brahmins do store up money, grain, silver, and gold.	NA

They were the authors and propagators of the hymns, whose hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times. These days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it. They continue chanting what was chanted, reciting what was recited, and teaching what was taught.	BB treats pavattar as equivalent to kattar, hence “creator”, and pavutta as from vac, i.e. reciter. However it seems likely that they are from the same root, cf occasional variant pavatta as noted in PTS dict. They relate to pavattita, cf. the rolling forth of the dhammacakka, and have the sense of “roll forth, i.e. propagate, spread” rather than either create or recite. Note that this statement is spoken by the Buddha to brahmins, and is an attack on their notion that the verses were spoken by Brahma, substituting a naturalistic explanation.
an5.192:3.2	Those seers described five kinds of brahmins.	NA

I don’t think this set of 5 kinds of brahmins is actually in any brahmanical texts. But certainly it is wrong to ascribe this to the Vedic rishis: there is no renunciate ideal in the Vedas.
an5.192:6.4	Then they meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth.

an5.195:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	NA

an5.196:0.3	The Great Dreams	NA
an5.196:1.1	“Mendicants, before his awakening five great dreams appeared to the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, when he was still not awake but intent on awakening.	NA
an5.196:1.2	What five?	NA
an5.196:1.3	This great earth was his bed. Himalaya, king of mountains, was his pillow. His left hand was laid down in the eastern sea. His right hand was laid down in the western sea. And both his feet were laid down in the southern sea.	I think ohita here with the locative implies the limbs were “in” the ocean, not just on it. A small difference, but one that has implications for the symbolism.
an5.196:1.4	This is the first great dream that appeared to the Realized One before his awakening.	NA
an5.196:2.1	Next, a kind of grass called ‘the crosser’ grew up from his navel and stood pushing against the cloudy sky.	The language here is very specific and quite unusual. The grass called “tiriyā” is unknown elsewhere. I assume it is related to tira, “crossing”. In BHS it is kṣīrikā “milky”. The text is clearly twinning the terms nābhiyā and nabham, which latter is here preferred to the several other words for sky in Pali. Nabha can often just mean sky, atmosphere. But it has a special association with clouds, mist and rain. It is also a name for a month in the Vassa (MW). I think the overall connotation in this image is that of fertility, hence justifying “cloudy” here. I am tempted to add “navy” also, to complete the image: from his navel to the navy-blue clouds. Also, not that āhacca is unusual here and seems to imply something more forceful than just “touched”. BHS has āsadya.
an5.196:2.2	This is the second great dream that appeared to the Realized One before his awakening.	NA
an5.196:3.1	Next, white caterpillars with black heads crawled up from his feet and covered his knees.	Kimi here is normally translated worm, eg BB. But Dhammika notes that kimi must sometimes mean caterpillar. And in fact it is quite common for caterpillars to have white bodies and black heads (http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-30Ehg5G1IVc/TwMrSNADp0I/AAAAAAAAMOw/4QEunpJjpYc/s1600/MalayDartlet_newly_hatched_01.jpg), a sight that must have been quite reminiscent of the upasikas. Not only does this avoid the derogatroy connotations of worms, it evokes the transformative potential of the caterpillar. They have come to the Buddha to turn into butterflies! Mvu has lohitakā prāṇakā.
an5.196:3.2	This is the third great dream that appeared to the Realized One before his awakening.	NA
an5.196:4.1	Next, four birds of different colors came from the four quarters. They fell at his feet, turning pure white.	NA
an5.196:4.2	This is the fourth great dream that appeared to the Realized One before his awakening.	NA
an5.196:5.1	Next, he walked back and forth on top of a huge mountain of filth while remaining unsoiled.	BB’s 'climbed a mountain' appears to be unjustified. Ṭhānissaro has 'walked back & forth on top of a giant mountain of excrement', comm has matthakamatthake.
an5.196:5.2	This is the fifth great dream that appeared to the Realized One before his awakening.	NA
an5.196:6.1	Now, as to when, before his awakening, the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha was still not awake but intent on awakening. This great earth was his bed. Himalaya, king of mountains, was his pillow. His left hand was laid down in the eastern sea. His right hand was laid down in the western sea. And both his feet were laid down in the southern sea.	NA
an5.196:6.2	This was fulfilled when the Buddha awakened to the perfect awakening.	NA
an5.196:6.3	This was the first great dream that appeared to him while he was still not awakened.	See BB’s notes, and extensive use of [braces] for the uncertainty in the construction of this and previous sentences. The text seems to be corrupt. BB, however, does not consider Mvu, which here makes more sense. In place of these two sentences, it just has: yaṁ pi bhikṣavaḥ tathāgato anuttarāṁ samyaksaṁbodhim anabhisaṁbuddho ayaṁ tasya mahāsvapnasya vipāko, “The fulfillment of this great dream is that the Realized One became awakened in the supreme perfect awakening”. While this is straightforward linguistically, the use of vipāka here is doctrinally questionable. Surely it can’t mean “kammavipaka” as, well, there’s no kamma. Jones has “fulfillment” which works better. I’m reading tassa anabhisambodhassa against the text’s tassā abhisambodhāya here. I don’t have any linguistic justification for this. It requires correcting tassā to tassa, and inserting the negative. My concern is that the text itself is curiously silent on the question of the relation between the dream and the outcome. We read pubbanimitta from the commentaries, where it occurs no less than twelve times. Something seems to be required to make sense, yet the text itself doesn’t quite say that. The idea of dreams as foreshadowing is obviously at the least unusual, if not unique, in the EBTs. I’d rather translate in a way that imposed as little meaning as possible. Reading it in this way, the sentence is just doing the ordinary thing you’d expect from a sentence like this in the nikayas: it restates the opening. I’d rather risk a linguistic slip than be guilty of reading an entire doctrine of foreshadowing by dreams into the EBTs based on such an uncertain passage. For the same reason, in the previous segment, while it seems we can’t avoid some interpolation, rather than the explicit “foreshadowing” or similar, I use the vague “fulfills”, following Jones. If I have a vision or make a prophecy and later “fulfill” that, it doesn’t imply that the prophecy caused the result.
an5.196:7.1	As to when a kind of grass called ‘the crosser’ grew up from his navel and stood pushing against the cloudy sky.	NA
an5.196:7.2	This was fulfilled when, after the Buddha had awakened to the noble eightfold path, it was well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.	Mvu here has a much longer section on the four truths, giving a summary recount of the Dhammacakka. Also, it makes more explicit the notion of the two worlds (imaṁ ca lokam abhijñāya paraṁ ca lokam abhijñāya) as implied in the dream.

an5.196:8.1	As to when white caterpillars with black heads crawled up from his feet and covered his knees.	NA
an5.196:8.2	This was fulfilled when many white-clothed laypeople went for refuge to him for life.	Mvu says that many people having served the Buddha went to heaven.
an5.196:8.3	This was the third great dream that appeared to him while he was still not awakened.	NA
an5.196:9.1	As to when four birds of different colors came from the four quarters. They fell at his feet, turning pure white.	For nipatitva Mvu has upajighritvā “having sniffed his feet”! (Jones translates as “kissed”. Cute, and quite Christian.) Instead of sampajjimsu it has apavidhyinsuḥ and apavijhinsuś. This is apparently Edgerton’s “aparādhyati: disappears: Mv ii.137.9 (śakuntā…) aparādhyetsuḥ, aor.; so mss., Senart em. apavidhyinsuḥ, but this could only mean were thrown away, which is completely inappropriate; in Mv ii.139.4, in identical context, mss. aparijhiṁsuḥ (°nsuḥ), Senart em. °vijhinsuḥ; read perhaps MIndic aparajjhiṁsuḥ, cf. AMg. above; in any case some form related to apa-rādh, aor., disappeared.” Jones has “went away”.
an5.196:9.2	This was fulfilled when members of the four classes—aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials—went forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One and realized supreme freedom.	NA
an5.196:9.3	This was the fourth great dream that appeared to him while he was still not awakened.	NA
an5.196:10.1	As to when he walked back and forth on top of a huge mountain of filth while remaining unsoiled.	NA
an5.196:10.2	This was fulfilled when the Realized One received robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And he used them untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawbacks, and understanding the escape.	NA
an5.196:10.3	This was the fifth great dream that appeared to him while he was still not awakened.	NA

Initially I rejected BB’s forecaster here, as I thought this more like soothsaying than science.

But while toothwoods, or as more widely known, chew sticks, are somewhat obscure, they are a distinct means of cleaning the teeth. I learned how to make and use them in Thailand. And they have their own wikipedia page! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teeth_cleaning_twig Check out the study here, which shows that they are as good or better than toothbrushes: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4114011/

an5.208:1.3	It’s not good for your eyes, you get bad breath, your taste-buds aren’t cleaned, bile and phlegm cover your food, and you lose your appetite.	This section emphasizes why this really needs to be chew sticks. Brushing your teeth doesn’t help your vision. But one of the basic principles of holistic medicine like ayurveda is that multiple different systems are affected. Liquorice, for example, is an ayurvedic root that can be a chew stick and is a digestive, an anti-phlegmatic, treatment for food poisoning, and is said to be good for the eyes, note that it’s exactly the same term as in the Pali (Chakshushya—Good for eyes,) http://easyayurveda.com/2012/12/08/licorice-benefits-medicinal-qualities-complete-ayurveda-details/. In fact the modern ayurvedic description of benefits suggest that liquorice was in fact used. Neem, another popular chew stick, is a digestive http://www.yogamag.net/archives/2008/ajan08/neem.shtml

Nor is that meaning found in MW: http://sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&q=paripantha&lang=sans&action=Search But if we take the normal meaning of paripantha, how is a parajika to “cut off the obstacle”. I propose reading as a dvanda: chinno paripantho. Also note that in this passage the vā only is used for the first three items, which might suggest the last two were added.

BB has “sent” for peseti, which is literal, but obscure to me. What it presumably means is that even if they have been appointed to the office, you should avoid asking them to actually do their job. I don’t think it’s found in Vinaya. “Employ” would work, but has different connotations these days. There might be a literal component of “sending”, i.e. to families to make arrangements. But I don’t see how this would be a general sense of their task as a whole: mostly it would be organizing who goes where. In Sanskrit praiṣa (MW) has: sending, direction, invitation, summons, order, call (especially upon the assistant priest to commence a ceremony). It seems to me that this is similar to the last meaning: calling on an appointed functionary to do their job.

an6.1:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
an6.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
an6.1:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
an6.1:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
an6.1:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
an6.1:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
an6.1:2.1	“Mendicants, a mendicant with six qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.	NA
an6.1:2.2	What six?	NA
an6.1:2.3	It’s a mendicant who, when they see a sight with their eyes, is neither happy nor sad. They remain equanimous, mindful and aware.	NA
an6.1:2.4	When they hear a sound with their ears …	NA
an6.1:2.5	When they smell an odor with their nose …	NA

an6.1:2.9	A mendicant with these six qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”	NA
an6.1:3.1	That is what the Buddha said.	NA

an6.2:1.2	What six?	NA
an6.2:1.3	It’s a mendicant who wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. They control the body as far as the realm of divinity.	NA
an6.2:2.1	With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and heavenly, whether near or far.	NA
an6.2:3.1	They understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind.	NA

an6.2:3.17	They understand unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’.	NA
an6.2:4.1	They recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	NA
an6.2:5.1	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	NA

an6.10:0.3	With Mahānāma	NA
an6.10:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.	NA
an6.10:1.2	Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	NA
an6.10:1.3	“Sir, when a noble disciple has reached the fruit and understood the instructions, what kind of meditation do they frequently practice?”	NA
an6.10:2.1	“Mahānāma, when a noble disciple has reached the fruit and understood the instructions they frequently practice this kind of meditation.	NA
an6.10:2.2	Firstly, a noble disciple recollects the Realized One:	NA
an6.10:2.3	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
an6.10:2.4	When a noble disciple recollects the Realized One their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion.	NA
an6.10:2.5	At that time their mind is unswerving, based on the Realized One.	BB’s “simply straight” for ujugata strikes me as unhelpfully literal. It seems to me the point is that the mind is focussed on the meditation and doesn’t deviate from it. See Dhp 33, where a “wobbling” (=capala) arrow is made “ujugata”. Here uju means both literally “straight”, but with the metaphorical point that the arrow doesn’t wobble in flight. “Sure “or” true” could work, but only if the sense is made clear in context, something like “their mind’s aim is true”.
an6.10:2.6	A noble disciple whose mind is unswerving finds inspiration in the meaning and the teaching, and finds joy connected with the teaching.	NA
an6.10:2.7	When they’re joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when they’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.	NA

an6.16:2.4	Householder, you might think:	NA
an6.16:2.5	‘When I’ve gone, the housewife Nakula’s mother won’t be able to provide for the children and keep up the household carpets.’	The verb santharitun is curious here, especially as it relates to a duty of housewives, such as may easily be overlooked or misconstrued by male editors. BB translates without note as “maintain”, perhaps reading sandharitun. But the majority reading, and lectio difficilior, is santharitun. An overly generic rendering devalues women’s work. Comm. says nicchiddaṁ kātuṁ, saṇṭhapetunti attho. Note both Cone and Gradual Sayings have the reading saṇṭhapetun pavattentunti attho. In each of the following sections she directly and specifically addresses the concern. In this case, the concern is addressed by her saying that she is skilled in weaving. Thus it is possible to read this as literally “keeping the house covered in carpets”. (Comm nicchidda, without holes). In earthen and cow-dung plastered homes maintaining the home with coverings is important. Perhaps it is an idiom for “keeping up standards”.

an6.24:1.3	It’s when a mendicant is skilled in entering immersion, skilled in remaining in immersion, skilled in emerging from immersion, skilled in gladdening the mind for immersion, skilled in the meditation subjects for immersion, and skilled in projecting the mind purified by immersion.	These terms are linguistically straightforward, but require care in interpretation. See BB’s notes, where he quotes Comm and Tika. The first three are obvious. Kallita has the notions of health, brightnesss, and fitness. Comm says “hāsetum”, and I think an important part of this is the notion of happiness as a characteristic of a healthy mind. The samadhigocara is satipatthana, i.e. the meditation subjects that you develop to get into samadhi. Gocara is generally a “support”. This is generally in line with Comm and Tika, but they are a bit vague. The only case where I disagree with Comm is abhinihara. They interpret this in terms of the later idea of making resolutions for samadhi. But if this is the case, why does it come at the end of the list? As the final factor, you’d expect it to deal with what comes after samadhi. And in fact the most common use of the term is exactly this: “So evaṁ samāhite citte parisuddhe pariyodāte … ñāṇadassanāya cittaṁ abhinīharati abhininnāmeti”. There’s no reason to think it doesn’t have this same meaning here.

On that occasion they should go to an esteemed mendicant and say:	BB has “object” for nimitta: “what object to rely on and attend to in order to attain …” But there is no such thing as a meditation “object” in early Buddhism. A nimitta is the very antithesis of an object; it is constantly associated with saññā, with perception, with ways of seeing, with aspects of things. To focus on a nimitta is to pay attention to that aspect of experience, especially meditative experience, that fosters and grows the requisite qualities, **together with the attending mind**, not as an object of it. The idiom yaṁ nimittaṁ āgamma yaṁ nimittaṁ manasikaroto recurs at MN 20, where BB renders it “when a bhikkhu is giving attention to some sign, and owing to that sign…” Nyanamoli had: “owing to some sign, to which sign he is giving attention”. BB’s more recent translation duplicates the sense of “owing to” (āgamma). I don’t try top capture the repeated yam, but try to capture the sense.

an6.28:7.2	Firstly, there’s a time when a mendicant’s heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire, and they don’t truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen. On that occasion they should go to an esteemed mendicant and say:	NA

an6.29:1.3	When he said this, Udāyī kept silent.	NA

an6.29:2.2	“Reverend Udāyī, the teacher is addressing you.”	NA
an6.29:2.3	“Reverend Ānanda, I hear the Buddha.	NA
an6.29:2.4	It’s when a mendicant recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	NA
an6.29:2.5	This is a topic for recollection.”	NA
an6.29:3.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda:	NA
an6.29:3.2	“Ānanda, I know that	NA
an6.29:3.3	this futile man Udāyī is not committed to the higher mind.	NA
an6.29:3.4	Ānanda, how many topics for recollection are there?”	NA
an6.29:4.1	“Sir, there are five topics for recollection.	BB describes Ananda’s unusual choice of five recollections as “ironic”. But it’s not ironic. Ananda is, of course, well aware of the basic teaching on the six recollections. He’s showing off, giving a more advanced teaching, one that he knows the Buddha will approve of. And the Buddha, as in a number of similar exchanges (see MN 123), brings him back down to earth by calling attention to the basic practice of mindfulness.
an6.29:4.2	What five?	NA
an6.29:4.3	Firstly, a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption.	NA
an6.29:4.4	When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to blissful meditation in this very life.	NA
an6.29:5.1	Furthermore, a mendicant focuses on the perception of light, focusing on the perception of day regardless of whether it’s night or day.	NA
an6.29:5.2	And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance.	NA
an6.29:5.3	When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to knowledge and vision.	NA
an6.29:6.1	Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth.	NA
an6.29:6.2	‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’	Here I note a few differences from BB’s list. Many of these are probably quite specialized terms, so using a few obscure terms is somewhat justified. Note that in some cases the exact definitions of these structures is vague and contested even in modern medicinal science. I have removed pleura as i think it is too specialized, I don’t see that the Pali must mean that particular set of membranes. For udariya see CPD. I use “feces” rather than excrement for karisa because, well, it has not been excreted. Synovial fluid is the correct term for lasika.
an6.29:6.3	When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to giving up sensual desire.	NA
an6.29:7.1	Furthermore, suppose a mendicant were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground. And it had been dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering.	NA
an6.29:7.2	They’d compare it with their own body:	NA
an6.29:7.3	‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’	NA
an6.29:8.1	Or suppose they were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, dogs, jackals, and many kinds of little creatures.	NA
an6.29:8.2	They’d compare it with their own body:	NA
an6.29:8.3	‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’	NA
an6.29:9.1	Furthermore, suppose they were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together by sinews …	NA
an6.29:9.2	A skeleton without flesh but smeared with blood, and held together by sinews …	NA
an6.29:9.3	A skeleton rid of flesh and blood, held together by sinews …	NA
an6.29:9.4	Bones rid of sinews scattered in every direction. Here a hand-bone, there a foot-bone, here a shin-bone, there a thigh-bone, here a hip-bone, there a rib-bone, here a back-bone, there an arm-bone, here a neck-bone, there a jaw-bone, here a tooth, there the skull … White bones, the color of shells … Decrepit bones, heaped in a pile … Bones rotted and crumbled to powder.	terovassika literally means “over a year”. But in SN 35.231 it’s used of a tree, which must be many decades old before become decrepit.
an6.29:9.5	They’d compare it with their own body:	NA
an6.29:9.6	‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’	NA
an6.29:9.7	When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to uprooting the conceit ‘I am’.	NA
an6.29:10.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
an6.29:10.2	When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to the penetration of many elements.	NA
an6.29:10.3	These are the five topics for recollection.”	NA
an6.29:11.1	“Good, good, Ānanda.	NA
an6.29:11.2	Well then, Ānanda, you should also remember this sixth topic for recollection.	NA
an6.29:11.3	In this case, a mendicant goes out mindfully, returns mindfully, stands mindfully, sits mindfully, lies down mindfully, and focuses on work mindfully.	NA
an6.29:11.4	When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to mindfulness and situational awareness.”	NA

an6.30:3.2	Some people go to hear the sound of drums, arched harps, singing, or a diverse spectrum of sounds; or ascetics and brahmins of wrong view and wrong practice.	Vina is usually translated as lute. But the ancient vina is more likely to be an instrument of the arched harp family. These are more closely derived from a bow. Arched harps are visible in several coins of Samudragupta, about 700 years after the Buddha. http://coinindia.com/galleries-samudragupta.html.

an6.34:0.3	With Mahāmoggallāna	NA
an6.34:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
an6.34:1.2	Then as Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	NA
an6.34:1.3	“Which gods know that they are	NA
an6.34:1.4	stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?”	NA
an6.34:1.5	Now, at that time a monk called Tissa had recently passed away and been reborn in a realm of divinity.	NA
an6.34:1.6	There they knew that	NA
an6.34:1.7	The divinity Tissa was very mighty and powerful.	NA
an6.34:2.1	And then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that realm of divinity.	NA
an6.34:2.2	Tissa saw Moggallāna coming off in the distance,	NA
an6.34:2.3	and said to him,	NA
an6.34:2.4	“Come, my good Moggallāna! Welcome, my good Moggallāna!	NA
an6.34:2.5	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.	NA
an6.34:2.6	Sit, my good Moggallāna, this seat is for you.”	This passage shows that the seat “prepared “or” made ready” doesn’t quite capture pannatta. It seems closer to the basic meaning of the word, “designated, appointed”. The point here is not that the gods had a seat ready for the Buddha all the time, but they were being polite by indicating which seat was for him.

an6.37:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
an6.37:1.2	Now at that time Veḷukaṇṭakī, Nanda’s mother, was preparing a religious donation with six factors for the mendicant Saṅgha headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna.	NA
an6.37:1.3	The Buddha saw her doing this, with his clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman,	NA

an6.37:1.5	“This Veḷukaṇṭakī, Nanda’s mother, is preparing a religious donation with six factors for the mendicant Saṅgha headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna.	NA
an6.37:2.1	And how does a religious donation have six factors?	NA
an6.37:2.2	Three factors apply to the donor and three to the recipients.	NA
an6.37:2.3	What three factors apply to the donor?	NA
an6.37:2.4	It’s when a donor is in a good mood before giving, while giving they feel confident, and after giving they’re uplifted.	The nuance in the terms for positive emotions here is interesting. sumana is a more general sense of well-being, good mood. Pasada comes in the act of doing. While attamana is the result of something. I render the latter more literally, sometimes it just means “pleased”, but it usually refers to an uplifting emotion that results from something positive.
an6.37:2.5	These three factors apply to the donor.	NA
an6.37:3.1	What three factors apply to the recipients?	NA
an6.37:3.2	It’s when the recipients are free of greed, hate, and delusion, or practicing to be free of them.	NA
an6.37:3.3	These three factors apply to the recipients.	NA
an6.37:3.4	Thus three factors apply to the donor and three to the recipients.	NA
an6.37:3.5	That’s how a religious donation has six factors.	NA
an6.37:4.1	It’s not easy to grasp the merit of such a six-factored donation by saying that	NA
an6.37:4.2	this is the extent of their overflowing merit, overflowing goodness that nurtures happiness and is conducive to heaven, ripening in happiness and leading to heaven. And it leads to what is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness.	NA
an6.37:4.3	It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.	NA
an6.37:5.1	It’s like trying to grasp how much water is in the ocean. It’s not easy to say	NA

an6.38:1.3	“Worthy Gotama, this is my doctrine and view:	NA
an6.38:1.4	One does not act of one’s own volition, nor does one act of another’s volition.”	BB has “there is no self-initiative; there is no initiative taken by others”. But I think this is unclear. Is it meant to imply that neither oneself has volition nor do others? If so, i don’t think this is what it means. It seems to me this is a statement of the classic problem of free will vs. determinism. Here it is denied that there is action from one’s own free will, “of one’s own volition”, as the standard idiom has it. Nor does one act by being instigated by others, (or, perhaps, by external conditions generally) i.e. the deterministic position.
an6.38:1.5	“Brahmin, may I never see or hear of anyone holding such a doctrine or view!	Obviously the Buddha has heard this view before. Text and commentary read _māhaṁ_, which with the aorist is prohibitive not negatory. It is an idiom expressing dislike.

an6.41:2.1	“If they wanted to, a mendicant with psychic powers who has mastered their mind could determine this tree trunk to be nothing but earth.	I think BB’s “might focus on as earth” is too weak. It’s no great feat to focus on a specific aspect of things and tune other aspects out. I can do it. Heck, anyone who gets absorbed in a TV show does it. Surely this means something rather more dramatic. Else why does it take a monk who is master of psychic powers? CPD has “to make a (magical) act of volition”, and while I would disagree that it’s magical, it’s at least getting there.
an6.41:2.2	Why is that?	NA
an6.41:2.3	Because the earth element exists in the tree trunk. Relying on that a mendicant with psychic powers could determine it to be nothing but earth.	NA

an6.42:1.8	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.

an6.42:5.1	Take a mendicant living within a village who I see sitting immersed in samādhi.	Contra Bodhi’s “outskirts of a village”, _gāmanta_ must mean “within a village”.

I use “village district” for _gāmakkhetta_, strictly “a village together with its fields”, and “neighborhood of a village” for _gāmasāmanta_.
an6.42:5.2	I think to myself:	NA

an6.43:2.3	“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the eastern gate to bathe.”	NA
an6.43:2.4	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
an6.43:2.5	So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the eastern gate to bathe.	NA
an6.43:2.6	When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying his limbs.	NA
an6.43:3.1	Now, at that time King Pasenadi had a giant bull elephant called “White”. It emerged from the eastern gate to the beating and playing of musical instruments.	NA
an6.43:3.2	When people saw it they said,	NA
an6.43:3.3	“The royal giant is so handsome! The royal giant is so good-looking! The royal giant is so lovely! The royal giant has such a huge body!”	BB includes the extra phrase “nago vata bho nago” here, however, it is absent from most editions so I don’t include it.
an6.43:3.4	When they said this, Venerable Udāyī said to the Buddha,	NA
an6.43:3.5	“Sir, is it only when they see elephants with such a huge, formidable body that people say:	NA
an6.43:3.6	‘A giant, such a giant’? Or do they say it when they see any other creatures with huge, formidable bodies?”	NA
an6.43:3.7	“Udāyī, when they see elephants with such a huge, formidable body people say:	NA
an6.43:3.8	‘A giant, such a giant!’	NA
an6.43:3.9	And also when they see a horse with a huge, formidable body …	NA
an6.43:3.10	When they see a bull with a huge, formidable body …	NA
an6.43:3.11	When they see a serpent with a huge, formidable body …	NA
an6.43:3.12	When they see a tree with a huge, formidable body …	NA
an6.43:3.13	And when they see a human being with such a huge, formidable body people say:	NA
an6.43:3.14	‘A giant, such a giant!’	NA
an6.43:3.15	But Udāyī, one who does nothing monstrous by way of body, speech, and mind is who I call a ‘giant’ in this world with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.”	By using monstrous I am trying to echo the pun in the text. Not very good, perhaps, but neither is the original!
an6.43:4.1	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	NA
an6.43:4.2	How well said this was by the Buddha:	NA
an6.43:4.3	‘But Udāyī, one who does nothing monstrous by way of body, speech, and mind is who I call a “giant” in this world with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.’	NA
an6.43:4.4	And I celebrate the well-spoken words of the Buddha with these verses:	NA
an6.43:5.1	Awakened as a human being,	My translation here follows, with a few adjustments, my earlier translation of Thag 15.2.

an6.43:6.1	Revered by people,	NA
an6.43:6.2	gone beyond all things,	NA
an6.43:6.3	even the gods revere him;	NA
an6.43:6.4	so I’ve heard from the perfected one.	NA
an6.43:7.1	He has transcended all fetters	NA
an6.43:7.2	and escaped from entanglements.	NA
an6.43:7.3	Delighting to renounce sensual pleasures,	NA
an6.43:7.4	he’s freed like lustrous gold from stone.	NA
an6.43:8.1	That giant outshines all,	NA
an6.43:8.2	like the Himalaya beside other mountains.	NA
an6.43:8.3	Of all those named ‘giant’,	NA
an6.43:8.4	he is truly named, supreme.	NA
an6.43:9.1	I shall extol the giant for you,	NA
an6.43:9.2	for he does nothing monstrous.	NA
an6.43:9.3	Sweetness and harmlessness	NA
an6.43:9.4	are two feet of the giant.	NA
an6.43:10.1	Fervor and chastity	NA
an6.43:10.2	are his two other feet.	NA
an6.43:10.3	Faith is the giant’s trunk,	NA

an6.43:11.1	Mindfulness is his neck, his head is wisdom—	NA
an6.43:11.2	inquiry and thinking about principles.	NA
an6.43:11.3	His belly is the sacred hearth of the Dhamma,	NA
an6.43:11.4	and his tail is seclusion.	NA
an6.43:12.1	Practicing absorption, enjoying the breath,	NA
an6.43:12.2	he is serene within.	NA
an6.43:12.3	The giant is serene when walking,	NA
an6.43:12.4	the giant is serene when standing,	NA
an6.43:13.1	the giant is serene when lying down,	NA
an6.43:13.2	and when sitting, the giant is serene.	NA
an6.43:13.3	The giant is restrained everywhere:	NA
an6.43:13.4	this is the accomplishment of the giant.	NA
an6.43:14.1	He eats blameless things,	NA
an6.43:14.2	he doesn’t eat blameworthy things.	NA
an6.43:14.3	When he gets food and clothes,	NA

an6.44:0.3	With Migasālā	NA
an6.44:1.1	Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the laywoman Migasālā, where he sat on the seat spread out.	NA
an6.44:1.2	Then the laywoman Migasālā went up to Ānanda, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
an6.44:2.1	“Honorable Ānanda, how on earth are we supposed to understand the teaching taught by the Buddha, when the chaste and the unchaste are both reborn in exactly the same place in the next life?	The repeated _kathaṁ_ with _nama_, followed also by _yatra hi nāma_, indicate a certain outrage.
an6.44:2.2	My father Purāṇa was chaste, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex.	NA
an6.44:2.3	When he passed away the Buddha declared that, since he was a once-returner, he was reborn in the host of joyful gods.	Manuscripts here and in [an10.75]() read _sakadāgāmipatto_ (“attained to the state of once-return”) or _sakadāgāmī satto_. The latter was evidently before the commentator, who glosses _sakadāgāmipuggalo_ (“once-return person”). I accept this reading, however I think _satto_ is a non-standard spelling of _santo_.
an6.44:2.4	But my uncle Isidatta was not chaste; he lived content with his wife.	Read _pettāpiyo_ “paternal uncle” (= Sanskrit _pitṛvya_).
an6.44:2.5	When he passed away the Buddha declared that, since he was also a once-returner, he was reborn in the host of joyful gods.	NA
an6.44:2.6	How on earth are we supposed to understand the teaching taught by the Buddha, when the chaste and the unchaste are both reborn in exactly the same place in the next life?”	NA
an6.44:2.7	“You’re right, sister, but that’s how the Buddha declared it.”	See BB’s note on this, with different interpretations offered by him and Brahmali. The exact phrase is also used in a rebirth context at AN 6.62, where it also expresses a certain ambiguity, as the monk is said to be foolish. Often evam’etam expresses an emphatic agreement “So it is!”. I think the kho pana inserted here is not just empty, but has qualifying sense. Remember, the replier in both cases is Ananda, who is very diplomatic. He’s supporting the questioner by affirming their knowledge, but expressing a certain hesitation about the motivation behind it.
an6.44:3.1	Then Ānanda, after receiving almsfood at Migasālā’s home, rose from his seat and left.	NA
an6.44:3.2	Then after the meal, on his return from almsround, Ānanda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	NA

an6.44:5.1	“Ānanda, who is this laywoman Migasālā, a foolish incompetent aunty, with an aunty’s wit? And who is it that knows how to assess individuals?	See BB’s note. This short passage is full of variants, grammatical problems, and the Chinese parallel lacks the misogynist parts. The word ammaka or ambaka means “mom, mummy”, and only occurs here and in the passage where Ambapali is called ammaka by the Licchavis. there it is clearly meant to pun with “mango”, confusing the situation even more. The Skt says that it is usually respectful, which is obviously not the case here. Perhaps we can use the modern Hinglish “auntie”.

His reading rests on slim grounds, being found in the Sinhalese texts only. Comm. reads vacisankhara, as does the Chinese parallel at SA 991: 口惡行 (akusala-vacisankhara). Moreover, I don’t think that reading makes sense. The context is speaking of mental qualities. I prefer the MN 44 explanation here: Pubbe kho, āvuso visākha, vitakketvā vicāretvā pacchā vācaṁ bhindati, tasmā vitakkavicārā vacīsaṅkhāro. The implied akusala is accepted from the Chinese.

an6.54:7.1	Then Venerable Dhammika took his bowl and robe and set out for Rājagaha.	NA
an6.54:7.2	Eventually he came to Rājagaha and the Vulture’s Peak. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	NA
an6.54:7.3	“So, Brahmin Dhammika, where have you come from?”	NA
an6.54:7.4	“Sir, I’ve been banished by the local lay followers from all seven monasteries in my native land.”	NA

an6.54:8.1	Once upon a time, some sea-merchants set sail for the ocean deeps, taking with them a land-spotting bird.	NA
an6.54:8.2	When their ship was out of sight of land, they released the bird.	NA
an6.54:8.3	It flew right away to the east, the west, the north, the south, upwards, and in-between.	NA
an6.54:8.4	If it saw land on any side, it went there and stayed.	NA
an6.54:8.5	But if it saw no land on any side it returned to the ship.	NA
an6.54:8.6	In the same way, now that you’ve been banished from all of those places, you have come to me.	NA
an6.54:9.1	Once upon a time, King Koravya had a royal banyan tree with five trunks called ‘Well Planted’. It was shady and lovely.	Here khandha refers to the secondary trunks rather than branches. BB uses “branch “and” section” for khandha, then “branch” again for sakha.
an6.54:9.2	Its canopy spread over twelve leagues, while the network of roots spread for five leagues.	The size is only moderately hyperbolic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thimmamma_Marrimanu
an6.54:9.3	Its fruits were as large as	NA
an6.54:9.4	a rice pot.	NA
an6.54:9.5	And they were as sweet as	NA
an6.54:9.6	pure wild honey.	NA
an6.54:9.7	The king and harem made use of one trunk, the troops another, the people of town and country another, ascetics and brahmins another, and beasts and birds another.	This story, a very rare specimen of extended narrative in the suttas, has the ring of a very old tale. Not only because of the folk beliefs it depends on, but the conceit of an entire kingdom living in one tree, no matter how large, sounds like a tribal society.
an6.54:9.8	No-one guarded the fruit, yet no-one damaged another’s fruits.	NA
an6.54:10.1	Then a certain person ate as much as he liked of the fruit, then broke off a branch and left.	NA
an6.54:10.2	Then the deity haunting the royal banyan tree thought,	Adhivattha is used virtually exclusively for a deva, and surely deserves a more elevated term than “live”. But we don’t have a positive word for “haunt”.
an6.54:10.3	‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!	NA
an6.54:10.4	How wicked this person is, to eat as much as they like, then break off a branch and leave! Why don’t I make sure that the royal banyan tree gives no fruit in future?’	NA
an6.54:10.5	Then the royal banyan tree gave no more fruit.	NA
an6.54:11.1	Then King Koravya went up to Sakka, lord of gods, and said to him,	NA
an6.54:11.2	‘Please good fellow, you should know that the royal banyan tree called Well Planted gives no fruit.’	The question mark in MS is incorrect. I have corrected it.
an6.54:11.3	Then Sakka used his psychic powers to will that a violent storm come. And it felled and uprooted the royal banyan tree.	Reading pātesi. This passage is the locus classic for the phrase: “that escalated quickly”.
an6.54:11.4	Then the deity haunting the tree stood to one side, miserable and sad, weeping, with a tearful face.	NA
an6.54:12.1	Then Sakka went up to that deity, and said,	NA
an6.54:12.2	‘Why, god, are you standing to one side, miserable and sad, weeping, with a tearful face?’	NA
an6.54:12.3	‘Because, my good fellow, a violent storm came and felled and uprooted my home.’	NA
an6.54:12.4	‘Well, did you stand by your tree’s duty when the storm came?’	NA
an6.54:12.5	‘But my good fellow, how does a tree stand by its duty?’	NA
an6.54:12.6	‘It’s when those who need the tree’s roots, bark, leaves, flowers, or fruit take what they need.	NA
an6.54:12.7	Yet the deity is not displeased or upset because of this.	NA
an6.54:12.8	This is how a tree stands by its duty.’	NA
an6.54:12.9	‘I was not standing by a tree’s duty when the storm came and felled and uprooted my home.’	NA
an6.54:12.10	‘God, if you were to stand by a tree’s duty, your home may be as it was before.’	Also not a question. I have corrected
an6.54:12.11	‘I will stand by a tree’s duty! May my home be as it was before!’	NA
an6.54:13.1	Then Sakka used his psychic power to will that a violent storm come. And it raised up that mighty banyan tree and the bark of the roots was healed.	NA
an6.54:13.2	In the same way, Brahmin Dhammika, were you standing by an ascetic’s duty when the local lay followers banished you from all seven of the monasteries in your native land?”	NA
an6.54:13.3	“But sir, how do I stand by an ascetic’s duty?”	NA
an6.54:13.4	“When someone abuses, annoys, or argues with an ascetic, the ascetic doesn’t abuse, annoy, or argue back at them.	NA
an6.54:13.5	That’s how an ascetic stands by an ascetic’s duty.”	NA
an6.54:13.6	“I was not standing by an ascetic’s duty when the local lay followers banished me from all seven of the monasteries in my native land.”	NA
an6.54:13.7	“Once upon a time, there was a Teacher called Sunetta. He was a religious founder and was free of desire for sensual pleasures.	For AN, BB has changed from “spiritual guide “to” founder of a spiritual sect” for titthakara. But the idiomatic usage seems to be “religious founders”.
an6.54:13.8	He had many hundreds of disciples.	NA
an6.54:13.9	He taught them the path to rebirth in the company of Divinity.	See BB’s note on this. the text seems corrupt, I give the apparent meaning.
an6.54:13.10	Those lacking confidence in Sunetta were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	NA
an6.54:13.11	Those full of confidence in Sunetta were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	NA
an6.54:14.1	Once upon a time there was a teacher called Mūgapakkha …	NA

an6.54:16.1	Kuddālaka …	NA
an6.54:17.1	Hatthipāla …	NA

an6.54:18.2	He had many hundreds of disciples.	NA
an6.54:18.3	He taught them the way to rebirth in the company of Divinity.	NA

an6.54:18.5	Those full of confidence in Jotipāla were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	NA
an6.54:19.1	What do you think, Brahmin Dhammika?	NA
an6.54:19.2	If someone with malicious intent were to abuse and insult these six teachers with their hundreds of followers, would they not create much wickedness?”	NA
an6.54:19.3	“Yes, sir.”	NA
an6.54:19.4	“They would indeed.	NA
an6.54:19.5	But someone who abuses and insults a single person accomplished in view with malicious intent creates even more wickedness.	NA
an6.54:19.6	Why is that?	NA
an6.54:19.7	Brahmin Dhammika, I say that any injury done by those outside of the Buddhist community does not compare with what is done to one’s own spiritual companions.	See BB’s note on this. It seems to me the sentence is following the previous sections and saying “In non-Buddhist communities, it is not possible to do such harm as it is in the Buddhist community when you harm your spiritual companions”. From BB’s translation, I think he is reading it as saying, “A Buddhist monastic cannot create harm against outsiders in the same way as they do for those in Buddhism.”
an6.54:19.8	So you should train like this:	NA
an6.54:19.9	‘We will have no malicious intent for those who we want to have as our spiritual companions.’	See BB’s note. I accept the most common reading in text and commentaries, “āmasabrahmacarisu”. This follows Edgerton: āmaPage 99, col 2 m., defined in ŚsP as = religious longings (lit. thirsts; could the word be connected with Skt. Lex. āma, m., disease? i.e. pathological state?): ŚsP 486.4–5 …mahāsattvasyāmaḥ; 7 āmaḥ, dharmatr̥ṣṇāḥ; 14–15, 22, etc., dharmatr̥ṣṇā āmaḥ. See s.v. mūdhāma. I think Dhammika was not a monk, but hoping to be one.

an6.55:0.2	6. The Great Chapter	NA
an6.55:0.3	With Soṇa	NA
an6.55:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
an6.55:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.	NA
an6.55:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Soṇa was staying near Rājagaha in the Cool Grove.	NA
an6.55:1.4	Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	NA
an6.55:1.5	“I am one of the Buddha’s most energetic disciples.	NA
an6.55:1.6	Yet my mind is not freed from defilements by not grasping. But my family has wealth. I could enjoy that wealth and make merit.	NA
an6.55:1.7	Why don’t I resign the training and return to a lesser life, so I can enjoy my wealth and make merit?”	NA
an6.55:2.1	Then the Buddha knew what Venerable Soṇa was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Vulture’s Peak and reappeared in the Cool Grove in front of Soṇa,	NA
an6.55:2.2	and sat on the seat spread out.	NA
an6.55:2.3	Soṇa bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.	NA
an6.55:2.4	The Buddha said to him,	NA
an6.55:3.1	“Soṇa, as you were in private retreat didn’t this thought come to your mind:	NA
an6.55:3.2	‘I am one of the Buddha’s most energetic disciples.	NA
an6.55:3.3	Yet my mind is not freed from defilements by not grasping. But my family has wealth. I could enjoy that wealth and make merit.	NA
an6.55:3.4	Why don’t I resign the training and return to a lesser life, so I can enjoy my wealth and make merit?’”	NA
an6.55:3.5	“Yes, sir.”	NA
an6.55:4.1	“What do you think, Soṇa?	NA
an6.55:4.2	When you were still a layman, weren’t you a good player of the arched harp?”	NA
an6.55:4.3	“Yes, sir.”	NA
an6.55:4.4	“When your harp’s strings were tuned too tight, was it resonant and playable?”	See discussion here: https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/on-so-a-and-tuning-instruments/2684 Also note that _kammaññā_ here wouldn’t really mean “easy to play”. A harp, unlike a guitar, doesn’t get harder to play if the strings are tight. It means “playable” as in “responsive, does what it should do”.
an6.55:4.5	“No, sir.”	NA
an6.55:5.1	“When your harp’s strings were tuned too slack, was it resonant and playable?”	NA
an6.55:5.2	“No, sir.”	NA
an6.55:6.1	“But when your harp’s strings were tuned neither too tight nor too slack, but fixed at an even tension, was it resonant and playable?”	I am not sure what guna means in this context. DOP says “string of a musical instrument” for this context, but why not continue using tanti for this? BB does not use string, but has “balanced pitch”, and I am unsure if he is explicitly rendering guna as “pitch” or merely translating the overall sense. “Pitch” would seem to be a possible reading for guna, but i can’t find it attested anywhere. The normal word would be yama. Perhaps it is simply a more vague phrase, “fixed at an even quality”.
an6.55:6.2	“Yes, sir.”	NA
an6.55:7.1	“In the same way, Soṇa, when energy is too forceful it leads to restlessness. When energy is too slack it leads to laziness.	NA
an6.55:7.2	So, Soṇa, you should focus on energy and serenity, find a balance of the faculties, and learn the pattern of this situation.”	I think BB’s “balanced” is wrong for samatha. It occurs very commonly, of course, and it always means “settle”, not “balance”. Moreover at AN 6.116 we have Uddhaccassa pahānāya samatho bhāvetabbo, which repeates a familiar theme, that samatha abandons restlessness, i.e. the problem mentioned in the previous sentence. So I take it as a dvanda with samatha in its normal meaning. And as always, nimitta never means “object” or anything like it. This phrase means that one should understand this principle in terms of cause and effect, so that you know what to do.
an6.55:7.3	“Yes, sir,” Soṇa replied.	NA
an6.55:7.4	After advising Soṇa like this, the Buddha, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Cool Grove and reappeared on the Vulture’s Peak.	NA
an6.55:8.1	After some time Soṇa focused on energy and serenity, found a balance of the faculties, and learned the pattern of this situation.	NA
an6.55:8.2	Then Soṇa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
an6.55:8.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	NA
an6.55:8.4	And Venerable Soṇa became one of the perfected.	NA
an6.55:9.1	Then, when Soṇa had attained perfection, he thought,	NA
an6.55:9.2	“Why don’t I go to the Buddha and declare my enlightenment in his presence?”	NA
an6.55:9.3	Then Soṇa went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	NA
an6.55:10.1	“Sir, a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—is dedicated to six things.	NA
an6.55:10.2	They are dedicated to renunciation, seclusion, kindness, the ending of craving, the ending of grasping, and mental clarity.	NA
an6.55:11.1	It may be, sir, that one of the venerables here thinks:	NA
an6.55:11.2	‘Maybe this venerable is dedicated to renunciation solely out of mere faith.’	saddhamattaka is consistently used in a diminutive sense, “mere faith”, as contrasted with saddhamatta “a degree of faith”. The latter is sufficient for one to progress in the path (MN 22, SN 55.24), but with the former one just gets by (MN 65).
an6.55:11.3	But it should not be seen like this.	NA
an6.55:11.4	A mendicant with defilements ended does not see in themselves anything more to do, or anything that needs improvement. They’re dedicated to renunciation because they’re free of greed, hate, and delusion with the end of greed, hate, and delusion.	NA

an6.56:0.3	With Phagguna	NA
an6.56:1.1	Now at that time Venerable Phagguna was sick, suffering, gravely ill.	NA
an6.56:1.2	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	NA
an6.56:1.3	“Sir, Venerable Phagguna is sick.	NA
an6.56:1.4	Sir, please go to Venerable Phagguna out of sympathy.”	NA
an6.56:1.5	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
an6.56:1.6	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to Venerable Phagguna.	NA
an6.56:1.7	Venerable Phagguna saw the Buddha coming off in the distance	NA

an6.56:2.2	“Sir, I’m not keeping well, I’m not getting by. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.	NA
an6.56:3.1	The winds piercing my head are so severe, it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp point.	abhimattha is used in the simile of the fire-sticks, where it can only mean “drill”.

an6.56:4.1	The pain in my head is so severe, it feels like a strong man tightening a tough leather strap around my head.	NA
an6.56:4.2	I’m not keeping well.	NA

an6.56:5.2	I’m not keeping well.	NA

an6.56:9.3	Firstly, take the case of a mendicant whose mind is not freed from the five lower fetters.	NA
an6.56:9.4	At the time of death they get to see the Realized One.	NA
an6.56:9.5	The Realized One proclaims a teaching to them that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA

an6.56:11.5	This is the third benefit of listening to the teaching.	NA

an6.57:0.3	The Six Classes of Rebirth	NA
an6.57:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.	NA
an6.57:1.2	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	NA
an6.57:1.3	“Sir, Pūraṇa Kassapa describes six classes of rebirth:	“Classes” alone does not capture the sense of abhijati, i.e. rebirth into a class.
an6.57:1.4	black, blue, red, yellow, white, and ultimate white.	NA
an6.57:2.1	The black class of rebirth consists of slaughterers of sheep, pigs, poultry, or deer, hunters or fishers, bandits, executioners, butchers of cattle, jailers, and any others with a cruel livelihood.	NA
an6.57:3.1	The blue class of rebirth consists of mendicants whose life is thorny, and any others who teach the efficacy of deeds and action.	These _bhikkhus_ may well have been Buddhist mendicants, but the reference to _kaṇṭakavuttikā_ is unclear. Compare _kasiravuttike_  in the sense “those whose life is tough” (eg. [an6.57:11.2]()), which suggests the sense, “those whose life is thorny”. Alternatively, Basham (*History and Doctrine of the Ājīvikas*, page 139) renders _kaṇṭaka_ as “thieves”, evidently following Manu 9.256–260, which describes various “thorns” (i.e. “pests”) as thieves, etc. Perhaps it means “those who are thorns in our sides”.
an6.57:4.1	The red class of rebirth consists of the Jain ascetics who wear one cloth.	NA
an6.57:5.1	The yellow class of rebirth consists of the lay people dressed in white who are disciples of the naked ascetics.	NA
an6.57:6.1	The white class of rebirth consists of male and female Ājīvaka ascetics.	NA
an6.57:7.1	And the ultimate white class of rebirth consists of Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saṅkicca, and the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla.	NA
an6.57:8.1	These are the six classes of rebirth that Pūraṇa Kassapa describes.”	NA
an6.57:9.1	“But Ānanda, did the whole world authorize Pūraṇa Kassapa to describe these six classes of rebirth?”	NA
an6.57:9.2	“No, sir.”	NA
an6.57:9.3	“It’s as if they were to force a chop on a poor, penniless person, telling them, ‘Eat this meat and pay for it!’	NA
an6.57:9.4	In the same way, Pūraṇa Kassapa has described these six classes of rebirth without the consent of those ascetics and brahmins. And he has done so in a foolish, incompetent, unskilled way, lacking common sense.	NA
an6.57:10.1	I, however, also describe six classes of rebirth.	NA
an6.57:10.2	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
an6.57:10.3	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
an6.57:10.4	The Buddha said this:	NA
an6.57:10.5	“And what, Ānanda, are the six classes of rebirth?	NA
an6.57:10.6	Someone born into a dark class gives rise to a dark result.	NA

an6.57:11.2	It’s when someone is reborn in a low family—a family of corpse-workers, bamboo-workers, hunters, chariot-makers, or scavengers—poor, with little to eat or drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find.	NA
an6.57:11.3	And they’re ugly, unsightly, deformed, sickly—one-eyed, crippled, lame, or half-paralyzed. They don’t get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting.	NA
an6.57:11.4	And they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.	NA

an6.59:1.5	“It does, sir.	NA
an6.59:1.6	Gifts are given to those mendicants who are perfected or on the path to perfection; they live in the wilderness, eat only almsfood, and wear rag robes.”	NA
an6.59:2.1	“Householder, as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures, living at home with your children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, fragrance, and makeup, and accepting gold and currency, it’s hard for you to know who is perfected or on the path to perfection.	BB has “receive” for sadiyeyya, probably influenced by the Vinaya meaning. However the root is “sata”, which clearly means to “enjoy, take pleasure”, and the contexts it is used in in the suttas, such as this, suggest that this nuance is still applicable. To “receive” money is, rather, patiggahana.

an6.60:2.3	But when they’re separated from the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role, they mix closely with monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; with rulers and their chief ministers, and with monastics of other religions and their disciples.	NA

an6.61:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana.	NA
an6.61:1.3	Now at that time, after the meal, on return from almsround, several senior mendicants sat together in the pavilion and this discussion came up among them,	NA
an6.61:1.4	“Reverends, this was said by the Buddha in ‘The Way to the Far Shore’, in ‘The Questions of Metteyya’:	NA
an6.61:2.1	‘The thoughtful one who has known both ends,	In the Pārāyana, this uses the demonstrative _so_, calling back to the previous verse, which here is not quoted.

an6.61:3.1	But what is one end? What’s the second end? What’s the middle? And who is the seamstress?”	NA
an6.61:3.2	When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:	NA
an6.61:3.3	“Contact, reverends, is one end. The origin of contact is the second end. The cessation of contact is the middle. And craving is the seamstress,	NA
an6.61:3.4	for craving weaves one to being reborn in one state of existence or another.	NA
an6.61:3.5	That’s how a mendicant directly knows what should be directly known and completely understands what should be completely understood. Knowing and understanding thus they make an end of suffering in this very life.”	NA
an6.61:4.1	When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:	NA

an6.61:5.3	NA	NA
an6.61:5.4	That’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.”	NA
an6.61:6.1	When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:	NA
an6.61:6.2	“Name, reverends, is one end. Form is the second end. Consciousness is the middle. And craving is the seamstress …	NA
an6.61:6.3	NA	NA
an6.61:6.4	That’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.”	NA

an6.61:7.4	That’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.”	NA
an6.61:8.1	When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:	NA
an6.61:8.2	“Substantial reality, reverends, is one end. The origin of substantial reality is the second end. The cessation of substantial reality is the middle. And craving is the seamstress,	NA

an6.61:9.4	As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”	NA
an6.61:10.1	“Yes, reverend,” those senior mendicants replied.	NA
an6.61:10.2	Then those senior mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,	NA
an6.61:10.3	and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed. They asked,	NA
an6.61:10.4	“Sir, who has spoken well?”	NA
an6.61:10.5	“Mendicants, you’ve all spoken well in a way. However, this is what I was referring to in ‘The Way to the Far Shore’, in ‘The Questions of Metteyya’ when I said:	NA

an6.61:12.1	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
an6.61:12.2	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA

an6.62:1.3	The Buddha left the road and sat at the root of a tree on the seat spread out.	NA
an6.62:1.4	The mendicants entered Daṇḍakappaka to look for a guest house.	NA
an6.62:2.1	Then Venerable Ānanda together with several mendicants went to the Aciravatī River to bathe.	NA
an6.62:2.2	When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying his limbs.	NA
an6.62:2.3	Then a certain mendicant went up to Venerable Ānanda, and said to him,	NA
an6.62:2.4	“Reverend Ānanda, when the Buddha declared that Devadatta was	NA
an6.62:2.5	going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable, did he do so after wholeheartedly deliberating, or was this just a way of speaking?”	NA
an6.62:2.6	“You’re right, reverend, that’s how the Buddha declared it.”	NA

an6.62:4.3	I do not see a single other person about whom I have given such whole-hearted deliberation before making a declaration as I did in the case of Devadatta.	NA
an6.62:4.4	As long as I saw even a fraction of a hair’s tip of goodness in Devadatta	NA

an6.62:5.1	Suppose there was a sewer deeper than a man’s height, full to the brim with feces,	NA

an6.62:5.8	If you would all listen, Ānanda, I will analyze the Realized One’s knowledges of the faculties of persons.”	This specific phrasing is shared with [mn136:6.15](), which is also a case where a junior monk has made a silly statement. There MS has _vibhajantassa_ (“for the analyzing”). The commentary does not explicitly comment on this phrase, but the Majjhima commentary does say that the Buddha thought, “I will make it clear for the mendicant Saṅgha” (_bhikkhusaṅghassa pākaṭaṁ karissāmīti_), which implies that it was reading the future tense.
an6.62:6.1	“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!	NA
an6.62:6.2	Let the Buddha analyze the faculties of persons. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	NA

an6.64:1.3	Firstly, the Realized One truly understands the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible.	NA
an6.64:1.4	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.	Note that text here switches from yehi samannagato to yam agamma, a shift that appears to have been overlooked in BB’s translation.

an6.64:3.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …	NA
an6.64:4.1	Furthermore, the Realized One recollects many kinds of past lives.

He remembers: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so he recollects his many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	NA
an6.64:4.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …	NA
an6.64:5.1	Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Realized One sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	NA
an6.64:5.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …	NA
an6.64:6.1	Furthermore, the Realized One has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And he lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.	NA

Being bright and clever. Enthusiasm for skillful qualities.	BB has “sphere of the noble ones” for ariyatane. Contextually, the phrase could either look back to the former phrases, in which it would be spiritual, or forward to the following phrases, in which case it would be a more ordinary meaning. Ariya in the sense of “civilized” is rare. But at KD6, DN 16, Ud 8.6 we have: Yāvatā, ānanda, ariyaṁ āyatanaṁ, yāvatā vaṇippatho, idaṁ agganagaraṁ bhavissati pāṭaliputtaṁ. Here it must mean “civilized regions, trade routes”. Also note the grammar here, i.e. not ariyassa (or ariyanam) āyatana as required by BB’s translation.

an7.7:1.1	Then Ugga the government chief minister went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA

an7.7:2.2	Migāra of Rohaṇa is so rich, so very wealthy.”	NA
an7.7:2.3	“But Ugga, how rich is he?”	NA
an7.7:2.4	“He has a hundred thousand gold coins, not to mention the silver coins!”	BB’s “units of minted gold” is a terribly artificial idiom for a common term. Despite occurring frequently, there is little in the suttas to distinguish hiranna from suvanna. However Mnd 1 says hiraññaṁ vuccati kahāpaṇoti. On the whole, suvanna seems to be used widely for natural gold and golden things, hiranna is less common and is most characteristically used, as here, when reckoning wealth, eg Cīvaracetāpannaṁ nāma hiraññaṁ vā suvaṇṇaṁ vā muttā vā maṇi vā; Natthi me, āvuso, hiraññassa paṭivīso, nāhaṁ hiraññaṁ sādiyāmī; Khettaṁ vatthuṁ hiraññaṁ vā, gavāssaṁ dāsaporisaṁ; Asīti sakaṭavāhānaṁ, hiraññassa ahosi me; Pahūtaṁ me jātarūpaṁ, muttā veḷuriyā; Vaṇijjā tādisī natthi, hiraññena kayākayaṁ; Na pasū brāhmaṇānāsuṁ, na hiraññaṁ na dhāniyaṁ. However, also consider the Hirannavati River, i.e. river with gold (nuggets or dust).

an7.22:12.2	How much more so all seven!	NA
an7.22:12.3	King Ajātasattu cannot defeat the Vajjis in war, unless by bribery or by sowing dissension.	_Upalāpana_ is used a number of times in the Vinaya, where it always has the sense of giving someone something to get them to do what you want.

an7.22:12.4	Well, now, worthy Gotama, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.”	NA
an7.22:12.5	“Please, brahmin, go at your convenience.”	NA

I don’t think BB’s “looking for rewards” is quite right for _sannidhipekho_. A reward is something that you get, but this refers to keeping what you’ve got. _sannidhi_ means to store up, and as the next phrase makes clear, it means you’re not really giving so much as investing. I think this is a significant difference between this and the teaching on kamma.

an7.52:6.2	But they give a gift thinking, ‘It’s good to give’ …	Curiously, the text does not specify the results of giving in the abbreviated versions. It skips up to rebirth in the Brahma realm for the last one. Presumably each grade of giving would get you one level higher in the celestial hierarchy. The numbers work out, but the logic is dubious. Is giving because it is good less virtuous than doing so because of wanting to follow the example of some Vedic seers? There’s no comment on this in Comm, BB, or Hare.

It might refer to the glorious results of merit, for which compare Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.2, “endowed with that [divine fruit for which he wished] he flourishes (_tena sampanno mahīyate_). Or else it might invoke the idea that merit flourishes depending on the recipient, like a seed on the earth (_mahī_; cp. _puññakkhetta_).

an7.61:0.3	Nodding Off	NA
an7.61:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
an7.61:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.	NA
an7.61:1.3	Now at that time, in the land of the Magadhans near Kallavāḷamutta Village, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was nodding off while meditating.	It’s curious name, with many variants. I wonder whether it stands for kālavāḷaputta, the “son of the black monster”. It was common for villages to be named after the local deity who had a shrine there, eg Alavi. Children were, it seems, offered to some of the darker deities.
an7.61:1.4	The Buddha saw him with his clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman.	NA
an7.61:1.5	NA	NA
an7.61:1.6	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood in the land of the Bhaggas and reappeared in front of Mahāmoggallāna near Kallavāḷamutta Village in the land of the Magadhans.	NA
an7.61:1.7	He sat on the seat spread out	NA
an7.61:1.8	and said to Mahāmoggallāna,	NA
an7.61:2.1	“Are you nodding off, Moggallāna? Are you nodding off?”	NA
an7.61:2.2	“Yes, sir.”	NA
an7.61:2.3	“So, Moggallāna, don’t focus on or cultivate the perception that you were meditating on when you fell drowsy.	NA
an7.61:2.4	It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way.	NA
an7.61:3.1	But what if that doesn’t work? Then think about and consider the teaching as you’ve learned and memorized it, examining it with your mind.	NA
an7.61:3.2	It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way.	NA
an7.61:4.1	But what if that doesn’t work? Then recite in detail the teaching as you’ve learned and memorized it.	NA
an7.61:4.2	It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way.	NA
an7.61:5.1	But what if that doesn’t work? Then pinch your ears and rub your limbs.	NA
an7.61:5.2	It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way.	NA
an7.61:6.1	But what if that doesn’t work? Then get up from your seat, flush your eyes with water, look around in every direction, and look up at the stars and constellations.	NA
an7.61:6.2	It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way.	NA
an7.61:7.1	But what if that doesn’t work? Then apply your mind to the perception of light, focusing on the perception of day:	NA
an7.61:7.2	as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.	NA
an7.61:7.3	And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, develop a mind that’s full of radiance.	NA
an7.61:7.4	It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way.	NA
an7.61:8.1	But what if that doesn’t work? Then walk mindfully, focusing on the perception of before and behind, your faculties directed inwards and your mind not scattered outside.	https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/therigatha-translation-questions/34761/38?u=sujato
an7.61:8.2	It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way.	NA
an7.61:9.1	But what if that doesn’t work? Then lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.	NA
an7.61:9.2	When you wake, you should get up quickly, thinking:	NA
an7.61:9.3	‘I will not live indulging in the pleasures of sleeping, lying down, and drowsing.’	NA
an7.61:9.4	That’s how you should train.	NA
an7.61:10.1	So you should train like this:	NA
an7.61:10.2	‘I will not approach families with my head swollen with vanity.’	Bb uses a nice phrase for this very idiomatic phrase. But I’m not sure why he uses the plural here.
an7.61:10.3	That’s how you should train.	NA
an7.61:10.4	What happens if a mendicant approaches families with a head swollen with vanity? Well, families have business to attend to,	NA
an7.61:10.5	so people might not notice when a mendicant arrives. In that case the mendicant thinks:	NA
an7.61:10.6	‘Who on earth has turned this family against me? It seems they don’t like me any more.’	NA
an7.61:10.7	And so, because they don’t get anything they feel dismayed. Being dismayed, they become restless. Being restless, they lose restraint. And without restraint the mind is far from immersion.	NA
an7.61:11.1	So you should train like this:	NA
an7.61:11.2	‘I won’t get into arguments.’	NA
an7.61:11.3	That’s how you should train.	NA
an7.61:11.4	When there’s an argument, you can expect there’ll be lots of talking. When there’s lots of talking, people become restless. Being restless, they lose restraint. And without restraint the mind is far from immersion.	NA
an7.61:11.5	Moggallāna, I don’t praise all kinds of closeness.	NA
an7.61:11.6	Nor do I criticize all kinds of closeness.	BB’s phrasing here “bonding with no-one at all” doesn’t fit with the explanation, where it is places that are mentioned, not people.
an7.61:11.7	I don’t praise closeness with laypeople and renunciates.	NA
an7.61:11.8	I do praise closeness with those lodgings that are quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat.”	NA
an7.61:12.1	When he said this, Venerable Moggallāna asked the Buddha,	NA
an7.61:12.2	“Sir, how do you briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans?”	NA
an7.61:13.1	“Take a mendicant who has heard:	NA
an7.61:13.2	‘Nothing is worth insisting on.’	NA
an7.61:13.3	When a mendicant has heard that	NA
an7.61:13.4	nothing is worth insisting on,	NA
an7.61:13.5	they directly know all things. Directly knowing all things, they completely understand all things. Completely understanding all things, when they experience any kind of feeling—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—	NA
an7.61:13.6	they meditate observing impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in those feelings.	NA
an7.61:13.7	Meditating in this way, they don’t grasp at anything in the world.	NA
an7.61:13.8	Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.	NA
an7.61:13.9	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’	NA
an7.61:13.10	That’s how I briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans.”	NA

an7.63:1.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, where he sat on the seat spread out.	NA
an7.63:1.2	Now at that time people in Anāthapiṇḍika’s home were making a dreadful racket.	NA
an7.63:1.3	Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	NA
an7.63:2.1	“Householder, what’s with the people making that dreadful racket in your home? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”	NA
an7.63:2.2	“Sir, that’s my daughter-in-law Sujātā. She’s been brought here from a wealthy family.	Note BB follow’s PTS reading of an extra addha.
an7.63:2.3	She doesn’t obey her mother-in-law or father-in-law or her husband. And she does not honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Buddha.”	The politics of the relations here are important. The word used is adiyati. This is used in the same sense in DN 32, where it refers to yakkhas rebelling against the gods, or bandits rebelling against the king. So “obey” seems fine, perhaps we could use “submit”. Note that this is not a general problem, but specifically living under another’s roof. Note too that the relation with the Buddha is of respect, not obedience, and it is this that actually works!
an7.63:3.1	Then the Buddha addressed Sujātā, saying,	NA
an7.63:3.2	“Come, Sujātā.”	Note the Buddha’s usual style: deal directly with the person themselves in a respectful manner.
an7.63:3.3	“Yes, sir,” she replied. She went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to her:	NA

an7.64:1.5	Why is that?	NA
an7.64:1.6	Because an enemy doesn’t like to have a beautiful enemy.	NA
an7.64:1.7	An irritable individual, overcome and overwhelmed by anger, is ugly, even though they’re nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed, and wearing white clothes.

an7.64:3.3	Why is that?	NA
an7.64:3.4	Because an enemy doesn’t like to have an enemy whose needs are amply satisfied.	NA

BB has “When an angry person causes damage/whether easily or with difficulty”, Nyanamoli has “Someone a man in anger hurts;/But, when his anger is later spent/With difficulty or with ease,”. But can we take viya to mean vā? Ṭhānissaro has “He takes pleasure in bad deeds as if they were good,” evidently following Hare in reading uparoceti “A man in wrath finds pleasure in bad deeds/as in good deeds.”

an7.66:10.2	this earth and Sineru, king of mountains, will burn and crumble and be no more, except for one who has seen the truth?	NA
an7.66:11.1	Once upon a time, there was a teacher called Sunetta. He was a religious founder and was free of desire for sensual pleasures.	NA
an7.66:11.2	He had many hundreds of disciples.	NA
an7.66:11.3	He taught them the path to rebirth in the company of Divinity.	NA
an7.66:11.4	Those who totally understood Sunetta’s teachings were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, the company of Divinity.	NA
an7.66:11.5	Of those who didn’t totally understand Sunetta’s teachings, some—when their body broke up, after death—were reborn in the company of the gods who control what is imagined by others. Some were reborn in the company of the gods who love to imagine, some with the joyful gods, some with the gods of Yama, some with the gods of the thirty-three, and some with the gods of the four great kings. Some were reborn in the company of well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders.	NA
an7.66:12.1	Then the teacher Sunetta thought:	NA
an7.66:12.2	‘It’s not proper for me to be reborn in the next life in exactly the same place as my disciples. Why don’t I further develop love?’	BB (original edition) has a typo here, the close quote is omitted.
an7.66:13.1	Then Sunetta developed love for seven years.	NA
an7.66:13.2	Having done so he did not return to this world for seven eons of cosmic expansion and contraction.	NA
an7.66:13.3	As the cosmos contracted he went to the realm of streaming radiance.	NA
an7.66:13.4	As it expanded he was reborn in an empty mansion of divinity.	NA
an7.66:13.5	There he was the Divinity, the Great Divinity, the vanquisher, the unvanquished, the universal seer, the wielder of power.	NA
an7.66:13.6	He was Sakka, lord of gods, thirty-six times.	NA
an7.66:13.7	Many hundreds of times he was a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extended to all four sides, he achieved stability in the country, and he possessed the seven treasures.	NA
an7.66:13.8	He had over a thousand sons who were valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.	NA
an7.66:13.9	After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigned by principle, without rod or sword.	NA
an7.66:13.10	Yet even though Sunetta lived so long, he was not exempt from	NA
an7.66:13.11	rebirth, old age, and death. He was not exempt from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress, I say.	NA
an7.66:14.1	Why is that?	NA
an7.66:14.2	Because of not understanding and not penetrating four things.	NA
an7.66:14.3	What four?	NA
an7.66:14.4	Noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom.	NA
an7.66:14.5	These noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom have been understood and comprehended. Craving for continued existence has been cut off; the conduit to rebirth is ended; now there’ll be no more future lives.”	NA
an7.66:14.6	That is what the Buddha said.	NA

an7.70:1.1	Then as Venerable Sāriputta was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	NA
an7.70:1.2	“What should a mendicant honor and respect and rely on, to give up the unskillful and develop the skillful?”	Throughout this sutta, text punctuates as if bhikkhu was a vocative, sariputta talking to himself. However compare AN 4.21, where it is the nominative, as translated by BB.

an7.70:2.4	Suppose a man were to acquire a gold ingot, pure and bright.	I don’t think BB’s “nugget” for nikkha is correct.

an7.70:2.6	‘My gold ingot is pure and bright. Why don’t I take it to show the smiths?	NA

an7.74:1.1	“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a Teacher called Araka. He was a religious founder and was free of desire for sensual pleasures.	Was he a Jain? https://www.academia.edu/35616096/Jain_Shade_in_Early_Buddhism_with_reference_to_the_Araka_Sutta_in_the_A%E1%B9%85guttara_Nik%C4%81ya He may be the Adraka (addaijja?) of Isibhasiyam https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.322298/page/115/mode/2up https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aranatha
an7.74:1.2	He had many hundreds of disciples,	NA
an7.74:1.3	and he taught them like this:	NA
an7.74:1.4	‘Brahmins, life as a human is short, brief, and fleeting, full of suffering and distress. Be thoughtful and wake up! Do what’s good and lead the spiritual life, for no-one born can escape death.	The vocative _brāhmaṇa_ is singular, but i must be used in a plural sense. The online BJT edition has _brāhmaṇā_.
an7.74:2.1	It’s like a drop of dew on a grass tip. When the sun comes up it quickly evaporates and doesn’t last long.	NA
an7.74:2.2	In the same way, life as a human is like a dewdrop. It’s brief and fleeting, full of suffering and distress. Be thoughtful and wake up! Do what’s good and lead the spiritual life, for no-one born can escape death.	NA
an7.74:3.1	It’s like when the heavens rain heavily. The bubbles quickly vanish and don’t last long.	NA
an7.74:3.2	In the same way, life as a human is like a bubble. …	NA
an7.74:4.1	It’s like a line drawn in water. It vanishes quickly and doesn’t last long.	NA
an7.74:4.2	In the same way, life as a human is like a line drawn in water. …	NA
an7.74:4.3	NA	NA
an7.74:5.1	It’s like a mountain river traveling far, flowing fast, carrying all before it. It doesn’t turn back—not for a moment, a second, an hour—but runs, rolls, and flows on.	NA
an7.74:5.2	In the same way, life as a human is like a mountain river. …	NA
an7.74:5.3	NA	NA
an7.74:6.1	It’s like a strong man who has formed a glob of spit on the tip of his tongue. He could easily spit it out.	NA
an7.74:6.2	In the same way, life as a human is like a glob of spit. …	NA
an7.74:6.3	NA	NA
an7.74:7.1	Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day. If you tossed a scrap of meat in, it would quickly vanish and not last long.	NA
an7.74:7.2	In the same way, life as a human is like a scrap of meat. …	NA
an7.74:7.3	NA	NA
an7.74:8.1	It’s like a cow being led to the slaughterhouse. With every step she comes closer to the slaughter, closer to death.	NA
an7.74:8.2	In the same way, life as a human is like a cow being slaughtered. It’s brief and fleeting, full of suffering and distress. Be thoughtful and wake up! Do what’s good and lead the spiritual life, for no-one born can escape death.’	NA
an7.74:9.1	Now, mendicants, at that time human beings had a lifespan of 60,000 years. Girls could be married at 500 years of age.	NA
an7.74:9.2	And human beings only had six afflictions:	NA
an7.74:9.3	cold, heat, hunger, thirst, and the need to defecate and urinate.	NA
an7.74:9.4	But even though humans were so long-lived with so few afflictions, Araka still taught in this way:	NA
an7.74:9.5	‘Life as a human is short, brief, and fleeting, full of suffering and distress. Be thoughtful and wake up! Do what’s good and lead the spiritual life, for no-one born can escape death.’	NA
an7.74:10.1	These days it’d be right to say:	NA
an7.74:10.2	‘Life as a human is short, brief, and fleeting, full of suffering and distress. Be thoughtful and wake up! Do what’s good and lead the spiritual life, for no-one born can escape death.’	NA
an7.74:10.3	For these days a long life is a hundred years or a little more.	NA
an7.74:10.4	Living for a hundred years, there are just three hundred seasons,	NA
an7.74:10.5	a hundred each of the winter, summer, and rains.	NA
an7.74:10.6	Living for three hundred seasons, there are just twelve hundred months,	NA
an7.74:10.7	four hundred in each of the winter, summer, and rains.	NA
an7.74:10.8	Living for twelve hundred months, there are just twenty-four hundred fortnights,	NA
an7.74:10.9	eight hundred in each of the winter, summer, and rains.	NA
an7.74:10.10	Living for 2,400 fortnights, there are just 36,000 days,	NA
an7.74:10.11	12,000 in each of the summer, winter, and rains.	NA
an7.74:10.12	Living for 36,000 days, you just eat 72,000 meals,	NA
an7.74:10.13	24,000 in each of the summer, winter, and rains, including when you’re suckling at the breast, and when you’re prevented from eating.	NA
an7.74:11.1	Things that prevent you from eating include anger, pain, sickness, sabbath, or being unable to get food.	NA
an7.74:11.2	So mendicants, for a human being with a hundred years lifespan I have counted the lifespan, the limit of the lifespan, the seasons, the years, the months, the fortnights, the nights, the days, the meals, and the things that prevent them from eating.	NA
an7.74:11.3	Out of sympathy, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples.	NA
an7.74:11.4	Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, mendicants! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.”	NA

an7.76:1.3	They know what is an offense.	The commentarial explanation for this stock passage on the patimokkhas, as quoted by BB, is somewhat misleading and anachronistic. It is clearly inappropriate to invoke the Khandhakas and Parivara here, the latter as it is late, and the former since the context is explicitly the patimokkhas. In this context “sutta” definitely means the list of “150” patimokkha rules. The anubyanjana is not exactly, or not entirely “explication”. If we are to consider it as the Suttavibhanga or its precursor, it has origin stories, successive laying down of rules, and so on, which aren’t really “explication”, but more of a general background.

an8.2:1.1	“Mendicants, there are eight causes and reasons that lead to acquiring the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life, and to its increase, growth, and full development once it has been acquired.	NA
an8.2:1.2	What eight?	NA
an8.2:1.3	It’s when a mendicant lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role. And they set up a keen sense of conscience and prudence for them, with warmth and respect.	NA
an8.2:1.4	This is the first cause.	NA
an8.2:2.1	When a mendicant lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role—with a keen sense of conscience and prudence for them, with warmth and respect—from time to time they go and ask them questions:	NA
an8.2:2.2	‘Why, sir, does it say this? What does that mean?’	NA
an8.2:2.3	Those venerables clarify what is unclear, reveal what is obscure, and dispel doubt regarding the many doubtful matters.	NA
an8.2:2.4	This is the second cause.	NA
an8.2:3.1	After hearing that teaching they perfect withdrawal of both body and mind.	NA
an8.2:3.2	This is the third cause.	NA
an8.2:4.1	A mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.	NA
an8.2:4.2	This is the fourth cause.	NA
an8.2:5.1	They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, rehearsing them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.	NA
an8.2:5.2	This is the fifth cause.	NA
an8.2:6.1	They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.	NA
an8.2:6.2	This is the sixth cause.	NA
an8.2:7.1	When in the Saṅgha they don’t engage in motley talk or low talk.	NA
an8.2:7.2	Either they talk on Dhamma, or they invite someone else to do so, or they respect noble silence.	NA
an8.2:7.3	This is the seventh cause.	NA
an8.2:8.1	They meditate observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates.	NA
an8.2:8.2	‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.	NA

an8.8:0.3	Uttara on Failure	NA
an8.8:1.1	At one time Venerable Uttara was staying on the Saṅkheyyaka Mountain in the Mahisa region near Dhavajālikā.	This place is, so far as I know, otherwise unknown. Uttara is a common name and it’s not clear if this is the same person as any of the others of the same name. Given the unusual setting, the lack of mention of the Buddha, the unusually fantastic setting—especially for such a prosaic teaching—the belabored repetition, the use of bhante uttara, and the incongruous last paragraph, this is clearly a late sutta. Perhaps this Uttara should be identified with the Uttara who was Revata’s student at the Second Council.
an8.8:1.2	There Uttara addressed the mendicants:	NA
an8.8:1.3	“Mendicants, it’s good for a mendicant to check their own failings from time to time.	NA
an8.8:1.4	It’s good for a mendicant to check the failings of others from time to time.	NA
an8.8:1.5	It’s good for a mendicant to check their own successes from time to time.	NA
an8.8:1.6	It’s good for a mendicant to check the successes of others from time to time.”	NA
an8.8:2.1	Now at that time the great king Vessavaṇa was on his way from the north to the south on some business.	NA
an8.8:2.2	He heard Venerable Uttara teaching this to the mendicants on Saṅkheyyaka Mountain.	NA

an8.8:2.4	NA	NA
an8.8:2.5	NA	NA
an8.8:2.6	NA	NA
an8.8:3.1	Then Vessavaṇa vanished from Saṅkheyyaka Mountain and appeared among the gods of the thirty-three, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm.	NA
an8.8:3.2	Then he went up to Sakka, lord of gods, and said to him:	NA
an8.8:3.3	“Please good fellow, you should know this.	NA
an8.8:3.4	Venerable Uttara is teaching the mendicants on Saṅkheyyaka Mountain in this way:	NA
an8.8:3.5	‘It’s good for a mendicant from time to time to check their own failings. …	NA
an8.8:3.6	the failings of others …	NA
an8.8:3.7	their own successes …	NA
an8.8:3.8	the successes of others.’”	NA
an8.8:4.1	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, Sakka vanished from the gods of the thirty-three and reappeared on Saṅkheyyaka Mountain in front of Venerable Uttara.	NA
an8.8:4.2	Then Sakka went up to Venerable Uttara, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:	NA
an8.8:5.1	“Is it really true, sir, that you teach the mendicants in this way:	NA
an8.8:5.2	‘It’s good for a mendicant from time to time to check their own failings …	NA
an8.8:5.3	the failings of others …	NA
an8.8:5.4	their own successes …	NA
an8.8:5.5	the successes of others’?”	NA
an8.8:5.6	“Indeed, lord of gods.”	NA
an8.8:5.7	“Sir, did this teaching come to you from your own inspiration, or was it spoken by the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”	BB’s “discernment” is here, as always, ill fitting for patibhana.
an8.8:5.8	“Well then, lord of gods, I shall give you a simile.	NA
an8.8:5.9	For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.	NA
an8.8:6.1	Suppose there was a large heap of grain not far from a town or village.	NA
an8.8:6.2	And a large crowd were to take away grain	NA
an8.8:6.3	with carrying poles, baskets, hip sacks, or their cupped hands.	NA
an8.8:6.4	If someone were to go to that crowd and ask them	NA
an8.8:6.5	where they got the grain from, how should that crowd rightly reply?”	NA
an8.8:6.6	“Sir, they should reply that they took it from the large heap of grain.”	NA
an8.8:6.7	“In the same way, lord of gods, whatever is well spoken is spoken by the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
an8.8:6.8	Both myself and others rely completely on that when we speak.”	NA

an8.11:0.3	At Verañjā	NA
an8.11:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
an8.11:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in Verañjā at the root of a neem tree dedicated to Naḷeru.	NA
an8.11:1.3	Then the brahmin Verañja went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	BB and Brahmali have “brahmin of Veranja” (cf. [mn42]()). But the normal connective form is Veranjaka. (MN 42). He would have been a brahmin known after his town, a common convention even today.
an8.11:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:	NA
an8.11:2.1	“Worthy Gotama, I have heard that	NA
an8.11:2.2	the ascetic Gotama doesn’t bow to old brahmins, the elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat.	NA
an8.11:2.3	And this is indeed the case,	NA
an8.11:2.4	for the worthy Gotama does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat.	NA
an8.11:2.5	This is not appropriate, worthy Gotama.”	NA
an8.11:2.6	“Brahmin, I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—for whom I should bow down or rise up or offer a seat.	NA
an8.11:2.7	If the Realized One bowed down or rose up or offered a seat to anyone, their head would explode!”	NA
an8.11:3.1	“Worthy Gotama lacks taste.”	NA
an8.11:3.2	“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say	NA
an8.11:3.3	that I lack taste.	NA
an8.11:3.4	For the Realized One has given up taste for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. It’s cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.	NA
an8.11:3.5	In this sense you could rightly say that I lack taste.	NA
an8.11:3.6	But that’s not what you’re talking about.”	NA
an8.11:4.1	“Worthy Gotama is indelicate.”	BB translates the commentary with his “convivial”. Horner, followed by Brahmali, have “enjoyment”. But nibbhoga is always used in the sense of “useless, abandoned”. SN 7.14 “Assova jiṇṇo nibbhogo,” Pv 12, Ja 354 “Evaṁ sarīre nibbhoge, pete kālaṅkate sati”. Here it probably means “has no use for polite standards”, thus similar to the previous. We can maintain the pun by using indelicate here and delight below.
an8.11:4.2	“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say	NA
an8.11:4.3	that I’m indelicate.	NA
an8.11:4.4	For the Realized One has given up delight in sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. It’s cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.	NA

an8.11:5.2	“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that	NA
an8.11:5.3	I’m a teacher of inaction.	NA
an8.11:5.4	For I teach inaction regarding bad bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and the many kinds of unskillful things.	This is parallel to AN 2.32
an8.11:5.5	In this sense you could rightly say that I’m a teacher of inaction.	NA
an8.11:5.6	But that’s not what you’re talking about.”	NA

an8.11:6.2	“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that	NA
an8.11:6.3	I’m a teacher of annihilationism.	NA
an8.11:6.4	For I teach the annihilation of greed, hate, and delusion, and the many kinds of unskillful things.	NA

an8.11:7.2	“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that	NA
an8.11:7.3	I’m disgusted.	NA
an8.11:7.4	For I’m disgusted by bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and by attainment of the many kinds of unskillful things.	NA
an8.11:7.5	In this sense you could rightly say that I’m disgusted.	NA
an8.11:7.6	But that’s not what you’re talking about.”	NA
an8.11:8.1	“Worthy Gotama is an exterminator.”	NA
an8.11:8.2	“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that	NA
an8.11:8.3	I’m an exterminator.	NA
an8.11:8.4	For I teach the extermination of greed, hate, and delusion, and the many kinds of unskillful things.	NA
an8.11:8.5	In this sense you could rightly say that I’m an exterminator.	NA
an8.11:8.6	But that’s not what you’re talking about.”	NA
an8.11:9.1	“Worthy Gotama is a mortifier.”	NA
an8.11:9.2	“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that	NA
an8.11:9.3	I’m a mortifier.	NA
an8.11:9.4	For I say that bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind should be mortified.	NA
an8.11:9.5	I say that a mortifier is someone who has given up unskillful qualities that should be mortified. They’ve cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they’re unable to arise in the future.	NA
an8.11:9.6	The Realized One is someone who has given up unskillful qualities that should be mortified. He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they’re unable to arise in the future.	NA
an8.11:9.7	In this sense you could rightly say that I’m a mortifier.	NA
an8.11:9.8	But that’s not what you’re talking about.”	NA
an8.11:10.1	“Worthy Gotama is immature.”	_Apagabbha_ is Sanskrit _apagalbha_, “not bold, immature”. The Buddha twists the sense to pun on _apa_ + _gabbha_ (“away from the womb”).
an8.11:10.2	“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that	NA
an8.11:10.3	I’m immature.	NA
an8.11:10.4	I say that an immature person is someone who has given up future wombs and rebirth into a new state of existence. They’ve cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they’re unable to arise in the future.	NA
an8.11:10.5	The Realized One has given up future wombs and rebirth into a new state of existence. He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they’re unable to arise in the future.	NA
an8.11:10.6	In this sense you could rightly say that I’m immature.	NA
an8.11:10.7	But that’s not what you’re talking about.	NA
an8.11:11.1	Suppose, brahmin, there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs.	NA
an8.11:11.2	And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated.	NA
an8.11:11.3	Now, the chick that is first to break out of the eggshell with its claws and beak and hatch safely: should that be called the eldest or the youngest?”	NA
an8.11:11.4	“Worthy Gotama, that should be called the eldest. For it is the eldest among them.”	NA
an8.11:12.1	“In the same way, in this population lost in ignorance, swaddled in their shells, I alone have broken open the egg of ignorance and realized the supreme perfect awakening.	NA
an8.11:12.2	So, brahmin, I am the eldest and the first in the world.	NA
an8.11:13.1	My energy was roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness was established and lucid, my body was tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind was immersed in samādhi.	NA
an8.11:13.2	Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
an8.11:13.3	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
an8.11:13.4	And with the fading away of rapture, I entered and remained in the third absorption, where I meditated with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA
an8.11:13.5	With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I entered and remained in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
an8.11:14.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward recollection of past lives.	NA
an8.11:14.2	I recollected many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. I remembered: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	NA
an8.11:15.1	This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the night.	NA
an8.11:15.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	NA
an8.11:15.3	This was my first breaking out, like a chick breaking out of the eggshell.	NA
an8.11:16.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	NA
an8.11:16.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	NA
an8.11:17.1	This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of the night.	NA
an8.11:17.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	NA
an8.11:17.3	This was my second breaking out, like a chick breaking out of the eggshell.	NA
an8.11:18.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	NA
an8.11:18.2	I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.	NA
an8.11:18.3	I truly understood: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.	NA
an8.11:18.4	Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	NA
an8.11:18.5	When it was freed, I knew it was freed.	NA
an8.11:18.6	I understood: ‘Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.’	NA
an8.11:19.1	This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the last watch of the night.	NA
an8.11:19.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	NA
an8.11:19.3	This was my third breaking out, like a chick breaking out of the eggshell.”	NA
an8.11:20.1	When he said this, the brahmin Verañja said to the Buddha:	NA
an8.11:20.2	“The worthy Gotama is the eldest! The worthy Gotama is the best!	NA
an8.11:20.3	Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	NA
an8.11:20.4	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
an8.11:20.5	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
an8.11:20.6	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	NA

an8.12:0.2	2. The Great Chapter	NA
an8.12:0.3	With Sīha	NA
an8.12:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	NA
an8.12:1.2	Now at that time several very prominent Licchavis were sitting together at the town hall, praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways.	NA
an8.12:2.1	Now at that time General Sīha, a disciple of the Jains, was sitting in that assembly.	NA
an8.12:2.2	He thought,	NA
an8.12:2.3	“That Blessed One must without a doubt be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha. For several very prominent Licchavis are praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways.	NA
an8.12:2.4	Why don’t I go to see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!”	NA
an8.12:2.5	Then General Sīha went to the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan and said to him,	NA
an8.12:2.6	“Sir, I’d like to go to see the ascetic Gotama.”	NA
an8.12:3.1	“But Sīha, you believe in the doctrine of action. Why should you go to see the ascetic Gotama, who teaches a doctrine of inaction?	NA
an8.12:3.2	For the ascetic Gotama believes in a doctrine of inaction, he teaches inaction, and he guides his disciples in that way.”	NA
an8.12:3.3	Then Sīha’s determination to go and see the Buddha died down.	NA
an8.12:4.1	For a second time, several prominent Licchavis were sitting together at the town hall, praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways.	NA
an8.12:4.2	And for a second time Sīha thought:	NA
an8.12:4.3	NA	NA
an8.12:4.4	“Why don’t I go to see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!”	NA
an8.12:4.5	Then General Sīha went to the Jain Ñātika …	NA

an8.12:6.2	And for a third time Sīha thought,	NA
an8.12:6.3	“That Blessed One must without a doubt be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha. For several very prominent Licchavis are praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways.	NA
an8.12:6.4	What can these Jains do to me, whether I take leave of them or not?	BB has “permission” for apalokita, but there’s no sense of that in the dialogue. mahavira never tells him he can’t go, he just tries to dissuade him. At SN 22.81 the Buddha is said to leave without apalokita with the sangha, so it can hardly mean permission.
an8.12:6.5	Why don’t I, without taking leave of them, go to see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!”	NA
an8.12:7.1	Then Sīha, with around five hundred chariots, set out from Vesālī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha.	NA
an8.12:7.2	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and went by foot.	BB follows PTS, which has arame pavisi.
an8.12:7.3	Then General Sīha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	NA
an8.12:8.1	“Sir, I have heard this:	NA
an8.12:8.2	‘The ascetic Gotama believes in a doctrine of inaction, he teaches inaction, and he guides his disciples in that way.’	NA
an8.12:8.3	I trust those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and do not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?	NA
an8.12:8.4	For we don’t want to misrepresent the Blessed One.”	NA

an8.12:25.3	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	NA
an8.12:26.1	“Sīha, you should act after careful consideration. It’s good for well-known people such as yourself to act after careful consideration.”	NA
an8.12:26.2	“Now I’m even more delighted and satisfied with the Buddha, since he tells me to act after careful consideration.	NA
an8.12:26.3	For if the followers of other religions were to gain me as a disciple, they’d carry a banner all over Vesālī, saying:	NA
an8.12:26.4	‘General Sīha has become our disciple!’	NA
an8.12:26.5	And yet the Buddha tells me to act after careful consideration.	NA
an8.12:26.6	For a second time, I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
an8.12:26.7	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	NA
an8.12:27.1	“For a long time now, Sīha, your family has been a well-spring of support for the Jain ascetics. You should consider giving to them when they come.”	NA
an8.12:27.2	“Now I’m even more delighted and satisfied with the Buddha, since he tells me to	NA
an8.12:27.3	consider giving to the Jain ascetics when they come.	NA
an8.12:27.4	Sir, I have heard that	NA
an8.12:27.5	the ascetic Gotama says this:	NA
an8.12:27.6	‘Gifts should only be given to me, and to my disciples.	NA
an8.12:27.7	Only what is given to me is very fruitful, not what is given to others.	NA
an8.12:27.8	Only what is given to my disciples is very fruitful, not what is given to the disciples of others.’	NA
an8.12:27.9	Yet the Buddha encourages me to give to the Jain ascetics.	NA
an8.12:27.10	Well, sir, we’ll know the proper time for that.	NA
an8.12:27.11	For a third time, I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
an8.12:27.12	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	NA
an8.12:28.1	Then the Buddha taught Sīha step by step, with	NA
an8.12:28.2	a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation.	NA
an8.12:28.3	And when the Buddha knew that Sīha’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas:	NA
an8.12:28.4	suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.	NA
an8.12:28.5	Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye,	NA
an8.12:28.6	in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in General Sīha:	NA
an8.12:28.7	“Everything that has a beginning has an end.”	NA
an8.12:29.1	Then Sīha saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha,	NA
an8.12:29.2	“Sir, may the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me.”	NA
an8.12:29.3	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
an8.12:29.4	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Sīha got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	NA
an8.12:30.1	Then Sīha addressed a certain man,	NA
an8.12:30.2	“Worthy, please find out if there is any meat ready for sale.”	NA
an8.12:30.3	And when the night had passed General Sīha had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	NA
an8.12:30.4	“Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.”	NA
an8.12:31.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Sīha’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.	NA
an8.12:31.2	Now at that time many Jain ascetics in Vesālī went from street to street and from square to square, calling out with raised arms:	BB’s “arms thrashing about” is incorrect. It means this http://previews.123rf.com/images/atic12/atic121402/atic12140200595/25885329-Closeup-portrait-of-overwhelmed-depressed-unhappy-upset-young-beautiful-woman-with-arms-raised-in-ai-Stock-Photo.jpg Not this http://img.boatdeck.com.au/makethumbnail.php?src=/blogs.dir/78/files/2014/01/drowning.jpg&w=553&h=280&zc=1
an8.12:31.3	“Today General Sīha has slaughtered a fat calf for the ascetic Gotama’s meal.	NA
an8.12:31.4	The ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared specially for him: this is a deed he caused.”	NA
an8.12:32.1	Then a certain person went up to Sīha and whispered in his ear,	NA
an8.12:32.2	“Please sir, you should know this.	NA
an8.12:32.3	Many Jain ascetics in Vesālī are going from street to street and square to square, calling out with raised arms:	NA
an8.12:32.4	‘Today General Sīha has slaughtered a fat calf for the ascetic Gotama’s meal.	NA
an8.12:32.5	The ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared specially for him: this is a deed he caused.’”	NA
an8.12:32.6	“Enough, master. For a long time those venerables have wanted to discredit the Buddha, his teaching, and his Saṅgha.	NA
an8.12:32.7	They’ll never stop misrepresenting the Buddha with their incorrect, hollow, false, untruthful claims.	NA
an8.12:32.8	We would never deliberately take the life of a living creature, not even for life’s sake.”	BB’s note on this accepts without question the notion that the Jains were vegetarians, which would make the argument of the current sutta, as he says, bordering on disingenuous. However it is quite well-known that Jain texts, including the earliest, the Acaranga, specify meat as allowable in certain contexts. See Acaranga Sutra 2.1.10.5-6 (http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe22/sbe2256.htm); Dasaveyaliya 5.1.73 and 5.1.84-86. This was accepted by at least some Jaina commentaries. Modern hesitancy over stating this plainly is a result of political lobbying by Jains: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Jacobi%27s_letter_on_Acaranga_controversy_of_meat-eating Of course, whether this sutta accurately represents the Jains is a separate question. But clearly the difference is not as great as it might seem.
an8.12:33.1	Then Sīha served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	NA
an8.12:33.2	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Sīha sat down to one side.	NA
an8.12:33.3	Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.	NA

an8.20:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.	NA
an8.20:1.2	Now, at that time it was the sabbath, and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.	NA
an8.20:1.3	And then, as the night was getting late, in the first watch of the night, Venerable Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said,	NA
an8.20:1.4	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the first watch of the night, and the Saṅgha of monks has been sitting long.	NA
an8.20:1.5	Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the monks.”	It’s doubtful that patimokkha here means the list of rules. More likely it’s the Ovadapatimokkha.
an8.20:2.1	But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent.	NA
an8.20:2.2	For a second time, as the night was getting late, in the middle watch of the night, Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said,	NA

an8.20:2.4	Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the monks.”	NA
an8.20:2.5	But for a second time the Buddha kept silent.	NA
an8.20:2.6	For a third time, as the night was getting late, in the last watch of the night, as dawn stirred, bringing joy to the night, Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said,	_Uddhastaṁ aruṇaṁ, nandimukhī ratti_ is very idiomatic, and _nandimukhi_ is generally treated as “face”. The idiom is surprisingly not used in this sense in Skt. But some Skt uses of the term are for a son or Rudra, suggesting that here _mukha_ is “cause”, i.e. “bringer of joy”. I take uddhasta as related to uddacca.

an8.20:2.10	“Ānanda, the assembly is not pure.”	NA

an8.20:3.2	“Who is the Buddha talking about?”	NA
an8.20:3.3	NA	NA
an8.20:3.4	Then he focused on comprehending the minds of everyone in the Saṅgha.	NA
an8.20:3.5	He saw that unethical person, of bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual practitioner—though claiming to be one—rotten inside, festering, and depraved, sitting in the middle of the Saṅgha.	NA
an8.20:3.6	When he saw him he got up from his seat, went up to him and said,	NA
an8.20:3.7	“Get up, reverend. The Buddha has seen you.	NA
an8.20:3.8	You can’t live in communion with the monks.”	NA

an8.20:4.8	NA	NA
an8.20:4.9	But for a third time that person kept silent.	NA
an8.20:5.1	Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna took that person by the arm, ejected him out the gate, and bolted the door. Then he went up to the Buddha, and said to him,	NA

an8.20:5.3	The assembly is pure.	NA

an8.20:5.6	how that futile man waited to be taken by the arm!”	NA
an8.20:6.1	Then the Buddha said to the monks:	NA

an8.20:6.3	From this day forth, I will not perform the sabbath or recite the monastic code.	NA

an8.21:4.4	And when he knew that my mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas:	NA

an8.30:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.	NA
an8.30:1.2	And at that time Venerable Anuruddha was staying in the land of the Cetīs in the Eastern Bamboo Park.	NA
an8.30:1.3	Then as Anuruddha was in private retreat this thought came to his mind:	NA
an8.30:1.4	“This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes.	NA
an8.30:1.5	It’s for the contented, not those who lack contentment.	NA
an8.30:1.6	It’s for the secluded, not those who enjoy company.	NA
an8.30:1.7	It’s for the energetic, not the lazy.	NA
an8.30:1.8	It’s for the mindful, not the unmindful.	NA
an8.30:1.9	It’s for those with immersion, not those without immersion.	NA
an8.30:1.10	It’s for the wise, not the witless.”	NA
an8.30:2.1	Then the Buddha knew what Anuruddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood in the land of the Bhaggas and reappeared in front of Anuruddha in the Eastern Bamboo Park in the land of the Cetīs,	NA
an8.30:2.2	and sat on the seat spread out.	NA
an8.30:2.3	Anuruddha bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.	NA
an8.30:2.4	The Buddha said to him:	NA
an8.30:3.1	“Good, good, Anuruddha!	NA
an8.30:3.2	It’s good that you reflect on these thoughts of a great man:	I prefer to gender the term mahapurisa, one of the few contexts where I elect for a gendered translation where BB uses a non-gendered one. Mahapurisa is a culturally potent term, comparable to the English “superman”. In its more worldly senses it is emphatically gendered, and I think it is significant to sustain this connection.
an8.30:3.3	‘This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes.	NA
an8.30:3.4	It’s for the contented, not those who lack contentment.	NA
an8.30:3.5	It’s for the secluded, not those who enjoy company.	NA
an8.30:3.6	It’s for the energetic, not the lazy.	NA
an8.30:3.7	It’s for the mindful, not the unmindful.	NA
an8.30:3.8	It’s for those with immersion, not those without immersion.	NA
an8.30:3.9	It’s for the wise, not the witless.’	NA
an8.30:3.10	Well then, Anuruddha, you should also reflect on the following eighth thought of a great man:	NA
an8.30:3.11	‘This teaching is for those who don’t enjoy proliferating and don’t like to proliferate, not for those who enjoy proliferating and like to proliferate.’	NA
an8.30:4.1	First you’ll reflect on these eight thoughts of a great man. Then whenever you want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, you’ll enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
an8.30:5.1	You’ll enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
an8.30:6.1	You’ll enter and remain in the third absorption, where you’ll meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA
an8.30:7.1	Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, you’ll enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
an8.30:8.1	First you’ll reflect on these eight thoughts of a great man, and you’ll get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in this life that belong to the higher mind—when you want, without trouble or difficulty. Then as you live contented your rag robe will seem to you like a chest full of garments of different colors seems to a householder or householder’s child.	NA
an8.30:8.2	It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment.	NA
an8.30:9.1	As you live contented your scraps of almsfood will seem to you like boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out, served with many soups and sauces seems to a householder or householder’s child.	NA
an8.30:9.2	It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment.	NA
an8.30:10.1	As you live contented your lodging at the root of a tree will seem to you like a bungalow, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with door fastened and window shuttered seems to a householder or householder’s child.	NA
an8.30:10.2	It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment.	NA
an8.30:11.1	As you live contented your lodging at the root of a tree will seem to you like a couch spread with woolen covers—shag-piled, pure white, or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red pillows at both ends seems to a householder or householder’s child.	NA
an8.30:11.2	It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment.	NA
an8.30:12.1	As you live contented your rancid urine as medicine will seem to you like various medicines—ghee, butter, oil, honey, and molasses—seem to a householder or householder’s child.	NA
an8.30:12.2	It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment.	NA
an8.30:12.3	Well then, Anuruddha, for the next rainy season residence you should stay right here in the land of the Cetīs in the Eastern Bamboo Park.”	This passage is a good example showing that “therefore” is not suited as translation for the “tena hi” idiom. Despite the instrumental, there’s no logical connection implied, merely a loose transition, for which we use “so” in English.
an8.30:12.4	“Yes, sir,” Anuruddha replied.	NA
an8.30:13.1	After advising Anuruddha like this, the Buddha—as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Eastern Bamboo Park in the land of the Cetīs and reappeared in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood in the land of the Bhaggas.	NA
an8.30:13.2	He sat on the seat spread out	NA
an8.30:13.3	and addressed the mendicants:	NA
an8.30:13.4	“Mendicants, I will teach you the eight thoughts of a great man. Listen …	NA
an8.30:13.5	And what are the eight thoughts of a great man?	NA
an8.30:13.6	This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes.	NA

an8.30:14.1	‘This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes.’	NA
an8.30:14.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
an8.30:14.3	A mendicant with few wishes doesn’t wish: ‘May they know me as having few wishes!’ When contented, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as contented!’ When secluded, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as secluded!’ When energetic, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as energetic!’ When mindful, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as mindful!’ When immersed, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as immersed!’ When wise, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as wise!’ When not enjoying proliferation, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as one who doesn’t enjoy proliferating!’	NA
an8.30:14.4	‘This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes.’	NA
an8.30:14.5	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA
an8.30:15.1	‘This teaching is for the contented, not those who lack contentment.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
an8.30:15.2	It’s for a mendicant who’s content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	NA
an8.30:15.3	‘This teaching is for the contented, not those who lack contentment.’	NA
an8.30:15.4	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA
an8.30:16.1	‘This teaching is for the secluded, not those who enjoy company.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
an8.30:16.2	It’s for a mendicant who lives secluded. But monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, rulers and their chief ministers, monastics of other religions and their disciples go to visit them.	NA
an8.30:16.3	With a mind slanting, sloping, and inclining to seclusion, withdrawn, and loving renunciation, that mendicant invariably gives each of them a talk emphasizing the topic of dismissal.	NA
an8.30:16.4	‘This teaching is for the secluded, not those who enjoy company.’	NA
an8.30:16.5	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA
an8.30:17.1	‘This teaching is for the energetic, not the lazy.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
an8.30:17.2	It’s for a mendicant who lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.	NA
an8.30:17.3	‘This teaching is for the energetic, not the lazy.’	NA
an8.30:17.4	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA
an8.30:18.1	‘This teaching is for the mindful, not the unmindful.’	NA
an8.30:18.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
an8.30:18.3	It’s for a mendicant who’s mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago.	NA
an8.30:18.4	‘This teaching is for the mindful, not the unmindful.’	NA
an8.30:18.5	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA
an8.30:19.1	‘This teaching is for those with immersion, not those without immersion.’	NA
an8.30:19.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
an8.30:19.3	It’s for a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.	NA
an8.30:19.4	‘This teaching is for those with immersion, not those without immersion.’	NA
an8.30:19.5	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA
an8.30:20.1	‘This teaching is for the wise, not the witless.’	NA
an8.30:20.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
an8.30:20.3	It’s for a mendicant who’s wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.	NA
an8.30:20.4	‘This teaching is for the wise, not the witless.’	NA
an8.30:20.5	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA
an8.30:21.1	‘This teaching is for those who don’t enjoy proliferating and don’t like to proliferate, not for those who enjoy proliferating and like to proliferate.’	NA
an8.30:21.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
an8.30:21.3	It’s for a mendicant whose mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes decided regarding the cessation of proliferation.	NA
an8.30:21.4	‘This teaching is for those who don’t enjoy proliferating and don’t like to proliferate, not for those who enjoy proliferating and like to proliferate.’	NA
an8.30:21.5	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.”	NA
an8.30:22.1	Then Anuruddha stayed the next rainy season residence right there in the land of the Cetīs in the Eastern Bamboo Park.	NA
an8.30:22.2	And Anuruddha, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
an8.30:22.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	NA
an8.30:22.4	And Venerable Anuruddha became one of the perfected.	NA
an8.30:22.5	And on the occasion of attaining perfection he recited these verses:	NA
an8.30:23.1	“Knowing my thoughts,	NA
an8.30:23.2	the supreme Teacher in the world	NA
an8.30:23.3	came to me in a mind-made body,	NA

an8.34:1.1	“Mendicants, when a field has eight factors a seed sown in it is not very fruitful or rewarding or productive.	I feel BB’s translation misses the mark a little here. He translates as if it were an actual fruit field, but there following paragraph, with its irrigation, sounds more like rice. Mahaphala is used so generally there’s no need for it to mean literal fruit. Assada too is most commonly used in a derived sense. Finally, I prefer to avoid rendering phatiseyya with “profit”, as most fields in those days were for subsistence, not the market.

an8.35:0.3	Rebirth by Giving	NA
an8.35:1.1	“Mendicants, there are these eight rebirths by giving.	NA
an8.35:1.2	What eight?	NA
an8.35:1.3	First, someone gives to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting.	NA
an8.35:1.4	Whatever they give they expect back.	NA
an8.35:1.5	They see a well-to-do aristocrat or brahmin or householder amusing themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	NA
an8.35:1.6	It occurs to them:	NA
an8.35:1.7	‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders!’	See [dn33:3.1.102]() and [mn120:3.4]().
an8.35:1.8	They settle on that thought, stabilize it, and develop it.	NA
an8.35:1.9	As they’ve settled for less and not developed further, their thought leads to rebirth there.	“Settled for less” also occurs at [dn33:3.1.103](). Readings vary between _hīne vimuttaṁ_ (“released in what is inferior”, per MS) and _hīne ’dhimuttaṁ_ (“resolved upon what is inferior”). This is an example of an ambiguity between _vi + √muc_ (“release”) and _adhi + √muc_ (“resolve”) that is sometimes seen in Pali texts. The subcommentary reads _vimuttaṁ_ and offers two explanations: “‘Released’ (_vimuttaṁ_) means ‘resolved’ (_adhimuttaṁ_); the meaning is slants, slopes, and inclines. Or else ‘released’ means ‘set free’ (_vissaṭṭhaṁ_).” Given that it is clearly accepted in the commentarial tradition, and that it is the more difficult reading, it seems we must accept _vimuttaṁ_ as the correct reading here. But from context, and from the subcommentary, it has the same sense as _adhimutta_, namely, “resolved upon”. This goes some way to explaining the ambiguity between the two words, as they not only have a similar form, but their meanings can overlap too.

an8.36:1.1	“Mendicants, there are these three grounds for making merit.	Normally I try to avoid using “make merit” for punnam karoti, to avoid the modern materialist slant on it.

So here I think it’s best to use “meditation” by bhavana, even if the scope is actually somewhat broader than that; it doubtless refers to the 37 bodhipakkhiyas.

an8.51:0.3	With Gotamī	NA
an8.51:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.	NA
an8.51:1.2	Then Mahāpajāpati Gotamī went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:	NA
an8.51:1.3	“Sir, please let females gain the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.”	NA
an8.51:1.4	“Enough, Gotamī.	NA
an8.51:1.5	Don’t endorse the going forth for females from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.”	NA

an8.51:2.3	NA	NA
an8.51:2.4	NA	NA
an8.51:3.1	For a third time, Mahāpajāpati Gotamī said to the Buddha:	NA

an8.51:3.3	“Enough, Gotamī.	NA
an8.51:3.4	Don’t endorse the going forth for females from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.”	NA
an8.51:4.1	Then Mahāpajāpati Gotamī thought, “The Buddha does not permit females to go forth.” Miserable and sad, weeping, with a tearful face, she bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on her right, before leaving.	NA
an8.51:5.1	When the Buddha had stayed in Kapilavatthu as long as he pleased, he set out for Vesālī.	NA
an8.51:5.2	Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Vesālī,	NA
an8.51:5.3	where he stayed at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	NA
an8.51:5.4	Then Mahāpajāpati Gotamī had her hair shaved, and dressed in ocher robes. Together with several Sakyan ladies she set out for Vesālī.	BB’s note quotes Pruitt who says there’s no indication of the gap of time between this and the previous event, and refers to the Commentarial assertion that the Buddha went to Rajagaha in the meantime, before returning to Vesali. But this is absurd. The text is perfectly clear: the Buddha walked from Kapilavatthu to Vesali, and Mahapajapati followed him. Sure, there’s no exact time specified, but no reason to think the Buddha detoured, for several weeks at least, to Rajagaha.
an8.51:5.5	Traveling stage by stage, she arrived at Vesālī and went to the Great Wood, the hall with the peaked roof.	NA
an8.51:5.6	Then Mahāpajāpati Gotamī stood crying outside the gate, her feet swollen, her limbs covered with dust, miserable and sad, with tearful face.	NA
an8.51:6.1	Venerable Ānanda saw her standing there,	NA
an8.51:6.2	and said to her,	NA
an8.51:6.3	“Gotamī, why do you stand crying outside the gate, your feet swollen, your limbs covered with dust, miserable and sad, with tearful face?”	NA
an8.51:6.4	“Honorable Ānanda, it’s because the Buddha does not permit females to go forth in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.”	NA
an8.51:6.5	“Well then, Gotamī, wait here an hour while I ask the Buddha to grant the going forth for females.”	NA
an8.51:7.1	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	NA
an8.51:7.2	“Sir, Mahāpajāpati Gotamī is standing crying outside the gate, her feet swollen, her limbs covered with dust, miserable and sad, with tearful face.	NA
an8.51:7.3	She says that it’s because the Buddha does not permit females to go forth.	NA
an8.51:7.4	Sir, please let females gain the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.”	NA
an8.51:7.5	“Enough, Ānanda.	NA
an8.51:7.6	Don’t endorse the going forth for females from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.”	NA
an8.51:8.1	For a second time …	NA
an8.51:8.2	For a third time, Ānanda said to the Buddha:	NA

an8.51:8.4	“Enough, Ānanda.	NA
an8.51:8.5	Don’t endorse the going forth for females from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.”	NA
an8.51:9.1	Then Venerable Ānanda thought,	NA
an8.51:9.2	“The Buddha does not permit females to go forth.	NA
an8.51:9.3	Why don’t I try another approach?”	NA
an8.51:9.4	Then Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,	NA
an8.51:9.5	“Sir, is a female able to realize the fruits of stream-entry, once-return, non-return, and perfection once she has gone forth?”	NA
an8.51:9.6	“She is able, Ānanda.”	NA
an8.51:9.7	“If a female is able to realize the fruits of stream-entry, once-return, non-return, and perfection once she has gone forth.	NA
an8.51:9.8	Sir, Mahāpajāpati has been very helpful to the Buddha. She is his aunt who raised him, nurtured him, and gave him her milk.	The bahukara sentence is clumsily edited; BB uses square brackets to parse it. The many different versions of the text differ here. It seems to have been pasted here and lightly edited. Compare AN 2.32, AN 3.31, AN 4.63. Ananda is quoting the Buddha’s own words back at him! In each of these cases the same bahukara phrase is used, in the same context, and each time it sanely starts a new sentence. One way this might be fixed is if sacchikatum was followed by a repeat of “sadhu, bhante …”, which subsequently became lost through abbreviation. However I can’t find any manuscript support for this. So I’ve chosen to leave the text in its broken state. Note that the BHS version o this passage at https://suttacentral.net/san-lo-bi-vb-nidana/san/roth begins the phrase with 'yato' rather than ’sace'. Note too that at AN 2.32 apadaka and posaka are applied without distinction to mother and father, so they cannot mean “wet nurse and foster mother” as BB has it.
an8.51:9.9	When the Buddha’s birth mother passed away, she nurtured him at her own breast.	NA

an8.51:18.1	From this day forth it is forbidden for nuns to criticize monks, but it is not forbidden for monks to criticize nuns.	Note that while vacanapatha sounds like a general term for “ways of speech”, it is in fact an idiom that is always used in the sense of harsh criticism: https://suttacentral.net/search?query=vacanapath%2A&offset=0&limit=10

an8.51:20.1	Then Ānanda, having learned these eight principles of respect from the Buddha himself, went to Mahāpajāpati Gotamī and said:	NA
an8.51:21.1	“Gotamī, if you accept eight principles of respect, that will be your ordination.	NA
an8.51:22.1	A nun, even if she has been ordained for a hundred years, should bow down to a monk who was ordained that very day. She should rise up for him, greet him with joined palms, and observe proper etiquette toward him.	NA

an8.51:24.2	In the same way, sir, I accept these eight principles of respect as not to be transgressed so long as life lasts.”	NA
an8.51:25.1	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:	NA
an8.51:25.2	“Sir, Mahāpajāpati Gotamī has accepted the eight principles of respect as not to be transgressed so long as life lasts.”	NA
an8.51:26.1	“Ānanda, if females had not gained the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One, the spiritual life would have lasted long. The true teaching would have remained for a thousand years.	NA
an8.51:26.2	But since they have gained the going forth, now the spiritual life will not last long.	NA
an8.51:26.3	The true teaching will remain only five hundred years.	NA
an8.51:27.1	It’s like those families with many women and few men. They’re easy prey for bandits and thieves.	The Comm explains kumbhathena as thieves who carry lamps in pots. I find this unconvincing. There doesn’t seem to be any similar idiom in Sanskrit. But a kumbha is frequently mentioned as a place for storing gold and vaulables, so perhaps that’s what is intended.
an8.51:27.2	In the same way, the spiritual life does not last long in a teaching and training where females gain the going forth.	NA

an8.51:29.1	It’s like a field full of sugar cane. Once the disease called ‘red rot’ attacks, it doesn’t last long.	BB has “rusting disease”, which is inaccurate.

an8.52:1.3	“Sir, how many qualities should a monk have to be deemed an adviser for nuns?”	NA
an8.52:2.1	“Ānanda, a monk with eight qualities may be deemed an adviser for nuns.	NA
an8.52:2.2	What eight?	NA
an8.52:2.3	Firstly, a monk is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.	NA
an8.52:2.4	They’re learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s totally full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reciting them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.	NA
an8.52:2.5	Both monastic codes have been passed down to them in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well evaluated in both the rules and accompanying material.	NA
an8.52:2.6	They’re a good speaker who enunciates well. Their voice is polished, clear, articulate, and expresses the meaning.	NA
an8.52:2.7	They’re able to educate, encourage, fire up, and inspire the community of nuns.	NA
an8.52:2.8	They’re likable and agreeable to most of the nuns.	NA
an8.52:2.9	They have never previously sexually harassed any woman wearing the ocher robe who has gone forth in the Buddha’s name.	The text says “fallen into a grave offence”. The grave offences are the sanghadisesas, and the relevant rules are 2–4, which deal with sexual harassment either verbally or physically. I think it’s important to make this clear. Also, the phrasing of this is odd in several ways. Why not use a more normal phrase for someone who has gone forth? Regardless, both Horner and Ṭhānissaro mistranslate this. I follow BB’s construal of the grammar.

Then, we would naturally expect that _attha_ is “matter, substance, content (of the teaching)”, and _dhamma_ is the “principle”, i.e. how it fits into the four noble truths.

He “is not capable” of remembering, yet he examines what he has remembered. I think the text is not actually contradictory. We should read -jatika as meaning “natural-born, talented”, and translate as “readily memorize”. Thus someone who is not a natural memorizer, even though it’s hard for them to memorize things, still manage to remember some things (Culapanthaka!), and these are what they examine.

an8.70:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	NA
an8.70:1.2	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.	NA
an8.70:1.3	Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Ānanda,	NA
an8.70:1.4	“Ānanda, get your sitting cloth.	NA
an8.70:1.5	Let’s go to the Cāpāla Shrine for the day’s meditation.”	NA
an8.70:1.6	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha.	NA
an8.70:2.1	Then the Buddha went up to the Cāpāla Shrine, where he sat on the seat spread out.	NA
an8.70:2.2	When he was seated he said to Venerable Ānanda:	NA
an8.70:3.1	“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Seven Maidens, Many Sons, Sārandada, and Cāpāla Tree-shrines are all lovely.	NA
an8.70:3.2	Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.	Normally _kappa_ as a period of time means “eon”, but the late canonical texts Kathāvatthu ([Kv 11.5](https://suttacentral.net/kv11.5)) and Milindapañha ([Mil 5.1.10](https://suttacentral.net/mil5.1.10)) argue that it means the “lifespan”, an interpretation followed by the commentaries. Support for this comes from [dn26:28.3](), which says that “long life” for a mendicant is the four bases of psychic power which enable you to remain for the _kappa_. Here it is surely talking about a full lifespan. Underlying this is the idea that in different epochs the “proper lifespan” varies; in the Buddha’s day it was one hundred years ([dn14:1.7.7]()). We can resolve the problem if we read _kappa_ here, not as a period of time, but as “proper, fitting”, i.e. the “proper” lifespan of a hundred years.
an8.70:3.3	The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.”	NA
an8.70:3.4	But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign.	NA
an8.70:3.5	He didn’t beg the Buddha,	NA
an8.70:3.6	“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon!

an8.70:4.1	For a second time …	NA
an8.70:4.2	And for a third time, the Buddha said to him:	NA
an8.70:4.3	“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Seven Maidens, Many Sons, Sārandada, and Cāpāla Tree-shrines are all lovely.	NA

an8.70:4.6	But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign.	NA
an8.70:4.7	He didn’t beg the Buddha,	NA
an8.70:4.8	“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra.	NA
an8.70:5.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	NA
an8.70:5.2	“Go now, Ānanda, at your convenience.”	NA
an8.70:5.3	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He rose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before sitting at the root of a tree close by.	NA
an8.70:5.4	And then, not long after Ānanda had left, Māra the Wicked said to the Buddha:	NA
an8.70:6.1	“Sir, may the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One now be fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment of the Buddha.	NA
an8.70:6.2	Sir, you once made this statement:	NA
an8.70:6.3	‘Wicked One, I shall not be fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and practice in line with the teachings; not until they practice appropriately, living in line with the teaching; not until they’ve learned their tradition, and explain, teach, assert, establish, clarify, analyze, and reveal; not until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis.’	BB includes pattayogakkhema.

an8.70:8.1	Sir, may the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One be fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment of the Buddha.	NA
an8.70:8.2	Sir, you once made this statement:	NA
an8.70:8.3	‘Wicked One, I shall not be fully extinguished until my spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.’	NA
an8.70:8.4	Today your spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.	NA
an8.70:9.1	Sir, may the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One be fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment of the Buddha.”	NA
an8.70:9.2	“Relax, Wicked One. The full extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon.	NA
an8.70:9.3	Three months from now the Realized One will be fully extinguished.”	NA
an8.70:10.1	So at the Cāpāla Tree-shrine the Buddha, mindful and aware, surrendered the life force.	NA
an8.70:10.2	When he did so there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky.	NA
an8.70:10.3	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
an8.70:10.4	“Comparing the incomparable <j>with the creation of prolonged life,	For this difficult verse, I generally follow Bhikkhu Bodhi’s long discussion in *Connected Discourses of the Buddha*, note 255 on the Mahāvagga. _Sambhava_ means “production, creation”, and here I think it refers to the prolonging of life which the Buddha had just rejected.
an8.70:10.5	the sage surrendered the life force.	_Bhavasaṅkhāra_ here is equivalent to _āyusaṅkhāra_ and _jīvitasaṅkhāra_.

an8.70:10.7	he shattered self-creation like a suit of armor.”	_Attasambhava_ here refers back to _sambhava_ in the first line.

an8.70:12.3	That was really a very big earthquake; awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky!	NA
an8.70:12.4	What’s the cause, what’s the reason for a great earthquake?”	NA

an8.70:14.3	This great earth is grounded on water, the water is grounded on air, and the air stands in space. At a time when a great wind blows, it stirs the water, and the water stirs the earth.	So far as it goes, this is a naturalistic explanation. The “water element” has the quality of softening, while the “air element” is traditionally understood as “movement”. Thus in modern terms this means, “When underground forces disturb a region of instability.”
an8.70:14.4	This is the first cause and reason for a great earthquake.	NA

an8.70:15.2	This is the second cause and reason for a great earthquake.	NA

an8.70:17.1	Furthermore, when the being intent on awakening comes out of his mother’s belly mindful and aware, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles.	NA

an8.70:18.1	Furthermore, when the Realized One realizes the supreme perfect awakening, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles.	NA
an8.70:18.2	This is the fifth cause and reason for a great earthquake.	NA
an8.70:19.1	Furthermore, when the Realized One rolls forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles.	NA

an8.80:1.2	What eight?	NA
an8.80:1.3	Firstly, a mendicant has some work to do.	NA
an8.80:1.4	They think:	NA
an8.80:1.5	‘I have some work to do. But while doing it my body will get tired. I’d better have a lie down.’	NA
an8.80:1.6	They lie down, and don’t rouse energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.	NA

an8.80:2.5	This is the second ground for laziness.	NA
an8.80:3.1	Furthermore, a mendicant has to go on a journey.	NA
an8.80:3.2	They think:	NA
an8.80:3.3	‘I have to go on a journey. But while walking my body will get tired. I’d better have a lie down.’	I think it’s important to mention the word “walk in such cases, as most people don” t think of walking when going on a journey.

an8.80:4.5	This is the fourth ground for laziness.	NA
an8.80:5.1	Furthermore, a mendicant has wandered for alms, but they didn’t get to fill up on as much food as they like, coarse or fine.	BB has “as much as he needs” for yavadattha, but contexts in AN consistently use it in the sense of “as much as he likes”, which is typically more than they need.

an9.1:0.2	1. Awakening	NA
an9.1:0.3	Awakening	NA
an9.1:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
an9.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
an9.1:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:	NA
an9.1:2.1	“Mendicants, if wanderers of other religions were to ask:	NA
an9.1:2.2	‘Reverends, what is the vital condition for the development of the awakening factors?’ How would you answer them?”	NA
an9.1:2.3	“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. … The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	NA
an9.1:3.1	“Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
an9.1:3.2	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
an9.1:3.3	The Buddha said this:	NA
an9.1:4.1	“Mendicants, if wanderers of other religions were to ask:	NA
an9.1:4.2	‘Reverends, what is the vital condition for the development of the awakening factors?’ You should answer them:	NA
an9.1:5.1	‘It’s when a mendicant has good friends, companions, and associates.	NA
an9.1:5.2	This is the first vital condition for the development of the awakening factors.	NA
an9.1:6.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.	NA
an9.1:6.2	This is the second vital condition for the development of the awakening factors.	NA
an9.1:7.1	Furthermore, a mendicant gets to take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart, when they want, without trouble or difficulty. That is, talk about fewness of wishes, contentment, seclusion, aloofness, arousing energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom.	NA
an9.1:7.2	This is the third vital condition for the development of the awakening factors.	NA
an9.1:8.1	Furthermore, a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.	NA
an9.1:8.2	This is the fourth vital condition for the development of the awakening factors.	NA
an9.1:9.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.	NA
an9.1:9.2	This is the fifth vital condition for the development of the awakening factors.’	Note that both text and BB mark the end of the initial answer here, but there is no “ti” to support this in the text. The sutta is obviously a composite one.
an9.1:10.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to	NA
an9.1:10.2	be ethical …	NA
an9.1:11.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to	NA
an9.1:11.2	take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart …	NA
an9.1:12.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to	NA
an9.1:12.2	live with energy roused up …	NA
an9.1:13.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to	NA
an9.1:13.2	be wise …	NA
an9.1:14.1	But then, a mendicant grounded on these five things should develop four further things.	NA
an9.1:14.2	They should develop the perception of ugliness to give up greed, love to give up hate, mindfulness of breathing to cut off thinking, and perception of impermanence to uproot the conceit ‘I am’.	NA
an9.1:14.3	When you perceive impermanence, the perception of not-self becomes stabilized.	NA
an9.1:14.4	Perceiving not-self, you uproot the conceit ‘I am’ and attain extinguishment in this very life.”	NA

an9.2:0.2	1. Awakening	NA
an9.2:0.3	Supported	NA
an9.2:1.1	Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	NA
an9.2:1.2	“Sir, they speak of being ‘supported’.	NA
an9.2:1.3	How is a mendicant who is supported defined?”	NA
an9.2:1.4	“Mendicant, if a mendicant supported by faith gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful, the unskillful is actually given up by them.	NA
an9.2:1.5	If a mendicant supported by conscience …	NA
an9.2:1.6	If a mendicant supported by prudence …	NA
an9.2:1.7	If a mendicant supported by energy …	NA
an9.2:1.8	If a mendicant supported by wisdom gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful, the unskillful is actually given up by them.	NA
an9.2:1.9	What’s been given up is completely given up when it has been given up by seeing with noble wisdom.	NA
an9.2:2.1	But then, a mendicant grounded on these five things should rely on four things.	NA
an9.2:2.2	What four?	NA
an9.2:2.3	After appraisal, a mendicant uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things.	NA
an9.2:2.4	That’s how a mendicant is supported.”	NA

an9.3:0.3	With Meghiya	NA
an9.3:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Cālikā, on the Cālikā mountain.	NA
an9.3:1.2	Now, at that time Venerable Meghiya was the Buddha’s attendant.	NA
an9.3:1.3	Then Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	NA
an9.3:1.4	“Sir, I’d like to enter Jantu village for alms.”	NA
an9.3:1.5	“Please, Meghiya, go at your convenience.”	NA
an9.3:2.1	Then Meghiya robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Jantu village for alms.	NA
an9.3:2.2	After the meal, on his return from almsround in Jantu village, he went to the shore of Kimikālā river.	NA
an9.3:2.3	As he was going for a walk along the shore of the river he saw a lovely and delightful mango grove.	NA
an9.3:2.4	It occurred to him,	NA
an9.3:2.5	“Oh, this mango grove is lovely and delightful! This is good enough for striving for a gentleman wanting to strive.	NA
an9.3:2.6	If the Buddha allows me, I’ll come back to this mango grove to meditate.”	NA
an9.3:3.1	Then Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding,	NA

an9.3:4.9	“We’re alone, Meghiya. Wait until another mendicant comes.”	NA
an9.3:5.1	For a second time Meghiya said to the Buddha,	NA
an9.3:5.2	“Sir, the Buddha has nothing more to do, and nothing that needs improvement.	NA
an9.3:5.3	But I have.	NA
an9.3:5.4	If you allow me, I’ll go back to that mango grove to meditate.”	NA
an9.3:5.5	“We’re alone, Meghiya. Wait until another mendicant comes.”	NA
an9.3:6.1	For a third time Meghiya said to the Buddha,	NA
an9.3:6.2	“Sir, the Buddha has nothing more to do, and nothing that needs improvement.	NA
an9.3:6.3	But I have.	NA
an9.3:6.4	If you allow me, I’ll go back to that mango grove to meditate.”	NA
an9.3:6.5	“Meghiya, since you speak of striving in meditation, what can I say?	NA
an9.3:6.6	Please, Meghiya, go at your convenience.”	NA
an9.3:7.1	Then Meghiya got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went to that mango grove, and, having plunged deep into it, sat at the root of a certain tree for the day’s meditation.	NA
an9.3:7.2	But while Meghiya was meditating in that mango grove he was beset mostly by three kinds of bad, unskillful thoughts, namely,	NA
an9.3:7.3	sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts.	NA
an9.3:7.4	Then he thought,	NA
an9.3:7.5	“Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!	NA
an9.3:7.6	I’ve gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness,	NA
an9.3:7.7	but I’m still harassed by these three kinds of bad, unskillful thoughts:	NA
an9.3:7.8	sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts.”	NA
an9.3:8.1	Then Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	NA

an9.3:12.1	Furthermore, a mendicant gets to take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart, when they want, without trouble or difficulty. That is, talk about fewness of wishes, contentment, seclusion, aloofness, arousing energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom.	NA
an9.3:12.2	This is the third thing …	NA
an9.3:13.1	Furthermore, a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.	NA
an9.3:13.2	This is the fourth thing …	NA
an9.3:14.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.	NA
an9.3:14.2	This is the fifth thing that, when the heart’s release is not ripe, helps it ripen.	NA
an9.3:15.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to	NA
an9.3:15.2	be ethical …	NA
an9.3:16.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to	NA
an9.3:16.2	take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart …	NA
an9.3:17.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to be energetic …	NA
an9.3:18.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to be wise …	NA
an9.3:19.1	But then, a mendicant grounded on these five things should develop four further things.	NA
an9.3:19.2	They should develop the perception of ugliness to give up greed, love to give up hate, mindfulness of breathing to cut off thinking, and perception of impermanence to uproot the conceit ‘I am’.	NA
an9.3:19.3	When you perceive impermanence, the perception of not-self becomes stabilized.	NA
an9.3:19.4	Perceiving not-self, you uproot the conceit ‘I am’ and attain extinguishment in this very life.”	NA

an9.4:0.3	With Nandaka	NA
an9.4:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
an9.4:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Nandaka was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk.	NA
an9.4:1.3	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall. He stood outside the door waiting for the talk to end.	NA
an9.4:1.4	When he knew the talk had ended he cleared his throat and knocked on the door-panel.	NA
an9.4:1.5	The mendicants opened the door for the Buddha,	NA
an9.4:2.1	and he entered the assembly hall, where he sat on the seat spread out.	NA
an9.4:2.2	He said to Nandaka,	NA
an9.4:2.3	“Nandaka, that was a long exposition of the teaching you gave to the mendicants.	NA
an9.4:2.4	My back was aching while I stood outside the door waiting for the talk to end.”	NA
an9.4:3.1	When he said this, Nandaka felt embarrassed and said to the Buddha,	NA
an9.4:3.2	“Sir, we didn’t know that the Buddha was standing outside the door.	BB translates as singular. Sometimes the plural is intended as a formal usage, but here it seems he is speaking on behalf of all the monks present. Note that in the next sentence “speak” is singular.
an9.4:3.3	If we’d known, I wouldn’t have said so much.”	NA
an9.4:4.1	Then the Buddha, knowing that Nandaka was embarrassed, said to him,	NA
an9.4:4.2	“Good, good, Nandaka!	NA
an9.4:4.3	It’s appropriate for gentlemen like you, who have gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, to sit together for a Dhamma talk.	NA
an9.4:4.4	When you’re sitting together you should do one of two things:	NA
an9.4:4.5	discuss the teachings or keep noble silence.	NA
an9.4:4.6	Nandaka, a mendicant is faithful but not ethical.	NA
an9.4:4.7	So they’re incomplete in that respect,	NA

an9.4:4.10	When a mendicant is faithful and ethical, they’re complete in that respect.	NA

an9.4:5.5	When a mendicant is faithful and ethical and gets internal serenity of heart, they’re complete in that respect.	NA
an9.4:6.1	A mendicant is faithful, ethical, and gets internal serenity of heart, but they don’t get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles.	NA
an9.4:6.2	So they’re incomplete in that respect.	NA
an9.4:6.3	Suppose, Nandaka, there was a four-footed animal	NA
an9.4:6.4	that was lame and disabled.	NA
an9.4:6.5	It would be incomplete in that respect.	NA
an9.4:6.6	In the same way, a mendicant is faithful, ethical, and gets internal serenity of heart, but they don’t get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles.	NA

an9.4:7.2	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
an9.4:7.3	When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.	NA
an9.4:8.1	Then soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Nandaka said to the mendicants,	NA
an9.4:8.2	“Just now, reverends, the Buddha explained a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure in four statements, before getting up from his seat and entering his dwelling:	NA

an9.4:9.1	Reverends, there are these five benefits of listening to the teachings at the right time and discussing the teachings at the right time.	NA
an9.4:9.2	What five?	NA
an9.4:9.3	Firstly, a mendicant proclaims a teaching to the mendicants that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
an9.4:9.4	Whenever they do this, they become liked and approved by the Teacher, respected and admired.	BB follows PTS edition in amending satthu to sattha, despite little manuscript support. It seems to me satthu makes more sense. The sutta began by the Buddha showing his respect and appreciation for a monk who was teaching.
an9.4:9.5	This is the first benefit …	NA
an9.4:10.1	Furthermore, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma …	NA
an9.4:10.2	Whenever they do this, they feel inspired by the meaning and the teaching in that Dhamma.	NA
an9.4:10.3	This is the second benefit …	NA
an9.4:11.1	Furthermore, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma …	NA
an9.4:11.2	Whenever they do this, they see the meaning of a deep saying in that Dhamma with penetrating wisdom.	NA
an9.4:11.3	This is the third benefit …	NA
an9.4:12.1	Furthermore, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma …	NA
an9.4:12.2	Whenever they do this, their spiritual companions esteem them more highly, thinking,	NA
an9.4:12.3	‘For sure this venerable has attained or will attain.’	NA
an9.4:12.4	This is the fourth benefit …	NA
an9.4:13.1	Furthermore, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma …	NA
an9.4:13.2	Whenever they do this, there may be trainee mendicants present, who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary from the yoke. Hearing that teaching, they rouse energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.	NA
an9.4:13.3	There may be perfected mendicants present, who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and are rightly freed through enlightenment. Hearing that teaching, they simply live happily in this life.	NA
an9.4:13.4	This is the fifth benefit …	NA
an9.4:13.5	These are the five benefits of listening to the teachings at the right time and discussing the teachings at the right time.”	NA

an9.5:0.3	Powers	NA
an9.5:1.1	“Mendicants, there are these four powers.	NA
an9.5:1.2	What four?	NA
an9.5:1.3	The powers of wisdom, energy, blamelessness, and inclusiveness.	NA
an9.5:1.4	And what is the power of wisdom?	NA
an9.5:1.5	One has clearly seen and clearly contemplated with wisdom those qualities that are skillful and considered to be skillful; those that are unskillful … blameworthy … blameless … dark … bright … to be cultivated … not to be cultivated … not worthy of the noble ones … worthy of the noble ones and considered to be worthy of the noble ones.	NA
an9.5:1.6	This is called the power of wisdom.	NA
an9.5:2.1	And what is the power of energy?	NA
an9.5:2.2	One generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives to give up those qualities that are unskillful and considered to be unskillful; those that are blameworthy … dark … not to be cultivated … not worthy of the noble ones and considered to be not worthy of the noble ones.	NA
an9.5:2.3	One generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives to gain those qualities that are skillful and considered to be skillful; those that are blameless … bright … to be cultivated … worthy of the noble ones and considered to be worthy of the noble ones.	NA
an9.5:2.4	This is called the power of energy.	NA
an9.5:3.1	And what is the power of blamelessness?	NA
an9.5:3.2	It’s when a noble disciple has blameless conduct by way of body, speech, and mind.	NA
an9.5:3.3	This is called the power of blamelessness.	NA
an9.5:4.1	And what is the power of inclusiveness?	NA
an9.5:4.2	There are these four ways of being inclusive.	NA
an9.5:4.3	Giving, kindly words, taking care, and equality.	NA
an9.5:4.4	The best of gifts is the gift of the teaching.	NA
an9.5:4.5	The best sort of kindly speech is to teach the Dhamma again and again to someone who is engaged and who actively listens.	NA
an9.5:4.6	The best way of taking care is to encourage, settle, and ground the unfaithful in faith, the unethical in ethics, the stingy in generosity, and the ignorant in wisdom.	NA
an9.5:4.7	The best kind of equality is the equality of a stream-enterer with another stream-enterer, a once-returner with another once-returner, a non-returner with another non-returner, and a perfected one with another perfected one.	NA
an9.5:4.8	This is called the power of inclusiveness.	NA
an9.5:4.9	These are the four powers.	NA
an9.5:5.1	A noble disciple who has these four powers has got past five fears.	NA
an9.5:5.2	What five?	NA
an9.5:5.3	Fear regarding livelihood, disrepute, feeling insecure in an assembly, death, and bad rebirth.	NA
an9.5:5.4	Then that noble disciple reflects:	NA
an9.5:5.5	‘I have no fear regarding livelihood.	NA
an9.5:5.6	Why would I be afraid of that?	NA
an9.5:5.7	I have these four powers:	NA
an9.5:5.8	the powers of wisdom, energy, blamelessness, and inclusiveness.	NA
an9.5:5.9	A witless person might fear for their livelihood.	NA
an9.5:5.10	A lazy person might fear for their livelihood.	NA
an9.5:5.11	A person who does blameworthy things by way of body, speech, and mind might fear for their livelihood.	NA
an9.5:5.12	A person who does not include others might fear for their livelihood.	NA
an9.5:5.13	I have no fear of disrepute …	NA
an9.5:5.14	I have no fear about feeling insecure in an assembly …	NA
an9.5:5.15	I have no fear of death …	NA
an9.5:5.16	I have no fear of a bad rebirth.	NA
an9.5:5.17	Why would I be afraid of that?	NA
an9.5:5.18	I have these four powers:	NA
an9.5:5.19	the powers of wisdom, energy, blamelessness, and inclusiveness.	NA
an9.5:5.20	A witless person might be afraid of a bad rebirth.	NA
an9.5:5.21	A lazy person might be afraid of a bad rebirth.	NA
an9.5:5.22	A person who does blameworthy things by way of body, speech, and mind might be afraid of a bad rebirth.	NA

These “impossibilities” are mentioned in a few suttas. However none of them are at Rajagaha, so the provenance of this sutta and the next are unclear. At MN 76 the five are taught to Sandaka at Kosambī. At DN 29 the nine (of this sutta, not the next) are taught to Cunda in the Sakyan country. And at DN 33 the five are taught by Sariputta at Pava.

an9.8:2.2	There I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:	NA
an9.8:2.3	‘A mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—can’t transgress in five respects.	NA
an9.8:2.4	A mendicant with defilements ended can’t deliberately take the life of a living creature, take something with the intention to steal, have sex, tell a deliberate lie, or store up goods for their own enjoyment like they did as a lay person.’	NA
an9.8:2.5	I trust I properly heard, learned, applied the mind, and remembered that from the Buddha?”	NA
an9.8:3.1	“Indeed, Sajjha, you properly heard, learned, applied the mind, and remembered that.	NA
an9.8:3.2	In the past, as today, I say this:	NA
an9.8:3.3	‘A mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—can’t transgress in nine respects.	NA
an9.8:3.4	A mendicant with defilements ended can’t deliberately kill a living creature, take something with the intention to steal, have sex, tell a deliberate lie, or store up goods for their own enjoyment like they used to as a lay person. And they can’t abandon the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, or the training.’	The PTS edition (his “Ee” ) gives the same reading as the MS, but has the “gati” reading as a variant. Here BB repeats the previous sutta. He doesn’t comment, so it’s unclear if this is an oversight. If, however that reading is accepted, there is little reason to include the sutta as a separate text.
an9.8:3.5	In the past, as today, I say this:	NA
an9.8:3.6	‘A mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—can’t transgress in these nine respects.’”	NA

an9.11:1.5	“Please, Sāriputta, go at your convenience.”	NA
an9.11:1.6	Then Sāriputta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	NA
an9.11:1.7	And then, not long after Sāriputta had left, a certain monk said to the Buddha,	NA
an9.11:1.8	“Sir, Venerable Sāriputta attacked me and left without saying sorry.”	NA

an9.11:1.14	“Yes, reverend,” Sāriputta replied.	NA
an9.11:2.1	Now at that time the Venerables Mahāmoggallāna and Ānanda, taking a latchkey, went from dwelling to dwelling, saying:	NA

an9.11:2.4	Then Venerable Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:	NA

an9.11:13.1	Then that monk rose from his seat, placed his robe over one shoulder, bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said,	NA
an9.11:13.2	“I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to speak ill of Venerable Sāriputta with an incorrect, hollow, false, untruthful claim.	NA

an9.11:13.4	“Indeed, monk, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to act in that way.	NA
an9.11:13.5	But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it.	NA
an9.11:13.6	For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.”	NA

an9.12:1.7	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.	NA

an9.20:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
an9.20:1.2	Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	NA
an9.20:2.1	“Householder, I wonder whether your family gives gifts?”	NA
an9.20:2.2	“It does, sir.	NA
an9.20:2.3	But only coarse gruel with false black pepper.”	NA
an9.20:2.4	“Householder, someone might give a gift that’s either coarse or fine.	NA
an9.20:2.5	But they give it carelessly, thoughtlessly, not with their own hand. They give the dregs, and they give without consideration for consequences.	NA
an9.20:2.6	Then wherever the result of any such gift manifests, their mind doesn’t incline toward enjoyment of nice food, clothes, vehicles, or the five refined kinds of sensual stimulation.	NA

an9.20:3.1	Someone might give a gift that’s either coarse or fine.	NA

an9.20:3.5	Why is that?	NA
an9.20:3.6	Because that is the result of deeds done carefully.	NA
an9.20:4.1	Once upon a time, householder, there was a brahmin named Velāma.	NA
an9.20:4.2	He gave the following gift, a great offering.	NA
an9.20:4.3	84,000 gold cups filled with silver. 84,000 silver cups filled with gold. 84,000 bronze cups filled with gold coins. 84,000 elephants with gold adornments and banners, covered with snow gold netting. 84,000 chariots upholstered with the hide of lions, tigers, and leopards, and cream rugs, with gold adornments and banners, covered with snow gold netting. 84,000 milk cows with silken reins and bronze pails. 84,000 maidens bedecked with jeweled earrings. 84,000 couches spread with woolen covers—shag-piled, pure white, or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide, with canopies above and red pillows at both ends. 8,400,000,000 fine cloths of linen, cotton, silk, and wool. And who can say how much food, drink, snacks, meals, refreshments, and beverages? It seemed like an overflowing river.	NA
an9.20:5.1	Householder, you might think:	NA
an9.20:5.2	‘Surely the brahmin Velāma must have been someone else at that time?’	NA
an9.20:5.3	But you should not see it like this.	NA
an9.20:5.4	I myself was the brahmin Velāma at that time.	NA
an9.20:5.5	I gave that gift, a great offering.	NA
an9.20:5.6	But at that event there was no-one worthy of a religious donation, and no-one to purify the religious donation.	NA
an9.20:6.1	It would be more fruitful to feed one person accomplished in view than that great offering of Velāma.	NA

an9.35:0.3	The Simile of the Cow	NA
an9.35:1.1	“Mendicants, suppose there was a mountain cow who was foolish, incompetent, unskillful, and lacked common sense when roaming on rugged mountains.	Note that akettannu is only used twice in the EBTs, here and AN6.57. Since here it clearly has aliteral sense, I think this should be retained; it’s not a commn term that has escaped its metaphor.
an9.35:1.2	She might think,	NA
an9.35:1.3	‘Why don’t I go somewhere I’ve never been before? I could eat grass and drink water that I’ve never tried before.’	NA
an9.35:1.4	She’d take a step with a fore-hoof; but before it was properly set down, she’d lift up a hind-hoof.	NA
an9.35:1.5	She wouldn’t go somewhere she’d never been before, or eat grass and drink water that she’d never tried before.	NA
an9.35:1.6	And she’d never return safely to the place she had started from.	NA
an9.35:1.7	NA	NA
an9.35:1.8	Why is that?	NA
an9.35:1.9	Because that mountain cow was foolish, incompetent, unskillful, and lacked common sense when roaming on rugged mountains.	NA
an9.35:1.10	In the same way, some foolish, incompetent, unskillful mendicant, lacking common sense, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
an9.35:1.11	But they don’t cultivate, develop, and make much of that basis; they don’t ensure it is properly stabilized.	BB’s translation here misses the mark. Nimitta is not object, and never is. Nor is it the “sign” of meditation as translated by Hare. Ṭhānissaro’s “theme” is a little better, but still misses the point. In meditation contexts, the nimitta is the cause, basis, or foundation for other qualities to grow. In this case, the first _jhāna_ is the **foundation** for developing the second _jhāna_. Moreover, BB’s translation of other terms here is not ideal. “Pursues” for asevati sounds like the meditator is running after to to catch up! But it just means “repeat, practice, do again and again”. Finally, “focus”, rarely an ideal choice for adhitthati, misses the mark once more. The most common connotation is “decision, certainty”. It’s added here in double emphasis to show that the meditator is “sure” and “fixed” in the first _jhāna_ before proceeding to the next.

an9.37:1.1	At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery.	NA
an9.37:1.2	There Ānanda addressed the mendicants:	NA
an9.37:1.3	“Reverends, mendicants!”	NA
an9.37:1.4	“Reverend,” they replied.	NA
an9.37:1.5	Ānanda said this:	NA
an9.37:2.1	“It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing!	NA
an9.37:2.2	How this Blessed One who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, has found an opening amid confinement. It’s in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment.	NA
an9.37:2.3	The eye itself is actually present, and so are those sights. Yet one will not experience that sense-field.	NA
an9.37:2.4	The ear itself is actually present, and so are those sounds. Yet one will not experience that sense-field.	NA
an9.37:2.5	The nose itself is actually present, and so are those smells. Yet one will not experience that sense-field.	NA
an9.37:2.6	The tongue itself is actually present, and so are those tastes. Yet one will not experience that sense-field.	NA
an9.37:2.7	The body itself is actually present, and so are those touches. Yet one will not experience that sense-field.”	NA
an9.37:3.1	When he said this, Venerable Udāyī said to Venerable Ānanda:	NA
an9.37:3.2	“Reverend Ānanda, is one who doesn’t experience that sense-field actually percipient or not?”	NA
an9.37:3.3	“Reverend, one who doesn’t experience that sense-field is actually percipient, not non-percipient.”	NA
an9.37:4.1	“But what does one who doesn’t experience that sense-field perceive?”	NA
an9.37:4.2	“It’s when a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.	NA
an9.37:4.3	One who doesn’t experience that sense-field perceives in this way.	NA
an9.37:5.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness.	NA
an9.37:5.2	One who doesn’t experience that sense-field perceives in this way.	NA
an9.37:6.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.	NA
an9.37:6.2	One who doesn’t experience that sense-field perceives in this way.	NA
an9.37:7.1	Reverend, this one time I was staying near Sāketa in the deer park in Añjana Wood.	NA
an9.37:7.2	Then the nun Jaṭilagāhikā came up to me, bowed, stood to one side, and said to me:	NA
an9.37:7.3	‘Honorable Ānanda, regarding the immersion that does not lean forward or pull back, and is not held in place by forceful suppression.	NA
an9.37:7.4	Being free, it’s stable. Being stable, it’s content. Being content, one is not anxious.	NA
an9.37:7.5	What did the Buddha say was the fruit of this immersion?’	NA
an9.37:8.1	When she said this, I said to her:	NA
an9.37:8.2	‘Sister, regarding the immersion that does not lean forward or pull back, and is not held in place by forceful suppression.	NA
an9.37:8.3	Being free, it’s stable. Being stable, it’s content. Being content, one is not anxious.	NA
an9.37:8.4	The Buddha said that the fruit of this immersion is enlightenment.’	NA
an9.37:8.5	One who doesn’t experience that sense-field perceives in this way, too.”	NA

an9.38:0.3	Brahmin Cosmologists	NA
an9.38:1.1	Then two brahmin cosmologists went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
an9.38:1.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:	NA
an9.38:2.1	“Worthy Gotama, Pūraṇa Kassapa claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus:	Sources for Pūraṇa Kassapa are slim, but he was regarded as a great teacher of the Ājīvakas, whose founder the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla was said to be omniscient (Basham, *History and Doctrines of the Ājīvikas*, 275–6).
an9.38:2.2	‘Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.’	NA
an9.38:2.3	He says:	NA
an9.38:2.4	‘With infinite knowledge I know and see that the cosmos is infinite.’	NA
an9.38:2.5	And the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan also claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus:	Extant Jain texts have no shortage of such claims (eg. Sūyagaḍa1.6, Kalpasūtra 1, Bhagavatisūtra 4.10, etc.), and it seems likely that this was part of Mahāvīra’s teachings.
an9.38:2.6	‘Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.’	NA
an9.38:2.7	He says:	NA
an9.38:2.8	‘With infinite knowledge I know and see that the cosmos is finite.’	Here the MS reading is obviously wrong. Also see BB’s interesting note, which establishes that this is, in fact, a misrepresentation of Mahavira’s views.
an9.38:2.9	These two claim to speak from knowledge, but they directly contradict each other. Which one of them speaks the truth, and which falsehood?”	NA
an9.38:3.1	“Enough, brahmins, let that be.	segment  SEE The Buddha responded the same way when asked this question by the brahmin Piṅgalakoccha ([mn30:2.6]()), and to a similar question at [an9.38:3.2]().
an9.38:3.2	NA	NA
an9.38:3.3	NA	NA
an9.38:3.4	I will teach you the Dhamma.	NA
an9.38:3.5	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
an9.38:3.6	“Yes, worthy sir,” those brahmins replied.	NA
an9.38:3.7	The Buddha said this:	NA
an9.38:4.1	“Suppose there were four men standing in the four quarters. Each of them was extremely fast, with an extremely mighty stride.	I don’t think we should include gatiya as BB, since it is not mentioned in what follows.
an9.38:4.2	They’re as fast as a light arrow easily shot across the shadow of a palm tree by a well-trained expert archer with a strong bow.	NA
an9.38:4.3	Their stride was such that it spanned from the eastern ocean to the western ocean.	NA
an9.38:4.4	Then the man standing in the east would say:	NA
an9.38:4.5	‘I will reach the end of the world by traveling.’	NA
an9.38:4.6	Though he’d travel for his whole lifespan of a hundred years—pausing only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness—he’d die along the way, never reaching the end of the world.	NA
an9.38:4.7	Then the man standing in the west …	NA
an9.38:4.8	Then the man standing in the north …	NA
an9.38:4.9	Then the man standing in the south would say:	NA

an9.38:4.11	Though he’d travel for his whole lifespan of a hundred years—pausing only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness—he’d die along the way, never reaching the end of the world.	NA
an9.38:4.12	Why is that?	NA
an9.38:4.13	I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by running like this.	NA
an9.38:4.14	But I also say there’s no making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world.	NA

I follow Bodhi’s emended reading _andhamakāsi_ (“blinded Māra”) for this passage (note 1393 of *Numerical Discourses*). | This passage is highly compressed in the PTS edition, which probably represents the manuscripts more exactly. It has been expanded in both Mahāsaṅgīti and BJT editions. MS edition includes _tiṇṇo loke visattikaṁ_ here, which has been improperly added from the final item. All editions omit _tasmiṁ samaye_ (“at that time”) from the formless sections, which start here. Bodhi has included this phrase in his translation, probably by restoring the PTS text, but this is unwarranted. Rather, the relative _yasmiṁ_ (“when”) is answered by the demonstrative _ayaṁ_ (“this”).

an9.40:1.2	When the wild bull elephant is engrossed in the pasture, but other elephants—males, females, younglings, or cubs—eat the broken branches that he has dragged down, the wild bull elephant is horrified, repelled, and disgusted by that.	I have no idea why BB translates “bent and twisted bundle of branches.” The “me” is supplied from the elephants reflection below. The point of this simile is that he, as tallest and strongest of the herd, pulls down the choice branches, but they eat them before he gets the chance. Here and above, pasuta is not “headed for” as in BB, but “engrossed in”. Otherwise the similes don’t make sense.

an9.40:2.4	Why don’t I live alone, withdrawn from the herd?’	NA
an9.40:2.5	After some time he lives alone, withdrawn from the herd, and he eats untrampled grass, and other elephants don’t eat the broken branches he has dragged down. He doesn’t drink muddy water, and the female elephants don’t bump into him after his bath.	NA
an9.40:3.1	At that time the wild bull elephant thinks:	NA

an9.40:5.4	Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.	NA
an9.40:5.5	Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.	NA

an10.20:7.1	And how has a mendicant eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth?	NA

an10.21:1.4	and roars his lion’s roar three times.	NA
an10.21:1.5	Then he sets out on the hunt.	NA
an10.21:1.6	Why is that?	NA
an10.21:1.7	‘May I not injure any little creatures on unclear ground.’	NA
an10.21:2.1	‘Lion’ is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
an10.21:2.2	When the Realized One teaches Dhamma to an assembly, this is his lion’s roar.	NA
an10.21:3.1	The Realized One possesses ten powers of a Realized One. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.	NA
an10.21:3.2	What ten?	NA
an10.21:3.3	Firstly, the Realized One truly understands the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible.	NA
an10.21:3.4	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.	NA
an10.21:4.1	Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of grounds and causes.	NA
an10.21:4.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …	NA
an10.21:5.1	Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands where all paths of practice lead.	NA
an10.21:5.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …	NA
an10.21:6.1	Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the world with its many and diverse elements.	NA

an10.21:8.1	Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the faculties of other sentient beings and other individuals after comprehending them with his mind.	BB has “the superior or inferior condition of the faculties …” following the comms. It’s not implausible, but it seems to me unnecessary, and a little programmatic. Surely spiritual faculties are not simply better or worse, but of different nature and character, and it is this that is seen. The term is indriya-paro-pariyatta “faculty-other-comprehended”. The last term = paricca, which is normally used in mind-reading contexts.
an10.21:8.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …	NA
an10.21:9.1	Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments.	NA
an10.21:9.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …	NA
an10.21:10.1	Furthermore, the Realized One recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. He remembers: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ Thus he recollects his many past lives, with features and details.	NA
an10.21:10.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …	NA
an10.21:11.1	Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Realized One sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, he sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	NA
an10.21:11.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …	NA
an10.21:12.1	Furthermore, the Realized One has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.	NA

an10.22:1.1	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:	NA
an10.22:2.1	“Ānanda, I claim to be assured regarding the teachings that lead to realizing by insight the various different hypotheses.	NA
an10.22:2.2	So I am able to teach the Dhamma in appropriate ways to different people. Practicing accordingly, when something exists they’ll know it exists. When it doesn’t exist they’ll know it doesn’t exist. When something is inferior they’ll know it’s inferior. When it’s superior they’ll know it’s superior. When something is not supreme they’ll know it’s not supreme. When it is supreme they’ll know it’s supreme.	NA
an10.22:2.3	And they will know or see or realize it in whatever way it should be known or seen or realized. This is possible.	NA
an10.22:2.4	But this is the unsurpassable knowledge, that is: truly knowing each and every case.	BB’s “these things and those things” misses the point. Rather than specific cases—this or that—the understanding based on principle is universal, and hence surpasses the previous particular knowledges. Compare SN 1.26 where the light of a fire is better than that of the sun and moon in that it is universal, i.e. shines by day or night.

an10.25:1.1	“Mendicants, there are these ten universal dimensions of meditation.	BB perpetuates the historical misunderstanding that kasina means “disk” in the suttas. It does not, as should be obvious from this sutta. It means “universal”. The root means “universal, totality”. It is not a term for the physical object on which meditation is based, but for the “universal, non-dual, measureless” state of mind produced by meditation. As such it is virtually a synonym for samadhi, but used in a more specific sense.

an10.26:0.3	With Kāḷī	NA
an10.26:1.1	At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying in the land of the Avantis near Kuraraghara on Steep Mountain.	Note that both the name of the town and the name of the mountain appear in several locations with several spelling variations. I’ve opted to translate the mountain name, assuming papāta as the reading.
an10.26:1.2	Then the laywoman Kāḷī of Kurughara went up to Venerable Mahākaccāna, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
an10.26:1.3	“Sir, this was said by the Buddha in ‘The Maidens’ Questions’:	NA
an10.26:2.1	‘I’ve reached the goal, peace of heart.	NA
an10.26:2.2	Having conquered the army <j>of the likable and pleasant,	NA
an10.26:2.3	alone, practicing absorption, I awakened to bliss.	NA
an10.26:2.4	That’s why I don’t get too close to people,	NA
an10.26:2.5	and no-one gets too close to me.’	NA
an10.26:3.1	How should we see the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement?”	NA
an10.26:4.1	“Sister, some ascetics and brahmins regard the attainment of the meditation on universal earth to be the ultimate. Thinking ‘this is the goal’, they are reborn.	BB has “generated” here, taking abhinibbatti to refer to the meditation state. But I don’t see why the normal meaning of reborn shouldn’t apply. In MN 26, eg, the problem is that they would practice a meditation that leads to rebirth in the appropriate sphere.
an10.26:4.2	The Buddha directly knew the extent to which the attainment of the meditation on universal earth was the ultimate.	NA
an10.26:4.3	Directly knowing this he saw the beginning, the drawback, and the escape. And he saw the knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path.	See BB for note on variant; _ādi_ is supported by the Chinese text at SA 549.
an10.26:4.4	Because he saw the beginning, the drawback, and the escape, and he saw the knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path, he knew that he had reached the goal, peace of heart.	NA
an10.26:5.1	Some ascetics and brahmins regard the attainment of the meditation on universal water to be the ultimate. Thinking ‘this is the goal’, they are reborn. …	NA

an10.27:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
an10.27:1.2	Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	NA
an10.27:1.3	Then it occurred to him,	NA
an10.27:1.4	“It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī.	NA
an10.27:1.5	Why don’t we visit the monastery of the wanderers of other religions?”	NA
an10.27:2.1	Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there.	NA
an10.27:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them:	NA
an10.27:3.1	“Reverends, the ascetic Gotama teaches his disciples like this:	NA
an10.27:3.2	‘Please, mendicants, directly know all things. Meditate having directly known all things.’	This is a not very good quote from AN 7.61. The text there supports BB’s suggestion that the singular here serves for the plural. However, also note that BB uses phenomena for dhamma here and things there. In this case, I understand dhamma to include “phenomena “and” principles”, so “things” is better.
an10.27:3.3	We too teach our disciples:	NA
an10.27:3.4	‘Please, reverends, directly know all things. Live having directly known all things.’	NA
an10.27:3.5	What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?”	NA
an10.27:4.1	Those mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers of other religions.	NA
an10.27:4.2	They got up from their seat, thinking,	NA
an10.27:4.3	“We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.”	NA
an10.27:5.1	Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	NA

an10.27:9.2	‘One thing: question, summary recital, and answer. Two … three … four … five … six … seven … eight … nine … ten things: question, summary recital, and answer.’	This is an odd sutta.

The identification of osadhitaraka is not straightforward. In Sanskrit it seems to mean only “moon”. And in the stock Pali phrase Obhāsentī disā sabbā, osadhī viya tārakā it seems unlikely the morning star is meant, more likely the moon. This is strongly connected with the healing power of herbs, especially the soma. However in MN 79 and MN80 we find the osadhitaraka mentioned in a list of ascending brightness, from a fire, to the osadhi to the moon, to the sun. That the osadhi is said to shine towards dawn strengthens the identification with Venus; the Chinese parallels confirm this. However at SN 2.29 a similar sequence of ascending brightness appears, which omits canda. And at Iti 27 the osadhi is placed awkwardly after the moon and sun.

an10.29:18.1	The best of these four perceptions is when a person, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, perceives the dimension of nothingness.	NA
an10.29:18.2	Some sentient beings perceive like this.	NA
an10.29:18.3	But even the sentient beings who perceive like this decay and perish.	NA

an10.29:19.1	This is the best of the convictions of outsiders, that is: ‘I might not be, and it might not be mine. I will not be, and it will not be mine.’	NA
an10.29:19.2	When someone has such a view, you can expect	NA
an10.29:19.3	that they will not be attracted to continued existence,	NA
an10.29:19.4	and they will not be repulsed by the cessation of continued existence.	NA
an10.29:19.5	Some sentient beings have such a view.	NA
an10.29:19.6	But even the sentient beings who have views like this decay and perish.	NA
an10.29:19.7	Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with it.	NA
an10.29:19.8	Their desire fades away even for the foremost, let alone the inferior.	NA
an10.29:20.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who advocate the ultimate purity of the spirit.	According to Ñāṇadīpa (_The Silent Sages of Old_, note 9) all Sinhalese manuscripts here have _paramayakkhavisuddhiṁ_, whereas other manuscripts have _paramatthavisuddhiṁ_. The phrase “highest purity of the spirit” occurs in a similar context at [snp 4.11:14.4](). The commentary glosses _uttamatthavisuddhiṁ_, the “highest purity of the goal”. _Yakkha_ is, however, a more satisfactory reading; perhaps the commentary originally had _uttamattavisuddhiṁ_, “highest purity of the self”, where _atta_ would have been a gloss of _yakkha_. | While _yakkha_ (Sanskrit _yakṣa_) is normally a worldly deity, he is identified with the ultimate Brahman, i.e. the cosmic self, at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.4.1 and Kena Upaniṣad 4.1.
an10.29:20.2	This is the best of the advocates of the ultimate purity of the spirit, that is, when someone, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	NA
an10.29:20.3	They teach Dhamma in order to directly know and realize this.	NA
an10.29:20.4	Some sentient beings have such a doctrine.	NA
an10.29:20.5	But even the sentient beings who have such a doctrine decay and perish.	NA
an10.29:20.6	Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with it.	By this the Buddha is referring to the Brahmanical teacher Uddaka Rāmaputta, who taught the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, but who passed away. It was due to the fact that his doctrine did not lead to an escape from the cycle of birth and death that the Buddha became disillusioned with it ([mn26:16.13]()).
an10.29:20.7	Their desire fades away even for the foremost, let alone the inferior.	NA
an10.29:21.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who advocate ultimate extinguishment in this very life.	NA
an10.29:21.2	This is the best of those who advocate extinguishment in this very life, that is, liberation by not grasping after truly understanding the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of the six fields of contact.	NA
an10.29:21.3	Though I state and assert this, certain ascetics and brahmins misrepresent me with the incorrect, hollow, false, untruthful claim:	NA
an10.29:21.4	‘The ascetic Gotama doesn’t advocate the complete understanding of sensual pleasures, forms, or feelings.’	Treated in detail at [mn13](); also see [an3.126]().
an10.29:21.5	But I do advocate the complete understanding of sensual pleasures, forms, and feelings. And I advocate full extinguishment by not grasping in this very life, wishless, quenched, and cooled.”	NA

an10.30:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
an10.30:1.2	Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala returned from combat after winning a battle and succeeding in his objective.	NA
an10.30:1.3	Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went to the monastery.	NA
an10.30:1.4	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot.	NA
an10.30:1.5	At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air.	NA
an10.30:1.6	Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to them and said,	NA
an10.30:1.7	“Sirs, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?	NA
an10.30:1.8	For I want to see the Buddha.”	NA
an10.30:1.9	“Great king, that’s his dwelling, with the door closed. Approach it quietly, without hurrying; go onto the porch, clear your throat, and knock on the door-panel. The Buddha will open the door.”	NA
an10.30:2.1	So the king approached the Buddha’s dwelling, cleared his throat and knocked on the door-panel, and the Buddha opened the door.	NA
an10.30:2.2	Then King Pasenadi entered the Buddha’s dwelling. He bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name:	NA
an10.30:2.3	“Sir, I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!	NA
an10.30:2.4	I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!”	NA
an10.30:3.1	“But great king, for what reason do you demonstrate such utmost devotion for this body, conveying your manifest love?”	NA
an10.30:3.2	“Sir, it’s because of my gratitude and thanks for the Buddha that I demonstrate such utmost devotion, conveying my manifest love.	NA
an10.30:4.1	The Buddha is practicing for the welfare and happiness of the people. He has established many people in the noble system, that is, the principles of goodness and skillfulness.	NA
an10.30:4.2	This is a reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.	NA
an10.30:5.1	Furthermore, the Buddha is ethical, possessing ethical conduct that is mature, noble, and skillful.	NA
an10.30:5.2	This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.	NA
an10.30:6.1	Furthermore, the Buddha lives in the wilderness, frequenting remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.	NA
an10.30:6.2	This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.	NA
an10.30:7.1	Furthermore, the Buddha is content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	NA
an10.30:7.2	This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.	NA
an10.30:8.1	Furthermore, the Buddha is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.	NA
an10.30:8.2	This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.	NA
an10.30:9.1	Furthermore, the Buddha gets to take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart, when he wants, without trouble or difficulty. That is, talk about fewness of wishes, contentment, seclusion, aloofness, arousing energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom.	NA
an10.30:9.2	This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.	NA
an10.30:10.1	Furthermore, the Buddha gets the four absorptions—blissful meditations in this life that belong to the higher mind—when he wants, without trouble or difficulty.	NA
an10.30:10.2	This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.	NA
an10.30:11.1	Furthermore, the Buddha recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. He remembers: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so he recollects his many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	NA
an10.30:11.2	This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.	NA
an10.30:12.1	Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	NA
an10.30:12.2	This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.	NA
an10.30:13.1	Furthermore, the Buddha has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.	NA
an10.30:13.2	This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.	NA
an10.30:14.1	Well, now, sir, I must go.	NA
an10.30:14.2	I have many duties, and much to do.”	NA
an10.30:14.3	“Please, great king, go at your convenience.”	NA

There, as it refers to an act made by the Buddha towards the end of his life, it cannot mean “intention leading to rebirth”. It must be a synonym of ayusankhara, and mean the “will to live”, “life force”, or something of the sort. In the current sutta, as per BB’s note it is not obvious in what sense intention would be meant here. The “sarira” refers, so far as i know, solely to the olarika kaya, so how are we to consider other realms? Normally, of course, ponobbhavika means “leading to rebirth”, but here I think it’s better to think of it in terms of being associated with ongoing rebirth.

an10.62:2.24	You should say: ‘Listening to an untrue teaching.’	BB has “not listening to the true teaching”. But where this negative form is used in MN 110, it has Asappuriso, bhikkhave, assaddhammasamannāgato hoti, which must mean “a bad person possesses an untrue teaching”. There, BB has “an untrue man is possessed of bad qualities” which agrees with the syntax I am proposing. Admittedly, there the context show dhamma must be “qualities”, while the association of dhamma here with savana shows that here it should be teachings. Similarly, below BB has “not associating with good persons” for asappurisesevana, but at SN 35.246 we have Asappurisasevito ceso maggo, na ceso maggo sappurisehi sevito. “This path is frequented by bad people, not by good people.”, which there BB translates as “This is a path followed by inferior people; it is not the path followed by superior people.”

an10.67:0.3	At Naḷakapāna (1st)	NA
an10.67:1.1	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Kosalans named Naḷakapāna.	NA
an10.67:1.2	There the Buddha stayed near Naḷakapāna in the grove of flame-of-the-forest trees.	Pali Text Society dictionary correctly says _palāsa_ is *Butea frondosa* (also called *Butea monosperma*). But it calls it the Judas tree, whereas the Judas tree is in fact *Cercis siliquastrum*, which is not native to India.
an10.67:1.3	Now, at that time it was the sabbath, and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by a Saṅgha of monks.	NA
an10.67:1.4	The Buddha spent much of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk. Then he looked around the Saṅgha of mendicants, who were so very silent. He addressed Venerable Sāriputta:	NA
an10.67:2.1	“Sāriputta, the Saṅgha of mendicants is rid of dullness and drowsiness.	NA

an10.67:2.5	“Yes, sir,” Sāriputta replied.	NA
an10.67:3.1	And then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.	catugguṇaṁ saṅghāṭiṁ paññāpetvā means “having spread out a four-fold sanghati”. BB translates thus in MN, but in SN and AN evidently takes pannapeti to refer to the act of folding rather than spreading. this is unlikely, since pannapeti is the standard term for setting out a seat. If we apply this to folding the robe, then the passages do not actually have the bit about making a seat. Furthermore, in SN he inconsistently takes pannapeti in a causal sense “had his robe folded”, but there are plenty of places that show this cannot work, as for example SN 16.11, where Kassapa obviously spreads out his own folded robe: the only other person present was the Buddha!

an10.84:2.4	Grilled in this way they get stuck or lose their way. They fall to ruin and disaster.	BB translates “flustered” evidently accepting vijina and the admittedly dubious meaning of vijina. But I can’t see any justification for that. It seems to me that following the unusual term irina we have another unusual term vipina, both of which are more or less synonyms: a wilderness, forest, etc. http://sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&q=vipina&lang=sans&action=Search The implication isn’t so much that they get emotionally upset, but that they “get stuck or lose their way”.

an10.89:4.1	Then Kokālika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	NA

an10.89:11.2	He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.	NA
an10.89:12.1	Then, late at night, the glorious divinity Sahampati, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	NA

an10.89:14.4	It’s not easy to calculate	NA
an10.89:14.5	how many years, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts.”	NA
an10.89:15.1	“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?”	NA
an10.89:15.2	“It’s possible,” said the Buddha.	NA
an10.89:15.3	“Suppose there was a Kosalan load of twenty packs of sesame seed. And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it.	The measure here is the _khārika_. A single horse in those days might draw a fully laden cart of around 500 kg. Divide by 20 makes 25 kg, which is roughly a bushel. Elsewhere a _khāri_ is a load carried by a single person on a journey ([dn3:2.4.7](), [ud6.2:2.1](), [ja509:1.3]()), so 25 kg is probably a little much, but in the ballpark. Modern sesame seeds vary between 0.0016 and 0.0037 grams. Assume a single seed of 2500 years ago was on the small side of this at 0.002 grams. Taking one every 100 years yields about 25 billion years. The current estimate of the age of the universe in physics is estimated at 13.8 billion years.
an10.89:15.4	By this means the Kosalan load of twenty packs of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell.	Ten hells are listed here, the names of which do not correspond with the 21 or 28 listed in Purāṇas, nor with the seven Jain hells, nor with the hells of [mn130](). The commentary offers three explanations for the obscure names of these hells: they are numbers reflecting the duration spent in Avīci; or they are the cries uttered by those suffering there; or they are simply the cold hells.
an10.89:15.5	Now, twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Nirabbuda hell.	NA
an10.89:15.6	Twenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Ababa hell.	NA
an10.89:15.7	Twenty lifetimes in the Ababa hell equal one lifetime in the Aṭaṭa hell.	NA
an10.89:15.8	Twenty lifetimes in the Aṭaṭa hell equal one lifetime in the Ahaha hell.	NA
an10.89:15.9	Twenty lifetimes in the Ahaha hell equal one lifetime in the Yellow Lotus hell.	NA
an10.89:15.10	Twenty lifetimes in the Yellow Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Fragrant Water Lily hell.	NA
an10.89:15.11	Twenty lifetimes in the Fragrant Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the Blue Water Lily hell.	NA
an10.89:15.12	Twenty lifetimes in the Blue Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the White Lotus hell.	NA
an10.89:15.13	Twenty lifetimes in the White Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Pink Lotus hell.	NA

an10.91:2.3	First, a pleasure seeker seeks wealth using illegitimate, coercive means.	Sahasa is related to the root for “power”, and the meaning “violent” is secondary (if indeed it applies at all in the Pali). It seems to me that it would include any business practices that involved intimidation, threats, or merely leveraging market position in unskillful ways. So I prefer coercion to BB’s violence.

It is explained as a ritual where the dead are buried until fully decayed, then exhumed. They wash them, arrange them, and honor them with scents and flowers. At an astrological conjunction they first weep and wail then celebrate. Similar “second funerals” are found among many peoples of the world as a way of both terminating the death process and honoring ancestors.

an10.115:4.1	Then those mendicants went to Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
an10.115:4.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. They told him what had happened, and said,	NA

an10.115:8.1	“Reverends, suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But he’d pass over the roots and trunk, imagining that the heartwood should be sought in the branches and leaves.	NA
an10.115:8.2	Such is the consequence for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the Buddha, you overlooked him, imagining that you should ask me about this matter.	BB has “And so it is with you” for evam sampamidam. But here sampada has the sense of “outcome, consequence”. This is an idiom always used in a context where someone has done something ill-advised, and has to deal with the consequences. Lit: “Such is the consequence for the venerables”. Idiomatically: “That’s what you get.”
an10.115:8.3	For he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the manifestation of divinity.

an10.115:9.5	You are capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha.	NA
an10.115:9.6	Please explain this, if it’s no trouble.”	This is an oddly difficult idiom. Compare with the “if” version at, say MN 75. Here BB has “without finding it troublesome”. Which is fine, but it seems to me the point of this version, as opposed to the if version, is that it returns agency to the addressee. It’s inviting them to give an unburdensome explanation. Literally it would be “making it unproblematic [for you]”, i.e. “without making a problem out of it.” But that sounds passive-aggressive, while the Pali is deferential and polite. It’s like a combination of “take it easy “and” keep it simple”. “if you don’t mind” is not really exact, but it is the only way I can see to keep the phrase as it should be, a minor politeism.

an10.176:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Pāvā in Cunda the smith’s mango grove.	NA
an10.176:1.3	Then Cunda the smith went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	NA
an10.176:1.4	“Cunda, whose purity do you believe in?”	NA
an10.176:1.5	“Sir, I believe in the purity advocated by the western brahmins draped with moss who carry pitchers, serve the sacred flame, and immerse themselves in water.”	kamandulaka: http://cdn.findmessages.com/images/2016/01/10-lord-shiva-sweetly-pouring-water-from-his-kama%E1%B9%87%E1%B8%8Dalu-on-the-head-of-baby-lord-ganesha.jpg

an10.176:2.2	“The western brahmins encourage their disciples like this:	NA
an10.176:2.3	‘Please, good people, rising early you should stroke the earth from your bed.	Note that the form of address is identical to that of the Jains in AN 3.70

an10.176:4.2	“Yes, sir,” Cunda replied.	NA
an10.176:4.3	The Buddha said this:	NA
an10.176:5.1	“Cunda, impurity is threefold by way of body,	NA

an10.176:7.1	They steal. With the intention to commit theft, they take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.	Theyyasankhata would seem to mean “what is considered to be theft”. However in Parajika 2 it is defined as theyyacitto avaharaṇacitto.
an10.176:8.1	They commit sexual misconduct. They have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal.	BB has “protected by their Dhamma”, with the note “protected by her co-religionists”. This is a surprisingly obscure detail, which I haven’t been able to source in the nikayas or their commentaries. However, the commentary to sanghadisesa 1 says: sagottehi pana sahadhammikehi ca ekaṁ satthāraṁ uddissa pabbajitehi ekagaṇapariyāpannehi ca rakkhitā so i guess this is where it stems from. It is possible, I guess, but it seems to me that the more obvious meaning would be that “dhamma” here simply means “what is right”.

an11.13:8.3	to have good friends who advise and instruct me out of kindness and sympathy.’	NA
an11.13:8.4	In this way you should establish mindfulness internally based on good friends.	NA

an11.13:10.2	‘There are deities who, surpassing the company of deities that consume solid food, are reborn in a certain host of mind-made deities. They don’t see in themselves anything more to do, or anything that needs improvement.’	BB’s translation is inconsistent with AN 5.166, and moreover I find it confusing. In addition, he comments that it is hard to determine where the quote is meant to end, and does so after the recapitulation. But the next two clauses use the vocative “Nandiya” so they can’t be meditation reflections. Finally, he comments that it is not clear what the reference of the text is, but it clearly relates to AN 5.166, where it refers to mendicants who are accomplished in sila, samadhi, and panna, and enter nirodhasamapatti, but are still reborn.
an11.13:10.3	An irreversibly freed mendicant doesn’t see in themselves anything more to do, or anything that needs improvement.	NA
an11.13:10.4	In the same way, Nandiya, there are deities who, surpassing the company of deities that consume solid food, are reborn in a certain host of mind-made deities. They don’t see in themselves anything more to do, or anything that needs improvement.	NA
an11.13:10.5	In this way you should establish mindfulness internally based on the deities.	NA
an11.13:11.1	A noble disciple who has these eleven qualities gives up bad, unskillful qualities and doesn’t cling to them.	NA

an11.14:1.2	“Subhūti, what is the name of this mendicant?”	NA
an11.14:1.3	“Sir, the name of this mendicant is Saddha. He is the son of the layman Sudatta, and has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness.”	Most manuscripts read the layman’s name as _saddha_, and this reading is accepted by Bodhi, but he does not treat it as a proper name. However the commentary clearly identifies this as Anāthapiṇḍika, so it must be Sudatta.

an11.14:3.3	The Buddha said this:	NA
an11.14:4.1	“Firstly, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.	NA
an11.14:4.2	When a mendicant is ethical, this is evidence of faith.	NA
an11.14:5.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, rehearsing them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.	NA
an11.14:5.2	When a mendicant is learned, this is evidence of faith.	NA
an11.14:6.1	Furthermore, a mendicant has good friends, companions, and associates.	NA
an11.14:6.2	When a mendicant has good friends, this is evidence of faith.	NA
an11.14:7.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is easy to admonish, having qualities that make them easy to admonish. They’re patient, and take instruction respectfully.	NA
an11.14:7.2	When a mendicant is easy to admonish, this is evidence of faith.	NA
an11.14:8.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is deft and tireless in a diverse spectrum of duties for their spiritual companions, understanding how to go about things in order to complete and organize the work.	NA
an11.14:8.2	When a mendicant is deft and tireless in a diverse spectrum of duties, this is evidence of faith.	NA
an11.14:9.1	Furthermore, a mendicant loves the teachings and is a delight to converse with, being full of joy in the teaching and training.	NA
an11.14:9.2	When a mendicant loves the teachings, this is evidence of faith.	NA
an11.14:10.1	Furthermore, a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.	NA
an11.14:10.2	When a mendicant is energetic, this is evidence of faith.	NA
an11.14:11.1	Furthermore, a mendicant gets the four absorptions—blissful meditations in this life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.	NA
an11.14:11.2	When a mendicant gets the four absorptions, this is evidence of faith.	NA
an11.14:12.1	Furthermore, a mendicant recollects many kinds of past lives.	NA
an11.14:12.2	That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	NA
an11.14:12.3	When a mendicant recollects many kinds of past lives, this is evidence of faith.	NA
an11.14:13.1	Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, a mendicant sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	NA
an11.14:13.2	When a mendicant has clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, this is evidence of faith.	NA

an11.16:0.3	The Wealthy Citizen	NA
an11.16:1.1	At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva.	_Dasama_ means “tenth”, explained by the commentary as meaning he was tenth in line in his family. | _Aṭṭhakanāgara_ is usually taken to be the name of a city, but neither the city nor the possessive form _nāgara_ appear elsewhere. Since all we know of him is that he was very rich; since the Pali is in the habit of naming people after their prominent quality; and since we find elsewhere a man named after his wealth (Dhaniya at [snp1.2]()), perhaps we should take _aṭṭhaka_ from _artha_ in the sense of “wealthy”, which agrees with the later Sanskrit sense of _nāgara_ as “prominent citizen”.
an11.16:1.2	Now at that time the householder Dasama, a wealthy citizen, had arrived at Pāṭaliputta on some business.	NA
