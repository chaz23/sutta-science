dhp5:1	For never is hatred
dhp5:2	settled by hate,
dhp5:3	it’s only settled by love: 
dhp5:4	this is an ancient law. 
dhp6:1	Others don’t understand
dhp6:2	that here we need to be restrained.
dhp6:3	But those who do understand this,
dhp6:4	being clever, settle their conflicts.
dhp7:1	Those who contemplate the beautiful,
dhp7:2	their faculties unrestrained,

dhp8:1	Those who contemplate the ugly,
dhp8:2	their faculties well-restrained,
dhp8:3	eating in moderation,

dhp9:1	One who, not free of stains themselves,

dhp10:3	possessed of self-control and of truth,
dhp10:4	they are truly worthy of the ocher robe.
dhp11:1	Thinking the inessential is essential,
dhp11:2	seeing the essential as inessential;
dhp11:3	they don’t realize the essential,

dhp12:1	Having known the essential as essential,
dhp12:2	and the inessential as inessential;

dhp19:1	Much though they may recite scripture,
dhp19:2	if a negligent person does not apply them,
dhp19:3	then, like a cowherd who counts the cattle of others,
dhp19:4	they miss out on the blessings of the ascetic life.
dhp20:1	Little though they may recite scripture,
dhp20:2	if they live in line with the teachings,

dhp116:0.3	Wickedness
dhp116:1	Rush to do good,
dhp116:2	shield your mind from evil;
dhp116:3	for when you’re slow to do good,
dhp116:4	your thoughts delight in wickedness.
dhp117:1	If you do something bad,
dhp117:2	don’t do it again and again,
dhp117:3	don’t set your heart on it,
dhp117:4	for piling up evil is suffering.
dhp118:1	If you do something good,
dhp118:2	do it again and again,
dhp118:3	set your heart on it,
dhp118:4	for piling up goodness is joyful.
dhp119:1	Even the wicked see good things,

dhp123:1	Avoid wickedness,
dhp123:2	as a merchant with rich cargo and small escort
dhp123:3	would avoid a dangerous road,
dhp123:4	or one who loves life would avoid drinking poison.
dhp124:1	You can carry poison in your hand
dhp124:2	if it has no wound,
dhp124:3	for poison does not infect without a wound;
dhp124:4	nothing bad happens unless you do bad.
dhp125:1	Whoever wrongs a man who has done no wrong, 
dhp125:2	a pure man who has not a blemish, 
dhp125:3	the evil backfires on the fool, 
dhp125:4	like fine dust thrown upwind.
dhp126:1	Some are born in a womb;

dhp131:1	Creatures love happiness,

dhp132:1	Creatures love happiness,
dhp132:2	so if you don’t hurt them with a stick
dhp132:3	in search of your own happiness,
dhp132:4	after death you will find happiness.
dhp133:1	Don’t speak harshly,
dhp133:2	they may speak harshly back.
dhp133:3	For aggressive speech is painful,
dhp133:4	and the rod may spring back on you.
dhp134:1	If you still yourself
dhp134:2	like a broken gong,
dhp134:3	you’re quenched
dhp134:4	and conflict-free.
dhp135:1	As a cowherd drives the cows
dhp135:2	to pasture with the rod,
dhp135:3	so too old age and death
dhp135:4	drive life from living beings.
dhp136:1	The fool does not understand
dhp136:2	the evil that they do.
dhp136:3	But because of those deeds, that dullard
dhp136:4	is tormented as if burnt by fire.
dhp137:1	One who violently attacks
dhp137:2	the peaceful and the innocent
dhp137:3	swiftly falls
dhp137:4	to one of ten bad states:

dhp139:2	vicious slander;
dhp139:3	loss of kin;
dhp139:4	destruction of wealth;
dhp140:1	or else their home
dhp140:2	is consumed by fire.
dhp140:3	When their body breaks up, that witless person 
dhp140:4	is reborn in hell. 
dhp141:1	Not nakedness, nor matted hair, nor mud,
dhp141:2	nor fasting, nor lying on bare ground,
dhp141:3	nor wearing dust and dirt, or squatting on the heels,
dhp141:4	will cleanse a mortal not free of doubt.
dhp142:1	Dressed-up they may be, but if they live well—
dhp142:2	peaceful, tamed, committed to the spiritual path,
dhp142:3	having laid aside violence towards all creatures—
dhp142:4	they are a brahmin, an ascetic, a mendicant.
dhp143:1	Can a person constrained by conscience 
dhp143:2	be found in the world? 
dhp143:3	Who shies away from blame, 
dhp143:4	like a fine horse from the whip?
dhp144:1	Like a fine horse under the whip,
dhp144:2	be keen and full of urgency.
dhp144:3	With faith, ethics, and energy,
dhp144:4	immersion, and investigation of principles,
dhp144:5	accomplished in knowledge and conduct, mindful,
dhp144:6	give up this vast suffering.
dhp145:1	While irrigators guide water,
dhp145:2	fletchers shape arrows,
dhp145:3	and carpenters carve timber—
dhp145:4	those true to their vows tame themselves.

dhp147:1	See this fancy puppet,

dhp148:1	This body is decrepit and frail, 
dhp148:2	a nest of disease.

dhp150:2	plastered with flesh and blood,
dhp150:3	old age and death are stashed away,
dhp150:4	along with conceit and contempt.
dhp151:1	Fancy chariots of kings wear out,

dhp153:1	Transmigrating through countless rebirths,
dhp153:2	I’ve journeyed without reward,
dhp153:3	searching for the house-builder;
dhp153:4	painful is birth again and again.
dhp154:1	I’ve seen you, house-builder!
dhp154:2	You won’t build a house again!
dhp154:3	Your rafters are all broken,
dhp154:4	your roof-peak is demolished.
dhp154:5	My mind, set on demolition,
dhp154:6	has reached the end of craving.
dhp155:1	When young they spurned the spiritual path
dhp155:2	and failed to earn any wealth.

dhp184:2	Extinguishment is the ultimate, say the Buddhas. 
dhp184:3	No true renunciate injures another,

dhp185:6	this is the instruction of the Buddhas.
dhp186:1	Even if it were raining money,
dhp186:2	you’d not be sated in sensual pleasures.
dhp186:3	An astute person understands that sensual pleasures
dhp186:4	offer little gratification and much suffering.
dhp187:1	Thus they find no delight

dhp188:1	So many go for refuge

dhp188:4	those people are driven by fear.
dhp189:1	But such refuge is no sanctuary,
dhp189:2	it is no supreme refuge.
dhp189:3	By going to that refuge,
dhp189:4	you’re not released from suffering.
dhp190:1	One gone for refuge to the Buddha,
dhp190:2	to his teaching and to the Saṅgha,
dhp190:3	sees the four noble truths
dhp190:4	with right understanding:

dhp191:2	suffering’s transcendence,
dhp191:3	and the noble eightfold path
dhp191:4	that leads to the stilling of suffering.
dhp192:1	Such refuge is a sanctuary,
dhp192:2	it is the supreme refuge.
dhp192:3	By going to that refuge,
dhp192:4	you’re released from all suffering.
dhp193:1	It’s hard to find a thoroughbred man
dhp193:2	they’re not born just anywhere.
dhp193:3	A family where that sage is born
dhp193:4	prospers in happiness.
dhp194:1	Happy, the arising of Buddhas!
dhp194:2	Happy, the teaching of Dhamma!
dhp194:3	Happy is the harmony of the Saṅgha,
dhp194:4	and the striving of the harmonious is happy.
dhp195:1	When a person venerates the worthy—
dhp195:2	the Buddha or his disciple,
dhp195:3	who have transcended proliferation,
dhp195:4	and have left behind grief and lamentation,
dhp196:1	quenched, fearing nothing from any quarter—
dhp196:2	the merit of one venerating such as these,
dhp196:3	cannot be calculated by anyone,
dhp196:4	saying it is just this much.

dhp321:1	The well-tamed beast is the one led to the crowd;
dhp321:2	the tamed elephant’s the one the king mounts;
dhp321:3	the tamed person who endures abuse
dhp321:4	is the best of human beings.
dhp322:1	Those who have tamed themselves are better
dhp322:2	than fine tamed mules,
dhp322:3	thoroughbreds from Sindh,
dhp322:4	or giant tuskers.

dhp323:2	would you go to the untrodden place,

dhp323:4	you go there, tamed by the tamed.

dhp325:4	that idiot is reborn again and again. 
dhp326:1	In the past my mind wandered
dhp326:2	how it wished, where it liked, as it pleased.
dhp326:3	Now I’ll carefully guide it,

dhp330:1	It’s better to wander alone,
dhp330:2	there’s no fellowship with fools.
dhp330:3	Wander alone and do no wrong, 
dhp330:4	at ease like a tusker in the wilds.
dhp331:1	A friend in need is a blessing;
dhp331:2	it’s a blessing to be content with whatever;
dhp331:3	good deeds are a blessing at the end of life,
dhp331:4	and giving up all suffering is a blessing.
dhp332:1	In this world it’s a blessing to serve
dhp332:2	one’s mother and one’s father.
dhp332:3	And it’s a blessing also to serve
dhp332:4	ascetics and brahmins.
dhp333:1	It’s a blessing to keep precepts until you grow old;
dhp333:2	a blessing to be grounded in faith;
dhp333:3	the getting of wisdom’s a blessing;

dhp37:1	The mind travels far, wandering alone;
dhp37:2	incorporeal, it hides in a cave.

dhp40:4	guard your conquest, and never settle.
dhp41:1	All too soon this body
dhp41:2	will lie upon the earth,
dhp41:3	bereft of consciousness,
dhp41:4	tossed aside like a useless log.
dhp42:1	A wrongly directed mind
dhp42:2	would do you more harm
dhp42:3	than a hater to the hated,
dhp42:4	or an enemy to their foe.
dhp43:1	A rightly directed mind
dhp43:2	would do you more good
dhp43:3	than your mother or father

dhp337:1	I say this to you, good people,
dhp337:2	all those who have gathered here:
dhp337:3	dig up the root of craving,
dhp337:4	as you’d dig up grass in search of roots.
dhp337:5	Don’t let Māra break you again and again,
dhp337:6	like a stream breaking a reed.
dhp338:1	A tree grows back even when cut down,
dhp338:2	so long as its roots are healthy;
dhp338:3	suffering springs up again and again,
dhp338:4	so long as the tendency to craving is not pulled out.
dhp339:1	A person of low views
dhp339:2	in whom the thirty-six streams
dhp339:3	that flow to pleasure are mighty,
dhp339:4	is swept away by lustful thoughts.
dhp340:1	The streams flow everywhere;
dhp340:2	a weed springs up and remains.
dhp340:3	Seeing this weed that has been born, 
dhp340:4	cut the root with wisdom.
dhp341:1	A persons’s joys

dhp342:4	they return to pain time and again.
dhp343:1	People governed by thirst,
dhp343:2	crawl about like a trapped rabbit.
dhp343:3	That’s why one who longs for dispassion
dhp343:4	should dispel thirst.
dhp344:1	Rejecting the household jungle, they set out for the real jungle,
dhp344:2	then they run right back to the jungle they left behind.
dhp344:3	Just look at this person!
dhp344:4	Freed, they run to bondage.
dhp345:1	The wise say that shackle is not strong 
dhp345:2	that’s made of iron, wood, or knots. 
dhp345:3	But obsession with jeweled earrings, 
dhp345:4	concern for your partners and children: 
dhp346:1	this, say the wise, is a strong shackle
dhp346:2	dragging the indulgent down, hard to escape. 
dhp346:3	Having cut this one too they go forth, 
dhp346:4	unconcerned, having given up sensual pleasures.
dhp347:1	Besotted by lust they fall into the stream,
dhp347:2	like a spider caught in the web she wove.
dhp347:3	The wise proceed, having cut this one too,
dhp347:4	unconcerned, having given up all suffering.
dhp348:1	Let go of the past, let go of the future,
dhp348:2	let go of the present, going beyond rebirth.
dhp348:3	With mind freed in every respect,
dhp348:4	you’ll not come again to rebirth and old age.
dhp349:1	For a person crushed by thoughts,
dhp349:2	very lustful, focusing on beauty,
dhp349:3	their craving grows and grows,
dhp349:4	tying them with a stout bond.
dhp350:1	But one who loves to calm their thoughts,
dhp350:2	developing perception of ugliness, ever mindful,
dhp350:3	will surely eliminate that craving,
dhp350:4	cutting off the bonds of Māra.
dhp351:1	One who is confident, unafraid,

dhp353:3	I’ve given up all, freed in the ending of craving.

dhp354:1	The gift of the teaching beats all other gifts;
dhp354:2	the taste of the teaching beats all other tastes;
dhp354:3	the joy of the teaching beats all other joys;
dhp354:4	one who has ended craving beats all suffering.
dhp355:1	Riches ruin an idiot,

dhp373:4	as they rightly discern the Dhamma.
dhp374:1	Whenever they are mindful
dhp374:2	of the rise and fall of the aggregates,
dhp374:3	they feel rapture and joy:
dhp374:4	that is the deathless for one who knows.
dhp375:1	This is the very start of the path
dhp375:2	for a wise mendicant:
dhp375:3	guarding the senses, contentment,
dhp375:4	and restraint in the monastic code.
dhp376:1	Mix with spiritual friends,
dhp376:2	who are tireless and pure of livelihood.
dhp376:3	Share what you have with others,
dhp376:4	being skillful in your conduct.
dhp376:5	And when you’re full of joy, 
dhp376:6	you’ll make an end to suffering.
dhp377:1	As a jasmine sheds
dhp377:2	its withered flowers,
dhp377:3	O mendicants,
dhp377:4	cast off greed and hate.
dhp378:1	Calm in body, calm in speech,
dhp378:2	peaceful and serene;
dhp378:3	a mendicant who’s spat out the world’s bait
dhp378:4	is said to be one at peace.
dhp379:1	Urge yourself on,
dhp379:2	reflect on yourself.
dhp379:3	A mendicant self-controlled and mindful
dhp379:4	will always dwell in happiness.
dhp380:1	Self is indeed the lord of self,
dhp380:2	for who else would be one’s lord?
dhp380:3	Self is indeed the home of self,
dhp380:4	so restrain yourself,
dhp380:5	as a merchant his thoroughbred steed.
dhp381:1	A monk full of joy
dhp381:2	trusting in the Buddha’s teaching,
dhp381:3	would realize the peaceful state,
dhp381:4	the blissful stilling of conditions.
dhp382:1	A young mendicant
dhp382:2	devoted to the Buddha’s teaching, 
dhp382:3	lights up the world,
dhp382:4	like the moon freed from a cloud.

dhp383:2	Dispel sensual pleasures, brahmin. 
dhp383:3	Knowing the ending of conditions,

dhp384:1	When a brahmin
dhp384:2	has gone beyond two things,
dhp384:3	then they consciously
dhp384:4	make an end of all fetters.
dhp385:1	When one does not recognize the near shore,
dhp385:2	the far shore, or both;
dhp385:3	stress-free, detached,
dhp385:4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
dhp386:1	Absorbed, rid of hopes,

dhp387:1	The sun blazes by day, 
dhp387:2	the moon glows at night, 
dhp387:3	the aristocrat shines in armor,

dhp387:5	But all day and all night, 
dhp387:6	the Buddha shines with glory.
dhp388:1	A brahmin’s so-called because they have banished evil,
dhp388:2	an ascetic’s so-called since they live a serene life.
dhp388:3	One who has renounced all stains
dhp388:4	is said to be a “renunciant”.
dhp389:1	One should never strike a brahmin,
dhp389:2	nor should a brahmin retaliate.
dhp389:3	Woe to the one who hurts a brahmin,
dhp389:4	and woe for the one who retaliates.
dhp390:1	Nothing is better for a brahmin
dhp390:2	than to hold their mind back from attachment.
dhp390:3	As cruelty in the mind gradually subsides,
dhp390:4	suffering also subsides.
dhp391:1	Who does nothing wrong
dhp391:2	by body, speech or mind,
dhp391:3	restrained in these three respects,
dhp391:4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
dhp392:1	You should graciously honor
dhp392:2	the one from whom you learn the Dhamma
dhp392:3	taught by the awakened Buddha,
dhp392:4	as a brahmin honors the sacred flame.
dhp393:1	Not by matted hair or family,
dhp393:2	or birth is one a brahmin.
dhp393:3	Those who have truth and principle:
dhp393:4	they are pure, they are brahmins.
dhp394:1	Why the matted hair, you fool,
dhp394:2	and why the skin of deer?
dhp394:3	The tangle is inside you,
dhp394:4	yet you polish up your outsides.
dhp395:1	A person who wears robes of rags,
dhp395:2	lean, their limbs showing veins,
dhp395:3	meditating alone in the forest,
dhp395:4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
dhp396:1	I don’t call someone a brahmin 
dhp396:2	after the mother or womb they came from. 
dhp396:3	If they still have attachments, 
dhp396:4	they’re just someone who says “sir”. 
dhp396:5	Having nothing, taking nothing:

dhp397:1	Having cut off all fetters

dhp403:1	Deep in wisdom, intelligent, 
dhp403:2	expert in the variety of paths; 
dhp403:3	arrived at the highest goal:

dhp404:1	Socializing with neither

dhp404:3	A migrant with no shelter, few in wishes: 
dhp404:4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
dhp405:1	They’ve laid aside violence 
dhp405:2	against creatures firm and frail; 
dhp405:3	not killing or making others kill: 
dhp405:4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
dhp406:1	Not fighting among those who fight, 
dhp406:2	extinguished among those who are armed,
dhp406:3	not taking among those who take: 
dhp406:4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
dhp407:1	They’ve discarded greed and hate, 
dhp407:2	along with conceit and contempt,
dhp407:3	like a mustard seed off the point of a pin: 
dhp407:4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
dhp408:1	The words they utter 
dhp408:2	are sweet, informative, and true, 
dhp408:3	and don’t offend anyone: 
dhp408:4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
dhp409:1	They don’t steal anything in the world, 
dhp409:2	long or short, 
dhp409:3	fine or coarse, beautiful or ugly: 
dhp409:4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
dhp410:1	They have no hope 
dhp410:2	in this world or the next.

dhp411:1	They have no clinging, 
dhp411:2	knowledge has freed them of indecision, 
dhp411:3	they’ve plunged right into the deathless:

dhp413:1	Pure as the spotless moon, 
dhp413:2	clear and undisturbed, 
dhp413:3	they’ve ended desire to be reborn: 
dhp413:4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
dhp414:1	They’ve got past this grueling swamp 
dhp414:2	of delusion, transmigration.
dhp414:3	They’ve crossed over to the far shore, 
dhp414:4	stilled and free of indecision. 
dhp414:5	They’re extinguished by not grasping: 
dhp414:6	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
dhp415:1	They’ve given up sensual stimulations,

dhp44:4	as an expert examines a flower?
dhp45:1	A trainee shall explore this land,
dhp45:2	and the Yama realm with its gods.
dhp45:3	A trainee shall examine the well-taught word of truth,
dhp45:4	as an expert examines a flower.
dhp46:1	Knowing this body’s like foam,
dhp46:2	realizing it’s all just a mirage,
dhp46:3	and cutting off Māra’s blossoming,
dhp46:4	vanish from the King of Death.
dhp47:1	As a mighty flood sweeps off a sleeping village,
dhp47:2	death steals away a man
dhp47:3	even as he gathers flowers,
dhp47:4	his mind caught up in them.
dhp48:1	The terminator gains control of the man
dhp48:2	who has not had his fill of pleasures,
dhp48:3	even as he gathers flowers,
dhp48:4	his mind caught up in them.
dhp49:1	A bee takes the nectar
dhp49:2	and moves on, doing no damage
dhp49:3	to the flower’s beauty and fragrance;
dhp49:4	and that’s how a sage should walk in the village.
dhp50:1	Don’t find fault with others,
dhp50:2	with what they’ve done or left undone.
dhp50:3	You should only watch yourself,
dhp50:4	what you’ve done or left undone.
dhp51:1	Just like a glorious flower
dhp51:2	that’s colorful but lacks fragrance;
dhp51:3	eloquent speech is fruitless
dhp51:4	for one who does not act on it.
dhp52:1	Just like a glorious flower
dhp52:2	that’s both colorful and fragrant,
dhp52:3	eloquent speech is fruitful
dhp52:4	for one who acts on it.
dhp53:1	Just as one would create many garlands
dhp53:2	from a heap of flowers,
dhp53:3	when a person has come to be born,
dhp53:4	they should do many skillful things.
dhp54:1	The fragrance of flowers doesn’t spread upwind, 
dhp54:2	nor sandalwood, pinwheel, or jasmine; 
dhp54:3	but the fragrance of the good spreads upwind; 
dhp54:4	a good person’s virtue spreads in every direction.
dhp55:1	Among all the fragrances—
dhp55:2	sandalwood or pinwheel
dhp55:3	or lotus or jasmine—
dhp55:4	the fragrance of virtue is supreme.
dhp56:1	Faint is the fragrance
dhp56:2	of sandal or pinwheel;
dhp56:3	but the fragrance of the virtuous
dhp56:4	floats to the highest gods.
dhp57:1	For those accomplished in ethics,
dhp57:2	meditating diligently,
dhp57:3	freed through the highest knowledge,
dhp57:4	Māra cannot find their path.
dhp58:1	From a forsaken heap
dhp58:2	discarded on the highway,
dhp58:3	a lotus might blossom,
dhp58:4	fragrant and delightful.
dhp59:1	So too, among the forsaken,
dhp59:2	a disciple of the perfect Buddha
dhp59:3	outshines with their wisdom

dhp60:1	Long is the night for the wakeful;
dhp60:2	long is the league for the weary;
dhp60:3	long transmigrate the fools
dhp60:4	who don’t understand the true teaching.
dhp61:1	If while wandering you find no partner
dhp61:2	equal or better than yourself,
dhp61:3	then firmly resolve to wander alone—
dhp61:4	there’s no fellowship with fools.
dhp62:1	“Sons are mine, wealth is mine”—
dhp62:2	thus the fool frets.
dhp62:3	But you can’t even call your self your own,
dhp62:4	let alone your sons or wealth.
dhp63:1	The fool who thinks they’re a fool
dhp63:2	is wise at least to that extent.
dhp63:3	But the true fool is said to be one
dhp63:4	who imagines that they are wise.
dhp64:1	Though a fool attends to the wise
dhp64:2	even for the rest of their life,
dhp64:3	they still don’t experience the teaching,
dhp64:4	like a spoon the taste of the soup.
dhp65:1	If a clever person attends to the wise
dhp65:2	even just for an hour or so,
dhp65:3	they swiftly experience the teaching,
dhp65:4	like a tongue the taste of the soup.
dhp66:1	Witless fools behave
dhp66:2	like their own worst enemies,
dhp66:3	doing wicked deeds
dhp66:4	that ripen as bitter fruit.
dhp67:1	It’s not good to do a deed
dhp67:2	that plagues you later on,
dhp67:3	for which you weep and wail,
dhp67:4	as its effect stays with you.
dhp68:1	It is good to do a deed
dhp68:2	that doesn’t plague you later on,
dhp68:3	that gladdens and cheers, 
dhp68:4	as its effect stays with you.
dhp69:1	The fool imagines that evil is sweet,
dhp69:2	so long as it has not yet ripened.
dhp69:3	But as soon as that evil ripens,
dhp69:4	they fall into suffering.
dhp70:1	Month after month a fool may eat
dhp70:2	food from a grass-blade’s tip;
dhp70:3	but they’ll never be worth a sixteenth part
dhp70:4	of one who has fathomed the teaching.
dhp71:1	For a wicked deed that has been done
dhp71:2	does not spoil quickly like milk.
dhp71:3	Smoldering, it follows the fool,
dhp71:4	like a fire smothered over with ash.
dhp72:0	
dhp72:1	Whatever fame a fool may get,
dhp72:2	it only gives rise to harm.
dhp72:3	Whatever good features they have it ruins,
dhp72:4	and blows their head into bits.
dhp73:1	They’d seek the esteem that they lack,
dhp73:2	and status among the mendicants;
dhp73:3	authority over monasteries,
dhp73:4	and honor among other families.
dhp74:1	“Let both layfolk and renunciants think
dhp74:2	the work was done by me alone.
dhp74:3	In anything at all that’s to be done,
dhp74:4	let them fall under my sway alone.”
dhp74:5	So thinks the fool,
dhp74:6	their greed and pride only growing.
dhp75:1	For the means to profit and the path to quenching
dhp75:2	are two quite different things.
dhp75:3	A mendicant disciple of the Buddha,
dhp75:4	understanding what this really means,
dhp75:5	would never delight in honors,
dhp75:6	but rather would foster seclusion.

dhp76:4	who corrects you when you need it.
dhp76:5	Sticking close to such an impartial person,
dhp76:6	things get better, not worse. 
dhp77:1	Advise and instruct;
dhp77:2	curb wickedness:
dhp77:3	for you shall be loved by the good,
dhp77:4	and disliked by the bad.
dhp78:1	Don’t mix with bad friends,
dhp78:2	nor with the worst of men.
dhp78:3	Mix with spiritual friends,
dhp78:4	and with the best of men.
dhp79:1	Through joy in the teaching you sleep at ease,
dhp79:2	with clear and confident heart.
dhp79:3	An astute person always delights in the teaching
dhp79:4	proclaimed by the Noble One.
dhp80:1	While irrigators guide water,
dhp80:2	fletchers straighten arrows,
dhp80:3	and carpenters carve timber,
dhp80:4	the astute tame themselves.
dhp81:1	As the wind cannot stir
dhp81:2	a solid mass of rock,

dhp81:4	do not affect the wise.
dhp82:1	Like a deep lake,
dhp82:2	clear and unclouded,
dhp82:3	so clear are the astute
dhp82:4	when they hear the teachings.
dhp83:1	Good people give up everything,
dhp83:2	they don’t cajole for the things they desire.
dhp83:3	Though touched by sadness or happiness,
dhp83:4	the astute appear neither depressed nor elated.
dhp84:1	Never wish for success by unjust means,
dhp84:2	for your own sake or that of another,
dhp84:3	desiring children, wealth, or nation;
dhp84:4	rather, be virtuous, wise, and just.
dhp85:1	Few are those among humans 
dhp85:2	who cross to the far shore. 
dhp85:3	The rest just run around
dhp85:4	on the near shore. 
dhp86:1	When the teaching is well explained, 
dhp86:2	those who practice accordingly 
dhp86:3	will cross over 
dhp86:4	Death’s domain so hard to pass.
dhp87:1	Rid of dark qualities, 
dhp87:2	an astute person should develop the bright. 
dhp87:3	Leaving home behind 
dhp87:4	for the seclusion so hard to enjoy, 
dhp88:1	find delight there, 
dhp88:2	having left behind sensual pleasures. 
dhp88:3	With no possessions, an astute person 
dhp88:4	would cleanse themselves of mental corruptions. 
dhp89:1	Those whose minds are rightly developed
dhp89:2	in the awakening factors; 
dhp89:3	who, letting go of attachments, 
dhp89:4	delight in not grasping:
dhp89:5	with defilements ended, brilliant, 
dhp89:6	they in this world are quenched.

dhp96:1	Their mind is peaceful,
dhp96:2	peaceful are their speech and deeds.
dhp96:3	Such a one is at peace,
dhp96:4	rightly freed through enlightenment.
dhp97:1	Lacking faith, a house-breaker,
dhp97:2	one who acknowledges nothing,
dhp97:3	purged of hope, they’ve wasted their chance:

dhp98:1	Whether in village or wilderness, 
dhp98:2	in a valley or the uplands, 
dhp98:3	wherever the perfected ones live 
dhp98:4	is a delightful place.
dhp99:1	Delightful are the wildernesses

iti10:2.3	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti10:2.4	On this it is said:

iti90:0.4	The Best Kinds of Confidence 
iti90:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti90:2.1	“Mendicants, these three kinds of confidence are the best. 
iti90:2.2	What three? 
iti90:2.3	Mendicants, the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, is said to be the best of all sentient beings—be they footless, with two feet, four feet, or many feet; with form or formless; with perception or without perception or with neither perception nor non-perception. 
iti90:2.4	Those who have confidence in the Buddha have confidence in the best. 
iti90:2.5	Having confidence in the best, the result is the best. 
iti90:3.1	Fading away is said to be the best of all things whether conditioned or unconditioned. That is, the quelling of vanity, the removing of thirst, the abolishing of clinging, the breaking of the round, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment. 
iti90:3.2	Those who have confidence in the teaching of fading away have confidence in the best. 
iti90:3.3	Having confidence in the best, the result is the best. 
iti90:4.1	The Saṅgha of the Realized One’s disciples is said to be the best of all communities and groups. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world. 
iti90:4.2	Those who have confidence in the Saṅgha have confidence in the best. 
iti90:4.3	Having confidence in the best, the result is the best. 
iti90:4.4	These are the three best kinds of confidence.”
iti90:4.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti90:4.6	On this it is said: 
iti90:5.1	“For those who, knowing the best teaching, 
iti90:5.2	base their confidence on the best—
iti90:5.3	confident in the best Awakened One, 
iti90:5.4	supremely worthy of a religious donation; 
iti90:6.1	confident in the best teaching, 
iti90:6.2	the bliss of fading and stilling; 
iti90:6.3	confident in the best Saṅgha, 
iti90:6.4	the supreme field of merit—
iti90:7.1	giving gifts to the best, 
iti90:7.2	the best of merit grows: 
iti90:7.3	the best lifespan, beauty, 
iti90:7.4	fame, reputation, happiness, and strength. 
iti90:8.1	An intelligent person gives to the best, 
iti90:8.2	settled on the best teaching. 
iti90:8.3	When they become a god or human, 
iti90:8.4	they rejoice at reaching the best.”

iti91:0.4	Lifestyle
iti91:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti91:2.1	“Mendicants, this relying on alms is an extreme lifestyle. 
iti91:2.2	The world curses you: ‘You beggar, walking bowl in hand!’ 
iti91:2.3	Yet earnest gentlemen take it up for a good reason. 
iti91:2.4	Not because they’ve been forced to by kings or bandits, or because they’re in debt or threatened, or to earn a living. 
iti91:2.5	Rather, because they think: ‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering. 
iti91:2.6	Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’
iti91:2.7	That’s how this gentleman has gone forth. 
iti91:2.8	Yet they covet sensual pleasures; they’re infatuated, full of ill will and malicious intent. They are unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying mind and undisciplined faculties. 
iti91:2.9	Suppose there was a firebrand for lighting a funeral pyre, burning at both ends, and smeared with dung in the middle. It couldn’t be used as timber either in the village or the wilderness. 
iti91:2.10	I say that person is just like this. They’ve missed out on the pleasures of the lay life, and haven’t fulfilled the goal of the ascetic life. 
iti91:2.11	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti91:2.12	On this it is said: 
iti91:3.1	“They’ve left behind the pleasures of the lay life,
iti91:3.2	and miss out on the goal of the ascetic life.
iti91:3.3	Ruining it, they throw it away,
iti91:3.4	and perish like a funeral firebrand.
iti91:4.1	Many who wrap their necks in ocher robes
iti91:4.2	are unrestrained and wicked.
iti91:4.3	Being wicked, they are reborn in hell
iti91:4.4	due to their bad deeds.
iti91:5.1	It’d be better for the immoral and unrestrained
iti91:5.2	to eat an iron ball,
iti91:5.3	scorching, like a burning flame,
iti91:5.4	than to eat the nation’s alms.”

iti92:0.4	The Corner of the Cloak
iti92:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti92:2.1	“Mendicants, suppose a mendicant were to hold the corner of my cloak and follow behind me step by step. 
iti92:2.2	Yet they covet sensual pleasures; they’re infatuated, full of ill will and malicious intent. They are unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying mind and undisciplined faculties. 
iti92:2.3	Then they are far from me, and I from them.
iti92:2.4	Why is that? 
iti92:2.5	Because that mendicant does not see the teaching.
iti92:2.6	Not seeing the teaching, they do not see me.
iti92:3.1	Suppose a mendicant were to live a hundred leagues away.
iti92:3.2	Yet they do not covet sensual pleasures; they’re not infatuated, or full of ill will and malicious intent. They have established mindfulness, situational awareness and immersion, with unified mind and restrained faculties.
iti92:3.3	Then they are close to me, and I to them.
iti92:3.4	Why is that? 
iti92:3.5	Because that mendicant sees the teaching.
iti92:3.6	Seeing the teaching, they see me.” 
iti92:3.7	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti92:3.8	On this it is said: 
iti92:4.1	“One full of desire and distress
iti92:4.2	may follow me close behind,
iti92:4.3	yet see how distant they are—
iti92:4.4	the stirred from the still,
iti92:4.5	the burning from the quenched,
iti92:4.6	the greedy from the greedless.
iti92:5.1	An astute person who has understood
iti92:5.2	and directly known the teaching,
iti92:5.3	grows calm,
iti92:5.4	like a lake unstirred by the wind.
iti92:6.1	See how close they are—
iti92:6.2	the still to the still,
iti92:6.3	the quenched to the quenched,
iti92:6.4	the greedless to the greedless.”

iti93:0.4	Fire 
iti93:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti93:2.1	“Mendicants, there are these three fires. 
iti93:2.2	What three? 
iti93:2.3	The fires of greed, hate, and delusion. 
iti93:2.4	These are the three fires.” 
iti93:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti93:2.6	On this it is said: 
iti93:3.1	“The fire of greed burns a mortal,
iti93:3.2	lustful, infatuated by sensual pleasures;
iti93:3.3	while, fallen in the fire of hate,
iti93:3.4	a person kills living creatures;
iti93:4.1	and, bewildered by the fire of delusion,
iti93:4.2	they miss the teaching of the noble ones.
iti93:4.3	Not recognizing these three fires,
iti93:4.4	people are caught up in identity.
iti93:5.1	They fill the ranks of hell,
iti93:5.2	of birth as an animal,
iti93:5.3	or of demons and ghosts,
iti93:5.4	not freed from Māra’s bonds.
iti93:6.1	But as to those committed day and night
iti93:6.2	to the teaching of the Buddha:
iti93:6.3	they quench the fire of greed,
iti93:6.4	always perceiving ugliness;
iti93:7.1	while those supreme persons
iti93:7.2	quench the fire of hate with love;
iti93:7.3	and the fire of delusion with the wisdom
iti93:7.4	that leads to penetration.
iti93:8.1	Having quenched these fires, alert,
iti93:8.2	tireless all day and night,
iti93:8.3	they become completely quenched,
iti93:8.4	completely transcending suffering.
iti93:9.1	Seers of the noble truths, knowledge masters,
iti93:9.2	the astute, understanding rightly,
iti93:9.3	directly know the ending of rebirth, 
iti93:9.4	they come not back to future lives.”

iti94:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti94:2.1	“Mendicants, a mendicant should examine in any such a way that their consciousness is neither scattered and diffused externally nor stuck internally, and they are not anxious because of grasping. 
iti94:2.2	When this is the case and they are no longer anxious, there is for them no coming to be of the origin of suffering—of rebirth, old age, and death in the future.” 
iti94:2.3	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti94:2.4	On this it is said: 
iti94:3.1	“For one who has given up seven chains,
iti94:3.2	a mendicant who has cut the cord,
iti94:3.3	transmigration through births is finished,
iti94:3.4	now there’ll be no more future lives.”

iti95:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti95:2.1	“Mendicants, there are these three ways of being provided with sensual pleasures.
iti95:2.2	What three? 
iti95:2.3	Some sensual pleasures are simply present; some are for those who love to create; and some are for those who control the creations of others.
iti95:2.4	These are the three ways of being provided with sensual pleasures.” 
iti95:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti95:2.6	On this it is said: 
iti95:3.1	“Sensual pleasures that are simply present,
iti95:3.2	Gods Who Control the Creations of Others,
iti95:3.3	Gods Who Love to Create,
iti95:3.4	and others who indulge in sensual pleasures—
iti95:3.5	They go from this state to another, 
iti95:3.6	but don’t escape transmigration. 
iti95:4.1	Knowing this danger
iti95:4.2	in sensual indulgence, an astute person
iti95:4.3	would reject all sensual pleasures,
iti95:4.4	both human and divine.
iti95:5.1	Having cut the stream so hard to pass,
iti95:5.2	that’s tied to pleasant seeming things,
iti95:5.3	they become completely quenched,
iti95:5.4	completely transcending suffering.
iti95:6.1	Seers of the noble truths, knowledge masters,
iti95:6.2	the astute, understanding rightly,
iti95:6.3	directly know the ending of rebirth,

iti96:2.1	“Mendicants, one attached to both sensual pleasures and rebirth is a returner, who comes back to this state of existence. 
iti96:2.2	One detached from sensual pleasures but still attached to rebirth is a non-returner, who comes not back to this state of existence. 
iti96:2.3	One detached from both sensual pleasures and rebirth is a perfected one, who has ended defilements.”
iti96:2.4	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti96:2.5	On this it is said: 
iti96:3.1	“Attached to both sensual pleasures 
iti96:3.2	and the desire to be reborn in a future life; 
iti96:3.3	sentient beings continue to transmigrate, 
iti96:3.4	with ongoing birth and death. 
iti96:4.1	Those who’ve given up sensual pleasures 
iti96:4.2	without attaining the end of defilements,
iti96:4.3	and are still attached to being reborn,
iti96:4.4	are said to be non-returners.
iti96:5.1	Those who have cut off doubt,
iti96:5.2	and ended conceit and future lives,
iti96:5.3	they’re the ones in this world who’ve truly crossed over, 
iti96:5.4	having reached the ending of defilements.”

iti97:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti97:2.1	“Mendicants, in this teaching and training a mendicant of good morals, good practice, and good wisdom is called consummate, accomplished, a supreme person. 
iti97:3.1	And how does a mendicant have good morals? 
iti97:3.2	It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. 
iti97:3.3	That’s how a mendicant has good morals.
iti97:3.4	Such is one of good morality.
iti97:4.1	And how does one have good practice?
iti97:4.2	It’s when a mendicant meditates pursuing the development of the seven qualities that lead to awakening.
iti97:4.3	That’s how a mendicant has good practice.
iti97:4.4	Such is one of good morality and good practice.
iti97:5.1	And how does one have good wisdom?
iti97:5.2	It’s when a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. 
iti97:5.3	That’s how a mendicant has good wisdom;
iti97:6.1	Such is one of good morals, good practice, and good wisdom, who in this teaching and training is called consummate, accomplished, a supreme person. 
iti97:6.2	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti97:6.3	On this it is said: 
iti97:7.1	“Who does nothing wrong
iti97:7.2	by body, speech or mind,
iti97:7.3	is said to be one good morals,
iti97:7.4	a conscientious mendicant.
iti97:8.1	Who has well developed the seven
iti97:8.2	factors that lead to awakening
iti97:8.3	is said to be one good practice,
iti97:8.4	a humble mendicant.
iti97:9.1	Who understands for themselves 
iti97:9.2	the end of suffering in this life 
iti97:9.3	is said to be one good wisdom,
iti97:9.4	an undefiled mendicant.
iti97:10.1	One accomplished in these three things, 
iti97:10.2	untroubled, with doubts cut off,
iti97:10.3	unattached to anything in the world,
iti97:10.4	has given up everything, they say.” 
iti97:11.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.
iti98:0.1	So It Was Said
iti98:0.2	The Book of the Threes
iti98:0.3	Chapter Five
iti98:0.4	Giving
iti98:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti98:2.1	“There are, mendicants, these two gifts. 
iti98:2.2	A gift of material things and a gift of the teaching. 
iti98:2.3	The better of these two gifts is the gift of the teaching.
iti98:3.1	There are these two kinds of sharing. 
iti98:3.2	Sharing material things and sharing the teaching. 
iti98:3.3	The better of these two kinds of sharing is sharing the teaching.
iti98:4.1	There are these two kinds of support. 
iti98:4.2	Support in material things and support in the teaching. 
iti98:4.3	The better of these two kinds of support is support in the teaching.”
iti98:4.4	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti98:4.5	On this it is said: 
iti98:5.1	“It is said to be the supreme, ultimate gift,
iti98:5.2	and the sharing praised by the Buddha;
iti98:5.3	what wise and sensible person, confident in the best of fields,
iti98:5.4	would not sow a such timely gift?
iti98:6.1	For those who are diligent in the dispensation of the Holy One,
iti98:6.2	both those who speak and those who listen,
iti98:6.3	confident in the dispensation of the Holy One,
iti98:6.4	such a gift purifies the highest goal.”
iti98:7.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.
iti99:0.1	So It Was Said
iti99:0.2	The Book of the Threes
iti99:0.3	Chapter Five
iti99:0.4	The Three Knowledges
iti99:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti99:2.1	“Mendicants, I describe a brahmin who is master of the three Vedic knowledges in terms of the teaching, not by mere oral recitation.
iti99:3.1	How so?
iti99:3.2	It’s when a mendicant recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. 
iti99:3.3	This was the first knowledge they achieved. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. 
iti99:4.1	Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, a mendicant sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. 
iti99:4.2	This was the second knowledge they achieved. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. 
iti99:5.1	Furthermore, a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
iti99:5.2	This was the third knowledge which they achieved. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. 
iti99:5.3	That’s how I describe a brahmin who is master of the three Vedic knowledges in terms of the teaching, not by mere oral recitation.”
iti99:5.4	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti99:5.5	On this it is said: 
iti99:6.1	“They know their past lives, 
iti99:6.2	seeing heaven and places of loss, 
iti99:6.3	and have attained the end of rebirth;
iti99:6.4	that sage has perfect insight. 
iti99:7.1	Because of these three knowledges 
iti99:7.2	a brahmin is a master of the three knowledges. 
iti99:7.3	That’s who I call a three-knowledge master, 
iti99:7.4	and not some mere reciter.” 
iti99:8.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.
iti100:0.1	So It Was Said
iti100:0.2	The Book of the Fours
iti100:0.3	The Chapter on the Holy Offering of the Teaching
iti100:0.4	The Holy Offering of the Teaching
iti100:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti100:2.1	“I, Mendicants, am a brahmin, committed to charity, always open-handed, bearing my final body, a healer, a surgeon.
iti100:2.2	You are my rightful children, born of my mouth, born of the teaching, created by the teaching, heirs in the teaching, not in material things.
iti100:3.1	There are these two gifts. 
iti100:3.2	A gift of material things and a gift of the teaching. 
iti100:3.3	The better of these two gifts is the gift of the teaching.
iti100:4.1	There are these two kinds of sharing. 
iti100:4.2	Sharing material things and sharing the teaching. 
iti100:4.3	The better of these two kinds of sharing is sharing the teaching.
iti100:5.1	There are these two kinds of support. 
iti100:5.2	Support in material things and support in the teaching. 
iti100:5.3	The better of these two kinds of support is support in the teaching.
iti100:6.1	There are these two offerings. 
iti100:6.2	An offering of material things and an offering of the teaching. 
iti100:6.3	The better of these two offerings is an offering of the teaching.”
iti100:6.4	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti100:6.5	On this it is said: 
iti100:7.1	“The Realized One, compassionate for all living creatures,
iti100:7.2	unstintingly offers up teaching.
iti100:7.3	Sentient beings revere him, first among gods and humans, 
iti100:7.4	who has gone beyond rebirth.” 
iti100:8.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.
iti101:0.1	So It Was Said
iti101:0.2	The Book of the Fours
iti101:0.3	The Chapter on the Holy Offering of the Teaching
iti101:0.4	Easy to Find
iti101:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti101:2.1	“Mendicants, these four trifles are easy to find and are blameless. 
iti101:2.2	What four? 
iti101:2.3	Rag-robes … 
iti101:2.4	A lump of almsfood … 
iti101:2.5	Lodgings at the root of a tree … 
iti101:2.6	Fermented urine as medicine … 
iti101:2.7	These four trifles are easy to find and are blameless. 
iti101:2.8	When a mendicant is content with trifles that are easy to find, they have one of the factors of the ascetic life, I say.” 
iti101:2.9	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti101:2.10	On this it is said: 
iti101:3.1	“When you’re content with what’s blameless, 
iti101:3.2	trifling, and easy to find, 
iti101:3.3	you don’t get upset 
iti101:3.4	about lodgings, robes, 
iti101:3.5	food, and drink, 
iti101:3.6	and you’re not obstructed anywhere. 
iti101:4.1	These qualities are said to be 
iti101:4.2	integral to the ascetic life. 
iti101:4.3	They’re mastered by a mendicant, 
iti101:4.4	content and diligent.” 
iti101:5.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.
iti102:0.1	So It Was Said
iti102:0.2	The Book of the Fours
iti102:0.3	The Chapter on the Holy Offering of the Teaching
iti102:0.4	The Ending of Defilements 
iti102:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti102:2.1	“Mendicants, I say that the ending of defilements is for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know or see. 
iti102:2.2	For one who knows and sees what? 
iti102:2.3	The ending of defilements is for one who knows and sees suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. 
iti102:2.4	The ending of the defilements is for one who knows and sees this.” 
iti102:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti102:2.6	On this it is said: 
iti102:3.1	“As a trainee trains, 
iti102:3.2	following the straight road, 
iti102:3.3	first they know about ending; 
iti102:3.4	enlightenment follows in the same lifetime. 
iti102:4.1	Then to one freed through enlightenment
iti102:4.2	the knowledge of ending arises,
iti102:4.3	the supreme knowledge of freedom,
iti102:4.4	with the ending of the fetters.
iti102:5.1	This is not for the lazy,
iti102:5.2	the fools don’t understand,
iti102:5.3	extinguishment is realized
iti102:5.4	with release from all ties.”
iti102:6.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.
iti103:0.1	So It Was Said
iti103:0.2	The Book of the Fours
iti103:0.3	The Chapter on the Holy Offering of the Teaching
iti103:0.4	Ascetics and Brahmins 
iti103:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti103:2.1	“Mendicants, there are ascetics and brahmins who don’t truly understand about suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. 
iti103:2.2	I don’t regard them as true ascetics and brahmins. Those venerables don’t realize the goal of life as an ascetic or brahmin, and don’t live having realized it with their own insight. 
iti103:3.1	There are ascetics and brahmins who truly understand about suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. 
iti103:4.1	“There are those who don’t understand suffering 
iti103:4.2	and suffering’s cause, 
iti103:4.3	and where all suffering 
iti103:4.4	cease with nothing left over; 
iti103:4.5	And they don’t know the path 
iti103:4.6	that leads to the stilling of suffering.
iti103:5.1	They lack the heart’s release, 
iti103:5.2	as well as the release by wisdom. 
iti103:5.3	Unable to make an end, 
iti103:5.4	they continue to be reborn and grow old. 
iti103:6.1	But there are those who understand suffering 
iti103:6.2	and suffering’s cause, 
iti103:6.3	and where all suffering 
iti103:6.4	cease with nothing left over; 
iti103:6.5	And they understand the path 
iti103:6.6	that leads to the stilling of suffering.
iti103:7.1	They’re endowed with the heart’s release, 
iti103:7.2	as well as the release by wisdom. 
iti103:7.3	Able to make an end, 
iti103:7.4	they don’t continue to be reborn and grow old.” 
iti103:8.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.
iti104:0.1	So It Was Said
iti104:0.2	The Book of the Fours
iti104:0.3	The Chapter on the Holy Offering of the Teaching
iti104:0.4	Accomplished in Ethics 
iti104:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti104:2.1	“Mendicants, take a mendicant who is accomplished in ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom. They advise and instruct. They educate, encourage, fire up, and inspire, and can rightly explain the true teaching. Even the sight of those mendicants is very helpful, I say. 
iti104:2.2	Even to hear them, 
iti104:2.3	approach them, 
iti104:2.4	pay homage to them, 
iti104:2.5	recollect them, 
iti104:2.6	or go forth after them is very helpful, I say. 
iti104:2.8	For one who frequents and associates with such mendicants, their incomplete spectrum of ethics is completed. Their incomplete spectrum of immersion … wisdom … freedom … knowledge and vision of freedom is completed.
iti104:2.9	Such mendicants are called ‘teachers’, ‘leaders of the caravan’, ‘vice-discarders’, ‘dispellers of darkness’, ‘bringers of light’, ‘luminaries’, ‘lamps’, ‘candlebearers’, ‘beacons’, ‘noble ones’, and ‘seers’.
iti104:2.10	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti104:2.11	On this it is said: 
iti104:3.1	“This is a reason for joy
iti104:3.2	for those who understand:
iti104:3.3	that is, those who are evolved,
iti104:3.4	the noble ones living righteously.
iti104:4.1	They illuminate the true teaching,
iti104:4.2	beacons beaming light, 
iti104:4.3	the wise ones bringing light,
iti104:4.4	seers with vices discarded.
iti104:5.1	Having heard their instruction,
iti104:5.2	the astute, understanding rightly,
iti104:5.3	directly know the ending of rebirth, 
iti104:5.4	they come not back to future lives.”
iti104:6.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.
iti105:0.1	So It Was Said
iti105:0.2	The Book of the Fours
iti105:0.3	The Chapter on the Holy Offering of the Teaching
iti105:0.4	The Arising of Craving 
iti105:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti105:2.1	“Mendicants, there are four things that give rise to craving in a mendicant. 
iti105:2.2	What four? 
iti105:2.3	For the sake of robes, 
iti105:2.4	almsfood, 
iti105:2.5	lodgings, 
iti105:2.6	or rebirth in this or that state. 
iti105:2.7	These are the four things that give rise to craving in a mendicant.” 
iti105:2.8	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti105:2.9	On this it is said: 
iti105:3.1	“Craving is a person’s partner 
iti105:3.2	as they transmigrate on this long journey. 
iti105:3.3	They go from this state to another, 
iti105:3.4	but don’t escape transmigration. 
iti105:4.1	Knowing this danger,
iti105:4.2	that craving is the cause of suffering—
iti105:4.3	rid of craving, free of grasping,
iti105:4.4	a mendicant would wander mindful.” 
iti105:5.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.
iti106:0.1	So It Was Said
iti106:0.2	The Book of the Fours
iti106:0.3	The Chapter on the Holy Offering of the Teaching
iti106:0.4	With Brahmā 
iti106:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti106:2.1	“Mendicants, a family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to live with Brahmā. 
iti106:2.2	A family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to live with the old deities. 
iti106:2.3	A family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to live with the first teachers. 
iti106:2.4	A family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to live with those worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods. 
iti106:3.1	‘Brahmā’ is a term for your parents. 
iti106:3.2	‘First teachers’ is a term for your parents. 
iti106:3.3	‘First teachers’ is a term for your parents. 
iti106:3.4	‘Worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods’ is a term for your parents. 
iti106:3.5	Why is that? 
iti106:3.6	Parents are very helpful to their children, they raise them, nurture them, and show them the world.” 
iti106:3.7	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti106:3.8	On this it is said: 
iti106:4.1	“Parents are said to be ‘Brahmā’ 
iti106:4.2	and ‘first teachers’. 
iti106:4.3	They’re worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods from their children, 
iti106:4.4	for they love their offspring. 
iti106:5.1	Therefore an astute person 
iti106:5.2	would revere them and honor them 
iti106:5.3	with food and drink, 
iti106:5.4	clothes and bedding, 
iti106:5.5	anointing and bathing, 
iti106:5.6	and by washing their feet. 
iti106:6.1	Because they look after 
iti106:6.2	their parents like this, 
iti106:6.3	they’re praised in this life by the astute, 
iti106:6.4	and they depart to rejoice in heaven.” 
iti106:7.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.
iti107:0.1	So It Was Said
iti107:0.2	The Book of the Fours
iti107:0.3	The Chapter on the Holy Offering of the Teaching
iti107:0.4	Very Helpful 
iti107:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti107:2.1	“Mendicants, brahmins and houselholders are very helpful to you, as they provide you with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.
iti107:2.2	And you are very helpful to brahmins and householders, as you teach them the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And you reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
iti107:2.3	That is how this spiritual path is lived in mutual dependence in order to cross over the flood and make a complete end of suffering.” 
iti107:2.4	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti107:2.5	On this it is said: 
iti107:3.1	“The home-dweller and the homeless,
iti107:3.2	depending on each other,
iti107:3.3	find success in the true teaching,
iti107:3.4	the supreme sanctuary. 
iti107:4.1	The homeless receive requisites
iti107:4.2	from the home-dwellers:
iti107:4.3	robes and lodgings
iti107:4.4	to shelter from harsh conditions.
iti107:5.1	Relying on the Holy One,
iti107:5.2	home-loving layfolk
iti107:5.3	place faith in the perfected ones,
iti107:5.4	meditators of noble wisdom.
iti107:6.1	Having practiced the teaching here, 
iti107:6.2	the path that goes to a good place, 
iti107:6.3	they delight in the heavenly realm, 
iti107:6.4	enjoying all the pleasures they desire.” 
iti107:7.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.
iti108:0.1	So It Was Said
iti108:0.2	The Book of the Fours
iti108:0.3	The Chapter on the Holy Offering of the Teaching
iti108:0.4	Deceivers 
iti108:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti108:2.1	“Mendicants, those mendicants who are deceivers, stubborn, flatterers, frauds, insolent, and scattered: those mendicants are no followers of mine. 
iti108:2.2	They’ve left this teaching and training, and they don’t achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training. 
iti108:2.3	But those mendicants who are genuine, not flatterers, wise, amenable, and serene: those mendicants are followers of mine. 
iti108:2.4	They haven’t left this teaching and training, and they do achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training.” 
iti108:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti108:2.6	On this it is said: 
iti108:3.1	“Those who are deceivers, stubborn, flatterers, and frauds, 
iti108:3.2	insolent and scattered: 
iti108:3.3	these don’t grow in the teaching 
iti108:3.4	that was taught by the perfected Buddha.
iti108:4.1	But those who are genuine, not flatterers, wise, 
iti108:4.2	amenable, and serene: 
iti108:4.3	these do grow in the teaching 
iti108:4.4	that was taught by the perfected Buddha.” 
iti108:5.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.
iti109:0.1	So It Was Said
iti109:0.2	The Book of the Fours
iti109:0.3	The Chapter on the Holy Offering of the Teaching
iti109:0.4	A River 
iti109:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti109:2.1	“Suppose a person was being carried along by a river current that seemed nice and pleasant. 
iti109:2.2	If a person with good eyesight saw them, they’d say: 
iti109:2.3	‘Mister, even though the river current carrying you along seems nice and pleasant, downstream there is a lake with waves and whirlpools, sharks and monsters. When you reach there it will result in death or deadly pain.’
iti109:2.4	Then, when they heard what was said, they’d paddle against the stream using their hands and feet.
iti109:3.1	I’ve made up this simile to make a point. 
iti109:3.2	And this is the point. 
iti109:3.3	‘Stream’ is a term for craving. 
iti109:4.1	‘Seeming nice and pleasant’ is a term for the six interior sense fields. 
iti109:5.1	‘A downstream lake’ is a term for the five lower fetters.
iti109:6.1	‘Danger of waves’ is a term for anger and distress. 
iti109:7.1	‘Whirlpool’ is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation. 
iti109:8.1	‘Sharks and monsters’ is a term for females. 
iti109:9.1	‘Against the stream’ is a term for renunciation. 
iti109:10.1	‘Paddling with hands and feet’ is a term for being energetic. 
iti109:11.1	‘A person with good eyesight’ is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.”
iti109:11.2	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti109:11.3	On this it is said: 
iti109:12.1	“In pain they’d give up sensual pleasures,
iti109:12.2	aspiring to the future sanctuary. 
iti109:12.3	With deep understanding and heart well-freed,
iti109:12.4	they’d experience universal liberation.
iti109:12.5	That knowledge master who has completed the spiritual journey,
iti109:12.6	and gone to the end of the world, is called ‘one who has gone beyond’.” 
iti109:13.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.
iti110:0.1	So It Was Said
iti110:0.2	The Book of the Fours
iti110:0.3	The Chapter on the Holy Offering of the Teaching
iti110:0.4	Walking 
iti110:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti110:2.1	“Mendicants, suppose a mendicant has a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought while walking. 
iti110:2.2	They tolerate it and don’t give it up, get rid of it, eliminate it, and obliterate it. Such a mendicant is said to be ‘not keen or prudent, always lazy, and lacking energy’ when walking. 
iti110:3.1	Suppose a mendicant has a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought while standing … 
iti110:4.1	sitting … 
iti110:5.1	or when lying down while awake. 
iti110:5.2	They tolerate it and don’t give it up, get rid of it, eliminate it, and obliterate it. Such a mendicant is said to be ‘not keen or prudent, always lazy, and lacking energy’ when lying down while awake. 
iti110:6.1	Suppose a mendicant has a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought while walking. 
iti110:6.2	They don’t tolerate them, but give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them. 
iti110:6.3	Such a mendicant is said to be ‘keen and prudent, always energetic and determined’ when walking. 
iti110:7.1	Suppose a mendicant has a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought while standing … 
iti110:8.1	sitting … 
iti110:9.1	or when lying down while awake. 
iti110:9.2	They don’t tolerate it, but give it up, get rid of it, eliminate it, and obliterate it. 
iti110:9.3	Such a mendicant is said to be ‘keen and prudent, always energetic and determined’ when lying down while awake.” 
iti110:9.4	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti110:9.5	On this it is said: 
iti110:10.1	“Whether walking or standing, 
iti110:10.2	sitting or lying down, 
iti110:10.3	one who thinks a bad thought 
iti110:10.4	to do with the lay life
iti110:11.1	is practicing the wrong way,
iti110:11.2	lost among things that delude;
iti110:11.3	such a mendicant is incapable 
iti110:11.4	of touching the highest awakening. 
iti110:12.1	But one who, whether standing or walking, 
iti110:12.2	sitting or lying down, 
iti110:12.3	has calmed their thoughts, 
iti110:12.4	loving peace of mind; 
iti110:12.5	such a mendicant is capable 
iti110:12.6	of touching the highest awakening.” 
iti110:13.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.
iti111:0.1	So It Was Said
iti111:0.2	The Book of the Fours
iti111:0.3	The Chapter on the Holy Offering of the Teaching
iti111:0.4	Accomplishment in Ethics
iti111:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti111:2.1	“Mendicants, live by the ethical precepts and the monastic code. Live restrained in the code of conduct, conducting yourselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, keep the rules you’ve undertaken. 
iti111:3.1	When you’ve done this, what more is there to do? 
iti111:4.1	Suppose a mendicant has got rid of desire and ill will while walking, and has given up dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. Their energy is roused up and unflagging, their mindfulness is established and lucid, their body is tranquil and undisturbed, and their mind is immersed in samādhi. 
iti111:4.2	Such a mendicant is said to be ‘keen and prudent, always energetic and determined’ when walking. 
iti111:5.1	Suppose a mendicant has got rid of desire and ill will while standing … 
iti111:6.1	sitting … 
iti111:7.1	or when lying down while awake. 
iti111:7.2	Such a mendicant is said to be ‘keen and prudent, always energetic and determined’ when lying down while awake.” 
iti111:7.3	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti111:7.4	On this it is said: 
iti111:8.1	“Carefully walking, carefully standing, 
iti111:8.2	carefully sitting, carefully lying; 
iti111:8.3	a mendicant carefully bends their limbs, 
iti111:8.4	and carefully extends them. 
iti111:9.1	Above, below, all round, 
iti111:9.2	as far as the earth extends; 
iti111:9.3	they scrutinize the rise and fall 
iti111:9.4	of phenomena such as the aggregates. 
iti111:10.1	Meditating diligently like this,
iti111:10.2	peaceful and stable,
iti111:10.3	training in what leads to serenity of heart, 
iti111:10.4	always staying mindful; 
iti111:10.5	they call such a mendicant 
iti111:10.6	‘always determined’.” 
iti111:11.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.
iti112:0.1	So It Was Said
iti112:0.2	The Book of the Fours
iti112:0.3	The Chapter on the Holy Offering of the Teaching
iti112:0.4	The World 
iti112:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti112:2.1	“Mendicants, the world has been understood by the Realized One; 
iti112:2.2	and he is detached from the world.
iti112:2.3	The origin of the world has been understood by the Realized One; 
iti112:2.4	and he has given up the origin of the world.
iti112:2.5	The cessation of the world has been understood by the Realized One; 
iti112:2.6	and he has realized the cessation of the world.
iti112:2.7	The practice that leads to the cessation of the world has been understood by the Realized One; 
iti112:2.8	and he has developed the practice that leads to the cessation of the world.
iti112:3.1	In this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, sought, and explored by the mind, all that has been understood by the Realized One. 
iti112:3.2	That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.
iti112:4.1	From the night when the Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening until the night he becomes fully extinguished—through the natural principle of extinguishment, without anything left over—everything he speaks, says, and expresses is real, not otherwise. 
iti112:4.2	That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.
iti112:5.1	The Realized One does as he says, and says as he does. 
iti112:5.2	Since this is so, 
iti112:5.3	that’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.
iti112:6.1	In this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—the Realized One is the undefeated, the champion, the universal seer, the wielder of power. 
iti112:6.2	That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.”
iti112:6.3	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti112:6.4	On this it is said: 
iti112:7.1	“Directly knowing the whole world as it is, 
iti112:7.2	and everything in it, 
iti112:7.3	he is detached from the whole world, 
iti112:7.4	disengaged from the whole world. 
iti112:8.1	That wise one is the champion 
iti112:8.2	who is released from all ties. 
iti112:8.3	He has reached ultimate peace: 
iti112:8.4	extinguishment, fearing nothing from any quarter. 
iti112:9.1	He is the Buddha, with defilements ended, 
iti112:9.2	untroubled, with doubts cut off. 
iti112:9.3	He has attained the end of all deeds, 
iti112:9.4	freed with the ending of attachments. 
iti112:10.1	That Blessed One is the Buddha, 
iti112:10.2	he is the supreme lion, 
iti112:10.3	in all the world with its gods, 
iti112:10.4	he turns the holy wheel. 
iti112:11.1	And so those gods and humans, 
iti112:11.2	who have gone to the Buddha for refuge, 
iti112:11.3	come together and revere him, 
iti112:11.4	even the deities revere him:
iti112:12.1	‘Tamed, he is the best of tamers, 
iti112:12.2	peaceful, he is the hermit among the peaceful, 
iti112:12.3	liberated, he is the foremost of liberators, 
iti112:12.4	crossed over, he is the most excellent of guides across.’ 
iti112:13.1	And so they revere him, 
iti112:13.2	great of heart and rid of naivety. 
iti112:13.3	In the world with its gods, 
iti112:13.4	he has no counterpart.” 
iti112:14.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.

iti11:0.4	Complete Understanding of Delusion
iti11:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti11:2.1	“Mendicants, without directly knowing and completely understanding delusion, without dispassion for it and giving it up, you can’t end suffering. 
iti11:2.2	By directly knowing and completely understanding delusion, having dispassion for it and giving it up, you can end suffering.” 
iti11:2.3	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti11:2.4	On this it is said: 
iti11:3.1	“When overcome by delusion
iti11:3.2	beings go to a bad place.
iti11:3.3	Having rightly understood that delusion,
iti11:3.4	the discerning give it up.
iti11:3.5	Once they’ve given it up,
iti11:3.6	they never return to this world.”

iti12:2.3	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti12:2.4	On this it is said:

iti12:3.2	beings go to a bad place.
iti12:3.3	Having rightly understood that anger,

iti13:2.2	By directly knowing and completely understanding disdain, having dispassion for it and giving it up, you can end suffering.”
iti13:2.3	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti13:2.4	On this it is said: 
iti13:3.1	“When overcome by disdain
iti13:3.2	beings go to a bad place.
iti13:3.3	Having rightly understood that disdain,

iti14:0.4	The Hindrance of Ignorance
iti14:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti14:2.1	“Mendicants, I do not see a single hindrance, hindered by which people wander and transmigrate for a long time like the hindrance of ignorance.
iti14:2.2	Hindered by ignorance, people wander and transmigrate for a long time.”
iti14:2.3	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti14:2.4	On this it is said: 
iti14:3.1	“There is no other thing
iti14:3.2	that hinders people like ignorance.
iti14:3.3	Shrouded by delusion,
iti14:3.4	they transmigrate day and night.
iti14:4.1	Those who have given up delusion,
iti14:4.2	shattering the mass of darkness,
iti14:4.3	wander no more,
iti14:4.4	the root is not found in them.”

iti15:0.4	The Fetter of Craving
iti15:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti15:2.1	“Mendicants, I do not see a single fetter, fettered by which people wander and transmigrate for a long time like the fetter of craving.
iti15:2.2	Fettered by craving, people wander and transmigrate for a long time.”
iti15:2.3	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti15:2.4	On this it is said: 
iti15:3.1	“Craving is a person’s partner 
iti15:3.2	as they transmigrate on this long journey. 
iti15:3.3	They go from this state to another, 
iti15:3.4	but don’t escape transmigration. 
iti15:4.1	Knowing this danger,
iti15:4.2	that craving is the cause of suffering—
iti15:4.3	rid of craving, free of grasping,
iti15:4.4	a mendicant would wander mindful.”

iti16:2.1	“Taking into account interior factors, mendicants, I do not see a single one that is so very helpful as proper attention for a trainee mendicant who hasn’t achieved their heart’s desire, but lives aspiring to the supreme sanctuary. 
iti16:2.2	A mendicant paying proper attention gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful.”
iti16:2.3	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti16:2.4	On this it is said: 
iti16:3.1	“There is nothing so helpful
iti16:3.2	for a trainee mendicant
iti16:3.3	aspiring for the ultimate goal
iti16:3.4	as proper attention.
iti16:3.5	Striving properly, a mendicant

iti17:2.2	A mendicant who has good friends gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful.”
iti17:2.3	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti17:2.4	On this it is said: 
iti17:3.1	“A mendicant with good friends
iti17:3.2	is reverential and respectful
iti17:3.3	when their friends are speaking,
iti17:3.4	aware and mindful.
iti17:3.5	Gradually they would attain

iti18:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti18:2.1	“One thing, mendicants, arises in the world for the hurt and unhappiness of the people, for the harm, hurt, and suffering of gods and humans. 
iti18:2.2	What one thing? 
iti18:2.3	Schism in the Saṅgha.
iti18:2.4	When the Saṅgha is split, they argue, insult, block, and reject each other. 
iti18:2.5	This doesn’t inspire confidence in those without it, and it causes some with confidence to change their minds.”
iti18:2.6	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti18:2.7	On this it is said: 
iti18:3.1	“A schismatic remains for the eon
iti18:3.2	in a place of loss, in hell. 
iti18:3.3	Taking a stand against the teaching, 
iti18:3.4	favoring factions, they destroy their sanctuary. 
iti18:3.5	After causing schism in a harmonious Saṅgha, 
iti18:3.6	they burn in hell for an eon.”

iti19:2.2	What one thing? 
iti19:2.3	Harmony in the Saṅgha.
iti19:2.4	When the Saṅgha is in harmony, they don’t argue, insult, block, or reject each other. 
iti19:2.5	This inspires confidence in those without it, and increases confidence in those who have it.”
iti19:2.6	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti19:2.7	On this it is said: 
iti19:3.1	“A Saṅgha in harmony is happy, 
iti19:3.2	as is support for those in harmony.
iti19:3.3	Taking a stand on the teaching, 
iti19:3.4	favoring harmony, they ruin no sanctuary. 
iti19:3.5	After creating harmony in the Saṅgha, 
iti19:3.6	they rejoice in heaven for an eon.”

iti20:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti20:2.1	“Mendicants, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person whose mind is corrupted, I understand: 
iti20:2.2	‘If this person were to die right now, they would be cast down to hell.’ 
iti20:2.3	Why is that? 
iti20:2.4	Because their mind is corrupted. 
iti20:2.5	Corruption of mind is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.” 
iti20:2.6	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti20:2.7	On this it is said: 
iti20:3.1	“Knowing a person’s
iti20:3.2	corrupted mind,
iti20:3.3	the Buddha explained this matter
iti20:3.4	in the mendicants’ presence.
iti20:4.1	If that person
iti20:4.2	were to die at this time,
iti20:4.3	they’d be reborn in hell,
iti20:4.4	for their mind is corrupted.
iti20:5.1	Such a person is cast down as surely
iti20:5.2	as if they’d been carried off and put there.
iti20:5.3	For corruption of mind is the reason
iti20:5.4	sentient beings go to a bad place.”
iti20:6.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.

iti21:2.1	“Mendicants, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person whose mind is pure, I understand: 
iti21:2.2	‘If this person were to die right now, they would be raised up to heaven.’ 
iti21:2.3	Why is that? 
iti21:2.4	Because their mind is pure. 
iti21:2.5	Purity of mind is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.” 
iti21:2.6	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti21:2.7	On this it is said: 
iti21:3.1	“Knowing a person’s
iti21:3.2	pure mind,
iti21:3.3	the Buddha explained this matter
iti21:3.4	in the mendicants’ presence.
iti21:4.1	If that person
iti21:4.2	were to die at this time,
iti21:4.3	they’d be reborn in heaven,
iti21:4.4	for their mind is pure. 
iti21:5.1	Such a person is raised up as surely
iti21:5.2	as if they’d been carried and put there.
iti21:5.3	For purity of mind is the reason
iti21:5.4	sentient beings go to a good place.”

iti22:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti22:2.1	“Mendicants, don’t fear good deeds. 
iti22:2.2	For ‘good deeds’ is a term for happiness, for what is likable, desirable, and agreeable. 
iti22:2.3	I recall undergoing for a long time the likable, desirable, and agreeable results of good deeds performed over a long time. 
iti22:2.4	As a result, for seven eons of the cosmos contracting and expanding I didn’t return to this world again. 
iti22:2.5	As the eon contracted I went to the realm of streaming radiance. 
iti22:2.6	As it expanded I was reborn in an empty mansion of Brahmā. 
iti22:3.1	There I was Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the undefeated, the champion, the universal seer, the wielder of power. 
iti22:3.2	I was Sakka, lord of gods, thirty-six times. 
iti22:3.3	Many hundreds of times I was a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. My dominion extended to all four sides, I achieved stability in the country, and I possessed the seven treasures. 
iti22:3.4	Not to mention regional kingship!
iti22:4.1	Then I thought, 
iti22:4.2	‘Of what deed of mine is this the fruit and result, that I am now so mighty and powerful?’ 
iti22:4.3	Then I thought, 
iti22:4.4	‘It is the fruit and result of three kinds of deeds: 
iti22:4.5	giving, self-control, and restraint.’”
iti22:4.6	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti22:4.7	On this it is said: 
iti22:5.1	“One should practice only good deeds,
iti22:5.2	whose happy outcome stretches ahead.
iti22:5.3	Giving and moral conduct, 
iti22:5.4	developing a mind of love:
iti22:6.1	having developed these
iti22:6.2	three things yielding happiness,
iti22:6.3	that astute one is reborn 
iti22:6.4	in a happy, pleasing world.”

iti23:2.1	“This one thing, mendicants, when developed and cultivated, secures benefits for both
iti23:2.2	the present life and lives to come.
iti23:2.3	What one thing? 
iti23:2.4	Diligence in skillful qualities. 
iti23:2.5	This is the one thing that, when developed and cultivated, secures benefits for both 
iti23:2.6	the present life and lives to come.”
iti23:2.7	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti23:2.8	On this it is said: 
iti23:3.1	“The astute praise diligence 
iti23:3.2	in making merit. 
iti23:3.3	Being diligent, an astute person 
iti23:3.4	secures both benefits: 
iti23:4.1	the benefit in this life, 
iti23:4.2	and in lives to come. 
iti23:4.3	A wise one, comprehending the meaning, 
iti23:4.4	is said to be astute.”

iti24:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti24:2.1	“Mendicants, one person roaming and transmigrating for an eon would amass a heap of bones the size of this Mount Vepulla, if they were gathered together and not lost.”
iti24:2.2	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti24:2.3	On this it is said: 
iti24:3.1	“If the bones of a single person 
iti24:3.2	for a single eon were gathered up, 
iti24:3.3	they’d make a pile the size of a mountain: 
iti24:3.4	so said the great hermit.
iti24:4.1	And this is declared to be 
iti24:4.2	as huge as Mount Vepulla, 
iti24:4.3	higher than the Vulture’s Peak 
iti24:4.4	near the Mountainfold of the Magadhans.
iti24:5.1	But then, with right understanding, 
iti24:5.2	a person sees the noble truths—
iti24:5.3	suffering, suffering’s origin,
iti24:5.4	suffering’s transcendence,
iti24:5.5	and the noble eightfold path 
iti24:5.6	that leads to the stilling of suffering.
iti24:6.1	After roaming on seven times at most,
iti24:6.2	that person 
iti24:6.3	makes an end of suffering, 
iti24:6.4	with the ending of all fetters.”

iti25:2.1	“Mendicants, for an individual who transgresses in one thing, there is no bad deed they would not do, I say. 
iti25:2.2	What one thing? 
iti25:2.3	It is this: telling a deliberate lie.”
iti25:2.4	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti25:2.5	On this it is said: 
iti25:3.1	“When a person, spurning the hereafter,
iti25:3.2	transgresses in just one thing—
iti25:3.3	lying—
iti25:3.4	there is no evil they would not do.”
iti25:4.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.

iti26:0.4	Giving
iti26:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti26:2.1	“Mendicants, if sentient beings only knew, as I do, the fruit of giving and sharing, they would not eat without first giving, and the stain of stinginess would not occupy their minds.
iti26:2.2	They would not eat without sharing even their last mouthful, their last morsel, so long as there was someone to receive it.
iti26:2.3	It is because sentient beings do not know, as I do, the fruit of giving and sharing, that they eat without first giving, and the stain of stinginess occupies their minds.”
iti26:2.4	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti26:2.5	On this it is said: 
iti26:3.1	“If sentient beings only knew
iti26:3.2	how great is the fruit
iti26:3.3	of giving and sharing
iti26:3.4	as taught by the great hermit!
iti26:4.1	Rid of the stain of stinginess, 
iti26:4.2	with clear and confident heart, 
iti26:4.3	they would duly give to the noble ones,
iti26:4.4	where a gift is very fruitful. 
iti26:5.1	Having given food in abundance
iti26:5.2	to those worthy of a religious donation, 
iti26:5.3	after passing from the human realm,
iti26:5.4	the givers go to heaven.
iti26:6.1	And when they have arrived there in heaven,
iti26:6.2	they enjoy all the pleasures they desire.
iti26:6.3	The generous enjoy the 
iti26:6.4	fruit of giving and sharing.”

iti27:0.4	The Meditation on Love
iti27:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti27:2.1	“Mendicants, of all the grounds for making worldly merit, none are worth a sixteenth part of the heart’s release by love.
iti27:2.2	Surpassing them, the heart’s release by love shines and glows and radiates.
iti27:3.1	It’s like how the radiance of all the stars is not worth a sixteenth part of the moon’s radiance. Surpassing them, the moon’s radiance by love shines and glows and radiates.
iti27:3.2	In the same way, of all the grounds for making worldly merit, none are worth a sixteenth part of the heart’s release by love. Surpassing them, the heart’s release by love shines and glows and radiates.
iti27:4.1	It’s like the time after the rainy season when the sky is clear and cloudless. And when the sun rises, it dispels all the darkness from the sky as it shines and glows and radiates. 
iti27:4.2	In the same way, of all the grounds for making worldly merit, none are worth a sixteenth part of the heart’s release by love. Surpassing them, the heart’s release by love shines and glows and radiates.
iti27:5.1	It’s like how after the rainy season the sky is clear and cloudless. At the crack of dawn, the Morning Star shines and glows and radiates. 
iti27:5.2	In the same way, of all the grounds for making worldly merit, none are worth a sixteenth part of the heart’s release by love. Surpassing them, the heart’s release by love shines and glows and radiates.”
iti27:5.3	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti27:5.4	On this it is said: 
iti27:6.1	“A mindful one who develops 
iti27:6.2	limitless love 
iti27:6.3	weakens the fetters, 
iti27:6.4	seeing the ending of attachments. 
iti27:7.1	Loving just one creature with a hateless heart 
iti27:7.2	makes you a good person. 
iti27:7.3	Compassionate for all creatures, 
iti27:7.4	a noble one creates abundant merit. 
iti27:8.1	The royal potentates conquered this land 
iti27:8.2	and traveled around sponsoring sacrifices—
iti27:8.3	horse sacrifice, human sacrifice, 
iti27:8.4	the sacrifices of the ‘stick-casting’, the ‘royal soma drinking’, and the ‘unbarred’. 
iti27:9.1	These are not worth a sixteenth part 
iti27:9.2	of the mind developed with love, 
iti27:9.3	as starlight cannot rival the moon. 
iti27:10.1	Don’t kill or cause others to kill,
iti27:10.2	don’t conquer or encourage others to conquer, 
iti27:10.3	with love for all living creatures—
iti27:10.4	you’ll have no enmity for anyone.”

iti28:2.1	“Mendicants, when a mendicant has two qualities they live unhappily in the present life—with distress, anguish, and fever—
iti28:2.2	and when the body breaks up, after death, they can expect a bad rebirth. 
iti28:2.3	What two? 
iti28:2.4	Not guarding the sense doors and eating too much. 
iti28:2.5	When a mendicant has these two qualities they live unhappily in the present life—with distress, anguish, and fever—
iti28:2.6	and when the body breaks up, after death, they can expect a bad rebirth.”
iti28:2.7	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti28:2.8	On this it is said: 
iti28:3.1	“Eye, ear, nose,
iti28:3.2	tongue, body, and likewise mind:
iti28:3.3	a mendicant who leaves these
iti28:3.4	sense doors unguarded—
iti28:4.1	immoderate in eating,
iti28:4.2	sense faculties unrestrained—
iti28:4.3	reaps suffering
iti28:4.4	both physical and mental.
iti28:5.1	Burning in body,

iti28:5.3	by day or by night
iti28:5.4	such a person lives in suffering.”

iti29:2.4	Guarding the sense doors and moderation in eating. 
iti29:2.5	When a mendicant has these two qualities they live happily in the present life—without distress, anguish, and fever—

iti30:2.1	“These two things, mendicants, are mortifying. 
iti30:2.2	What two? 
iti30:2.3	It’s when someone hasn’t done good and skillful things that keep them safe, but has done bad, violent, and depraved things. 
iti30:2.4	Thinking, ‘I haven’t done good things’, they’re mortified. Thinking, ‘I have done bad things’, they’re mortified. 
iti30:2.5	These are the two things that are mortifying.” 
iti30:2.6	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti30:2.7	On this it is said: 
iti30:3.1	“Having done bad things 
iti30:3.2	by way of body, 
iti30:3.3	speech, and mind,
iti30:3.4	and whatever else is corrupt;

iti34:2.1	“Mendicants, without being keen and prudent a mendicant can’t achieve awakening, extinguishment, and the supreme sanctuary. 
iti34:2.2	But if a mendicant is keen and prudent they can achieve awakening, extinguishment, and the supreme sanctuary.”
iti34:2.3	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti34:2.4	On this it is said:

iti34:3.2	lazy, lacking energy,
iti34:3.3	full of dullness and drowsiness,
iti34:3.4	unconscientious, lacking regard for others,
iti34:3.5	such a mendicant is incapable

iti35:3.2	not because of tradition, 
iti35:3.3	but for the sake of restraint and giving up,

iti37:2.2	What two?

iti37:4.2	peaceful and stable,
iti37:4.3	devoted to serenity of heart,

iti38:0.4	Thoughts 
iti38:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti38:2.1	“Two thoughts, mendicants, often occur to the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha:
iti38:2.2	the thought of sanctuary, and that of seclusion.
iti38:2.3	The Realized One loves kindness and delights in it,
iti38:2.4	so this thought often occurs to him:
iti38:2.5	‘Through this behavior, I shall not hurt any creature firm or frail.’
iti38:3.1	The Realized One loves seclusion and delights in it,
iti38:3.2	so this thought often occurs to him:
iti38:3.3	‘What is unskillful has been given up.’
iti38:4.1	So, mendicants, you too should love kindness and delight in it,
iti38:4.2	then this thought will often occur to you:
iti38:4.3	‘Through this behavior, I shall not hurt any creature firm or frail.’
iti38:5.1	You too should love seclusion and delight in it,
iti38:5.2	then this thought will often occur to you:
iti38:5.3	‘What is unskillful? What is not given up? What should I give up?’”
iti38:5.4	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti38:5.5	On this it is said: 
iti38:6.1	“Two thoughts occur to him,
iti38:6.2	the Realized One, the bearer of the unbearable:
iti38:6.3	first mentioned was thought of sanctuary,
iti38:6.4	then the second made clear was seclusion.
iti38:7.1	Dispeller of darkness, the great hermit has crossed over:
iti38:7.2	the attained, the master, the undefiled.
iti38:7.3	In the midst of it all, he is freed in the ending of craving;
iti38:7.4	that sage bears his final body.
iti38:7.5	He has disposed of Māra, I declare, and gone beyond old age.
iti38:8.1	Standing high on a rocky mountain, 
iti38:8.2	you can see the people all around. 
iti38:8.3	In just the same way, the all-seer, wise one, 
iti38:8.4	having ascended the Temple of Truth,
iti38:8.5	rid of sorrow, looks upon the people 
iti38:8.6	swamped with sorrow, oppressed by rebirth and old age.”

iti39:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti39:2.1	“Mendicants, the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha has two approaches to teaching Dhamma.
iti39:2.2	What two? 
iti39:2.3	‘See evil as evil’—
iti39:2.4	this is the first approach to teaching Dhamma. 
iti39:2.5	‘Having seen evil as evil, be disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed from it’—
iti39:2.6	this is the second approach to teaching Dhamma. 
iti39:2.7	The Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha has these two approaches to teaching Dhamma.”
iti39:2.8	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti39:2.9	On this it is said: 
iti39:3.1	“See the two approaches for 
iti39:3.2	explaining the Dhamma
iti39:3.3	used by the Realized One, the Buddha,
iti39:3.4	compassionate for all beings:
iti39:4.1	see that that is evil,
iti39:4.2	and be dispassionate towards it.
iti39:4.3	Then, with a mind free of desire,
iti39:4.4	you will make an end of suffering.”

iti40:2.2	Knowledge precedes the attainment of skillful qualities, with conscience and prudence following along.”
iti40:2.3	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti40:2.4	On this it is said: 
iti40:3.1	“Bad destinies of whatever kind,
iti40:3.2	in this world or the next,
iti40:3.3	are all rooted in ignorance,
iti40:3.4	compounded of greed and desire.
iti40:4.1	Since one of wicked desires is
iti40:4.2	unconscientious, lacking regard for others,
iti40:4.3	they make much bad karma,
iti40:4.4	which sends them to a place of loss.
iti40:5.1	Therefore, dispelling desire
iti40:5.2	and greed and ignorance,
iti40:5.3	a mendicant arousing knowledge
iti40:5.4	would cast off all bad destinies.”

iti41:2.1	“Those sentient beings are truly bereft, mendicants, who are bereft of noble wisdom.
iti41:2.2	They live unhappily in the present life—with distress, anguish, and fever—
iti41:2.3	and when the body breaks up, after death, they can expect a bad rebirth. 
iti41:2.4	Those sentient beings are not bereft who are not bereft of noble wisdom.
iti41:2.5	In the present life they’re happy—free of anguish, distress, and fever—
iti41:2.6	and when the body breaks up, after death, they can expect a good rebirth.”
iti41:2.7	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti41:2.8	On this it is said: 
iti41:3.1	“See the world with its gods,
iti41:3.2	bereft of wisdom,
iti41:3.3	habituated to name and form,
iti41:3.4	imagining this is truth.
iti41:4.1	Wisdom is best in the world,
iti41:4.2	as it leads to penetration,
iti41:4.3	through which one rightly understands
iti41:4.4	the ending of rebirth and continued existence.
iti41:5.1	Gods and humans envy them,
iti41:5.2	the Buddhas, ever mindful,
iti41:5.3	of laughing wisdom,

iti42:2.1	“These two bright things, mendicants, protect the world. 
iti42:2.2	What two? 
iti42:2.3	Conscience and prudence. 
iti42:2.4	If these two bright things did not protect the world, there would be no recognition of the status of mother, aunts, or wives and partners of teachers and respected people. 
iti42:2.5	The world would become promiscuous, like goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and dogs and jackals. 
iti42:2.6	But because the two bright things protect the world, there is recognition of the status of mother, aunts, and wives and partners of teachers and respected people.” 
iti42:2.7	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti42:2.8	On this it is said: 
iti42:3.1	“Those in whom conscience and shame
iti42:3.2	are never found at all,
iti42:3.3	have lost their bright roots,

iti42:4.1	Those in whom conscience and shame
iti42:4.2	are always rightly established,
iti42:4.3	thrive in the spiritual life;
iti42:4.4	being at peace, they will not be reborn again.”

iti43:0.4	Unborn
iti43:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti43:2.1	“There is, mendicants, an unborn, unproduced, unmade, and unconditioned.
iti43:2.2	If there were no unborn, unproduced, unmade, and unconditioned, then you would find no escape here from the born, produced, made, and conditioned.
iti43:2.3	But since there is an unborn, unproduced, unmade, and unconditioned, an escape is found from the born, produced, made, and conditioned.”
iti43:2.4	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti43:2.5	On this it is said: 
iti43:3.1	“What’s born, produced, and arisen,
iti43:3.2	made, conditioned, not lasting,
iti43:3.3	wrapped in old age and death,
iti43:3.4	frail, a nest of disease,
iti43:4.1	generated by food and the conduit to rebirth:
iti43:4.2	that’s not fit to delight in.
iti43:4.3	The escape from that is peaceful,
iti43:4.4	beyond the scope of logic, everlasting,
iti43:5.1	unborn and unarisen,
iti43:5.2	the sorrowless, stainless state,
iti43:5.3	the cessation of all painful things,
iti43:5.4	the stilling of conditions, bliss.”
iti43:6.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.

iti44:0.4	Facets of Quenching
iti44:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti44:2.1	“There are, mendicants, these two facets of quenching. 
iti44:2.2	What two? 
iti44:2.3	The facet of quenching with something left over, and the facet of quenching with nothing left over.
iti44:3.1	And what is the facet of quenching with something left over? 
iti44:3.2	It’s when a mendicant is a perfected one, with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment.
iti44:3.3	Their five sense faculties still remain. So long as their senses have not gone they continue to experience the agreeable and disagreeable, to feel pleasure and pain.
iti44:3.4	The ending of greed, hate, and delusion in them
iti44:3.5	is called the facet of quenching with something left over. 
iti44:4.1	And what is the facet of quenching with nothing left over? 
iti44:4.2	It’s when a mendicant is a perfected one, with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment.
iti44:4.3	For them, everything that’s felt, being no longer relished, will become cool right here.
iti44:4.4	This is called the facet of quenching with nothing left over.
iti44:4.5	These are the two facets of quenching.” 
iti44:4.6	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti44:4.7	On this it is said: 
iti44:5.1	“These two facets of quenching have been made clear
iti44:5.2	by the seer, the unattached, the poised.
iti44:5.3	One facet pertains to the present life—
iti44:5.4	what is left over when the conduit to rebirth has ended.
iti44:5.5	What has nothing left over pertains to what follows this life,
iti44:5.6	where all states of existence cease.
iti44:6.1	Those who have fully understood the unconditioned state—
iti44:6.2	their minds freed, the conduit to rebirth ended—
iti44:6.3	attained to the heart of the Dhamma, they delight in ending,
iti44:6.4	the poised ones have given up all states of existence.”

iti45:0.3	Chapter Two
iti45:0.4	Retreat
iti45:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti45:2.1	“Enjoy retreat, mendicants, love retreat. Be committed to inner serenity of the heart, don’t neglect absorption, be endowed with discernment, and frequent empty huts. 
iti45:2.2	A mendicant who enjoys retreat can expect one of two results:
iti45:2.3	enlightenment in the present life, or if there’s something left over, non-return.” 
iti45:2.4	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti45:2.5	On this it is said: 
iti45:3.1	“With minds at peace, alert,
iti45:3.2	mindful and meditative,
iti45:3.3	they rightly discern the Dhamma,
iti45:3.4	unconcerned for sensual pleasures.
iti45:4.1	Delighting in diligence, peaceful,
iti45:4.2	seeing fear in negligence, 
iti45:4.3	such a one can’t decline, 
iti45:4.4	and has drawn near to quenching.” 
iti45:5.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.

iti46:0.4	The Benefits of Training 
iti46:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti46:2.1	“Mendicants, live with training as benefit, with wisdom as overseer, with freedom as core, and with mindfulness as ruler. 
iti46:2.2	A mendicant who lives in this way can expect one of two results:
iti46:2.3	enlightenment in the present life, or if there’s something left over, non-return.” 
iti46:2.4	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti46:2.5	On this it is said: 
iti46:3.1	“The training fulfilled, not liable to decline,
iti46:3.2	overseen by wisdom, seer of rebirth’s end;
iti46:3.3	that sage bears their final body;
iti46:3.4	they have disposed of Māra, I declare, and gone beyond old age.
iti46:4.1	Therefore be always enjoying absorption, immersed in samādhi,
iti46:4.2	energetic, seers of rebirth’s end.
iti46:4.3	Having overcome Māra and his armies, mendicants,
iti46:4.4	go beyond birth and death.” 
iti46:5.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.

iti47:0.4	Wake Up
iti47:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti47:2.1	“Meditate wakeful, mendicants, mindful and aware, joyful and clear, and at times discern the skillful qualities in that state.
iti47:2.2	A mendicant who meditates in this way can expect one of two results:
iti47:2.3	enlightenment in the present life, or if there’s something left over, non-return.” 
iti47:2.4	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti47:2.5	On this it is said: 
iti47:3.1	“Listen up, wakeful ones!
iti47:3.2	And those asleep, wake up!
iti47:3.3	Wakefulness is better than sleep,
iti47:3.4	the wakeful have nothing to fear.
iti47:4.1	Those who are wakeful, mindful and aware,
iti47:4.2	immersed in samādhi, joyful and clear,
iti47:4.3	rightly investigating the Dhamma in good time,
iti47:4.4	unified, would shatter the darkness.
iti47:5.1	That’s why you should apply yourself to wakefulness.
iti47:5.2	A keen and alert mendicant, possessing absorption,
iti47:5.3	having cut the fetter of birth and old age,
iti47:5.4	would touch the highest awakening right here.”
iti47:6.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.

iti48:0.4	Bound for Loss 
iti48:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti48:2.1	“Mendicants, two kinds of people are bound for a place of loss, bound for hell, if they don’t give up this fault. 
iti48:2.2	What two? 
iti48:2.3	Someone who is unchaste, but claims to be celibate; and someone who makes a groundless accusation of unchastity against a person whose celibacy is pure.
iti48:2.4	These are the two kinds of people bound for a place of loss, bound for hell, if they don’t give up this fault.” 
iti48:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti48:2.6	On this it is said: 
iti48:3.1	“A liar goes to hell, 
iti48:3.2	as does one who denies what they did.
iti48:3.3	Both are equal in the hereafter,
iti48:3.4	those men of base deeds.
iti48:4.1	Many who wrap their necks in ocher robes
iti48:4.2	are unrestrained and wicked.
iti48:4.3	Being wicked, they are reborn in hell
iti48:4.4	due to their bad deeds.
iti48:5.1	It’d be better for the immoral and unrestrained
iti48:5.2	to eat an iron ball,
iti48:5.3	scorching, like a burning flame,
iti48:5.4	than to eat the nation’s alms.”
iti48:6.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.

iti49:0.4	Misconceptions
iti49:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti49:2.1	“Overcome by two misconceptions, mendicants, some gods and humans get stuck, some overreach, while those with vision see.
iti49:3.1	And how do some get stuck? 
iti49:3.2	Because of love, delight, and enjoyment of existence, when the Dhamma is being taught for the cessation of existence, the minds of some gods and humans are not eager, confident, settled, and decided.
iti49:3.3	That is how some get stuck.
iti49:4.1	And how do some overreach? 
iti49:4.2	Some, becoming horrified, repelled, and disgusted with existence, delight in ending existence:
iti49:4.3	‘When this self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death:
iti49:4.4	that is peaceful, that is sublime, that is reality.’ 
iti49:4.5	That is how some overreach.
iti49:5.1	And how do those with vision see?
iti49:5.2	It’s when a mendicant sees what has come to be as having come to be.
iti49:5.3	Seeing this, they are practicing for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding what has come to be. 
iti49:5.4	That is how those with vision see.”
iti49:5.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti49:5.6	On this it is said: 
iti49:6.1	“Those who see what has come to be as having come to be,
iti49:6.2	transcending what has come to be,
iti49:6.3	are freed in accord with the truth,
iti49:6.4	with the ending of craving for continued existence.
iti49:7.1	They completely understand what has come to be,
iti49:7.2	rid of craving for rebirth in this or that state,
iti49:7.3	with the disappearance of what has come to be,
iti49:7.4	a mendicant does not come back to future lives.”

iti50:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti50:2.1	“Mendicants, there are these three unskillful roots. 
iti50:2.2	What three? 
iti50:2.3	Greed, hate, and delusion. 
iti50:2.4	These are the three unskillful roots. ”
iti50:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti50:2.6	On this it is said: 
iti50:3.1	“When greed, hate, and delusion, 
iti50:3.2	have arisen inside oneself, 
iti50:3.3	they harm a person of wicked heart, 
iti50:3.4	as a reed is destroyed by its own fruit.”

iti51:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti51:2.1	“Mendicants, there are these three elements. 
iti51:2.2	What three? 
iti51:2.3	The elements of form, formlessness, and cessation. 
iti51:2.4	These are the three elements.” 
iti51:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti51:2.6	On this it is said: 
iti51:3.1	“Comprehending the element of form, 
iti51:3.2	not stuck in the formless,
iti51:3.3	those who are released in cessation,
iti51:3.4	they are destroyers of death.
iti51:4.1	Having directly experienced the deathless element,
iti51:4.2	free of attachments; 
iti51:4.3	having realised relinquishment
iti51:4.4	of attachments, the undefiled
iti51:4.5	fully awakened Buddha teaches
iti51:4.6	the sorrowless, stainless state.”

iti52:2.2	What three? 
iti52:2.3	Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling. 
iti52:2.4	These are the three feelings.” 
iti52:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti52:2.6	On this it is said: 
iti52:3.1	“Stilled, aware,
iti52:3.2	a mindful disciple of the Buddha 
iti52:3.3	understands feelings, 
iti52:3.4	the cause of feelings, 
iti52:4.1	where they cease, 
iti52:4.2	and the path that leads to their ending. 
iti52:4.3	With the ending of feelings, a mendicant 
iti52:4.4	is hungerless, extinguished.”

iti53:2.2	What three? 
iti53:2.3	Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling. 
iti53:2.4	Pleasant feeling should be seen as suffering. 
iti53:2.5	Painful feeling should be seen as a dart. 
iti53:2.6	Neutral feeling should be seen as impermanent. 
iti53:2.7	When a mendicant has seen these three feelings in this way, 
iti53:2.8	they’re called a mendicant who has cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of suffering.”
iti53:2.9	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti53:2.10	On this it is said: 
iti53:3.1	“A mendicant who sees pleasure as pain, 
iti53:3.2	and suffering as a dart,
iti53:3.3	and that peaceful, neutral feeling 
iti53:3.4	as impermanent 
iti53:4.1	sees rightly.
iti53:4.2	And when freed in regards to that,
iti53:4.3	that peaceful sage, with perfect insight,
iti53:4.4	has truly escaped their bonds.”

iti54:2.2	What three? 
iti54:2.3	The search for sensual pleasures, the search for continued existence, and the search for a spiritual path. 
iti54:2.4	These are the three searches.

iti55:2.6	On this it is said: 
iti55:3.1	“The search for sensual pleasures, for a good rebirth, 
iti55:3.2	and the search for a spiritual path; 
iti55:3.3	the holding tight to the notion ‘this is the truth’, 
iti55:3.4	and the mass of grounds for views—
iti55:4.1	for one detached from all lusts, 
iti55:4.2	freed by the ending of craving, 
iti55:4.3	that searching has been relinquished, 
iti55:4.4	and those viewpoints eradicated.

iti58:2.4	These are the three cravings.”

iti61:4.6	is released from all suffering.”
iti61:5.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.

iti62:0.3	Chapter Two 
iti62:0.4	Faculties 
iti62:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti62:2.1	“Mendicants, there are these three faculties. 
iti62:2.2	What three? 
iti62:2.3	The faculty of understanding that one’s enlightenment is imminent. The faculty of enlightenment. The faculty of one who is enlightened. 
iti62:2.4	These are the three faculties.” 
iti62:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti62:2.6	On this it is said: 
iti62:3.1	“As a trainee trains, 
iti62:3.2	following the straight road, 
iti62:3.3	first they know about ending; 
iti62:3.4	enlightenment follows in the same lifetime. 
iti62:4.1	Then the knowledge comes
iti62:4.2	to such a one, freed through enlightenment,
iti62:4.3	with the end of the fetters of rebirth:
iti62:4.4	‘My freedom is unshakable.’
iti62:5.1	Accomplished in the faculties, 
iti62:5.2	peaceful, in love with the state of peace,
iti62:5.3	they bear their final body, 
iti62:5.4	having vanquished Māra and his mount.” 
iti62:6.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.

iti63:0.4	Periods 
iti63:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti63:2.1	“Mendicants, there are these three periods. 
iti63:2.2	What three? 
iti63:2.3	Past, future, and present. 
iti63:2.4	These are the three periods.” 
iti63:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti63:2.6	On this it is said: 
iti63:3.1	“Sentient beings who perceive the communicable, 
iti63:3.2	become established in the communicable. 
iti63:3.3	Not understanding the communicable, 
iti63:3.4	they fall under the yoke of Death. 
iti63:4.1	But having fully understood the communicable, 
iti63:4.2	they don’t identify as a communicator, 
iti63:4.3	as they’ve touched liberation with their mind,
iti63:4.4	the supreme state of peace.
iti63:5.1	Accomplished in the visible, 
iti63:5.2	peaceful, in love with the state of peace;
iti63:5.3	making use after reflection, firm in principle, 
iti63:5.4	a knowledge master cannot be reckoned.”
iti63:6.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.

iti64:2.3	Bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. 
iti64:2.4	These are the three faculties.” 
iti64:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti64:2.6	On this it is said: 
iti64:3.1	“Having done bad things 
iti64:3.2	by way of body, 
iti64:3.3	speech, and mind,
iti64:3.4	and whatever else is corrupt;
iti64:4.1	not having done good deeds,
iti64:4.2	and having done many bad,
iti64:4.3	when their body breaks up, that witless person 
iti64:4.4	is reborn in hell.”

iti65:2.2	What three? 
iti65:2.3	Good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. 
iti65:2.4	These are the three kinds of good conduct.” 
iti65:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti65:2.6	On this it is said: 
iti65:3.1	“Having given up bad conduct 
iti65:3.2	by way of body, 
iti65:3.3	speech, and mind, 
iti65:3.4	and whatever else is corrupt;
iti65:4.1	not having done bad deeds,
iti65:4.2	and having done many good,
iti65:4.3	when their body breaks up, that wise person 
iti65:4.4	is reborn in heaven.”

iti66:2.3	Purity of body, speech, and mind. 
iti66:2.4	These are the three kinds of purity.” 
iti66:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti66:2.6	On this it is said: 
iti66:3.1	“Purity of body, purity of speech, 
iti66:3.2	and undefiled purity of heart. 
iti66:3.3	A pure person, blessed with purity, 
iti66:3.4	has given up everything, they say.”

iti67:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti67:2.6	On this it is said: 
iti67:3.1	“A sage in body, a sage in speech, 
iti67:3.2	a sage undefiled in mind; 
iti67:3.3	a sage, blessed with sagacity, 
iti67:3.4	has washed off all bad things, they say.”

iti68:2.1	“Whoever has not given up greed, hate, and delusion
iti68:2.2	is said to be trapped. They’re caught in Māra’s snare, and the Wicked One can do what he wants with them. 
iti68:2.3	Whoever has given up greed, hate, and delusion
iti68:2.4	is said to be free. They’re caught in Māra’s snare, and the Wicked One can do what he wants with them.”
iti68:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti68:2.6	On this it is said: 
iti68:3.1	“Those in whom greed, hate, and ignorance
iti68:3.2	have faded away, 
iti68:3.3	belong with those who are evolved;
iti68:3.4	holy, realized, awakened,
iti68:3.5	beyond enmity and fear,
iti68:3.6	they’ve given up everything, they say.”

iti69:2.1	“Whoever has not given up greed, hate, and delusion
iti69:2.2	is said to have not crossed over the ocean with its waves and whirlpools, its sharks and monsters. 
iti69:2.3	Whoever has given up greed, hate, and delusion
iti69:2.4	is said to have crossed over the ocean with its waves and whirlpools, its sharks and monsters. Crossed over and gone beyond, that brahmin stands on the shore.” 
iti69:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti69:2.6	On this it is said: 
iti69:3.1	“Those in whom greed, hate, and ignorance
iti69:3.2	have faded away,
iti69:3.3	have crossed the ocean so hard to cross, 
iti69:3.4	with its sharks and monsters, its waves and dangers. 
iti69:4.1	They’ve escaped their chains, given up death, and have no attachments. 
iti69:4.2	They’ve given up suffering, so there are no more future lives. 
iti69:4.3	They’ve come to an end, and cannot be measured; 
iti69:4.4	and they’ve confounded the King of Death, I say.” 
iti69:5.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.

iti70:0.4	Having Wrong View 
iti70:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti70:2.1	“Mendicants, I’ve seen beings who engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, who abused the noble ones, who had wrong views and acted accordingly.
iti70:2.2	At the breaking up of the body, after death, they were reborn in a lower realm, a bad destination, a world of misery, hell. 
iti70:3.1	Now, I don’t say this because I’ve heard it from some other ascetic or brahmin. 
iti70:3.4	I only say it because I’ve known, seen, and realized it for myself.” 
iti70:4.3	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti70:4.4	On this it is said: 
iti70:5.1	“When the mind has been misdirected,
iti70:5.2	and words wrongly spoken,
iti70:5.3	and right bodily deeds have been done,
iti70:5.4	a person here
iti70:6.1	uneducated, doer of bad deeds,
iti70:6.2	though their life may be short,
iti70:6.3	when their body breaks up, that witless person 
iti70:6.4	is reborn in hell.”

iti71:2.2	At the breaking up of the body, after death, they were reborn in a good destination, a heaven world.
iti71:3.1	Now, I don’t say this because I’ve heard it from some other ascetic or brahmin. 
iti71:3.4	I only say it because I’ve known, seen, and realized it for myself.”
iti71:4.3	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti71:4.4	On this it is said: 
iti71:5.1	“When the mind has been directed right,
iti71:5.2	and words rightly spoken,
iti71:5.3	and right bodily deeds have been done,
iti71:5.4	a person here
iti71:6.1	learned, doer of good deeds,

iti72:0.4	Elements of Escape 
iti72:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti72:2.1	“Mendicants, there are these three elements of escape. 
iti72:2.2	What three? 
iti72:2.3	Renunciation is the escape from sensual pleasures. Formlessness is the escape from form. Cessation is the escape from whatever is created, conditioned, and dependently originated. 
iti72:2.4	These are the three elements of escape.” 
iti72:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti72:2.6	On this it is said: 
iti72:3.1	“Knowing the escape from sensuality,
iti72:3.2	and form’s transcendence,
iti72:3.3	one always keen touches
iti72:3.4	the stilling of all activities.
iti72:4.1	That mendicant sees rightly, 
iti72:4.2	and when freed in regards to that,
iti72:4.3	that peaceful sage, with perfect insight,
iti72:4.4	has truly escaped their bonds.” 
iti72:5.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.

iti73:0.4	More Peaceful
iti73:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti73:2.1	“Mendicants, formless states are more peaceful than states of form; cessation is more peaceful than formless states.”
iti73:2.2	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti73:2.3	On this it is said: 
iti73:3.1	“There are beings in the realm of luminous form, 
iti73:3.2	and others stuck in the formless. 
iti73:3.3	Not understanding cessation, 
iti73:3.4	they return in future lives.
iti73:4.1	But the people who completely understand form, 
iti73:4.2	not stuck in the formless,
iti73:4.3	released in cessation—
iti73:4.4	they are destroyers of death.
iti73:5.1	Having directly experienced the deathless element,
iti73:5.2	free of attachments; 
iti73:5.3	having realised relinquishment
iti73:5.4	of attachments, the undefiled
iti73:5.5	fully awakened Buddha teaches
iti73:5.6	the sorrowless, stainless state.”
iti73:6.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.

iti74:0.3	Chapter Three
iti74:0.4	A Child 
iti74:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti74:2.1	“These three kinds of child are found in the world. 
iti74:2.2	What three? 
iti74:2.3	One who betters their birth, one who equals their birth, one who fails their birth.
iti74:3.1	And how does a child better their birth? 
iti74:3.2	It’s when a child’s parents
iti74:3.3	have not gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha. 
iti74:3.4	They kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, and use alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. They’re immoral, of bad character. 
iti74:3.5	But their child
iti74:3.6	has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. 
iti74:3.7	They don’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. They’re ethical, of good character. 
iti74:3.8	That’s how a child betters their birth.
iti74:4.1	And how does a child equal their birth? 
iti74:4.2	It’s when a child’s parents
iti74:4.3	have gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha. 
iti74:4.4	They don’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. They’re ethical, of good character. 
iti74:4.5	And their child
iti74:4.6	has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. 
iti74:4.7	They don’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. They’re ethical, of good character. 
iti74:4.8	That’s how a child equals their birth.
iti74:5.1	And how does a child fail their birth? 
iti74:5.2	It’s when a child’s parents
iti74:5.3	have gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha. 
iti74:5.4	They don’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. They’re ethical, of good character. 
iti74:5.5	But their child
iti74:5.6	has not gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. 
iti74:5.7	They kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, and use alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. They’re immoral, of bad character. 
iti74:5.8	That’s how a child fails their birth.
iti74:5.9	These are the three kinds of child found in the world.” 
iti74:5.10	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti74:5.11	On this it is said: 
iti74:6.1	“The astute wish for a child
iti74:6.2	who betters or equals their birth;
iti74:6.3	not one who fails their birth,
iti74:6.4	disgracing their family.
iti74:7.1	These are the children in the world
iti74:7.2	who become lay devotees;
iti74:7.3	faithful, accomplished in ethics, 
iti74:7.4	bountiful, rid of stinginess.
iti74:7.5	Like the moon freed from a cloud.
iti74:7.6	they shine in the assemblies.”
iti74:8.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.
iti75:0.1	So It Was Said

iti75:0.3	Chapter Three
iti75:0.4	A Rainless Cloud
iti75:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti75:2.1	“Mendicants, these three people are found in the world. 
iti75:2.2	What three? 
iti75:2.3	One like a rainless cloud, one who rains locally, one who rains all over.
iti75:3.1	And how is a person like a rainless cloud? 
iti75:3.2	It’s when some person doesn’t give to anyone at all—whether ascetics and brahmins, paupers, vagrants, travelers, or beggars—such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, perfumes, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. 
iti75:3.3	That’s how a person is like a rainless cloud. 
iti75:4.1	And how does a person rain locally? 
iti75:4.2	It’s when some person gives to some but not to others—whether ascetics and brahmins, paupers, vagrants, travelers, or beggars—such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, perfumes, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. 
iti75:4.3	That’s how a person rains locally.
iti75:5.1	And how does a person rain all over? 
iti75:5.2	It’s when some person gives to everyone—whether ascetics and brahmins, paupers, vagrants, travelers, or beggars—such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, perfumes, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. 
iti75:5.3	That’s how a person rains all over. 
iti75:5.4	These are the three people found in the world.” 
iti75:5.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti75:5.6	On this it is said: 
iti75:6.1	“They don’t share the food and drink
iti75:6.2	they have acquired
iti75:6.3	with ascetics or brahmins,
iti75:6.4	with paupers, vagrants, or travelers.
iti75:6.5	They’re like a rainless cloud,
iti75:6.6	they say, the meanest of men.
iti75:7.1	They don’t give to some,
iti75:7.2	to some they provide.
iti75:7.3	They rain locally,
iti75:7.4	so say the wise.
iti75:8.1	Compassionate for all beings,
iti75:8.2	that person distributes
iti75:8.3	abundant food upon request,
iti75:8.4	saying, “Give! Give!”
iti75:9.1	The rain cloud rains forth, 
iti75:9.2	having thundered and roared, 
iti75:9.3	drenching the earth with water,
iti75:9.4	soaking the uplands and valleys. 
iti75:10.1	Even so, such a person,
iti75:10.2	having accumulated wealth 
iti75:10.3	by legitimate means,
iti75:10.4	through their own hard work,
iti75:10.5	rightly satisfies with food and drink
iti75:10.6	those fallen to destitution.”
iti75:11.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.
iti76:0.1	So It Was Said
iti76:0.2	The Book of the Threes
iti76:0.3	Chapter Three
iti76:0.4	Wishing for Happiness
iti76:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti76:2.1	“Mendicants, an astute person who wishes for three kinds of happiness should take care of their ethics.
iti76:2.2	What three? 
iti76:2.3	“May I be be praised!” “May I become rich!” “When my body breaks up, after death, may I be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm!”
iti76:2.4	An astute person who wishes for these three kinds of happiness should protect their precepts.”
iti76:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti76:2.6	On this it is said: 
iti76:3.1	Wishing for three kinds of happiness—
iti76:3.2	praise, prosperity,
iti76:3.3	and to delight in heaven after passing away—
iti76:3.4	the wise would take care of their ethics.
iti76:4.1	Though you do no wrong,
iti76:4.2	if you associate with one who does,
iti76:4.3	you’re suspected of wrong,
iti76:4.4	and your disrepute grows.
iti76:5.1	Whatever kind of friend you make, 
iti76:5.2	with whom you associate,
iti76:5.3	that’s how you become,
iti76:5.4	for so it is when you share your life.
iti76:6.1	The one who associates and the one associated with,
iti76:6.2	the one contacted and the one who contacts another,
iti76:6.3	are like an arrow smeared with poison
iti76:6.4	that contaminates the quiver.
iti76:6.5	A wise one, fearing contamination, 
iti76:6.6	would never have wicked friends.
iti76:7.1	A man who wraps
iti76:7.2	putrid fish in blades of grass
iti76:7.3	makes the grass stink—
iti76:7.4	so it is when associating with fools.
iti76:8.1	But one who wraps
iti76:8.2	sandalwood incense in leaves
iti76:8.3	makes the leaves fragrant—
iti76:8.4	so it is when associating with the wise.
iti76:9.1	So, knowing they’ll end up
iti76:9.2	like the wrapping, the astute
iti76:9.3	would shun the wicked,
iti76:9.4	and befriend the good.
iti76:9.5	The wicked lead you to hell, 
iti76:9.6	the good help you to a good place.” 
iti76:10.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.

iti77:0.4	Fragile
iti77:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti77:2.1	“This body is fragile, mendicants, consciousness is liable to fade away, and all attachments are impermanent, suffering, and perishable.”
iti77:2.2	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti77:2.3	On this it is said: 
iti77:3.1	“Knowing that the body is fragile,
iti77:3.2	that consciousness fades away,
iti77:3.3	and seeing the danger in attachments,
iti77:3.4	they go beyond birth and death.
iti77:3.5	Having attained ultimate peace,
iti77:3.6	evolved, they bide their time.”
iti77:4.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.

iti78:0.3	Chapter Three
iti78:0.4	Converging Elements
iti78:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti78:2.1	“Mendicants, sentient beings come together and converge because of an element: 
iti78:2.2	Those who have a bad attitude come together and converge with those who have a bad attitude. 
iti78:2.3	Those who have a good attitude come together and converge with those who have a good attitude. 
iti78:3.1	In the past … 
iti78:4.1	In the future … 
iti78:5.1	At present, too, sentient beings come together and converge because of an element. 
iti78:5.2	Those who have a bad attitude come together and converge with those who have a bad attitude. 
iti78:5.3	Those who have a good attitude come together and converge with those who have a good attitude.”
iti78:5.4	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti78:5.5	On this it is said: 
iti78:6.1	“Socializing promotes entanglements; 
iti78:6.2	they’re cut off by being aloof. 
iti78:6.3	If you’re lost in the middle of a great sea,
iti78:6.4	and you clamber up on a little log, you’ll sink.
iti78:7.1	So too, a person who lives well
iti78:7.2	sinks by relying on a lazy person.
iti78:7.3	Hence you should avoid such
iti78:7.4	a lazy person who lacks energy.

iti79:0.4	Decline 
iti79:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti79:2.1	“These three things lead to the decline of a mendicant trainee. 
iti79:2.2	What three? 
iti79:2.3	It’s when a mendicant relishes work, 
iti79:2.4	talk,
iti79:2.5	and sleep.
iti79:2.6	These three things lead to the decline of a mendicant trainee. 
iti79:3.1	These three things don’t lead to the decline of a mendicant trainee. 
iti79:3.2	What three? 
iti79:3.3	It’s when a mendicant doesn’t relish work, 
iti79:3.4	talk,
iti79:3.5	and sleep.
iti79:3.6	These three things don’t lead to the decline of a mendicant trainee.” 
iti79:3.7	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti79:3.8	On this it is said: 
iti79:4.1	“Restless, they relish
iti79:4.2	work, talk, and sleep.
iti79:4.3	Such a mendicant is incapable 
iti79:4.4	of touching the highest awakening. 
iti79:5.1	That’s why one ought have few duties,
iti79:5.2	being wakeful and stable.
iti79:5.3	Such a mendicant is capable 
iti79:5.4	of touching the highest awakening.”

iti80:0.4	Thoughts 
iti80:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti80:2.1	“Mendicants, there are these three unskillful thoughts. 
iti80:2.2	What three? 
iti80:2.3	The thought of being looked up to; of getting material possessions, honor, and popularity; and of fondness for others.
iti80:2.4	These are the three unskillful thoughts.” 
iti80:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti80:2.6	On this it is said: 
iti80:3.1	“One concerned with being looked up to,
iti80:3.2	with possessions, honor, and respect,
iti80:3.3	with sharing joys with friends,
iti80:3.4	is far from the ending of fetters.
iti80:4.1	But one who gives up children and herds, 
iti80:4.2	marriage and acquisitions—
iti80:4.3	such a mendicant is capable 
iti80:4.4	of touching the highest awakening.”

iti81:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti81:2.1	“I’ve seen, mendicants, sentient beings whose minds are overcome and overwhelmed by honor. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. 
iti81:3.1	I’ve seen sentient beings whose minds are overcome and overwhelmed by not being honored. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. 
iti81:4.1	I’ve seen sentient beings whose minds are overcome and overwhelmed by both honor and by not being honored. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. 
iti81:5.1	Now, I don’t say this because I’ve heard it from some other ascetic or brahmin. 
iti81:5.2	I only say it because I’ve known, seen, and realized it for myself.”
iti81:8.2	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti81:8.3	On this it is said: 
iti81:9.1	“Whether they’re honored 
iti81:9.2	or not honored, or both,
iti81:9.3	their immersion doesn’t waver
iti81:9.4	as they live diligently.
iti81:10.1	They persistently practice absorption
iti81:10.2	with subtle view and discernment.
iti81:10.3	Rejoicing in the ending of grasping,
iti81:10.4	they’re said to be a good person.”

iti82:0.4	The Cry of the Gods
iti82:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti82:2.1	“Mendicants, these three cries are uttered among the gods on occasion.
iti82:2.2	What three? 
iti82:2.3	When a noble disciple shaves off their hair and beard, dresses in ocher robes, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, the gods cry out:
iti82:2.4	‘This noble disciple intends to join battle with Māra!’
iti82:2.5	This is the first occasion a cry is uttered among the gods.
iti82:3.1	Furthermore, when a noble disciple meditates pursuing the development of the seven qualities that lead to awakening, the gods cry out:
iti82:3.2	‘This noble disciple is joining battle with Māra!’
iti82:3.3	This is the second occasion a cry is uttered among the gods.
iti82:4.1	Furthermore, when a noble disciple realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements, the gods cry out:
iti82:4.2	‘This noble disciple has won victory in battle, establishing himself as foremost in battle!’
iti82:4.3	This is the third occasion a cry is uttered among the gods.
iti82:4.4	These are the three cries that are uttered among the gods on occasion.”
iti82:4.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti82:4.6	On this it is said: 
iti82:5.1	“Seeing the winner of the battle—
iti82:5.2	a disciple of the Buddha,
iti82:5.3	a great one, rid of naivety—
iti82:5.4	even the deities revere them:
iti82:6.1	‘Homage to you, O thoroughbred! 
iti82:6.2	You won a battle hard to win!
iti82:6.3	Having defeated the army of death, 
iti82:6.4	your liberation is unobstructed.’
iti82:7.1	And so the deities revere the one, 
iti82:7.2	who has achieved their heart’s desire.
iti82:7.3	For they see nothing in them by means of which 
iti82:7.4	they might fall under the sway of Death.”

iti83:0.4	Five Warning Signs
iti83:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti83:2.1	“Mendicants, when a god is due to pass away from the realm of the gods, five warning signs appear.
iti83:2.2	Their flower-garlands wither; their clothes become soiled; they sweat from the armpits; their physical appearance deteriorates; and they no longer delight in their heavenly throne.
iti83:2.3	When the other gods know that that god is due to pass away, they wish them well in three ways:
iti83:2.4	‘Sir, may you go from here to a good place!
iti83:3.1	When you have gone to a good place, may you be blessed with good fortune!
iti83:4.1	When you have been blessed with good fortune, may you become well grounded!’ 
iti83:5.1	When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha, 
iti83:5.2	“Sir, what do the gods reckon to be going to a good place?
iti83:6.1	What do they reckon to be blessed with good fortune?
iti83:7.1	What do they reckon to become well grounded?”
iti83:8.1	“It is human existence, mendicant, that the gods reckon to be going to a good place.
iti83:9.1	When a human being gains faith in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One,
iti83:9.2	that is what the gods reckon to be blessed with good fortune.
iti83:10.1	When that faith in the Realized One is settled, rooted, and planted deep; when it’s strong and can’t be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world,
iti83:10.2	that is what the gods reckon to become well grounded.”
iti83:11.1	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti83:11.2	On this it is said: 
iti83:12.1	“When, with the fading of life, 
iti83:12.2	a god passes from the realm of the gods,
iti83:12.3	the gods utter three cries
iti83:12.4	of well-wishing:
iti83:13.1	‘Sir, go from here to a good place,
iti83:13.2	in the company of humans.
iti83:13.3	As a human being, gain supreme faith
iti83:13.4	in the true teaching.
iti83:14.1	May that faith of yours be settled,
iti83:14.2	with roots planted deep, 
iti83:14.3	unfaltering all life long
iti83:14.4	in the true teaching so well proclaimed.
iti83:15.1	Having given up bad conduct 
iti83:15.2	by way of body, 
iti83:15.3	speech, and mind, 
iti83:15.4	and whatever else is corrupt;
iti83:16.1	and having done much good,
iti83:16.2	by way of body, 
iti83:16.3	speech, and mind, 
iti83:16.4	limitless, free of attachments; 
iti83:17.1	then, having made much worldly merit
iti83:17.2	by giving gifts,
iti83:17.3	establish other colleagues
iti83:17.4	in the true teaching, the spiritual life.’
iti83:18.1	It is due to such compassion
iti83:18.2	that when the gods know a god
iti83:18.3	is due to pass away, they wish them well:
iti83:18.4	‘Come back, god, again and again!’
iti83:19.1	This too was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.

iti84:0.4	For the Welfare of the People
iti84:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti84:2.1	“Three people, mendicants, arise in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. 
iti84:2.2	What three? 
iti84:2.3	It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. 
iti84:2.4	He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
iti84:2.5	This is the first person who arises in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.
iti84:3.1	Furthermore, it’s when a mendicant is a perfected one, with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment.
iti84:3.2	They teach Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
iti84:3.3	This is the second person who arises in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.
iti84:4.1	Furthermore, it’s when a disciple of that Teacher is a trainee, a learned practitioner with precepts and observances intact.
iti84:4.2	They teach Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
iti84:4.3	This is the third person who arises in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.
iti84:4.4	These are the three people who arise in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.”
iti84:4.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti84:4.6	On this it is said: 
iti84:5.1	“The Teacher is the first, the great hermit,
iti84:5.2	following whom is the disciple of developed self,
iti84:5.3	and then a trainee, a practitioner,
iti84:5.4	learned, with precepts and observances intact.
iti84:6.1	These three are first among gods and humans,
iti84:6.2	beacons proclaiming the teaching!
iti84:6.3	They fling open the door to the deathless,
iti84:6.4	freeing many from bondage.
iti84:7.1	Following the path so well taught
iti84:7.2	by the unsurpassed caravan leader,
iti84:7.3	those who are diligent in the Holy One’s teaching
iti84:7.4	make an end of suffering in this very life.”

iti85:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti85:2.1	“Mendicants, meditate observing the ugliness of the body.
iti85:2.2	Let mindfulness of breathing be well-established right there inside you.
iti85:2.3	Meditate observing the impermanence of all conditions.
iti85:2.4	As you meditate observing the ugliness of the body, you will give up desire for the body. 
iti85:2.5	When mindfulness of breathing is well-established right there inside you, there will be no distressing external thoughts or wishes.
iti85:2.6	When you meditate observing the impermanence of all conditions, ignorance is given up and knowledge arises.”
iti85:2.7	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti85:2.8	On this it is said: 
iti85:3.1	“Observing the ugliness of the body,
iti85:3.2	mindful of the breath,
iti85:3.3	one always keen sees
iti85:3.4	the stilling of all activities.
iti85:4.1	That mendicant sees rightly, 
iti85:4.2	and when freed in regards to that,
iti85:4.3	that peaceful sage, with perfect insight,
iti85:4.4	has truly escaped their bonds.”

iti86:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti86:2.1	“Regarding a mendicant practicing in line with the teaching, it is in line with the teaching to declare that
iti86:2.2	this is what it means to practice in line with the teaching. When speaking, they speak in line with the teaching, not against it. When thinking, they think in line with the teaching, not against it. And rejecting both, they meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware.”
iti86:2.3	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti86:2.4	On this it is said: 
iti86:3.1	“Delighting in the teaching, enjoying the teaching,
iti86:3.2	contemplating the teaching,
iti86:3.3	a mendicant who recollects the teaching
iti86:3.4	doesn’t decline in the true teaching.
iti86:4.1	Whether walking or standing, 
iti86:4.2	sitting or lying down, 
iti86:4.3	with mind collected inside,
iti86:4.4	they attain only peace.”

iti87:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti87:2.1	“Mendicants, these three unskillful thoughts are destroyers of sight, vision, and knowledge. They block wisdom, they’re on the side of anguish, and they don’t lead to extinguishment. 
iti87:2.2	What three? 
iti87:2.3	Thoughts of sensuality,
iti87:2.4	malice,
iti87:2.5	and cruelty.
iti87:2.6	These are the three unskillful thoughts that are destroyers of sight, vision, and knowledge. They block wisdom, they’re on the side of anguish, and they don’t lead to extinguishment. 
iti87:3.1	These three skillful thoughts are creators of sight, vision, and knowledge. They grow wisdom, they’re on the side of solace, and they lead to extinguishment.
iti87:3.2	What three? 
iti87:3.3	Thoughts of renunciation, 
iti87:3.4	good will, 
iti87:3.5	and harmlessness.
iti87:3.6	These are the three skillful thoughts that are creators of sight, vision, and knowledge. They grow wisdom, they’re on the side of solace, and they lead to extinguishment.”
iti87:3.7	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti87:3.8	On this it is said: 
iti87:4.1	“Think the three skillful thoughts,
iti87:4.2	and get rid of the unskillful.
iti87:4.3	Quelling such thoughts and considerations,
iti87:4.4	like rain on the dust,
iti87:4.5	with a heart calmed of thought,
iti87:4.6	you’ll touch the state of peace right here.”

iti88:2.2	What three? 
iti88:2.3	Greed,
iti88:2.4	hate,
iti88:2.5	and delusion.
iti88:2.6	These three are inner stains, inner foes, inner enemies, inner killers, and inner adversaries.”
iti88:2.7	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti88:2.8	On this it is said: 
iti88:3.1	“Greed creates harm; 
iti88:3.2	greed upsets the mind. 
iti88:3.3	That person doesn’t recognize 
iti88:3.4	the danger that arises within. 
iti88:4.1	A greedy person doesn’t know the good. 
iti88:4.2	A greedy person doesn’t see the truth.

iti89:0.4	About Devadatta 
iti89:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.
iti89:2.1	“Mendicants, overcome and overwhelmed by three things that oppose the true teaching, Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable. 
iti89:2.2	What three? 
iti89:2.3	Wicked desires …
iti89:2.4	Bad friendship …
iti89:2.5	When there is still more to be done, stopping half-way after achieving some insignificant distinction.
iti89:2.6	Overcome and overwhelmed by these three things that oppose the true teaching, Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable.”
iti89:2.7	That is what the Buddha said. 
iti89:2.8	On this it is said: 
iti89:3.1	“Surely, none of wicked desire
iti89:3.2	are reborn into this world.
iti89:3.3	And by this too you should know
iti89:3.4	the place where those of wicked desires go.
iti89:4.1	He once was considered astute, 
iti89:4.2	regarded as evolved,
iti89:4.3	his glory stood forth like a flame,
iti89:4.4	the renowned Devadatta.
iti89:5.1	Seduced by heedlessness,
iti89:5.2	he attacked the Realized One. 
iti89:5.3	He has fallen to Avīci hell,
iti89:5.4	four-doored and terrifying.
iti89:6.1	When someone betrays the innocent,
iti89:6.2	who have done no wrong,
iti89:6.3	their bad deeds impact the one
iti89:6.4	with corrupt heart, lacking regard for others.
iti89:7.1	You might think to pollute
iti89:7.2	the ocean with a pot of poison,
iti89:7.3	but it wouldn’t work,
iti89:7.4	for the sea is terribly large.
iti89:8.1	So too when someone attacks
iti89:8.2	with words the Realized One—
iti89:8.3	consummate, of peaceful mind—
iti89:8.4	the words don’t take.
iti89:9.1	The astute would befriend one like this,
iti89:9.2	and follow them around.
iti89:9.3	A mendicant who walks the path
iti89:9.4	attains the ending of suffering.”

kp7:0.2	Outside the Walls
kp7:1.1	Outside the walls they stand and wait,
kp7:1.2	at the junctions and the crossroads.
kp7:1.3	Returning to their former homes
kp7:1.4	they wait beside the door posts.
kp7:2.1	But when lavish food and drink
kp7:2.2	of many kinds is set out,
kp7:2.3	no-one remembers them at all,
kp7:2.4	because of those beings’s deeds.
kp7:3.1	That’s why those who have compassion
kp7:3.2	give to their relatives
kp7:3.3	food and drink at the right time,
kp7:3.4	that’s clean, delicious, and suitable.
kp7:4.1	“May this be for our relatives!
kp7:4.2	May our relatives be happy!”
kp7:4.3	Those ghosts who have gathered there,
kp7:4.4	the departed relatives who have come
kp7:5.1	for the lavish food and drink
kp7:5.2	gratefully express appreciation:
kp7:5.3	“May our relatives live long!
kp7:5.4	For those to whom we owe this gain,
kp7:6.1	who have given honor to us,
kp7:6.2	it will not be fruitless for the donor.”
kp7:6.3	There is no farming there,
kp7:6.4	no cow pasture can be found;
kp7:7.1	likewise there’s no trading,
kp7:7.2	and no commerce in gold.
kp7:7.3	The departed, the dead in that place
kp7:7.4	live on what is given here.
kp7:8.1	Just as water that rains on high
kp7:8.2	flows down to the plains,

kp7:8.4	aids the departed ghosts.
kp7:9.1	Just as the rivers full
kp7:9.2	swell the ocean seas
kp7:9.3	so too what is given here
kp7:9.4	aids the departed ghosts.

kp7:10.3	give offerings to departed kin,
kp7:10.4	remembering past deeds. 
kp7:11.1	For neither tears nor grief
kp7:11.2	or other lamentations
kp7:11.3	are of any use to the departed,
kp7:11.4	so long as their relatives stay like this.
kp7:12.1	This offering that has been given,
kp7:12.2	well placed in the Saṅgha,
kp7:12.3	is for their lasting welfare,
kp7:12.4	and aids them right away.
kp7:13.1	The relative’s duty has now been shown:

kp8:0.1	Basic Passages
kp8:0.2	A Hidden Treasure
kp8:1.1	A person stores away their savings
kp8:1.2	in a deep pit by the water’s edge:
kp8:1.3	“When need arises
kp8:1.4	it will be there to help 
kp8:2.1	free me from rulers if I am slandered,
kp8:2.2	or from bandits if harassed,
kp8:2.3	or to release me from debt,
kp8:2.4	or in case of famine or losses.”
kp8:2.5	What the world calls savings
kp8:2.6	get stored away for such reasons.
kp8:3.1	But no matter how well stored away they are
kp8:3.2	in a deep pit by the water’s edge,
kp8:3.3	all their savings will fail
kp8:3.4	to aid them all the time.
kp8:4.1	For perhaps those savings are removed from there,
kp8:4.2	or they forget what marks the site,
kp8:4.3	or dragons make off with them,
kp8:4.4	or spirits carry them away,
kp8:5.1	or unloved heirs
kp8:5.2	secretly unearth them.
kp8:5.3	When their merit is used up,
kp8:5.4	all of that will vanish.
kp8:6.1	But by giving and morality,
kp8:6.2	restraint and self-control,
kp8:6.3	a women or man
kp8:6.4	keeps their savings safe.
kp8:7.1	At a shrine or with the Saṅgha,
kp8:7.3	with mother or father,
kp8:7.4	or else an elder sibling,
kp8:8.1	those savings are kept safe,
kp8:8.2	they stay with you, undecaying.
kp8:8.3	We must go on leaving all behind,
kp8:8.4	only this you take when you go.
kp8:9.1	You don’t have to divide it with others,
kp8:9.2	no thief makes off with your savings.
kp8:9.3	A wise person would make merit,
kp8:9.4	the savings that stay with you.
kp8:10.1	Such savings grant every desire
kp8:10.2	of gods and humans too.
kp8:10.3	Whatever it is that they wish for
kp8:10.4	through this they have it all.
kp8:11.1	Good looks, a sweet voice,
kp8:11.2	a good shape, and good appearance,
kp8:11.3	leadership and followers:
kp8:11.4	through this they have it all.
kp8:12.1	Sovereignty of a local kingdom,
kp8:12.2	the happiness of a Wheel-Turning Monarch,
kp8:12.3	even divine kingship in the heavens:
kp8:12.4	through this they have it all.
kp8:13.1	Human success,
kp8:13.2	heavenly delight,
kp8:13.3	attaining extinguishment:
kp8:13.4	through this they have it all.
kp8:14.1	Relying on having good friends,
kp8:14.2	proper application of effort,
kp8:14.3	mastery of knowledge and freedom:
kp8:14.4	through this they have it all.
kp8:15.1	Analytical knowledge, the liberations,
kp8:15.2	the perfections of the disciple,
kp8:15.3	the plane of a Buddha awakened for themselves:
kp8:15.4	through this they have it all.
kp8:16.1	This accomplishment in merit
kp8:16.2	is so very beneficial.
kp8:16.3	That’s why the wise and the astute
kp8:16.4	praise the making of merit.

kp9:5.4	May all beings be happy!
kp9:6.1	Let none turn from another,
kp9:6.2	nor look down on anyone anywhere.
kp9:6.3	Though provoked or aggrieved,
kp9:6.4	let them not wish pain on each other.
kp9:7.1	Even as a mother would protect with her life
kp9:7.2	her child, her only child,
kp9:7.3	so too for all creatures
kp9:7.4	unfold a boundless heart.
kp9:8.1	With love for the whole world,
kp9:8.2	unfold a boundless heart.
kp9:8.3	Above, below, all round, 
kp9:8.4	unconstricted, without enemy or foe.
kp9:9.1	When standing, walking, sitting,
kp9:9.2	or lying down while yet unweary,
kp9:9.3	keep this ever in mind;
kp9:9.4	for this, they say, is a holy abiding in this life.
kp9:10.1	Avoiding harmful views,
kp9:10.2	virtuous, accomplished in insight,
kp9:10.3	with sensual desire dispelled,
kp9:10.4	they never come back to a womb again.

thag10.1:1.1	“The trees are now crimson, venerable sir,
thag10.1:1.2	they’ve shed their foliage, and are ready to fruit.
thag10.1:1.3	They’re splendid, as if aflame;
thag10.1:1.4	great hero, this season is full of flavor.
thag10.1:2.1	The blossoming trees are delightful,
thag10.1:2.2	wafting their scent all around, in all directions.
thag10.1:2.3	They’ve shed their leaves and wish to fruit,
thag10.1:2.4	hero, it is time to depart from here.
thag10.1:3.1	It is neither too hot nor too cold,
thag10.1:3.2	venerable sir, it’s a pleasant season for traveling.
thag10.1:3.3	Let the Sākiyas and Koḷiyas see you,
thag10.1:3.4	heading west across the Rohiṇī river.
thag10.1:4.1	In hope, the field is plowed;
thag10.1:4.2	the seed is sown in hope;
thag10.1:4.3	in hope, merchants travel the seas,
thag10.1:4.4	carrying rich cargoes.
thag10.1:4.5	The hope that I stand for:
thag10.1:4.6	may it succeed!
thag10.1:5.1	Again and again, they sow the seed;
thag10.1:5.2	again and again, the lord god sends rain;
thag10.1:5.3	again and again, farmers plow the field;
thag10.1:5.4	again and again, grain is produced for the nation.
thag10.1:6.1	Again and again, the beggars wander,
thag10.1:6.2	again and again, the donors give.
thag10.1:6.3	Again and again, when the donors have given,
thag10.1:6.4	again and again, they take their place in heaven.
thag10.1:7.1	A hero of vast wisdom purifies seven generations
thag10.1:7.2	of the family in which they’re born.
thag10.1:7.3	Sakya, I believe you’re the king of kings,
thag10.1:7.4	since you fathered the one who is truly called a sage.
thag10.1:8.1	The father of the great hermit is named Suddhodana;
thag10.1:8.2	and the Buddha’s mother is named Māyā.
thag10.1:8.3	Having borne the Bodhisatta in her belly,
thag10.1:8.4	she rejoices in the heaven of the Thirty-Three.
thag10.1:9.1	When she died and passed away from here,

thag10.2:0.4	Ekavihāriya
thag10.2:1.1	If no-one else is found
thag10.2:1.2	in front or behind,
thag10.2:1.3	it’s extremely pleasant
thag10.2:1.4	to be dwelling alone in a forest grove.
thag10.2:2.1	Come now, I’ll go alone
thag10.2:2.2	to the wilderness praised by the Buddha.
thag10.2:2.3	It’s pleasant for a mendicant
thag10.2:2.4	to be dwelling alone and resolute.
thag10.2:3.1	Alone and self-disciplined,
thag10.2:3.2	I’ll quickly enter the delightful forest,
thag10.2:3.3	which gives joy to meditators,
thag10.2:3.4	and is frequented by rutting elephants.
thag10.2:4.1	In Sītavana, so full of flowers,
thag10.2:4.2	in a cool mountain cave,
thag10.2:4.3	I’ll bathe my limbs
thag10.2:4.4	and walk mindfully alone.
thag10.2:5.1	When will I dwell alone,
thag10.2:5.2	without a companion,
thag10.2:5.3	in the great wood, so delightful,
thag10.2:5.4	my task complete, free of defilements?
thag10.2:6.1	This is what I want to do:
thag10.2:6.2	may my wish succeed!
thag10.2:6.3	I’ll make it happen myself,
thag10.2:6.4	for no-one can do another’s duty.
thag10.2:7.1	Fastening my armor,
thag10.2:7.2	I’ll enter the forest.
thag10.2:7.3	I won’t leave
thag10.2:7.4	without attaining the end of defilements.
thag10.2:8.1	As the cool breeze blows
thag10.2:8.2	with fragrant scent,
thag10.2:8.3	I’ll split ignorance apart,
thag10.2:8.4	sitting on the mountain-peak.
thag10.2:9.1	In a forest grove covered with blossoms,
thag10.2:9.2	in a cave so very cool,
thag10.2:9.3	I take pleasure in the Mountainfold,
thag10.2:9.4	happy with the happiness of freedom.
thag10.2:10.1	I’ve got all I wished for
thag10.2:10.2	like the moon on the fifteenth day.
thag10.2:10.3	With the utter ending of all defilements,

thag10.3:0.4	Mahākappina
thag10.3:1.1	If you’re prepared for the future,
thag10.3:1.2	both the good and the bad,
thag10.3:1.3	then those who look for your weakness,
thag10.3:1.4	whether enemies or well-wishers, will find none.
thag10.3:2.1	One who has fulfilled, developed,
thag10.3:2.2	and gradually consolidated
thag10.3:2.3	mindfulness of breathing
thag10.3:2.4	as it was taught by the Buddha:
thag10.3:2.5	they light up the world,
thag10.3:2.6	like the moon freed from a cloud.
thag10.3:3.1	Yes, my mind is clean,
thag10.3:3.2	limitless and well-developed;
thag10.3:3.3	it has broken through and been uplifted—
thag10.3:3.4	it radiates in every direction.
thag10.3:4.1	A wise person lives on
thag10.3:4.2	even after loss of wealth;
thag10.3:4.3	but without gaining wisdom,
thag10.3:4.4	even a rich person doesn’t really live.
thag10.3:5.1	Wisdom questions what is learned;
thag10.3:5.2	wisdom grows fame and reputation;
thag10.3:5.3	a person who has wisdom
thag10.3:5.4	finds happiness even among sufferings.
thag10.3:6.1	It’s not a teaching just for today;
thag10.3:6.2	it isn’t incredible or amazing.
thag10.3:6.3	When you’re born, you die—
thag10.3:6.4	what’s amazing about that?
thag10.3:7.1	For anyone who is born,
thag10.3:7.2	death always follows after life.
thag10.3:7.3	Everyone who is born here dies here;
thag10.3:7.4	such is the nature of living creatures.
thag10.3:8.1	The things that are useful for the living
thag10.3:8.2	are of no use for the dead—not fame, not celebrity,
thag10.3:8.3	not praise by ascetics and brahmins.
thag10.3:8.4	For the dead, there is only weeping.
thag10.3:9.1	And weeping impairs the eye and the body;
thag10.3:9.2	complexion, health, and intelligence decline.
thag10.3:9.3	Your enemies rejoice;
thag10.3:9.4	but your well-wishers are not happy.
thag10.3:10.1	So you should wish that those who stay in your family
thag10.3:10.2	have intelligence and learning,
thag10.3:10.3	and do their duty through the power of wisdom,
thag10.3:10.4	just as you’d cross a full river by boat.

thag10.4:0.3	Chapter One
thag10.4:0.4	Cūḷapanthaka
thag10.4:1.1	My progress was slow,
thag10.4:1.2	I was despised in the past.
thag10.4:1.3	Even my brother turned me away,
thag10.4:1.4	saying, “Go home now.”
thag10.4:2.1	Turned away at the gate
thag10.4:2.2	of the Saṅgha’s monastery,
thag10.4:2.3	I stood there sadly,
thag10.4:2.4	longing for the dispensation.
thag10.4:3.1	Then the Buddha came
thag10.4:3.2	and touched my head.
thag10.4:3.3	Taking me by the arm,
thag10.4:3.4	he brought me into the Saṅgha’s monastery.
thag10.4:4.1	The Teacher, out of compassion,
thag10.4:4.2	gave me a foot-wiping cloth, saying:
thag10.4:4.3	“Focus your awareness
thag10.4:4.4	exclusively on this clean cloth.”
thag10.4:5.1	After hearing his words,
thag10.4:5.2	I happily did his bidding.
thag10.4:5.3	I practiced meditative immersion
thag10.4:5.4	for the attainment of the highest goal.
thag10.4:6.1	I know my past lives,
thag10.4:6.2	my clairvoyance is clarified;
thag10.4:6.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges,
thag10.4:6.4	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thag10.4:7.1	I, Panthaka, created a thousand
thag10.4:7.2	images of myself,
thag10.4:7.3	and sat in the delightful mango grove
thag10.4:7.4	until the time for the meal offering was announced.
thag10.4:8.1	Then the teacher sent to me
thag10.4:8.2	a messenger to announce the time.
thag10.4:8.3	When the time was announced,
thag10.4:8.4	I flew to him through the air.
thag10.4:9.1	I paid homage at the teacher’s feet,
thag10.4:9.2	and sat to one side.
thag10.4:9.3	When he knew I was seated,
thag10.4:9.4	the teacher received the offering.
thag10.4:10.1	Recipient of gifts from the whole world,
thag10.4:10.2	receiver of sacrifices,
thag10.4:10.3	field of merit for humanity,
thag10.4:10.4	he received the religious donation.

thag10.5:1.1	Filled with different kinds of dirt,
thag10.5:1.2	a great producer of dung,
thag10.5:1.3	like a stagnant cesspool,
thag10.5:1.4	a huge boil, a bad wound,
thag10.5:2.1	full of pus and blood,
thag10.5:2.2	sunk in a toilet-pit,
thag10.5:2.3	trickling with fluids,
thag10.5:2.4	this rotting body always oozes.
thag10.5:3.1	Bound by sixty tendons,
thag10.5:3.2	coated with a fleshy coating,
thag10.5:3.3	clothed in a jacket of skin,
thag10.5:3.4	this rotting body is worthless.
thag10.5:4.1	Held together by a skeleton of bones,
thag10.5:4.2	and bound by sinews;
thag10.5:4.3	it assumes postures
thag10.5:4.4	due to a complex of many things.
thag10.5:5.1	We set out in the certainty of death,
thag10.5:5.2	in the presence of the King of Death;
thag10.5:5.3	and having discarded the body right here,
thag10.5:5.4	a person goes where he likes.
thag10.5:6.1	Shrouded by ignorance,
thag10.5:6.2	tied by the four ties,
thag10.5:6.3	this body is sinking in the flood,
thag10.5:6.4	caught in the net of the underlying tendencies.
thag10.5:7.1	Yoked to the five hindrances,
thag10.5:7.2	afflicted by thought,
thag10.5:7.3	stuck to the root of craving,
thag10.5:7.4	hidden by delusion:
thag10.5:8.1	that is how the body goes on,
thag10.5:8.2	propelled by the mechanism of deeds.
thag10.5:8.3	But existence ends in perishing;
thag10.5:8.4	separated, the body perishes.
thag10.5:9.1	Those blind, ordinary people
thag10.5:9.2	who think of this body as theirs,
thag10.5:9.3	swell the horrors of the charnel ground,
thag10.5:9.4	taking hold of future lives.
thag10.5:10.1	Those who shun this body,
thag10.5:10.2	like a snake smeared with dung,
thag10.5:10.3	expel the root of rebirth,
thag10.5:10.4	and realize quenching free of defilements.

thag10.6:0.3	Chapter One
thag10.6:0.4	Upasena, Vaṅganta’s Son
thag10.6:1.1	In order to go on retreat,
thag10.6:1.2	a monk should stay in lodgings
thag10.6:1.3	that are secluded and quiet,
thag10.6:1.4	frequented by beasts of prey.
thag10.6:2.1	Having gathered scraps from rubbish heaps,
thag10.6:2.2	cemeteries and streets,
thag10.6:2.3	and making an outer robe from them,
thag10.6:2.4	one should wear that coarse robe.
thag10.6:3.1	Humbling their heart,
thag10.6:3.2	a mendicant should walk for alms
thag10.6:3.3	from family to family indiscriminately,
thag10.6:3.4	with sense doors guarded, well-restrained.
thag10.6:4.1	They should be content even with coarse food,
thag10.6:4.2	not hoping for lots of flavors.
thag10.6:4.3	The mind that’s greedy for flavors
thag10.6:4.4	doesn’t enjoy absorption.
thag10.6:5.1	With few wishes, content,
thag10.6:5.2	a sage should live secluded,
thag10.6:5.3	socializing with neither
thag10.6:5.4	householders nor the homeless.
thag10.6:6.1	He should present himself
thag10.6:6.2	as if stupid or dumb;
thag10.6:6.3	an astute person would not speak overly long
thag10.6:6.4	in the midst of the Saṅgha.
thag10.6:7.1	He would not insult anyone,
thag10.6:7.2	and would avoid causing damage.
thag10.6:7.3	Restrained in the monastic code,
thag10.6:7.4	they would eat in moderation.
thag10.6:8.1	Expert in the arising of thought,
thag10.6:8.2	they would grasp well the pattern of the mind.
thag10.6:8.3	They would be devoted to practicing
thag10.6:8.4	serenity and discernment at the right time.
thag10.6:9.1	Though endowed with energy and perseverance,
thag10.6:9.2	and always devoted to meditation,
thag10.6:9.3	a wise person would not be too sure of themselves,
thag10.6:9.4	until they have attained the end of suffering.
thag10.6:10.1	For a mendicant who meditates in this way,
thag10.6:10.2	longing for purification,
thag10.6:10.3	all their defilements wither away,
thag10.6:10.4	and they realize quenching.

thag10.7:0.3	Chapter One
thag10.7:0.4	Another Gotama
thag10.7:1.1	You should understand your own purpose,
thag10.7:1.2	and consider the dispensation carefully,
thag10.7:1.3	as well as what’s appropriate
thag10.7:1.4	for one who has entered the ascetic life.
thag10.7:2.1	Good friendship in the community,
thag10.7:2.2	undertaking plenty of training,
thag10.7:2.3	eagerness to learn from the teachers—
thag10.7:2.4	this is appropriate for an ascetic.
thag10.7:3.1	Respect for the Buddha,
thag10.7:3.2	reverence for the Dhamma as it really is,
thag10.7:3.3	esteem for the Saṅgha—
thag10.7:3.4	this is appropriate for an ascetic.
thag10.7:4.1	Commitment to good conduct and alms-resort,
thag10.7:4.2	a livelihood that is pure and blameless,
thag10.7:4.3	and stilling the mind—
thag10.7:4.4	this is appropriate for an ascetic.
thag10.7:5.1	An impressive deportment in things that should be done,
thag10.7:5.2	and in those better avoided;
thag10.7:5.3	commitment to the higher mind—
thag10.7:5.4	this is appropriate for an ascetic.
thag10.7:6.1	Wilderness lodgings,
thag10.7:6.2	remote and quiet,
thag10.7:6.3	fit for use by a sage—
thag10.7:6.4	this is appropriate for an ascetic.
thag10.7:7.1	Ethics, learning,
thag10.7:7.2	investigation of teachings in line with reality,
thag10.7:7.3	and penetration of the truths—
thag10.7:7.4	this is appropriate for an ascetic.
thag10.7:8.1	Developing the perceptions
thag10.7:8.2	of impermanence, non-self, and unattractiveness,
thag10.7:8.3	and displeasure with the whole world—
thag10.7:8.4	this is appropriate for an ascetic.
thag10.7:9.1	Developing the awakening factors,
thag10.7:9.2	the bases for psychic power, the faculties and powers,
thag10.7:9.3	and the noble eightfold path—
thag10.7:9.4	this is appropriate for an ascetic.
thag10.7:10.1	A sage should abandon craving,
thag10.7:10.2	defilements shattered, root and all,
thag10.7:10.3	they should live liberated—
thag10.7:10.4	this is appropriate for an ascetic.

thag11.1:2.1	“Just as the wind in Verambhā

thag11.1:7.3	I’m not aware of having any such
thag11.1:7.4	ignoble, malicious intentions.
thag11.1:8.1	I’ve served the teacher
thag11.1:8.2	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thag11.1:8.3	The heavy burden is laid down,

thag11.1:9.1	I’ve attained the goal
thag11.1:9.2	for the sake of which I went forth
thag11.1:9.3	from the lay life to homelessness—
thag11.1:9.4	the ending of all fetters.
thag11.1:10.1	I don’t long for death;
thag11.1:10.2	I don’t long for life;
thag11.1:10.3	I await my time,

thag12.1:3.1	The well-behaved have many friends,
thag12.1:3.2	because of their self-restraint.
thag12.1:3.3	But one lacking ethics, of bad conduct,
thag12.1:3.4	drives away their friends.
thag12.1:4.1	A person whose ethics are bad has
thag12.1:4.2	ill-repute and infamy.
thag12.1:4.3	A person whose conduct is ethical always has
thag12.1:4.4	a good reputation, fame, and praise.
thag12.1:5.1	Ethical conduct is the starting point and foundation;
thag12.1:5.2	the mother at the head
thag12.1:5.3	of all good things:
thag12.1:5.4	that’s why you should purify your ethics.
thag12.1:6.1	Ethics provide a boundary and a restraint,
thag12.1:6.2	an enjoyment for the mind;
thag12.1:6.3	the ford where all the Buddhas cross over:
thag12.1:6.4	that’s why you should purify your ethics.
thag12.1:7.1	Ethics are the matchless power;
thag12.1:7.2	ethics are the ultimate weapon;
thag12.1:7.3	ethics are the best ornament;
thag12.1:7.4	ethics are a marvelous coat of armor.
thag12.1:8.1	Ethics are a mighty bridge;
thag12.1:8.2	ethics are the unsurpassed scent;
thag12.1:8.3	ethics are the best perfume,
thag12.1:8.4	that float from place to place.
thag12.1:9.1	Ethics are the best provision;
thag12.1:9.2	ethics are the unsurpassed supply for a journey;
thag12.1:9.3	ethics are the best vehicle
thag12.1:9.4	that take you from place to place.
thag12.1:10.1	In this life they’re criticized;
thag12.1:10.2	after departing they grieve in a lower realm;
thag12.1:10.3	a fool is unhappy everywhere,
thag12.1:10.4	because they are unsteady in ethics.
thag12.1:11.1	In this life they’re renowned;
thag12.1:11.2	after departing they’re happy in heaven;
thag12.1:11.3	a wise one is happy everywhere,
thag12.1:11.4	because they are steady in ethics.
thag12.1:12.1	Ethical conduct is best in this life,
thag12.1:12.2	but one with wisdom is supreme.
thag12.1:12.3	Someone with both virtue and wisdom
thag12.1:12.4	is victorious among men and gods.
thag12.2:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag12.2:0.2	The Book of the Twelves
thag12.2:0.3	Chapter One
thag12.2:0.4	Sunīta
thag12.2:1.1	I was born in a low-class family.
thag12.2:1.2	We were poor, with little to eat.
thag12.2:1.3	My job was lowly—
thag12.2:1.4	I threw out the old flowers.
thag12.2:2.1	Shunned by people,
thag12.2:2.2	I was disregarded and held in contempt.
thag12.2:2.3	I humbled my heart
thag12.2:2.4	and paid respects to many people.
thag12.2:3.1	Then I saw the Buddha
thag12.2:3.2	at the fore of the mendicant Saṅgha;
thag12.2:3.3	the great hero
thag12.2:3.4	was entering the capital city of Magadhā.
thag12.2:4.1	I dropped my flail
thag12.2:4.2	and approached to pay homage.
thag12.2:4.3	Out of compassion for me,
thag12.2:4.4	the supreme man stood still.
thag12.2:5.1	When I had paid homage at the Teacher’s feet,
thag12.2:5.2	I stood to one side
thag12.2:5.3	and asked the supreme being
thag12.2:5.4	for the going-forth.
thag12.2:6.1	Then the Teacher, being sympathetic,
thag12.2:6.2	and having compassion for the whole world,
thag12.2:6.3	said to me, “Come, monk!”
thag12.2:6.4	That was my ordination.
thag12.2:7.1	Staying alone in the wilderness,
thag12.2:7.2	meditating tirelessly,
thag12.2:7.3	I have completed what the Teacher taught,
thag12.2:7.4	just as the victor advised me.
thag12.2:8.1	In the first watch of the night,
thag12.2:8.2	I recollected my past lives.
thag12.2:8.3	In the middle watch of the night,
thag12.2:8.4	I purified my clairvoyance.
thag12.2:8.5	In the last watch of the night,
thag12.2:8.6	I shattered the mass of darkness.
thag12.2:9.1	At the end of the night,
thag12.2:9.2	as the sunrise drew near,
thag12.2:9.3	Indra and Brahmā came
thag12.2:9.4	and revered me with joined hands.
thag12.2:10.1	“Homage to you, O thoroughbred!
thag12.2:10.2	Homage to you, supreme among men!
thag12.2:10.3	Since your defilements are ended,
thag12.2:10.4	you, sir, are worthy of a religious donation.”
thag12.2:11.1	When he saw me honored
thag12.2:11.2	by the assembly of gods,
thag12.2:11.3	the teacher smiled
thag12.2:11.4	and said the following:
thag12.2:12.1	“By austerity and spiritual practice,
thag12.2:12.2	by restraint and by self-control:
thag12.2:12.3	that’s how to become a brahmin,
thag12.2:12.4	this is the supreme brahmin.”

thag13.1:0.2	The Book of the Thirteens
thag13.1:0.3	Chapter One
thag13.1:0.4	Soṇakoḷivisa
thag13.1:1.1	He who was special in the kingdom,
thag13.1:1.2	the footman to the king of Aṅga,
thag13.1:1.3	today is special in the Dhamma—
thag13.1:1.4	Soṇa has gone beyond suffering.
thag13.1:2.1	Five to cut, five to drop,
thag13.1:2.2	and five more to develop.
thag13.1:2.3	A monk who has got over five kinds of clinging
thag13.1:2.4	is called “One who has crossed the flood”.
thag13.1:3.1	If a monk is insolent and negligent,
thag13.1:3.2	concerned only with externals,
thag13.1:3.3	their ethics, immersion, and wisdom
thag13.1:3.4	do not become fulfilled.
thag13.1:4.1	They disregard what should be done,
thag13.1:4.2	and do what should not be done.
thag13.1:4.3	For the insolent and the negligent,
thag13.1:4.4	their defilements only grow.
thag13.1:5.1	Those that have properly undertaken
thag13.1:5.2	constant mindfulness of the body,
thag13.1:5.3	don’t cultivate what should not be done,
thag13.1:5.4	but always do what should be done.
thag13.1:5.5	Mindful and aware,
thag13.1:5.6	their defilements come to an end.
thag13.1:6.1	The straight path has been explained—
thag13.1:6.2	go on it and don’t turn back.
thag13.1:6.3	Urge yourself on
thag13.1:6.4	and take yourself to quenching.
thag13.1:7.1	When my energy was over-exerted,
thag13.1:7.2	the supreme Teacher in the world
thag13.1:7.3	created the simile of the lute for me.
thag13.1:7.4	The Seer taught the Dhamma,
thag13.1:7.5	and when I heard what he said,
thag13.1:7.6	I happily did his bidding.
thag13.1:8.1	Practicing serenity of mind
thag13.1:8.2	for the attainment of the highest goal.
thag13.1:8.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges
thag13.1:8.4	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thag13.1:9.1	When you’re dedicated to renunciation
thag13.1:9.2	and seclusion of the heart;
thag13.1:9.3	when you’re dedicated to kindness
thag13.1:9.4	and the end of grasping;
thag13.1:10.1	when you’re dedicated to the ending of craving
thag13.1:10.2	and clarity of heart;
thag13.1:10.3	and you’ve seen the arising of the senses,
thag13.1:10.4	your mind is rightly freed.
thag13.1:11.1	For that one, rightly freed,
thag13.1:11.2	a mendicant with peaceful mind,
thag13.1:11.3	there’s nothing to be improved,
thag13.1:11.4	and nothing more to do.
thag13.1:12.1	As the wind cannot stir
thag13.1:12.2	a solid mass of rock,
thag13.1:12.3	so too sights, tastes, sounds,
thag13.1:12.4	smells, and touches—the lot—
thag13.1:13.1	and thoughts, whether liked or disliked,
thag13.1:13.2	don’t disturb the poised one.
thag13.1:13.3	Their mind is steady and unfettered
thag13.1:13.4	as they observe disappearance.

thag14.1:0.2	The Book of the Fourteens
thag14.1:0.3	Chapter One
thag14.1:0.4	Khadiravaniyarevata
thag14.1:1.1	Since I’ve gone forth
thag14.1:1.2	from the lay life to homelessness,
thag14.1:1.3	I’m not aware of any intention
thag14.1:1.4	that is ignoble and hateful.
thag14.1:2.1	“May these beings be killed!
thag14.1:2.2	May they be slaughtered! May they suffer!”—
thag14.1:2.3	I’m not aware of having any such intentions
thag14.1:2.4	in all this long while.
thag14.1:3.1	I have been aware of loving-kindness,
thag14.1:3.2	limitless and well-developed;
thag14.1:3.3	gradually consolidated
thag14.1:3.4	as it was taught by the Buddha.
thag14.1:4.1	I’m friend and comrade to all,
thag14.1:4.2	compassionate for all beings!
thag14.1:4.3	I develop a mind of love,
thag14.1:4.4	always delighting in harmlessness.
thag14.1:5.1	Unfaltering, unshakable,
thag14.1:5.2	I gladden the mind.
thag14.1:5.3	I develop the divine meditation,
thag14.1:5.4	which sinners do not cultivate.
thag14.1:6.1	Having entered a meditation state without thought,
thag14.1:6.2	a disciple of the Buddha
thag14.1:6.3	is at that moment blessed
thag14.1:6.4	with noble silence.
thag14.1:7.1	As a rocky mountain
thag14.1:7.2	is unwavering and well grounded,
thag14.1:7.3	so when delusion ends,
thag14.1:7.4	a monk, like a mountain, doesn’t tremble.
thag14.1:8.1	To the man who has not a blemish
thag14.1:8.2	who is always seeking purity,
thag14.1:8.3	even a hair-tip of evil
thag14.1:8.4	seems as big as a cloud.
thag14.1:9.1	As a frontier city
thag14.1:9.2	is guarded inside and out,
thag14.1:9.3	so you should ward yourselves—
thag14.1:9.4	don’t let the moment pass you by.
thag14.1:10.1	I don’t long for death;
thag14.1:10.2	I don’t long for life;
thag14.1:10.3	I await my time,
thag14.1:10.4	like a worker waiting for their wages.
thag14.1:11.1	I don’t long for death;
thag14.1:11.2	I don’t long for life;
thag14.1:11.3	I await my time,
thag14.1:11.4	aware and mindful.
thag14.1:12.1	I’ve served the teacher
thag14.1:12.2	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thag14.1:12.3	The heavy burden is laid down,
thag14.1:12.4	the attachment to rebirth is eradicated.
thag14.1:13.1	I’ve attained the goal
thag14.1:13.2	for the sake of which I went forth
thag14.1:13.3	from the lay life to homelessness—
thag14.1:13.4	the ending of all fetters.
thag14.1:14.1	Persist with diligence:
thag14.1:14.2	this is my instruction.
thag14.1:14.3	Come, I’ll realize quenching—
thag14.1:14.4	I’m liberated in every way.

thag14.2:0.2	The Book of the Fourteens
thag14.2:0.3	Chapter One
thag14.2:0.4	Godatta
thag14.2:1.1	Just as a fine thoroughbred,
thag14.2:1.2	yoked to a carriage, endures the load.
thag14.2:1.3	Though oppressed by the heavy burden,
thag14.2:1.4	it doesn’t shake off the yoke.
thag14.2:2.1	So too, those who are as full of wisdom
thag14.2:2.2	as the ocean is with water,
thag14.2:2.3	don’t look down on others;
thag14.2:2.4	this is the teaching of the noble ones for living creatures.
thag14.2:3.1	People who fall under the sway of time,
thag14.2:3.2	the sway of rebirth in this or that state,
thag14.2:3.3	undergo suffering,
thag14.2:3.4	and those young men grieve in this life.
thag14.2:4.1	Elated by things that bring happiness,
thag14.2:4.2	downcast by things that bring suffering:
thag14.2:4.3	this pair destroys the fool
thag14.2:4.4	who doesn’t see things as they are.
thag14.2:5.1	But those who in suffering, and in happiness,
thag14.2:5.2	and in the middle have overcome the weaver—
thag14.2:5.3	they stand like a boundary pillar,
thag14.2:5.4	neither elated nor downcast.
thag14.2:6.1	Not to gain nor loss,
thag14.2:6.2	not to fame nor reputation,
thag14.2:6.3	not to criticism nor praise,
thag14.2:6.4	not to suffering nor happiness—
thag14.2:7.1	the wise cling to nothing,
thag14.2:7.2	like a droplet on a lotus-leaf.
thag14.2:7.3	They are happy everywhere,
thag14.2:7.4	and victorious everywhere.
thag14.2:8.1	There’s legitimate loss,
thag14.2:8.2	and there’s illegitimate gain.
thag14.2:8.3	Legitimate loss is better
thag14.2:8.4	than illegitimate gain.
thag14.2:9.1	There’s the fame of the unintelligent,
thag14.2:9.2	and there’s the disrepute of the discerning.
thag14.2:9.3	The disrepute of the discerning is better
thag14.2:9.4	than the fame of the unintelligent.
thag14.2:10.1	There’s praise by fools,
thag14.2:10.2	and there’s criticism by the discerning.
thag14.2:10.3	Criticism by the discerning is better
thag14.2:10.4	than praise by fools.
thag14.2:11.1	There’s the happiness of sensual pleasures,
thag14.2:11.2	and there’s the suffering of seclusion.
thag14.2:11.3	The suffering of seclusion is better
thag14.2:11.4	than the happiness of sensual pleasures.
thag14.2:12.1	There’s life without principles,
thag14.2:12.2	and there’s death with principles.
thag14.2:12.3	Death with principles is better
thag14.2:12.4	than life without principles.
thag14.2:13.1	Those who’ve given up desire and anger,
thag14.2:13.2	their minds at peace regarding rebirth in this or that state,
thag14.2:13.3	wander in the world unattached,
thag14.2:13.4	for them nothing is beloved or unloved.
thag14.2:14.1	Having developed the awakening factors,
thag14.2:14.2	the faculties and the powers,
thag14.2:14.3	having arrived at ultimate peace,
thag14.2:14.4	they are quenched, without defilements.

thag15.1:0.4	Koṇḍañña Who Understood
thag15.1:1.1	“My confidence grew
thag15.1:1.2	as I heard the teaching, so full of flavor.
thag15.1:1.3	Dispassion is what was taught,
thag15.1:1.4	without any grasping at all.”
thag15.1:2.1	“There are so many pretty things
thag15.1:2.2	in this vast territory.
thag15.1:2.3	They disturb one’s thoughts, it seems to me,
thag15.1:2.4	attractive, provoking lust.
thag15.1:3.1	Just as a rain cloud would settle
thag15.1:3.2	the dust blown up by the wind,
thag15.1:3.3	so thoughts settle down
thag15.1:3.4	when seen with wisdom.
thag15.1:4.1	All conditions are impermanent—
thag15.1:4.2	when this is seen with wisdom
thag15.1:4.3	one grows disillusioned with suffering:
thag15.1:4.4	this is the path to purity.
thag15.1:5.1	All conditions are suffering—
thag15.1:5.2	when this is seen with wisdom
thag15.1:5.3	one grows disillusioned with suffering:
thag15.1:5.4	this is the path to purity.
thag15.1:6.1	All things are not-self—
thag15.1:6.2	when this is seen with wisdom
thag15.1:6.3	one grows disillusioned with suffering:
thag15.1:6.4	this is the path to purity.
thag15.1:7.1	The senior monk who was awakened right after the Buddha,
thag15.1:7.2	Koṇḍañña, is keenly energetic.
thag15.1:7.3	He has given up birth and death,
thag15.1:7.4	and has completed the spiritual journey.
thag15.1:8.1	There are floods, snares, and strong posts,
thag15.1:8.2	and a mountain hard to crack;
thag15.1:8.3	snapping the posts and snares,
thag15.1:8.4	breaking the mountain so hard to break,
thag15.1:8.5	crossing over to the far shore,
thag15.1:8.6	one practicing absorption is freed from Māra’s bonds.
thag15.1:9.1	When a mendicant is haughty and fickle,
thag15.1:9.2	relying on bad friends,
thag15.1:9.3	they sink down in the great flood,
thag15.1:9.4	overcome by a wave.
thag15.1:10.1	But one who is steady and stable,
thag15.1:10.2	alert, with senses restrained,
thag15.1:10.3	intelligent, with good friends,
thag15.1:10.4	makes an end of suffering.
thag15.1:11.1	With knobbly knees,
thag15.1:11.2	thin and veiny,
thag15.1:11.3	eating and drinking in moderation—
thag15.1:11.4	this person’s spirit is undaunted.
thag15.1:12.1	Pestered by flies and mosquitoes
thag15.1:12.2	in the wilds, the formidable forest,
thag15.1:12.3	one should mindfully endure,
thag15.1:12.4	like an elephant at the head of the battle.
thag15.1:13.1	I don’t long for death;
thag15.1:13.2	I don’t long for life;
thag15.1:13.3	I await my time,
thag15.1:13.4	like a worker waiting for their wages.
thag15.1:14.1	I don’t long for death;
thag15.1:14.2	I don’t long for life;

thag15.1:15.1	I’ve served the teacher

thag15.2:0.3	Chapter One
thag15.2:0.4	Udāyī
thag15.2:1.1	Awakened as a human being,
thag15.2:1.2	self-tamed and serene,
thag15.2:1.3	following the spiritual path,
thag15.2:1.4	he loves peace of mind.
thag15.2:2.1	Revered by people,
thag15.2:2.2	gone beyond all things,
thag15.2:2.3	even the gods revere him;
thag15.2:2.4	so I’ve heard from the perfected one.
thag15.2:3.1	He has transcended all fetters,
thag15.2:3.2	and escaped from entanglements.
thag15.2:3.3	Delighting to renounce sensual pleasures,
thag15.2:3.4	he’s freed like gold from stone.
thag15.2:4.1	That giant outshines all,
thag15.2:4.2	like the Himalaya beside other mountains.
thag15.2:4.3	Of all those named “giant”,
thag15.2:4.4	he is truly named, supreme.
thag15.2:5.1	I shall extol the giant for you,
thag15.2:5.2	for he does nothing monstrous.
thag15.2:5.3	Gentleness and harmlessness
thag15.2:5.4	are two feet of the giant.
thag15.2:6.1	Mindfulness and awareness
thag15.2:6.2	are his two other feet.
thag15.2:6.3	Faith is the giant’s trunk,
thag15.2:6.4	and equanimity his white tusks.
thag15.2:7.1	Mindfulness is his neck, his head is wisdom—
thag15.2:7.2	investigation and thinking about principles.
thag15.2:7.3	His belly is the sacred hearth of the Dhamma,
thag15.2:7.4	and his tail is seclusion.
thag15.2:8.1	Practicing absorption, enjoying the breath,
thag15.2:8.2	he is serene within.
thag15.2:8.3	The giant is serene when walking,
thag15.2:8.4	the giant is serene when standing,
thag15.2:9.1	the giant is serene when lying down,
thag15.2:9.2	and when sitting, the giant is serene.
thag15.2:9.3	The giant is restrained everywhere:
thag15.2:9.4	this is the accomplishment of the giant.
thag15.2:10.1	He eats blameless things,
thag15.2:10.2	he doesn’t eat blameworthy things.
thag15.2:10.3	When he gets food and clothes,
thag15.2:10.4	he avoids storing them up.
thag15.2:11.1	Having severed all bonds,
thag15.2:11.2	fetters large and small,
thag15.2:11.3	wherever he goes,
thag15.2:11.4	he goes without concern.
thag15.2:12.1	A white lotus,
thag15.2:12.2	fragrant and delightful,
thag15.2:12.3	sprouts in water and grows there,
thag15.2:12.4	but the water doesn’t cling to it.
thag15.2:13.1	Just so the Buddha is born in the world,
thag15.2:13.2	and lives in the world,
thag15.2:13.3	but the world doesn’t stick to him,
thag15.2:13.4	as water does not stick to the lotus.
thag15.2:14.1	A great blazing fire
thag15.2:14.2	dies down when the fuel runs out.
thag15.2:14.3	And when the coals have gone out
thag15.2:14.4	it’s said to be “extinguished”.
thag15.2:15.1	This simile is taught by the discerning
thag15.2:15.2	to express the meaning clearly.
thag15.2:15.3	Great giants will understand
thag15.2:15.4	what the giant taught the giant.
thag15.2:16.1	Free of greed, free of hate,
thag15.2:16.2	free of delusion, undefiled;
thag15.2:16.3	the giant, giving up his body,
thag15.2:16.4	will be quenched without defilements.

thag16.10:0.3	Chapter One
thag16.10:0.4	Pārāpariya (3rd)
thag16.10:1.1	This thought came to the ascetic
thag16.10:1.2	in the forest full of flowers,
thag16.10:1.3	as he was seated alone
thag16.10:1.4	meditating in seclusion:
thag16.10:2.1	“The behavior of the mendicants
thag16.10:2.2	these days seems different
thag16.10:2.3	from when the protector of the world,
thag16.10:2.4	the best of men, was still here.
thag16.10:3.1	Their robes were only for covering the private parts,
thag16.10:3.2	and protection from the cold and wind.
thag16.10:3.3	They ate in moderation,
thag16.10:3.4	content with whatever they were offered.
thag16.10:4.1	Whether food was refined or rough,
thag16.10:4.2	a little or a lot,
thag16.10:4.3	they ate only for sustenance,
thag16.10:4.4	without greed or gluttony.
thag16.10:5.1	They weren’t so very eager
thag16.10:5.2	for the requisites of life,
thag16.10:5.3	such as tonics and other necessities,
thag16.10:5.4	as they were for the ending of defilements.
thag16.10:6.1	In the wilderness, at a tree’s root,
thag16.10:6.2	in caves and caverns,
thag16.10:6.3	fostering seclusion,
thag16.10:6.4	they lived with that as their final goal.
thag16.10:7.1	They were used to simple things, unburdensome,
thag16.10:7.2	gentle, not stubborn at heart,
thag16.10:7.3	unsullied, not scurrilous,
thag16.10:7.4	their thoughts were intent on the goal.
thag16.10:8.1	That’s why they inspired confidence,
thag16.10:8.2	in their movements, eating, and practice;
thag16.10:8.3	their deportment was as smooth
thag16.10:8.4	as a stream of oil.
thag16.10:9.1	With the utter ending of all defilements,
thag16.10:9.2	those senior monks have now been quenched.
thag16.10:9.3	They were great meditators and great benefactors—
thag16.10:9.4	there are few like them today.
thag16.10:10.1	With the ending
thag16.10:10.2	of good principles and understanding,
thag16.10:10.3	the victor’s teaching,
thag16.10:10.4	full of all excellent qualities, has fallen apart.
thag16.10:11.1	This is the season
thag16.10:11.2	for bad principles and defilements.
thag16.10:11.3	Those who are ready for seclusion
thag16.10:11.4	are all that’s left of the true Dhamma.
thag16.10:12.1	As they grow, the defilements
thag16.10:12.2	possess most people;
thag16.10:12.3	they play with fools, it seems to me,
thag16.10:12.4	like monsters with the mad.
thag16.10:13.1	Overcome by defilements,
thag16.10:13.2	they run here and there
thag16.10:13.3	among the bases for defilement,
thag16.10:13.4	as if they had declared war on themselves.
thag16.10:14.1	Having abandoned the true teaching,
thag16.10:14.2	they argue with each other.
thag16.10:14.3	Following wrong views
thag16.10:14.4	they think, ‘This is better.’
thag16.10:15.1	They cut off their wealth,
thag16.10:15.2	children, and wife to go forth.
thag16.10:15.3	But then they do what they shouldn’t,
thag16.10:15.4	for the sake of a measly spoon of almsfood.
thag16.10:16.1	They eat until their bellies are full,
thag16.10:16.2	and then they lie to sleep on their backs.
thag16.10:16.3	When they wake up, they keep on chatting,
thag16.10:16.4	the kind of talk that the teacher criticized.
thag16.10:17.1	Valuing all the arts and crafts,
thag16.10:17.2	they train themselves in them.
thag16.10:17.3	Not being settled inside, they think,
thag16.10:17.4	‘This is the goal of the ascetic life.’
thag16.10:18.1	They provide clay, oil, and talcum powder,
thag16.10:18.2	water, lodgings, and food
thag16.10:18.3	for householders,
thag16.10:18.4	expecting more in return.
thag16.10:19.1	And in addition, tooth-picks, wood-apples,
thag16.10:19.2	flowers, food to eat,
thag16.10:19.3	well-cooked almsfood,
thag16.10:19.4	mangoes and myrobalans.
thag16.10:20.1	In medicine they are like doctors,
thag16.10:20.2	in business like householders,
thag16.10:20.3	in makeup like prostitutes,
thag16.10:20.4	in sovereignty like lords.
thag16.10:21.1	Cheats, frauds,
thag16.10:21.2	false witnesses, sly:
thag16.10:21.3	using multiple plans,
thag16.10:21.4	they enjoy material things.
thag16.10:22.1	Pursuing shams, contrivances, and plans,
thag16.10:22.2	by such means
thag16.10:22.3	they accumulate a lot of wealth
thag16.10:22.4	for the sake of their own livelihood.
thag16.10:23.1	They assemble the community
thag16.10:23.2	for business rather than Dhamma.
thag16.10:23.3	They teach the Dhamma to others
thag16.10:23.4	for gain, not for the goal.
thag16.10:24.1	Those outside the Saṅgha
thag16.10:24.2	quarrel over the Saṅgha’s property.
thag16.10:24.3	They’re shameless, and do not care
thag16.10:24.4	that they live on someone else’s property.
thag16.10:25.1	Some with shaven head and robe
thag16.10:25.2	are not devoted to practice,
thag16.10:25.3	but wish only to be honored,
thag16.10:25.4	besotted with property and reverence.
thag16.10:26.1	When things have come to this,
thag16.10:26.2	it’s not easy these days
thag16.10:26.3	to realize what has not yet been realized,
thag16.10:26.4	or to preserve what has been realized.
thag16.10:27.1	When shoeless on a thorny path,
thag16.10:27.2	one would walk
thag16.10:27.3	very mindfully;
thag16.10:27.4	that’s how a sage should walk in the village.
thag16.10:28.1	Remembering the meditators of old,
thag16.10:28.2	and recollecting their conduct,
thag16.10:28.3	even in the latter days,
thag16.10:28.4	it’s still possible to realize the deathless.”
thag16.10:29.1	That is what the ascetic, whose faculties
thag16.10:29.2	were fully developed, said in the sāl tree grove.
thag16.10:29.3	The brahmin, the hermit, became quenched,
thag16.10:29.4	putting an end to all future lives.
thag16.1:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag16.1:0.2	The Book of the Twenties
thag16.1:0.3	Chapter One
thag16.1:0.4	Adhimutta (2nd)
thag16.1:1.1	“Those who we killed in the past,
thag16.1:1.2	whether for sacrifice or for wealth,
thag16.1:1.3	without exception were afraid;
thag16.1:1.4	they trembled and they squealed.
thag16.1:2.1	But you’re not scared;
thag16.1:2.2	you look even calmer than before.
thag16.1:2.3	Why don’t you cry out
thag16.1:2.4	in such a terrifying situation?”
thag16.1:3.1	“There isn’t any mental suffering
thag16.1:3.2	for one without hope, village chief.
thag16.1:3.3	All fears are left behind
thag16.1:3.4	by one whose fetters have ended.
thag16.1:4.1	When attachment to rebirth is ended,
thag16.1:4.2	and the truth is seen as it is,
thag16.1:4.3	there is no fear of death;
thag16.1:4.4	it’s like laying down a burden.
thag16.1:5.1	I’ve lived the spiritual life well,
thag16.1:5.2	and developed the path well, too.
thag16.1:5.3	I do not fear death;
thag16.1:5.4	it’s like the passing of a disease.
thag16.1:6.1	I’ve lived the spiritual life well,
thag16.1:6.2	and developed the path well, too.
thag16.1:6.3	I’ve seen that there’s nothing gratifying in existences,
thag16.1:6.4	like someone who has tasted poison, then thrown it out.
thag16.1:7.1	One who has gone beyond, without grasping,
thag16.1:7.2	they’ve completed the task and are free of defilements.
thag16.1:7.3	They are content at the end of life,
thag16.1:7.4	like someone released from execution.
thag16.1:8.1	Having realized the supreme Dhamma,
thag16.1:8.2	without needing anything in the whole world,
thag16.1:8.3	one doesn’t grieve at death;
thag16.1:8.4	for it’s like escaping from a burning house.
thag16.1:9.1	Whatever has come to pass,
thag16.1:9.2	wherever life is obtained,
thag16.1:9.3	there is no Lord of all that:
thag16.1:9.4	so said the great hermit.
thag16.1:10.1	Whoever understands this
thag16.1:10.2	as it was taught by the Buddha
thag16.1:10.3	doesn’t grab on to any new life,
thag16.1:10.4	like you wouldn’t grab a hot iron ball.
thag16.1:11.1	It doesn’t occur to me, ‘I existed in the past’;
thag16.1:11.2	nor, ‘I will exist in the future’.
thag16.1:11.3	All conditions will disappear—
thag16.1:11.4	why weep over that?
thag16.1:12.1	Seeing in accordance with reality
thag16.1:12.2	the bare arising of phenomena,
thag16.1:12.3	and the bare process of conditions,
thag16.1:12.4	there is no fear, village chief.
thag16.1:13.1	The world is like grass and sticks:
thag16.1:13.2	when this is seen with wisdom,
thag16.1:13.3	not finding anything to be mine,
thag16.1:13.4	you won’t grieve, thinking ‘I don’t have it’.
thag16.1:14.1	I’m fed up with the body;
thag16.1:14.2	I don’t need another life.
thag16.1:14.3	This body will be broken up,
thag16.1:14.4	and there won’t be another.
thag16.1:15.1	Do what you want
thag16.1:15.2	with my corpse.
thag16.1:15.3	I won’t be angry or attached
thag16.1:15.4	on account of that.”
thag16.1:16.1	When they heard these words,
thag16.1:16.2	so astonishing and hair-raising,
thag16.1:16.3	the young men laid down their swords
thag16.1:16.4	and spoke these words:
thag16.1:17.1	“What have you practiced, Venerable?
thag16.1:17.2	And who is your teacher?
thag16.1:17.3	Whose instructions do we follow
thag16.1:17.4	to gain the sorrowless state?”
thag16.1:18.1	“The knower of all, the seer of all:
thag16.1:18.2	the victor is my teacher.
thag16.1:18.3	He is a Teacher of great compassion,
thag16.1:18.4	healer of the whole world.
thag16.1:19.1	He taught this Dhamma,
thag16.1:19.2	leading to ending, unsurpassed.
thag16.1:19.3	Following his instructions,
thag16.1:19.4	you can gain the sorrowless state.”
thag16.1:20.1	When the bandits heard the good words of the hermit,
thag16.1:20.2	they laid down their swords and weapons.
thag16.1:20.3	Some refrained from their former deeds,
thag16.1:20.4	while others chose the going-forth.
thag16.1:21.1	When they had gone forth in the teaching of the Holy One,
thag16.1:21.2	those astute ones developed the awakening factors and the powers.
thag16.1:21.3	Elated, happy, their faculties complete,
thag16.1:21.4	they realized the state of quenching, the unconditioned.

thag16.2:0.2	The Book of the Twenties
thag16.2:0.3	Chapter One
thag16.2:0.4	Pārāpariya (2nd)
thag16.2:1.1	This thought came to the ascetic,
thag16.2:1.2	the monk Pārāpariya,
thag16.2:1.3	as he was seated alone
thag16.2:1.4	meditating in seclusion:
thag16.2:2.1	“Following what system,
thag16.2:2.2	what observance, what conduct,
thag16.2:2.3	may I do what I need to do for myself,
thag16.2:2.4	without harming anyone else?
thag16.2:3.1	The faculties of human beings
thag16.2:3.2	can lead to both welfare and harm.
thag16.2:3.3	Unguarded they lead to harm;
thag16.2:3.4	guarded they lead to welfare.
thag16.2:4.1	By protecting the faculties,
thag16.2:4.2	taking care of the faculties,
thag16.2:4.3	I can do what I need to do for myself
thag16.2:4.4	without harming anyone else.
thag16.2:5.1	If your eye wanders
thag16.2:5.2	among sights without check,
thag16.2:5.3	not seeing the danger,
thag16.2:5.4	you’re not freed from suffering.
thag16.2:6.1	If your ear wanders
thag16.2:6.2	among sounds without check,
thag16.2:6.3	not seeing the danger,
thag16.2:6.4	you’re not freed from suffering.
thag16.2:7.1	If, not seeing the escape,
thag16.2:7.2	you indulge in a smell,
thag16.2:7.3	you’re not freed from suffering,
thag16.2:7.4	being besotted by smells.
thag16.2:8.1	Recollecting the sour,
thag16.2:8.2	the sweet and the bitter,
thag16.2:8.3	captivated by craving for taste,
thag16.2:8.4	you don’t understand the heart.
thag16.2:9.1	Recollecting lovely
thag16.2:9.2	and pleasurable touches,
thag16.2:9.3	full of desire, you experience
thag16.2:9.4	many kinds of suffering because of lust.
thag16.2:10.1	Unable to protect
thag16.2:10.2	the mind from such thoughts,
thag16.2:10.3	suffering follows them
thag16.2:10.4	because of all five.
thag16.2:11.1	This body is full of pus and blood,
thag16.2:11.2	it’s home to many carcasses;
thag16.2:11.3	but cunning people decorate it
thag16.2:11.4	like a lovely painted casket.
thag16.2:12.1	You don’t understand that
thag16.2:12.2	the sweetness of honey turns bitter,
thag16.2:12.3	and the bonds to those we love cause pain,
thag16.2:12.4	like a razor’s edge smeared with honey.
thag16.2:13.1	Full of lust for the sight of a woman,
thag16.2:13.2	for the voice and the smells of a woman,
thag16.2:13.3	for a woman’s touch,
thag16.2:13.4	you experience many kinds of suffering.
thag16.2:14.1	All of a woman’s streams
thag16.2:14.2	flow from five to five.
thag16.2:14.3	Whoever, being energetic,
thag16.2:14.4	is able to curb these,
thag16.2:15.1	purposeful and firm in principle,
thag16.2:15.2	is clever and clear-seeing.
thag16.2:15.3	Though he might enjoy himself,
thag16.2:15.4	his duty is connected with the teaching and its goal.
thag16.2:16.1	One who’s diligent and discerning,
thag16.2:16.2	thinking, “This ought not be done”,
thag16.2:16.3	would avoid a useless task
thag16.2:16.4	that’s doomed to failure.
thag16.2:17.1	Whatever is meaningful,
thag16.2:17.2	and whatever happiness is principled,
thag16.2:17.3	let one undertake and follow that:
thag16.2:17.4	this is the best happiness.
thag16.2:18.1	They want to get hold of what belongs to others
thag16.2:18.2	by any means, fair or foul.
thag16.2:18.3	They kill, injure, and torment,
thag16.2:18.4	violently plundering what belongs to others.
thag16.2:19.1	Just as a strong person when building
thag16.2:19.2	knocks out a peg with a peg,
thag16.2:19.3	so the skillful person
thag16.2:19.4	knocks out the faculties with the faculties.
thag16.2:20.1	Developing faith, energy, immersion,
thag16.2:20.2	mindfulness, and wisdom;
thag16.2:20.3	destroying the five with the five,
thag16.2:20.4	the brahmin walks on without worry.
thag16.2:21.1	Purposeful and firm in principle,
thag16.2:21.2	having fulfilled in every respect
thag16.2:21.3	the instructions spoken by the Buddha,
thag16.2:21.4	that person prospers in happiness.”
thag16.3:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag16.3:0.2	The Book of the Twenties
thag16.3:0.3	Chapter One
thag16.3:0.4	Telakāni
thag16.3:1.1	For a long time, sadly,
thag16.3:1.2	though I keenly contemplated the teaching,
thag16.3:1.3	I gained no peace of mind.
thag16.3:1.4	So I asked this of ascetics and brahmins:
thag16.3:2.1	“Who has crossed over the world?
thag16.3:2.2	Whose attainment culminates in the deathless?
thag16.3:2.3	Whose teaching do I accept
thag16.3:2.4	to understand the highest goal?
thag16.3:3.1	I was hooked inside,
thag16.3:3.2	like a fish gulping bait;
thag16.3:3.3	bound like the demon Vepaciti
thag16.3:3.4	in Mahinda’s trap.
thag16.3:4.1	Dragging it along, I’m not free
thag16.3:4.2	from grief and lamentation.
thag16.3:4.3	Who will free me from bonds in the world,
thag16.3:4.4	so that I may know awakening?
thag16.3:5.1	What ascetic or brahmin
thag16.3:5.2	points out what is frail?
thag16.3:5.3	Whose teaching do I accept
thag16.3:5.4	to sweep away old age and death?
thag16.3:6.1	Tied up with uncertainty and doubt,
thag16.3:6.2	secured by the power of pride,
thag16.3:6.3	rigid as a mind beset by anger;
thag16.3:6.4	the arrow of covetousness,
thag16.3:7.1	propelled by the bow of craving,
thag16.3:7.2	is stuck in my twice-fifteen ribs—
thag16.3:7.3	see how it stands in my breast,
thag16.3:7.4	breaking my strong heart.
thag16.3:8.1	Speculative views are not abandoned,
thag16.3:8.2	they are sharpened by memories and intentions;
thag16.3:8.3	and pierced by this I tremble,
thag16.3:8.4	like a leaf blowing in the wind.
thag16.3:9.1	Having arisen within,
thag16.3:9.2	what belongs to me burns quickly,
thag16.3:9.3	in that place where the body always heads
thag16.3:9.4	with its six sense-fields of contact.
thag16.3:10.1	I don’t see a healer
thag16.3:10.2	who can pull out my dart of doubt
thag16.3:10.3	without a lance
thag16.3:10.4	or some other blade.
thag16.3:11.1	Without knife or wound,
thag16.3:11.2	who will pull out this dart
thag16.3:11.3	that’s stuck inside me,
thag16.3:11.4	without harming any part of my body?
thag16.3:12.1	He really would be the Lord of the Dhamma,
thag16.3:12.2	the best one to cure the damage of poison;
thag16.3:12.3	when I have fallen into deep waters,
thag16.3:12.4	he would give me his show me the shore.
thag16.3:13.1	I’ve plunged into a lake,
thag16.3:13.2	and I can’t wash off the mud and dirt.
thag16.3:13.3	It’s full of fraud, jealousy, pride,
thag16.3:13.4	and dullness and drowsiness.
thag16.3:14.1	Like a thunder-cloud of restlessness,
thag16.3:14.2	like a rain-cloud of fetters;
thag16.3:14.3	lustful thoughts are winds
thag16.3:14.4	that sweep off a person with bad views.
thag16.3:15.1	The streams flow everywhere;
thag16.3:15.2	a weed springs up and remains.
thag16.3:15.3	Who will block the streams?
thag16.3:15.4	Who will cut the weed?”
thag16.3:16.1	“Venerable sir, build a dam
thag16.3:16.2	to block the streams.
thag16.3:16.3	Don’t let your mind-made streams
thag16.3:16.4	cut you down suddenly like a tree.”
thag16.3:17.1	That is how the teacher whose weapon is wisdom,
thag16.3:17.2	surrounded by the Saṅgha of hermits,
thag16.3:17.3	was my shelter when I was full of fear,
thag16.3:17.4	seeking the far shore from the near.
thag16.3:18.1	As I was being swept away,
thag16.3:18.2	he gave me a strong, simple ladder,
thag16.3:18.3	made of the heartwood of Dhamma,
thag16.3:18.4	and he said to me: “Do not fear.”
thag16.3:19.1	I climbed the tower of mindfulness meditation,
thag16.3:19.2	and checked back down
thag16.3:19.3	at people delighting in identity,
thag16.3:19.4	as I’d obsessed over in the past.
thag16.3:20.1	When I saw the path,
thag16.3:20.2	as I was embarking on the ship,
thag16.3:20.3	without fixating on the self,
thag16.3:20.4	I saw the supreme landing-place.
thag16.3:21.1	The dart that arises in oneself,
thag16.3:21.2	and that which stems from attachment to rebirth:
thag16.3:21.3	he taught the supreme path
thag16.3:21.4	for the canceling of these.
thag16.3:22.1	For a long time it had lain within me;
thag16.3:22.2	for a long time it was fixed in me:
thag16.3:22.3	the Buddha cast off the knot,
thag16.3:22.4	curing the damage of poison.
thag16.4:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag16.4:0.2	The Book of the Twenties
thag16.4:0.3	Chapter One
thag16.4:0.4	Raṭṭhapāla
thag16.4:1.1	“See this fancy puppet,
thag16.4:1.2	a body built of sores,
thag16.4:1.3	diseased, obsessed over,
thag16.4:1.4	in which nothing lasts at all.
thag16.4:2.1	See this fancy figure,
thag16.4:2.2	with its gems and earrings;
thag16.4:2.3	it is bones wrapped in skin,
thag16.4:2.4	made pretty by its clothes.
thag16.4:3.1	Rouged feet
thag16.4:3.2	and powdered face
thag16.4:3.3	may be enough to beguile a fool,
thag16.4:3.4	but not a seeker of the far shore.
thag16.4:4.1	Hair in eight braids
thag16.4:4.2	and eyeliner
thag16.4:4.3	may be enough to beguile a fool,
thag16.4:4.4	but not a seeker of the far shore.
thag16.4:5.1	A rotting body all adorned
thag16.4:5.2	like a freshly painted makeup box
thag16.4:5.3	may be enough to beguile a fool,
thag16.4:5.4	but not a seeker of the far shore.
thag16.4:6.1	The hunter laid his snare,
thag16.4:6.2	but the deer didn’t spring the trap.
thag16.4:6.3	I’ve eaten the bait and now I go,
thag16.4:6.4	leaving the trapper to lament.
thag16.4:7.1	The hunter’s snare is broken,
thag16.4:7.2	but the deer didn’t spring the trap.
thag16.4:7.3	I’ve eaten the bait and now I go,
thag16.4:7.4	leaving the deer-hunter to grieve.”
thag16.4:8.1	“I see rich people in the world who,
thag16.4:8.2	because of delusion, give not the wealth they’ve earned.
thag16.4:8.3	Greedily, they hoard their riches,
thag16.4:8.4	yearning for ever more sensual pleasures.
thag16.4:9.1	A king who conquered the earth by force,
thag16.4:9.2	ruling the land from sea to sea,
thag16.4:9.3	unsatisfied with the near shore of the ocean,
thag16.4:9.4	would still yearn for the further shore.
thag16.4:10.1	Not just the king, but others too,
thag16.4:10.2	reach death not rid of craving.
thag16.4:10.3	They leave the body still wanting,
thag16.4:10.4	for in this world sensual pleasures never satisfy.
thag16.4:11.1	Relatives lament, their hair disheveled,
thag16.4:11.2	saying ‘Ah! Alas! They’re not immortal!’
thag16.4:11.3	They take out the body wrapped in a shroud,
thag16.4:11.4	heap up a pyre, and burn it there.
thag16.4:12.1	It’s poked with stakes while being burnt,
thag16.4:12.2	in just a single cloth, all wealth gone.
thag16.4:12.3	Relatives, friends, and companions
thag16.4:12.4	can’t help you when you’re dying.
thag16.4:13.1	Heirs take your riches,
thag16.4:13.2	while beings fare on according to their deeds.
thag16.4:13.3	Riches don’t follow you when you die;
thag16.4:13.4	nor do children, wife, wealth, nor kingdom.
thag16.4:14.1	Longevity isn’t gained by riches,
thag16.4:14.2	nor does wealth banish old age;
thag16.4:14.3	for the wise say this life is short,
thag16.4:14.4	it’s perishable and not eternal.
thag16.4:15.1	The rich and the poor feel its touch;
thag16.4:15.2	the fool and the wise feel it too.
thag16.4:15.3	But the fool lies stricken by their own folly,
thag16.4:15.4	while the wise don’t tremble at the touch.
thag16.4:16.1	Therefore wisdom’s much better than wealth,
thag16.4:16.2	since by wisdom you reach consummation in this life.
thag16.4:16.3	But if because of delusion you don’t reach consummation,
thag16.4:16.4	you’ll do evil deeds in life after life.
thag16.4:17.1	One who enters a womb and the world beyond,
thag16.4:17.2	will transmigrate from one life to the next.
thag16.4:17.3	While someone of little wisdom, placing faith in them,
thag16.4:17.4	also enters a womb and the world beyond.
thag16.4:18.1	As a bandit caught in the door
thag16.4:18.2	is punished for his own bad deeds;
thag16.4:18.3	so after departing, in the world beyond,
thag16.4:18.4	people are punished for their own bad deeds.
thag16.4:19.1	Sensual pleasures are diverse, sweet, delightful,
thag16.4:19.2	appearing in disguise they disturb the mind.
thag16.4:19.3	Seeing danger in the many kinds of sensual stimulation,
thag16.4:19.4	I went forth, O King.
thag16.4:20.1	As fruit falls from a tree, so people fall,
thag16.4:20.2	young and old, when the body breaks up.
thag16.4:20.3	Seeing this, too, I went forth, O King;
thag16.4:20.4	the ascetic life is guaranteed to be better.”
thag16.4:21.1	“I went forth out of faith
thag16.4:21.2	joining the victor’s dispensation.
thag16.4:21.3	My going forth wasn’t wasted;
thag16.4:21.4	I enjoy my food free of debt.
thag16.4:22.1	I saw sensual pleasures as burning,
thag16.4:22.2	gold as a cutting blade,
thag16.4:22.3	conception in a womb as suffering,
thag16.4:22.4	and the hells as very fearful.
thag16.4:23.1	Knowing this danger,
thag16.4:23.2	I was struck with a sense of urgency.
thag16.4:23.3	I was stabbed, but then I found peace,
thag16.4:23.4	attaining the end of defilements.
thag16.4:24.1	I’ve served the teacher
thag16.4:24.2	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thag16.4:24.3	The heavy burden is laid down,
thag16.4:24.4	the attachment to rebirth is eradicated.
thag16.4:25.1	I’ve reached the goal
thag16.4:25.2	for the sake of which I went forth
thag16.4:25.3	from the lay life to homelessness—
thag16.4:25.4	the ending of all fetters.”

thag16.6:0.3	Chapter One
thag16.6:0.4	Sela
thag16.6:1.1	“O Blessed One, your body’s perfect,
thag16.6:1.2	you’re radiant, handsome, lovely to behold;
thag16.6:1.3	golden colored,
thag16.6:1.4	with teeth so white; you’re strong.
thag16.6:2.1	The characteristics
thag16.6:2.2	of a handsome man,
thag16.6:2.3	the marks of a great man,
thag16.6:2.4	are all found on your body.
thag16.6:3.1	Your eyes are clear, your face is fair,
thag16.6:3.2	you’re formidable, upright, majestic.
thag16.6:3.3	In the midst of the Saṅgha of ascetics,
thag16.6:3.4	you shine like the sun.
thag16.6:4.1	You’re a mendicant fine to see,
thag16.6:4.2	with skin of golden sheen.
thag16.6:4.3	But with such excellent appearance,
thag16.6:4.4	what do you want with the ascetic life?
thag16.6:5.1	You’re fit to be a king,
thag16.6:5.2	a wheel-turning monarch, chief of charioteers,
thag16.6:5.3	victorious in the four directions,
thag16.6:5.4	lord of all India.
thag16.6:6.1	Aristocrats, nobles, and kings
thag16.6:6.2	ought follow your rule. 
thag16.6:6.3	Gotama, you should reign
thag16.6:6.4	as king of kings, lord of men!”
thag16.6:7.1	“I am a king, Sela”,
thag16.6:7.2	said the Buddha to Sela,
thag16.6:7.3	“the supreme king of the teaching.
thag16.6:7.4	By the teaching I roll forth the wheel
thag16.6:7.5	which cannot be rolled back.”
thag16.6:8.1	“You claim to be awakened,”
thag16.6:8.2	said Sela the brahmin,
thag16.6:8.3	“the supreme king of the teaching.
thag16.6:8.4	‘I roll forth the teaching’:
thag16.6:8.5	so you say, Gotama.
thag16.6:9.1	Then who is your general,
thag16.6:9.2	the disciple who follows the Teacher’s way?
thag16.6:9.3	Who keeps rolling the wheel
thag16.6:9.4	of the teaching you rolled forth?”
thag16.6:10.1	“By me the wheel was rolled forth,”
thag16.6:10.2	said the Buddha,
thag16.6:10.3	“the supreme wheel of the teaching.
thag16.6:10.4	Sāriputta, taking after the Realized One,
thag16.6:10.5	keeps it rolling on.
thag16.6:11.1	I have known what should be known,
thag16.6:11.2	and developed what should be developed,
thag16.6:11.3	and given up what should be given up:
thag16.6:11.4	and so, brahmin, I am a Buddha.
thag16.6:12.1	Dispel your doubt in me—
thag16.6:12.2	make up your mind, brahmin!
thag16.6:12.3	The sight of a Buddha
thag16.6:12.4	is hard to find again.
thag16.6:13.1	I am a Buddha, brahmin,
thag16.6:13.2	the supreme surgeon,
thag16.6:13.3	one of those whose appearance in the world
thag16.6:13.4	is hard to find again.
thag16.6:14.1	Holy, unequaled,
thag16.6:14.2	crusher of Māra’s army;
thag16.6:14.3	having subdued all my opponents,
thag16.6:14.4	I rejoice, fearing nothing from any quarter.”
thag16.6:15.1	“Pay heed, sirs, to what
thag16.6:15.2	is spoken by the seer.
thag16.6:15.3	The surgeon, the great hero,
thag16.6:15.4	roars like a lion in the jungle.
thag16.6:16.1	Holy, unequaled,
thag16.6:16.2	crusher of Māra’s army;
thag16.6:16.3	who would not be inspired by him,
thag16.6:16.4	even one whose nature is dark?
thag16.6:17.1	Those who wish may follow me;
thag16.6:17.2	those who don’t may go.
thag16.6:17.3	Right here, I’ll go forth in his presence,
thag16.6:17.4	the one of such splendid wisdom.”
thag16.6:18.1	“Sir, if you like
thag16.6:18.2	the teaching of the Buddha,
thag16.6:18.3	we’ll also go forth in his presence,
thag16.6:18.4	the one of such splendid wisdom.”
thag16.6:19.1	“These three hundred brahmins
thag16.6:19.2	with joined palms held up, ask:
thag16.6:19.3	‘May we lead the spiritual life
thag16.6:19.4	in your presence, Blessed One?’”
thag16.6:20.1	“The spiritual life is well explained,”
thag16.6:20.2	said the Buddha,
thag16.6:20.3	“visible in this very life, immediately effective.
thag16.6:20.4	Here the going forth isn’t in vain
thag16.6:20.5	for one who trains with diligence.”
thag16.6:21.1	“This is the eighth day since
thag16.6:21.2	we went for refuge, O seer.
thag16.6:21.3	In these seven days, Blessed One,
thag16.6:21.4	we’ve become tamed in your teaching.
thag16.6:22.1	You are the Buddha, you are the Teacher,
thag16.6:22.2	you are the sage who has overcome Māra;
thag16.6:22.3	you have cut off the underlying tendencies,
thag16.6:22.4	you’ve crossed over, and you bring humanity across.
thag16.6:23.1	You have transcended attachments,
thag16.6:23.2	your defilements are shattered;
thag16.6:23.3	by not grasping, like a lion,
thag16.6:23.4	you’ve given up fear and dread.
thag16.6:24.1	These three hundred mendicants
thag16.6:24.2	stand with joined palms raised.
thag16.6:24.3	Stretch out your feet, great hero:
thag16.6:24.4	let these giants bow to the Teacher.”

thag16.7:21.1	Giving up a valuable bronze bowl,
thag16.7:21.2	and a precious golden one, too,
thag16.7:21.3	I took a bowl made of clay:
thag16.7:21.4	this is my second initiation.
thag16.7:22.1	I used to live in a citadel with walls so high,
thag16.7:22.2	with battlements strong and gates,
thag16.7:22.3	all guarded by swordsmen—
thag16.7:22.4	and yet I trembled with fear.
thag16.7:23.1	Today I am fortunate, free of cowardice,
thag16.7:23.2	with fear and dread given up.
thag16.7:23.3	Bhaddiya son of Godhā
thag16.7:23.4	has plunged into the forest and practices absorption.
thag16.7:24.1	Established in the entire spectrum of ethics,
thag16.7:24.2	developing the mind and wisdom,
thag16.7:24.3	gradually I attained
thag16.7:24.4	the ending of all fetters.
thag16.8:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag16.8:0.2	The Book of the Twenties
thag16.8:0.3	Chapter One
thag16.8:0.4	Aṅgulimāla
thag16.8:1.1	“While walking, ascetic, you say ‘I’ve stopped.’
thag16.8:1.2	And I have stopped, but you tell me I’ve not.
thag16.8:1.3	I’m asking you this, ascetic:
thag16.8:1.4	how is it you’ve stopped and I have not?”
thag16.8:2.1	“Aṅgulimāla, I have forever stopped—
thag16.8:2.2	I’ve laid aside violence towards all creatures.
thag16.8:2.3	But you can’t stop yourself from harming living creatures;
thag16.8:2.4	that’s why I’ve stopped, but you have not.”
thag16.8:3.1	“Oh, at long last an ascetic,
thag16.8:3.2	a great hermit who I honor, has entered this great forest.
thag16.8:3.3	Now that I’ve heard your verse on Dhamma,
thag16.8:3.4	I shall discard a thousand evils.”
thag16.8:4.1	With these words, the bandit hurled his sword and weapons
thag16.8:4.2	down a cliff into an abyss.
thag16.8:4.3	He venerated the Holy One’s feet,
thag16.8:4.4	and asked the Buddha for the going forth right away.
thag16.8:5.1	Then the Buddha, the compassionate great hermit,
thag16.8:5.2	the teacher of the world with its gods,
thag16.8:5.3	said to him, “Come, monk!”
thag16.8:5.4	And with that he became a monk.
thag16.8:6.1	“He who once was heedless,
thag16.8:6.2	but turned to heedfulness,
thag16.8:6.3	lights up the world,
thag16.8:6.4	like the moon freed from a cloud.
thag16.8:7.1	Someone whose bad deed
thag16.8:7.2	is supplanted by the good,
thag16.8:7.3	lights up the world,
thag16.8:7.4	like the moon freed from a cloud.
thag16.8:8.1	A young mendicant
thag16.8:8.2	devoted to the Buddha’s teaching, 
thag16.8:8.3	lights up the world,
thag16.8:8.4	like the moon freed from a cloud.
thag16.8:9.1	May even my enemies hear a Dhamma talk!
thag16.8:9.2	May even my enemies devote themselves to the Buddha’s teaching!
thag16.8:9.3	May even my enemies associate with those good people
thag16.8:9.4	who establish others in the Dhamma!
thag16.8:10.1	May even my enemies hear Dhamma at the right time,
thag16.8:10.2	from those who speak on acceptance,
thag16.8:10.3	praising acquiescence;
thag16.8:10.4	and may they follow that path!
thag16.8:11.1	For then they’d surely wish no harm
thag16.8:11.2	upon myself or others.
thag16.8:11.3	Having arrived at ultimate peace,
thag16.8:11.4	they’d look after creatures firm and frail.
thag16.8:12.1	For irrigators guide the water,
thag16.8:12.2	and fletchers straighten arrows;
thag16.8:12.3	carpenters carve timber—
thag16.8:12.4	but the astute tame themselves.
thag16.8:13.1	Some tame by using the rod,
thag16.8:13.2	some with goads, and some with whips.
thag16.8:13.3	But the poised one tamed me
thag16.8:13.4	without rod or sword.
thag16.8:14.1	My name is ‘Harmless’,
thag16.8:14.2	though I used to be harmful.
thag16.8:14.3	The name I bear today is true,
thag16.8:14.4	for I do no harm to anyone.
thag16.8:15.1	I used to be a bandit,
thag16.8:15.2	the notorious Aṅgulimāla.
thag16.8:15.3	Swept away in a great flood,
thag16.8:15.4	I went to the Buddha for refuge.
thag16.8:16.1	I used to have blood on my hands,
thag16.8:16.2	the notorious Aṅgulimāla.
thag16.8:16.3	See the refuge I’ve found—
thag16.8:16.4	the attachment to rebirth is eradicated.
thag16.8:17.1	I’ve done many of the sort of deeds
thag16.8:17.2	that lead to a bad destination.
thag16.8:17.3	The result of my deeds has already struck me,
thag16.8:17.4	so I enjoy my food free of debt.
thag16.8:18.1	Fools and half-wits
thag16.8:18.2	devote themselves to negligence.
thag16.8:18.3	But the wise protect diligence
thag16.8:18.4	as their best treasure.
thag16.8:19.1	Don’t devote yourself to negligence,
thag16.8:19.2	or delight in sexual intimacy.
thag16.8:19.3	For if you’re diligent and practice absorption,
thag16.8:19.4	you’ll attain ultimate happiness.
thag16.8:20.1	It was welcome, not unwelcome,
thag16.8:20.2	the advice I got was good.
thag16.8:20.3	Of teachings that are shared,
thag16.8:20.4	I encountered the best.
thag16.8:21.1	It was welcome, not unwelcome,
thag16.8:21.2	the advice I got was good.
thag16.8:21.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges,
thag16.8:21.4	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.”
thag16.8:22.1	“In the wilderness, at a tree’s root,
thag16.8:22.2	on mountains, or in caves—
thag16.8:22.3	it used to be that wherever I stood,
thag16.8:22.4	my mind was anxious.
thag16.8:23.1	But now I lie down happily and stand up happily,
thag16.8:23.2	I live my life happily,
thag16.8:23.3	out of Māra’s reach;
thag16.8:23.4	the teacher had compassion for me.
thag16.8:24.1	I used to belong to the brahmin caste,
thag16.8:24.2	highborn on both sides,
thag16.8:24.3	now I’m a son of the Holy One,
thag16.8:24.4	the Teacher, King of Dhamma.
thag16.8:25.1	I am rid of craving, free of grasping,
thag16.8:25.2	my sense-doors are guarded and well-restrained.
thag16.8:25.3	I’ve destroyed the root of misery,
thag16.8:25.4	and attained the ending of defilements.
thag16.8:26.1	I’ve served the teacher
thag16.8:26.2	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thag16.8:26.3	The heavy burden is laid down,
thag16.8:26.4	the attachment to rebirth is eradicated.”
thag16.9:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag16.9:0.2	The Book of the Twenties
thag16.9:0.3	Chapter One
thag16.9:0.4	Anuruddha
thag16.9:1.1	Leaving my mother and father behind,
thag16.9:1.2	as well as sisters, kinsmen, and brothers;
thag16.9:1.3	having given up the five sensual titillations,
thag16.9:1.4	Anuruddha practices absorption.
thag16.9:2.1	Surrounded by song and dance,
thag16.9:2.2	awakened by cymbals and gongs,
thag16.9:2.3	he did not find purification
thag16.9:2.4	while delighting in Māra’s domain.
thag16.9:3.1	But he has gone beyond all that,
thag16.9:3.2	and delights in the Buddha’s teaching.
thag16.9:3.3	Having crossed over the entire flood,
thag16.9:3.4	Anuruddha practices absorption.
thag16.9:4.1	Sights, sounds, tastes, smells,
thag16.9:4.2	and touches so delightful:
thag16.9:4.3	having crossed over these as well,
thag16.9:4.4	Anuruddha practices absorption.
thag16.9:5.1	Returning from almsround,
thag16.9:5.2	alone, without companion,
thag16.9:5.3	seeking rags from the dust heap,
thag16.9:5.4	Anuruddha is without defilements.
thag16.9:6.1	The thoughtful sage
thag16.9:6.2	selected rags from the dust heap;
thag16.9:6.3	he picked them up, washed, dyed, and wore them;
thag16.9:6.4	Anuruddha is without defilements.
thag16.9:7.1	The principles of someone
thag16.9:7.2	who has many wishes and is not content,
thag16.9:7.3	who socializes and is conceited,
thag16.9:7.4	are wicked and corrupt.
thag16.9:8.1	But someone who is mindful, few of wishes,
thag16.9:8.2	content and untroubled,
thag16.9:8.3	delighting in seclusion, joyful,
thag16.9:8.4	always resolute and energetic;
thag16.9:9.1	their principles are skillful,
thag16.9:9.2	leading to awakening;
thag16.9:9.3	they are without defilements—
thag16.9:9.4	so said the great hermit.
thag16.9:10.1	“Knowing my thoughts,
thag16.9:10.2	the supreme Teacher in the world
thag16.9:10.3	came to me in a mind-made body,
thag16.9:10.4	using his psychic power.
thag16.9:11.1	He taught me more
thag16.9:11.2	than I had thought of.
thag16.9:11.3	The Buddha who loves non-proliferation
thag16.9:11.4	taught me non-proliferation.
thag16.9:12.1	Understanding that teaching,
thag16.9:12.2	I happily did his bidding.
thag16.9:12.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges,
thag16.9:12.4	and have fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thag16.9:13.1	For the last fifty-five years
thag16.9:13.2	I have not lain down to sleep.
thag16.9:13.3	Twenty-five years have passed
thag16.9:13.4	since I eradicated drowsiness.”
thag16.9:14.1	“There was no more breathing
thag16.9:14.2	for the poised one of steady heart.
thag16.9:14.3	Imperturbable, committed to peace,
thag16.9:14.4	the seer became fully extinguished.
thag16.9:15.1	He put up with painful feelings
thag16.9:15.2	without flinching.
thag16.9:15.3	The liberation of his heart
thag16.9:15.4	was like the extinguishing of a lamp.”
thag16.9:16.1	“Now these touches and the other four
thag16.9:16.2	are the last to be experienced by the sage;
thag16.9:16.3	nor will there be other phenomena
thag16.9:16.4	since the Buddha became fully extinguished.
thag16.9:17.1	Weaver of the web in the company of the gods,
thag16.9:17.2	now there are no future lives.
thag16.9:17.3	Transmigration through births is finished,
thag16.9:17.4	now there’ll be no more future lives.”
thag16.9:18.1	“Knowing in an hour the galaxy,
thag16.9:18.2	together with the Brahmā realm;
thag16.9:18.3	that mendicant, a master of psychic powers,
thag16.9:18.4	knowing the passing away and rebirth of beings, sees even the gods at that time.”
thag16.9:19.1	“In the past I was Annabhāra,
thag16.9:19.2	a poor carrier of fodder.
thag16.9:19.3	I practiced as an ascetic,
thag16.9:19.4	the renowned Upariṭṭha.
thag16.9:20.1	Then I was reborn in the Sakyan clan,
thag16.9:20.2	where I was known as ‘Anuruddha’.
thag16.9:20.3	Surrounded by song and dance,
thag16.9:20.4	I was awakened by cymbals and gongs.
thag16.9:21.1	Then I saw the Buddha,
thag16.9:21.2	the Teacher, fearing nothing from any quarter;
thag16.9:21.3	filling my mind with confidence in him,
thag16.9:21.4	I went forth to homelessness.
thag16.9:22.1	I know my past lives,
thag16.9:22.2	the places I used to live.
thag16.9:22.3	I was born as Sakka,
thag16.9:22.4	and stayed among the Thirty-Three gods.
thag16.9:23.1	Seven times I was a king of men
thag16.9:23.2	ruling a kingdom,
thag16.9:23.3	victorious in the four directions,
thag16.9:23.4	lord of all India.
thag16.9:23.5	Without rod or sword,
thag16.9:23.6	I governed by principle.
thag16.9:24.1	Seven here, seven there,
thag16.9:24.2	fourteen transmigrations in all.
thag16.9:24.3	I remember my past lives;
thag16.9:24.4	at that time I stayed in the realm of the gods.
thag16.9:25.1	I have gained complete tranquility
thag16.9:25.2	in immersion with five factors.
thag16.9:25.3	Peaceful, serene,
thag16.9:25.4	my clairvoyance is purified.
thag16.9:26.1	Steady in five-factored absorption,
thag16.9:26.2	I know the passing away and rebirth of beings,
thag16.9:26.3	their coming and going,
thag16.9:26.4	their lives in this state and that.
thag16.9:27.1	I’ve served the teacher
thag16.9:27.2	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thag16.9:27.3	The heavy burden is laid down,
thag16.9:27.4	the attachment to rebirth is eradicated.
thag16.9:28.1	In the Vajjian village of Veḷuva,
thag16.9:28.2	my life will come to an end.
thag16.9:28.3	Beneath a thicket of bamboos,
thag16.9:28.4	I’ll be quenched without defilements.”
thag17.1:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag17.1:0.2	The Book of the Thirties
thag17.1:0.3	Chapter One
thag17.1:0.4	Phussa
thag17.1:1.1	Seeing many who inspire confidence,
thag17.1:1.2	evolved and well-restrained,
thag17.1:1.3	the hermit Paṇḍarasagotta
thag17.1:1.4	asked the one known as Phussa:
thag17.1:2.1	“In future times,
thag17.1:2.2	what desire and motivation
thag17.1:2.3	and behavior will people have?
thag17.1:2.4	Please answer my question.”
thag17.1:3.1	“Listen to my words,
thag17.1:3.2	Paṇḍarasa the hermit,
thag17.1:3.3	and remember them carefully,
thag17.1:3.4	I will describe the future.
thag17.1:4.1	In the future many will be
thag17.1:4.2	angry and hostile,
thag17.1:4.3	offensive, stubborn, and devious,
thag17.1:4.4	jealous, holding divergent views.
thag17.1:5.1	Imagining they understand the depths of the teaching,
thag17.1:5.2	they remain on the near shore.
thag17.1:5.3	Superficial and disrespectful towards the teaching,
thag17.1:5.4	they lack respect for one another.
thag17.1:6.1	In the future
thag17.1:6.2	many dangers will arise in the world.
thag17.1:6.3	Idiots will defile
thag17.1:6.4	the Dhamma that was taught so well.
thag17.1:7.1	Though bereft of good qualities,
thag17.1:7.2	unlearned prattlers, too sure of themselves,
thag17.1:7.3	will become powerful
thag17.1:7.4	in running Saṅgha proceedings.
thag17.1:8.1	Though possessing good qualities,
thag17.1:8.2	the conscientious and unbiased, acting in the proper spirit,
thag17.1:8.3	will become weak
thag17.1:8.4	in running Saṅgha proceedings.
thag17.1:9.1	In the future, fools will accept
thag17.1:9.2	money, gold, and silver,
thag17.1:9.3	fields and land, goats and sheep,
thag17.1:9.4	and bonded servants, male and female.
thag17.1:10.1	Fools looking for fault in others,
thag17.1:10.2	but unsteady in their own ethics,
thag17.1:10.3	will wander about, insolent,
thag17.1:10.4	like cantankerous beasts.
thag17.1:11.1	They’ll be arrogant,
thag17.1:11.2	wrapped in robes of blue;
thag17.1:11.3	deceivers, stubborn, flatterers, and frauds,
thag17.1:11.4	they’ll wander as if they were noble ones.
thag17.1:12.1	With hair sleeked back with oil,
thag17.1:12.2	fickle, their eyes painted with eye-liner,
thag17.1:12.3	they’ll travel on the high-road,
thag17.1:12.4	wrapped in robes of ivory color.
thag17.1:13.1	The deep-dyed ocher robe,
thag17.1:13.2	worn without disgust by the free,
thag17.1:13.3	they will come to loathe,
thag17.1:13.4	besotted by white clothes.
thag17.1:14.1	They’ll want lots of possessions,
thag17.1:14.2	and be lazy, lacking energy.
thag17.1:14.3	Weary of the forest,
thag17.1:14.4	they’ll stay within villages.
thag17.1:15.1	Being unrestrained, they’ll keep company with
thag17.1:15.2	those who get lots of stuff,
thag17.1:15.3	and who always enjoy wrong livelihood,
thag17.1:15.4	following their example.
thag17.1:16.1	They won’t respect those
thag17.1:16.2	who don’t get lots of stuff,
thag17.1:16.3	and they won’t associate with the wise,
thag17.1:16.4	even though they’re very amiable.
thag17.1:17.1	Disparaging their own banner,
thag17.1:17.2	which is dyed the color of copper,
thag17.1:17.3	some will wear the white banner
thag17.1:17.4	of those who follow other paths.
thag17.1:18.1	Then they’ll have no respect
thag17.1:18.2	for the ocher robe.
thag17.1:18.3	The mendicants will not reflect
thag17.1:18.4	on the nature of the ocher robe.
thag17.1:19.1	This awful lack of reflection
thag17.1:19.2	was unthinkable to the elephant,
thag17.1:19.3	who was overcome by suffering,
thag17.1:19.4	injured by an arrow strike.
thag17.1:20.1	Then the six-tusked elephant,
thag17.1:20.2	seeing the deep-dyed banner of the perfected ones,
thag17.1:20.3	straight away spoke these verses
thag17.1:20.4	connected with the goal.
thag17.1:21.1	One who, not free of stains themselves,
thag17.1:21.2	would wear the robe stained in ocher,
thag17.1:21.3	bereft of self-control and truth:
thag17.1:21.4	they are not worthy of the ocher robe.
thag17.1:22.1	One who’s purged all their stains,
thag17.1:22.2	steady in ethics,
thag17.1:22.3	possessing truth and self-control:
thag17.1:22.4	they are truly worthy of the ocher robe.
thag17.1:23.1	Devoid of virtue, unintelligent,
thag17.1:23.2	wild, doing what they like,
thag17.1:23.3	their minds astray, indolent:
thag17.1:23.4	they are not worthy of the ocher robe.
thag17.1:24.1	One accomplished in ethics,
thag17.1:24.2	free of greed, serene,
thag17.1:24.3	their heart’s intention pure:
thag17.1:24.4	they are truly worthy of the ocher robe.
thag17.1:25.1	The conceited, arrogant fool,
thag17.1:25.2	who has no ethics at all,
thag17.1:25.3	is worthy of a white robe—
thag17.1:25.4	what use is an ocher robe for them?
thag17.1:26.1	In the future, monks and nuns
thag17.1:26.2	with corrupt hearts, lacking regard for others,
thag17.1:26.3	will disparage those
thag17.1:26.4	with hearts of loving-kindness.
thag17.1:27.1	Though trained in wearing the robe
thag17.1:27.2	by senior monks,
thag17.1:27.3	the unintelligent will not listen,
thag17.1:27.4	wild, doing what they like.
thag17.1:28.1	With that kind of attitude to training,
thag17.1:28.2	those fools won’t respect each other,
thag17.1:28.3	or take any notice of their mentors,
thag17.1:28.4	like a wild colt with its charioteer.
thag17.1:29.1	Even so, in the future,
thag17.1:29.2	this will be the practice
thag17.1:29.3	of monks and nuns
thag17.1:29.4	when the latter days have come.
thag17.1:30.1	Before this frightening future arrives,
thag17.1:30.2	be easy to admonish,
thag17.1:30.3	kind in speech,
thag17.1:30.4	and respect one another.
thag17.1:31.1	Have hearts of love and compassion,
thag17.1:31.2	and please do keep your precepts.
thag17.1:31.3	Be energetic, resolute,
thag17.1:31.4	and always staunchly vigorous.
thag17.1:32.1	Seeing negligence as fearful,
thag17.1:32.2	and diligence as a sanctuary,
thag17.1:32.3	develop the eightfold path,
thag17.1:32.4	realizing the deathless state.”

thag17.2:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag17.2:0.2	The Book of the Thirties
thag17.2:0.3	Chapter One
thag17.2:0.4	Sāriputta
thag17.2:1.1	“One who’s mindful as per their conduct and mindfulness,
thag17.2:1.2	diligent as per their intentions and meditation,
thag17.2:1.3	happy inside, serene, solitary, contented:
thag17.2:1.4	that is what they call a mendicant.
thag17.2:2.1	When eating fresh or dried food,
thag17.2:2.2	one shouldn’t be overly replete.
thag17.2:2.3	A mendicant should wander mindfully,
thag17.2:2.4	with empty stomach, taking limited food.
thag17.2:3.1	Four or five mouthfuls before you’re full,
thag17.2:3.2	drink some water;
thag17.2:3.3	this is enough for a resolute mendicant
thag17.2:3.4	to live in comfort.
thag17.2:4.1	If they cover themselves with a robe
thag17.2:4.2	that’s allowable and fit for purpose;
thag17.2:4.3	this is enough for a resolute mendicant
thag17.2:4.4	to live in comfort.
thag17.2:5.1	When sitting cross-legged,
thag17.2:5.2	the rain doesn’t fall on the knees;
thag17.2:5.3	this is enough for a resolute mendicant
thag17.2:5.4	to live in comfort.”
thag17.2:6.1	“When you’ve seen happiness as suffering,
thag17.2:6.2	and suffering as a dart,
thag17.2:6.3	and that there’s nothing between the two—
thag17.2:6.4	what keeps you in the world? What would you become?
thag17.2:7.1	Thinking, ‘May I have nothing to do with those of bad wishes,
thag17.2:7.2	lazy, lacking energy,
thag17.2:7.3	uneducated, lacking regard for others’—
thag17.2:7.4	what keeps you in the world? What would you become?”
thag17.2:8.1	“An intelligent, learned person,
thag17.2:8.2	steady in ethics,
thag17.2:8.3	devoted to serenity of heart—
thag17.2:8.4	let them stand at the head.”
thag17.2:9.1	“A beast who likes to proliferate,
thag17.2:9.2	enjoying proliferation,
thag17.2:9.3	fails to win extinguishment,
thag17.2:9.4	the supreme sanctuary.
thag17.2:10.1	But one who gives up proliferation,
thag17.2:10.2	enjoying the state of non-proliferation,
thag17.2:10.3	wins extinguishment,
thag17.2:10.4	the supreme sanctuary.”
thag17.2:11.1	“Whether in the village or the wilderness,
thag17.2:11.2	in a valley or the uplands,
thag17.2:11.3	wherever the perfected ones live
thag17.2:11.4	is a delightful place.”
thag17.2:12.1	“The wilderness is so lovely!
thag17.2:12.2	Though most people don’t like it,
thag17.2:12.3	those free of greed are happy there,
thag17.2:12.4	as they don’t seek sensual pleasures.”
thag17.2:13.1	“Regard one who sees your faults
thag17.2:13.2	as a guide to a hidden treasure.
thag17.2:13.3	Stay close to one so wise and astute
thag17.2:13.4	who corrects you when you need it.
thag17.2:13.5	Sticking close to such an impartial person,
thag17.2:13.6	things get better, not worse.”
thag17.2:14.1	“Advise and instruct;
thag17.2:14.2	curb wickedness:
thag17.2:14.3	for you shall be loved by the good,
thag17.2:14.4	and disliked by the bad.”
thag17.2:15.1	“The Blessed One, the Buddha, the seer
thag17.2:15.2	was teaching Dhamma to another.
thag17.2:15.3	As he taught the Dhamma,
thag17.2:15.4	I lent an ear to get the meaning.
thag17.2:16.1	My listening wasn’t wasted:
thag17.2:16.2	I’m freed, without defilements.”
thag17.2:17.1	“Not for knowledge of past lives,
thag17.2:17.2	nor even for clairvoyance;
thag17.2:17.3	not for psychic powers, or reading the minds of others,
thag17.2:17.4	nor for knowing people’s passing away and being reborn;
thag17.2:17.5	not for purifying the power of clairaudience,
thag17.2:17.6	did I have any wish.”
thag17.2:18.1	“His only shelter is the foot of a tree;
thag17.2:18.2	shaven, wrapped in his outer robe,
thag17.2:18.3	the senior monk foremost in wisdom,
thag17.2:18.4	Upatissa himself practices absorption.
thag17.2:19.1	Entering meditation without thought,
thag17.2:19.2	a disciple of the Buddha
thag17.2:19.3	is at that moment blessed
thag17.2:19.4	with noble silence.
thag17.2:20.1	As a rocky mountain
thag17.2:20.2	is unwavering and well grounded,
thag17.2:20.3	so when delusion ends,
thag17.2:20.4	a monk, like a mountain, doesn’t tremble.
thag17.2:21.1	“To the man who has not a blemish,
thag17.2:21.2	who is always seeking purity,
thag17.2:21.3	even a hair-tip of evil
thag17.2:21.4	seems as big as a cloud.”
thag17.2:22.1	“I don’t long for death;
thag17.2:22.2	I don’t long for life;
thag17.2:22.3	I will lay down this body,
thag17.2:22.4	aware and mindful.
thag17.2:23.1	I don’t long for death;
thag17.2:23.2	I don’t long for life;
thag17.2:23.3	I await my time,
thag17.2:23.4	like a worker waiting for their wages.”
thag17.2:24.1	“Both what came before and what follows after
thag17.2:24.2	are nothing but death, not the deathless.
thag17.2:24.3	Practice, don’t perish—
thag17.2:24.4	don’t let the moment pass you by.
thag17.2:25.1	Just like a frontier city,
thag17.2:25.2	is guarded inside and out,
thag17.2:25.3	so you should ward yourselves—
thag17.2:25.4	don’t let the moment pass you by.
thag17.2:25.5	For if you miss your moment
thag17.2:25.6	you’ll grieve when sent to hell.”
thag17.2:26.1	“Calm and quiet,
thag17.2:26.2	thoughtful in counsel, and stable—
thag17.2:26.3	he shakes off bad qualities
thag17.2:26.4	as the wind shakes leaves off a tree.
thag17.2:27.1	Calm and quiet,
thag17.2:27.2	thoughtful in counsel, and stable—
thag17.2:27.3	he plucks off bad qualities
thag17.2:27.4	as the wind plucks leaves off a tree.
thag17.2:28.1	Calm and free of despair,
thag17.2:28.2	clear and unclouded,
thag17.2:28.3	of good morals, intelligent:
thag17.2:28.4	one would make an end of suffering.”
thag17.2:29.1	“Some householders, and even some renunciants,
thag17.2:29.2	are not to be trusted.
thag17.2:29.3	Some who were good later become bad;
thag17.2:29.4	while some who were bad become good.”
thag17.2:30.1	“Sensual desire, ill will,
thag17.2:30.2	dullness and drowsiness,
thag17.2:30.3	restlessness, and doubt:
thag17.2:30.4	these are the five mental stains for a monk.”
thag17.2:31.1	“Whether they’re honored
thag17.2:31.2	or not honored, or both,
thag17.2:31.3	their immersion doesn’t waver
thag17.2:31.4	as they live diligently.
thag17.2:32.1	They persistently practice absorption
thag17.2:32.2	with subtle view and discernment.
thag17.2:32.3	Rejoicing in the ending of grasping,
thag17.2:32.4	they’re said to be a good person.”
thag17.2:33.1	“The oceans and the earth,
thag17.2:33.2	the mountains and the wind—
thag17.2:33.3	none of these can compare
thag17.2:33.4	with the Teacher’s magnificent liberation.”
thag17.2:34.1	“The senior monk who keeps the wheel rolling,
thag17.2:34.2	he is very wise and serene.
thag17.2:34.3	Like earth, like water, like fire,
thag17.2:34.4	he is neither attracted nor repelled.
thag17.2:35.1	He has attained the perfection of wisdom,
thag17.2:35.2	so intelligent and thoughtful.
thag17.2:35.3	He is bright, but seems to be dull;
thag17.2:35.4	he always wanders, quenched.”
thag17.2:36.1	“I’ve served the teacher
thag17.2:36.2	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thag17.2:36.3	The heavy burden is laid down,
thag17.2:36.4	the attachment to rebirth is eradicated.”
thag17.2:37.1	“Persist with diligence:
thag17.2:37.2	this is my instruction.
thag17.2:37.3	Come, I’ll realize quenching—
thag17.2:37.4	I am everywhere free.”

thag17.3:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag17.3:0.2	The Book of the Thirties
thag17.3:0.3	Chapter One
thag17.3:0.4	Ānanda
thag17.3:1.1	“The astute would not make friends
thag17.3:1.2	with the slanderous or the hateful,
thag17.3:1.3	with a miser or a gloater,
thag17.3:1.4	for it’s bad to consort with sinners.
thag17.3:2.1	The astute would make friends
thag17.3:2.2	with the faithful and the pleasant,
thag17.3:2.3	the wise and the learned,
thag17.3:2.4	for it’s a blessing to consort with good people.”
thag17.3:3.1	“See this fancy puppet,
thag17.3:3.2	a body built of sores,
thag17.3:3.3	diseased, obsessed over,
thag17.3:3.4	in which nothing lasts at all.
thag17.3:4.1	See this fancy puppet,
thag17.3:4.2	with its gems and earrings;
thag17.3:4.3	it is bones wrapped with skin,
thag17.3:4.4	made pretty by its clothes.
thag17.3:5.1	Rouged feet
thag17.3:5.2	and powdered face
thag17.3:5.3	may be enough to beguile a fool,
thag17.3:5.4	but not a seeker of the far shore.
thag17.3:6.1	Hair in eight braids
thag17.3:6.2	and eyeliner
thag17.3:6.3	may be enough to beguile a fool,
thag17.3:6.4	but not a seeker of the far shore.
thag17.3:7.1	A rotting body all adorned
thag17.3:7.2	like a freshly painted makeup box
thag17.3:7.3	may be enough to beguile a fool,
thag17.3:7.4	but not a seeker of the far shore.”
thag17.3:8.1	“Gotama is learned, a brilliant speaker,
thag17.3:8.2	the attendant to the Buddha.
thag17.3:8.3	With burden put down, detached,
thag17.3:8.4	Gotama made his bed.
thag17.3:9.1	Defilements ended, detached,
thag17.3:9.2	he has got over clinging and become quenched.
thag17.3:9.3	He bears his final body,
thag17.3:9.4	having gone beyond birth and death.”
thag17.3:10.1	“Gotama stands firm
thag17.3:10.2	on the path that leads to quenching,
thag17.3:10.3	where the teachings of the Buddha,
thag17.3:10.4	the Kinsman of the Sun, are grounded.”
thag17.3:11.1	“82,000 from the Buddha,
thag17.3:11.2	and 2,000 more from the monks:
thag17.3:11.3	84,000 teachings I’ve learned,
thag17.3:11.4	and these are what I promulgate.”
thag17.3:12.1	“A person of little learning
thag17.3:12.2	ages like an ox—
thag17.3:12.3	their flesh grows,
thag17.3:12.4	but not their wisdom.
thag17.3:13.1	A learned person who, on account of their learning,
thag17.3:13.2	looks down on someone of little learning,
thag17.3:13.3	seems to me like
thag17.3:13.4	a blind man holding a lamp.
thag17.3:14.1	You should stay close to a learned person—
thag17.3:14.2	don’t lose what you’ve learned.
thag17.3:14.3	It is the root of the spiritual life,
thag17.3:14.4	which is why you should memorize the teaching.
thag17.3:15.1	Knowing the sequence and meaning of the teaching,
thag17.3:15.2	expert in the interpretation of terms,
thag17.3:15.3	they make sure it is well memorized,
thag17.3:15.4	and then examine the meaning.
thag17.3:16.1	Accepting the teachings, they become enthusiastic;
thag17.3:16.2	making an effort, they weigh up the teaching.
thag17.3:16.3	When it’s time, they strive
thag17.3:16.4	serene inside themselves.
thag17.3:17.1	If you want to understand the teaching,
thag17.3:17.2	you should befriend the sort of person
thag17.3:17.3	who is learned and has memorized the teachings,
thag17.3:17.4	a wise disciple of the Buddha.
thag17.3:18.1	One who is learned and has memorized the teaching,
thag17.3:18.2	a keeper of the great hermit’s treasury,
thag17.3:18.3	is a visionary for the whole world,
thag17.3:18.4	learned and honorable.
thag17.3:19.1	Delighting in the teaching, enjoying the teaching,
thag17.3:19.2	contemplating the teaching,
thag17.3:19.3	a mendicant who recollects the teaching
thag17.3:19.4	doesn’t decline in the true teaching.”
thag17.3:20.1	“When your body is pampered and heavy,
thag17.3:20.2	while your remaining time is running out,
thag17.3:20.3	greedy for physical pleasure,
thag17.3:20.4	how can you be comfortable as an ascetic?”
thag17.3:21.1	“I’m completely disorientated!
thag17.3:21.2	The teachings don’t spring to mind!
thag17.3:21.3	With the passing of our good friend,
thag17.3:21.4	everything seems dark.
thag17.3:22.1	When your friend has passed away,
thag17.3:22.2	and your Teacher is past and gone,
thag17.3:22.3	there’s no friend like
thag17.3:22.4	mindfulness of the body.
thag17.3:23.1	The old have passed away,
thag17.3:23.2	and I don’t agree with the new.
thag17.3:23.3	Today I meditate alone
thag17.3:23.4	like a bird snug in its nest.”
thag17.3:24.1	“Many international visitors
thag17.3:24.2	have come to visit.
thag17.3:24.3	Don’t block the audience,
thag17.3:24.4	let the congregation see me.”
thag17.3:25.1	“Lots of international visitors
thag17.3:25.2	have come to visit.
thag17.3:25.3	The teacher grants them the opportunity,
thag17.3:25.4	the seer doesn’t turn them away.”
thag17.3:26.1	“In the twenty five years that have passed
thag17.3:26.2	since I became a trainee,
thag17.3:26.3	no sensual perception has arisen in me:
thag17.3:26.4	see the excellence of the teaching!
thag17.3:27.1	In the twenty-five years
thag17.3:27.2	since I became a trainee,
thag17.3:27.3	no malicious perception has arisen in me:
thag17.3:27.4	see the excellence of the teaching!”
thag17.3:28.1	'For 25 years
thag17.3:28.2	I attended on the Buddha
thag17.3:28.3	with loving deeds,
thag17.3:28.4	like a shadow that never left.
thag17.3:29.1	For 25 years
thag17.3:29.2	I attended on the Buddha
thag17.3:29.3	with loving words,
thag17.3:29.4	like a shadow that never left.
thag17.3:30.1	For 25 years
thag17.3:30.2	I attended on the Buddha
thag17.3:30.3	with loving thoughts,
thag17.3:30.4	like a shadow that never left.
thag17.3:31.1	While the Buddha was walking mindfully,
thag17.3:31.2	I walked behind him.
thag17.3:31.3	As he taught the Dhamma,
thag17.3:31.4	knowledge arose in me.”
thag17.3:32.1	“I’m a trainee, who has more to do;
thag17.3:32.2	my heart’s desire is still unfulfilled.
thag17.3:32.3	Yet the Teacher, who was so compassionate to me,
thag17.3:32.4	has become completely quenched.
thag17.3:33.1	Then there was terror!
thag17.3:33.2	Then they had goosebumps!
thag17.3:33.3	When the Buddha, endowed with all fine qualities,
thag17.3:33.4	became fully extinguished.”
thag17.3:34.1	“Ānanda, who was learned and had memorized the teaching,
thag17.3:34.2	a keeper of the great hermit’s treasury,
thag17.3:34.3	a visionary for the entire world,
thag17.3:34.4	has become fully quenched.
thag17.3:35.1	He was learned and had memorized the teaching,
thag17.3:35.2	a keeper of the great hermit’s treasury,
thag17.3:35.3	a visionary for the entire world,
thag17.3:35.4	in thick of night he dispelled the dark.
thag17.3:36.1	He is the hermit who remembered the teachings,
thag17.3:36.2	and mastered their sequence, holding them firm.
thag17.3:36.3	The senior monk who memorized the teaching,
thag17.3:36.4	Ānanda was a mine of gems.”
thag17.3:37.1	“I’ve served the teacher
thag17.3:37.2	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thag17.3:37.3	The heavy burden is laid down,
thag17.3:37.4	now there are no more future lives.”

thag18.1:0.3	Chapter One
thag18.1:0.4	18.1. Mahākassapa
thag18.1:1.1	“You shouldn’t live for the adulation of a following;
thag18.1:1.2	it turns your mind, making it hard to get immersion.
thag18.1:1.3	Seeing that popularity is suffering,
thag18.1:1.4	you shouldn’t consent to a following.
thag18.1:2.1	A sage should not visit respectable families;
thag18.1:2.2	it turns your mind, making it hard to get immersion.
thag18.1:2.3	If you’re eager and greedy for flavors,
thag18.1:2.4	you’ll miss the goal that brings such happiness.
thag18.1:3.1	They know it really is a bog,
thag18.1:3.2	this homage and veneration in respectable families.
thag18.1:3.3	Honor is a subtle dart, hard to extract,
thag18.1:3.4	and hard for a sinner to give up.”
thag18.1:4.1	“I came down from my lodging
thag18.1:4.2	and entered the city for alms.
thag18.1:4.3	I courteously stood by
thag18.1:4.4	while a leper ate.
thag18.1:5.1	With his putrid hand
thag18.1:5.2	he offered me a morsel.
thag18.1:5.3	Putting the morsel in my bowl,
thag18.1:5.4	his finger dropped off right there.
thag18.1:6.1	Sitting by a wall,
thag18.1:6.2	I ate that lump of rice.
thag18.1:6.3	I did not feel any disgust
thag18.1:6.4	while eating or afterwards.
thag18.1:7.1	Anyone who makes use of
thag18.1:7.2	leftovers for food,
thag18.1:7.3	fermented urine as medicine,
thag18.1:7.4	the root of a tree as lodging,
thag18.1:7.5	and cast-off rags as robes,
thag18.1:7.6	is at ease in any quarter.”
thag18.1:8.1	“Where some have fallen to ruin
thag18.1:8.2	while climbing the mountain,
thag18.1:8.3	there Kassapa ascends;
thag18.1:8.4	an heir of the Buddha,
thag18.1:8.5	aware and mindful,
thag18.1:8.6	owing to his psychic powers.
thag18.1:9.1	Returning from almsround,
thag18.1:9.2	Kassapa ascends the mountain,
thag18.1:9.3	and practices absorption without grasping,
thag18.1:9.4	with fear and dread given up.
thag18.1:10.1	Returning from almsround,
thag18.1:10.2	Kassapa ascends the mountain,
thag18.1:10.3	and practices absorption without grasping,
thag18.1:10.4	quenched amongst those who burn.
thag18.1:11.1	Returning from almsround,
thag18.1:11.2	Kassapa ascends the mountain,
thag18.1:11.3	and practices absorption without grasping,
thag18.1:11.4	his task completed, free of defilements.”
thag18.1:12.1	“Strewn with garlands of the musk-rose tree,

thag18.1:12.3	echoing with the trumpeting of elephants:
thag18.1:12.4	these rocky crags delight me!
thag18.1:13.1	Glistening, they look like blue storm clouds,
thag18.1:13.2	with waters cool and streams so clear,
thag18.1:13.3	and covered all in ladybugs:
thag18.1:13.4	these rocky crags delight me!
thag18.1:14.1	Like the peak of a blue storm cloud,
thag18.1:14.2	or like a fine bungalow, lovely,
thag18.1:14.3	echoing with the trumpeting of elephants:
thag18.1:14.4	these rocky crags delight me!
thag18.1:15.1	The rain comes down on the lovely flats,
thag18.1:15.2	in the mountains frequented by hermits.
thag18.1:15.3	Echoing with the cries of peacocks,
thag18.1:15.4	these rocky crags delight me!
thag18.1:16.1	It’s enough for me,
thag18.1:16.2	who loves absorption and is resolute, to be mindful.
thag18.1:16.3	It’s enough for me,
thag18.1:16.4	a resolute monk who loves the goal.
thag18.1:17.1	It’s enough for me,
thag18.1:17.2	a resolute monk who loves comfort.
thag18.1:17.3	It’s enough for me,
thag18.1:17.4	resolute and poised, loving meditation.
thag18.1:18.1	Covered with flowers of flax,
thag18.1:18.2	like the sky covered with clouds,
thag18.1:18.3	full of flocks of many different birds,
thag18.1:18.4	these rocky crags delight me!
thag18.1:19.1	Empty of householders,
thag18.1:19.2	frequented by herds of deer,

thag18.1:19.4	these rocky crags delight me!
thag18.1:20.1	The water’s clear and the rocks are broad,
thag18.1:20.2	monkeys and deer are all around;
thag18.1:20.3	festooned with dewy moss,
thag18.1:20.4	these rocky crags delight me!”
thag18.1:21.1	“Even the music of a five-piece band
thag18.1:21.2	can never give such pleasure
thag18.1:21.3	as when, with unified mind,
thag18.1:21.4	you rightly discern the Dhamma.”
thag18.1:22.1	“Don’t get involved in lots of work,
thag18.1:22.2	avoid people, and don’t try to acquire things.
thag18.1:22.3	If you’re eager and greedy for flavors,
thag18.1:22.4	you’ll miss the goal that brings such happiness.
thag18.1:23.1	Don’t get involved in lots of work,
thag18.1:23.2	avoid what doesn’t lead to the goal.
thag18.1:23.3	The body gets worn out and fatigued,
thag18.1:23.4	and when you ache, you won’t find serenity.”
thag18.1:24.1	“You won’t see yourself
thag18.1:24.2	by merely reciting words,
thag18.1:24.3	wandering stiff-necked
thag18.1:24.4	and thinking, ‘I’m better than them.’
thag18.1:25.1	The fool is no better,
thag18.1:25.2	but they think they are.
thag18.1:25.3	The wise don’t praise
thag18.1:25.4	stuck-up people.
thag18.1:26.1	Whoever is not affected
thag18.1:26.2	by the modes of conceit—
thag18.1:26.3	‘I am better’, ‘I’m not better’,
thag18.1:26.4	‘I am worse’, or ‘I am the same’—
thag18.1:27.1	with such understanding, poised,
thag18.1:27.2	steady in ethics,
thag18.1:27.3	and devoted to serenity of mind:
thag18.1:27.4	that is who the wise praise.”
thag18.1:28.1	“Whoever has no respect
thag18.1:28.2	for their spiritual companions
thag18.1:28.3	is as far from the true teaching
thag18.1:28.4	as the earth is from the sky.
thag18.1:29.1	Those whose conscience and shame
thag18.1:29.2	are always rightly established,
thag18.1:29.3	thrive in the spiritual life;
thag18.1:29.4	for them, there are no future lives.
thag18.1:30.1	When a mendicant who is haughty and fickle
thag18.1:30.2	wears rags from the rubbish-heap,
thag18.1:30.3	that doesn’t make them shine:
thag18.1:30.4	they’re like a monkey in a lion skin.
thag18.1:31.1	But if they are steady and stable,
thag18.1:31.2	alert, with senses restrained,
thag18.1:31.3	then, wearing rags from the rubbish-heap, they shine
thag18.1:31.4	like a lion in a mountain cave.”
thag18.1:32.1	“These many gods
thag18.1:32.2	powerful and glorious,
thag18.1:32.3	all 10,000 of them,
thag18.1:32.4	belong to the host of Brahmā.
thag18.1:33.1	They stand with joined palms
thag18.1:33.2	honoring Sāriputta,
thag18.1:33.3	the general of the Dhamma, the hero,
thag18.1:33.4	the serene great meditator:
thag18.1:34.1	‘Homage to you, O thoroughbred!
thag18.1:34.2	Homage to you, supreme among men!
thag18.1:34.3	We don’t understand
thag18.1:34.4	the basis of your absorption.
thag18.1:35.1	The profound domain of the Buddhas
thag18.1:35.2	is truly amazing.
thag18.1:35.3	We don’t understand,
thag18.1:35.4	though we’ve gathered here to split hairs.’
thag18.1:36.1	When he saw the host of gods
thag18.1:36.2	paying homage to Sāriputta—
thag18.1:36.3	who is truly worthy of homage—
thag18.1:36.4	Kappina smiled.”
thag18.1:37.1	“As far as the range of the Buddha extends,
thag18.1:37.2	I am outstanding in austerities.
thag18.1:37.3	I have no equal,
thag18.1:37.4	apart from the great sage himself.
thag18.1:38.1	I’ve served the teacher
thag18.1:38.2	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thag18.1:38.3	The heavy burden is laid down,
thag18.1:38.4	now there’ll be no more future lives.”
thag18.1:39.1	“Like a lotus flower
thag18.1:39.2	to which water will not stick,
thag18.1:39.3	Gotama the immeasurable is unstained
thag18.1:39.4	by robes, lodgings, or food.
thag18.1:39.5	He inclines to renunciation,
thag18.1:39.6	and has escaped the three states of existence.
thag18.1:40.1	The great sage’s neck is mindfulness meditation;
thag18.1:40.2	faith is his hands, and wisdom his head.
thag18.1:40.3	Having great knowledge,
thag18.1:40.4	he always wanders, quenched.”

thag19.1:0.3	Chapter One
thag19.1:0.4	Tālapuṭa
thag19.1:1.1	Oh, when will I stay in a mountain cave,
thag19.1:1.2	alone, with no companion,
thag19.1:1.3	discerning all states of existence as impermanent?
thag19.1:1.4	This hope of mine, when will it be?
thag19.1:2.1	Oh, when will I stay happily in the forest,
thag19.1:2.2	a sage wearing a torn robe, dressed in ocher,
thag19.1:2.3	unselfish, with no need for hope,
thag19.1:2.4	with greed, hate, and delusion destroyed?
thag19.1:3.1	Oh, when will I stay alone in the wood,
thag19.1:3.2	fearless, discerning this body as impermanent,
thag19.1:3.3	a nest of death and disease,
thag19.1:3.4	oppressed by death and old age; when will it be?
thag19.1:4.1	Oh, when will I live, having grasped the sharp sword of wisdom
thag19.1:4.2	and cut the creeper of craving that tangles around everything,
thag19.1:4.3	the mother of fear, the bringer of suffering?
thag19.1:4.4	When will it be?
thag19.1:5.1	Oh, when will I, seated on the lion’s throne,
thag19.1:5.2	swiftly grasp the sword of the sages,
thag19.1:5.3	forged by wisdom, of fiery might,
thag19.1:5.4	and swiftly break Māra and his army? When will it be?
thag19.1:6.1	Oh, when will I be seen striving in the assemblies
thag19.1:6.2	by those who are virtuous, poised, respecting the Dhamma,
thag19.1:6.3	seeing things as they are, with faculties subdued?
thag19.1:6.4	When will it be?
thag19.1:7.1	Oh, when will I focus on my own goal at the Mountainfold,
thag19.1:7.2	free of oppression by laziness, hunger, thirst,
thag19.1:7.3	wind, heat, insects, and reptiles?
thag19.1:7.4	When will it be?
thag19.1:8.1	Oh, when will I, serene and mindful,
thag19.1:8.2	understand the four truths,
thag19.1:8.3	that were realized by the great hermit,
thag19.1:8.4	and are so very hard to see? When will it be?
thag19.1:9.1	Oh, when will I, devoted to serenity,
thag19.1:9.2	see with understanding the infinite sights,
thag19.1:9.3	sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts
thag19.1:9.4	as burning? When will it be?
thag19.1:10.1	Oh, when will I not be distraught
thag19.1:10.2	because of criticism,
thag19.1:10.3	nor elated because of praise?
thag19.1:10.4	When will it be?
thag19.1:11.1	Oh when will I discern the aggregates
thag19.1:11.2	and the infinite varieties of phenomena,
thag19.1:11.3	both internal and external, as no more than
thag19.1:11.4	wood, grass, and creepers? When will it be?
thag19.1:12.1	Oh, when will the rain clouds in season
thag19.1:12.2	freshly wet me in my robe in the forest,
thag19.1:12.3	walking the path trodden by the sages?
thag19.1:12.4	When will it be?
thag19.1:13.1	Oh, when will I rise up, intent on attaining the deathless,
thag19.1:13.2	hearing, in the mountain cave,
thag19.1:13.3	the cry of the crested peacock in the forest?
thag19.1:13.4	When will it be?
thag19.1:14.1	Oh, when will I cross the Ganges, Yamunā,
thag19.1:14.2	and Sarasvatī rivers, the Pātāla country,
thag19.1:14.3	and the dangerous Baḷavāmukha sea,
thag19.1:14.4	by psychic power unimpeded? When will it be?
thag19.1:15.1	Oh, when will I be devoted to absorption,
thag19.1:15.2	rejecting entirely the signs of beauty,
thag19.1:15.3	splitting apart desire for sensual stimulation,
thag19.1:15.4	like an elephant that wanders free of ties? When will it be?
thag19.1:16.1	Oh, when will I realize the teaching of the great hermit
thag19.1:16.2	and be content, like a poor person in debt,
thag19.1:16.3	harassed by creditors, who finds a hidden treasure?
thag19.1:16.4	When will it be?
thag19.1:17.1	For many years you begged me,
thag19.1:17.2	“Enough of living in a house for you!”
thag19.1:17.3	Why do you not urge me on, mind,
thag19.1:17.4	now that I’ve gone forth as an ascetic?
thag19.1:18.1	Didn’t you entice me, mind:
thag19.1:18.2	“On the Mountainfold, the birds with colorful wings,
thag19.1:18.3	greeting the thunder, Mahinda’s voice,
thag19.1:18.4	will delight you as you meditate in the forest?”
thag19.1:19.1	'In my family circle, friends, loved ones, and relatives;
thag19.1:19.2	and in the world, sports and play, and sensual pleasures;
thag19.1:19.3	all these I gave up when I entered this life:
thag19.1:19.4	and even then you’re not content with me, mind!
thag19.1:20.1	This is mine alone, it doesn’t belong to others;
thag19.1:20.2	when it is time to don your armor, why lament?
thag19.1:20.3	Observing that all this is unstable,
thag19.1:20.4	I went forth, seeking the deathless state.
thag19.1:21.1	The methodical teacher, supreme among people,
thag19.1:21.2	great physician, guide for those who wish to train, said:
thag19.1:21.3	“The mind fidgets like a monkey,
thag19.1:21.4	so it’s very hard to control if you are not free of lust.”
thag19.1:22.1	Sensual pleasures are diverse, sweet, delightful;
thag19.1:22.2	an ignorant ordinary person is bound to them.
thag19.1:22.3	Seeking to be reborn again, they wish for suffering;
thag19.1:22.4	led on by their mind, they’re relegated to hell.
thag19.1:23.1	“Staying in the grove resounding with cries
thag19.1:23.2	of peacocks and herons, and adored by leopards and tigers,
thag19.1:23.3	abandon concern for the body, without fail!”
thag19.1:23.4	So you used to urge me, mind.
thag19.1:24.1	“Develop the absorptions and spiritual faculties,
thag19.1:24.2	the powers, awakening factors, and immersion;
thag19.1:24.3	realize the three knowledges in the teaching of the Buddha!”
thag19.1:24.4	So you used to urge me, mind.
thag19.1:25.1	“Develop the eightfold path for realizing the deathless,
thag19.1:25.2	emancipating, plunging into the end of all suffering,
thag19.1:25.3	and cleansing all defilements!”
thag19.1:25.4	So you used to urge me, mind.
thag19.1:26.1	“Reflect properly on the aggregates as suffering,
thag19.1:26.2	and abandon that from which suffering arises;
thag19.1:26.3	make an end of suffering in this very life!”
thag19.1:26.4	So you used to urge me, mind.
thag19.1:27.1	“Properly discern that impermanence is suffering,
thag19.1:27.2	that emptiness is non-self, and that misery is death.
thag19.1:27.3	Uproot the wandering mind!”
thag19.1:27.4	So you used to urge me, mind.
thag19.1:28.1	“Bald, unsightly, accursed,
thag19.1:28.2	seek alms amongst families, bowl in hand.
thag19.1:28.3	Devote yourself to the word of the teacher, the great hermit!”
thag19.1:28.4	So you used to urge me, mind.
thag19.1:29.1	“Wander the streets well-restrained,
thag19.1:29.2	unattached to families and sensual pleasures,
thag19.1:29.3	like the full moon on a bright night!”
thag19.1:29.4	So you used to urge me, mind.
thag19.1:30.1	“Be a wilderness-dweller and an alms-eater,
thag19.1:30.2	one who lives in charnel grounds, a rag-robe wearer,
thag19.1:30.3	one who never lies down, always delighting in ascetic practices.”
thag19.1:30.4	So you used to urge me, mind.
thag19.1:31.1	Mind, when you urge me to the impermanent and unstable,
thag19.1:31.2	you’re acting like someone who plants trees,
thag19.1:31.3	then, when they’re about to fruit,
thag19.1:31.4	wishes to cut down the very same trees.
thag19.1:32.1	Incorporeal mind, far-traveler, lone-wanderer:
thag19.1:32.2	I won’t do your bidding any more.
thag19.1:32.3	Sensual pleasures are suffering, painful, and very dangerous;
thag19.1:32.4	I’ll wander with my mind focused only on quenching.
thag19.1:33.1	I didn’t go forth due to bad luck or shamelessness,
thag19.1:33.2	or due to a whim or banishment,
thag19.1:33.3	nor for the sake of a livelihood;
thag19.1:33.4	it was because I agreed to the promise you made, mind.
thag19.1:34.1	“Having few wishes, abandoning disparagement,
thag19.1:34.2	the stilling of suffering: these are praised by good people.”
thag19.1:34.3	So you used to urge me, mind,
thag19.1:34.4	but now you keep on with your old habits!
thag19.1:35.1	Craving, ignorance, the loved and unloved,
thag19.1:35.2	pretty sights, pleasant feelings,
thag19.1:35.3	and the delightful kinds of sensual stimulation:
thag19.1:35.4	I’ve vomited them all, and I won’t swallow them back.
thag19.1:36.1	I’ve done your bidding everywhere, mind!
thag19.1:36.2	For many births, I’ve done nothing to upset you,
thag19.1:36.3	yet this self-made chain is your show of gratitude!
thag19.1:36.4	For a long time I’ve transmigrated in the suffering you’ve created.
thag19.1:37.1	Only you, mind, make a brahmin;
thag19.1:37.2	you make an aristocrat or a royal hermit.
thag19.1:37.3	Sometimes we become traders or workers;
thag19.1:37.4	and life as a god is also on account of you.
thag19.1:38.1	You alone make us demons;
thag19.1:38.2	because of you we’re born in hell.
thag19.1:38.3	Then sometimes we become animals,
thag19.1:38.4	and life as a ghost is also on account of you.
thag19.1:39.1	Come what may, you won’t betray me again,
thag19.1:39.2	dazzling me with your ever-changing display!
thag19.1:39.3	You play with me like I’m mad—
thag19.1:39.4	but how have I ever failed you, mind?
thag19.1:40.1	In the past my mind wandered
thag19.1:40.2	how it wished, where it liked, as it pleased.
thag19.1:40.3	Now I’ll carefully guide it,
thag19.1:40.4	as a trainer with a hook guides a rutting elephant.
thag19.1:41.1	The teacher willed that this world appear to me
thag19.1:41.2	as impermanent, unstable, insubstantial.
thag19.1:41.3	Mind, let me leap into the victor’s teaching,
thag19.1:41.4	carry me over the great flood, so hard to pass.
thag19.1:42.1	Things have changed, mind!
thag19.1:42.2	Nothing could make me return to your control!
thag19.1:42.3	I’ve gone forth in the teaching of the great hermit,
thag19.1:42.4	those like me don’t come to ruin.
thag19.1:43.1	Mountains, oceans, rivers, the earth;
thag19.1:43.2	the four directions, the intermediate directions, below and in the sky;
thag19.1:43.3	the three realms of existence are all impermanent and troubled—
thag19.1:43.4	where can you go to find happiness, mind?
thag19.1:44.1	Mind, what will you do to someone who has made the ultimate commitment?
thag19.1:44.2	Nothing could make me a follower under your control, mind;
thag19.1:44.3	there’s no way I’d touch a bellows with a mouth open at each end;
thag19.1:44.4	curse this mortal frame flowing with nine streams!
thag19.1:45.1	You’ve ascended the mountain peak, full of nature’s beauty,
thag19.1:45.2	frequented by boars and antelopes,
thag19.1:45.3	a grove sprinkled with fresh water in the rains;
thag19.1:45.4	and there you’ll be happy in your cave-home.
thag19.1:46.1	Peacocks with beautiful necks and crests,
thag19.1:46.2	colorful tail-feathers and wings,
thag19.1:46.3	crying out at the resounding thunder:
thag19.1:46.4	they’ll delight you as you meditate in the forest.
thag19.1:47.1	When the sky has rained down, and the grass is four inches high,
thag19.1:47.2	and the grove is full of flowers like a cloud,
thag19.1:47.3	in the mountain cleft, like the fork of a tree, I’ll lie;
thag19.1:47.4	it will be as soft as cotton-buds.
thag19.1:48.1	I’ll act as a master does:
thag19.1:48.2	let whatever I get be enough for me.
thag19.1:48.3	And that’s why I’ll make you as supple
thag19.1:48.4	as a tireless worker makes a cat-skin bag.
thag19.1:49.1	I’ll act as a master does:
thag19.1:49.2	let whatever I get be enough for me.
thag19.1:49.3	I’ll control you with my energy,
thag19.1:49.4	as a skilled trainer controls an elephant with a hook.
thag19.1:50.1	Now that you’re well-tamed and reliable,
thag19.1:50.2	I can use you, like a trainer uses a straight-running horse,
thag19.1:50.3	to practice the path so full of grace,
thag19.1:50.4	cultivated by those who take care of their minds.
thag19.1:51.1	I shall strongly fasten you to a meditation subject,
thag19.1:51.2	as an elephant is tied to a post with firm rope.
thag19.1:51.3	You’ll be well-guarded by me, well-developed by mindfulness,
thag19.1:51.4	and unattached to rebirth in all states of existence.
thag19.1:52.1	You’ll use understanding to cut the follower of the wrong path,
thag19.1:52.2	curb them by practice, and settle them on the right path.
thag19.1:52.3	And when you have seen the cause of suffering arise and pass away,
thag19.1:52.4	you’ll be an heir to the greatest teacher.
thag19.1:53.1	Under the sway of the four distortions, mind,
thag19.1:53.2	you dragged me around like a bull in a pit;
thag19.1:53.3	but now you won’t associate with the great sage of compassion,
thag19.1:53.4	the cutter of fetters and bonds?
thag19.1:54.1	Like a deer roaming free in the colorful forest,
thag19.1:54.2	I’ll ascend the lovely mountain wreathed in cloud,
thag19.1:54.3	and rejoice to be on that hill, free of folk—
thag19.1:54.4	there is no doubt you’ll perish, mind.
thag19.1:55.1	The men and women who live under your will and command,
thag19.1:55.2	whatever pleasure they experience,
thag19.1:55.3	they are ignorant and fall under Māra’s control;
thag19.1:55.4	loving life, they’re your disciples, mind.

thag2.11:1.2	when you’re learned, wisdom grows;
thag2.11:1.3	by wisdom, you know the goal;
thag2.11:1.4	knowing the goal brings happiness.
thag2.11:2.1	You should frequent remote lodgings
thag2.11:2.2	and practice to be released from fetters.
thag2.11:2.3	If you don’t find enjoyment there,
thag2.11:2.4	live in the Saṅgha, self-guarded and mindful.

thag2.12:1.1	People who act harshly—
thag2.12:1.2	attacking people,
thag2.12:1.3	tying them up,
thag2.12:1.4	hurting them in all kinds of ways—
thag2.12:1.5	they’re treated in the same way;
thag2.12:1.6	their deeds don’t vanish.
thag2.12:2.1	Whatever deeds a person does,
thag2.12:2.2	whether good or bad,
thag2.12:2.3	they are the heir to each
thag2.12:2.4	and every deed they do.

thag2.13:1.2	and then life is cut short.
thag2.13:1.3	The life of mortals wastes away,
thag2.13:1.4	like the water in tiny streams.
thag2.13:2.1	But while doing bad deeds

thag2.14:1.1	If you’re lost in the middle of a great sea,
thag2.14:1.2	and you clamber up on a little log, you’ll sink.
thag2.14:1.3	So too, a person who lives well
thag2.14:1.4	sinks by relying on a lazy person.
thag2.14:1.5	Hence you should avoid such
thag2.14:1.6	a lazy person who lacks energy.
thag2.14:2.1	Dwell with the noble ones
thag2.14:2.2	who are secluded and determined

thag2.15:1.3	people are hurt by people;
thag2.15:1.4	and people hurt people.
thag2.15:2.1	So what’s the point of people,

thag2.16:1.1	There’s a big black woman who looks like a crow.
thag2.16:1.2	She broke off thigh-bones, first one then another;
thag2.16:1.3	she broke off arm-bones, first one then another;
thag2.16:1.4	she broke off a skull like a curd-bowl, and then
thag2.16:1.5	arranged them and sat nearby.
thag2.16:2.1	When an ignorant person builds up attachments,

thag2.19:1.2	I was addicted to ornamentation.
thag2.19:1.3	I was vain, fickle,
thag2.19:1.4	racked by desire for pleasures of the senses.
thag2.19:2.1	But with the help of the Buddha,
thag2.19:2.2	the Kinsman of the Sun, so skilled in means,

thag2.1:1.4	and pass away, again and again.
thag2.1:2.1	Knowing this danger,
thag2.1:2.2	I don’t need another life.

thag2.41:1.4	such a teaching for themselves.
thag2.41:2.1	Through countless eons
thag2.41:2.2	they obtained individual identities.
thag2.41:2.3	This is their last,
thag2.41:2.4	their very final body
thag2.41:2.5	in the transmigration through births and deaths;
thag2.41:2.6	now there are no more future lives.

thag2.42:1.4	his life is not in vain.
thag2.42:2.1	So let the wise devote themselves

thag2.42:2.3	confidence, and insight into the teaching,
thag2.42:2.4	remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.

thag2.44:2.1	“I’ve heard that all the Magadhans

thag2.45:0.4	Visākhapañcālaputta
thag2.45:1.1	One should not suspend others from the Saṅgha, nor raise objections against them;
thag2.45:1.2	and neither disparage nor raise one’s voice against one who has crossed to the further shore.
thag2.45:1.3	One should not praise oneself among the assemblies,
thag2.45:1.4	but be stable, measured in speech, and true to your vows.
thag2.45:2.1	For one who sees the meaning so very subtle and fine,

thag2.46:2.2	going forth in the teaching of the Buddha is easy for a good person.

thag2.48:1.3	not seeing the noble truths,

thag20.1:1.2	happy with the scraps in our bowls,

thag20.1:1.4	while remaining serene within.
thag20.1:2.1	Living in the wilderness, eating only almsfood,

thag20.1:3.1	Living at the foot of a tree, persistent,

thag20.1:5.1	“You little hut, made of a chain of bones,
thag20.1:5.2	sewn together with flesh and sinew;
thag20.1:5.3	damn you mortal frame, you stink,
thag20.1:5.4	you cherish the parts of others!
thag20.1:6.1	You sack of dung wrapped up in skin!
thag20.1:6.2	You demoness with horns on your chest!
thag20.1:6.3	O body, you have nine streams
thag20.1:6.4	that are flowing all the time.
thag20.1:7.1	With its nine streams,
thag20.1:7.2	your body stinks, full of dung.
thag20.1:7.3	A monk seeking purity
thag20.1:7.4	would avoid it like excrement.
thag20.1:8.1	If they knew you
thag20.1:8.2	like I do,

thag20.1:11.3	Evil-minded one, don’t attack me,
thag20.1:11.4	you’ll end up like a moth in a bonfire.”

thag20.1:12.2	a body built of sores,

thag20.1:12.4	in which nothing lasts at all.
thag20.1:13.1	See this fancy figure,
thag20.1:13.2	with its gems and earrings;
thag20.1:13.3	it is bones wrapped in skin,
thag20.1:13.4	made pretty by its clothes.
thag20.1:14.1	Rouged feet
thag20.1:14.2	and powdered face
thag20.1:14.3	may be enough to beguile a fool,

thag20.1:15.1	Hair in eight braids
thag20.1:15.2	and eyeliner

thag20.1:16.1	A rotting body all adorned
thag20.1:16.2	like a freshly painted makeup box

thag20.1:17.1	The hunter laid his snare,
thag20.1:17.2	but the deer didn’t spring the trap.
thag20.1:17.3	I’ve eaten the bait and now I go,

thag20.1:18.3	I’ve eaten the bait and now I go,
thag20.1:18.4	leaving the deer-hunter to grieve.”
thag20.1:19.1	“Then there was terror!
thag20.1:19.2	Then they had goosebumps!
thag20.1:19.3	When Sāriputta, endowed with a multitude of attributes,
thag20.1:19.4	became quenched.
thag20.1:20.1	Oh! Conditions are impermanent,
thag20.1:20.2	their nature is to rise and fall;
thag20.1:20.3	having arisen, they cease;
thag20.1:20.4	their stilling is true bliss.”
thag20.1:21.1	“Those who see the five aggregates
thag20.1:21.2	as other, not as self,
thag20.1:21.3	penetrate a subtle thing,
thag20.1:21.4	like a hair-tip with an arrow.

thag20.1:22.2	as other, not as self,
thag20.1:22.3	pierce a fine thing,
thag20.1:22.4	like a hair-tip with an arrow.”
thag20.1:23.1	“Like they’re struck by a sword,
thag20.1:23.2	like their head was on fire,
thag20.1:23.3	a mendicant should wander mindful,
thag20.1:23.4	to give up sensual desire.
thag20.1:24.1	Like they’re struck by a sword,
thag20.1:24.2	like their head was on fire,
thag20.1:24.3	a mendicant should wander mindful,
thag20.1:24.4	to give up desire for rebirth.”
thag20.1:25.1	“Urged by the developed one,
thag20.1:25.2	who bore his final body,
thag20.1:25.3	I shook the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother
thag20.1:25.4	with my big toe.”
thag20.1:26.1	“Not by being slack,
thag20.1:26.2	or with little strength
thag20.1:26.3	is extinguishment realized,
thag20.1:26.4	the release from all ties.”
thag20.1:27.1	“This young monk,
thag20.1:27.2	this best of men,
thag20.1:27.3	bears his final body,
thag20.1:27.4	having vanquished Māra and his mount.”
thag20.1:28.1	“Lightning flashes down
thag20.1:28.2	on the cleft of Vebhāra and Paṇḍava.
thag20.1:28.3	But in the mountain cleft he is absorbed in jhāna—
thag20.1:28.4	the son of the Buddha, inimitable and poised.”
thag20.1:29.1	“Calm and quiet,
thag20.1:29.2	the sage in his remote lodging,
thag20.1:29.3	the heir to the best of Buddhas,
thag20.1:29.4	is honored even by Brahmā.
thag20.1:30.1	Calm and quiet,
thag20.1:30.2	the sage in his remote lodging,
thag20.1:30.3	is heir to the best of Buddhas:
thag20.1:30.4	Brahmin, you should honor Kassapa!
thag20.1:31.1	Even if someone were to be born again and again
thag20.1:31.2	a hundred times in the human realm,
thag20.1:31.3	and always as a brahmin,
thag20.1:31.4	a student accomplished in the Vedas;
thag20.1:32.1	and if he were to become a reciter,
thag20.1:32.2	a master of the three Vedas:
thag20.1:32.3	honoring such a person
thag20.1:32.4	isn’t worth a sixteenth of that.
thag20.1:33.1	One who attains the eight emancipations
thag20.1:33.2	forwards and backwards 
thag20.1:33.3	before breakfast,
thag20.1:33.4	and then goes on almsround—
thag20.1:34.1	don’t attack such a mendicant!
thag20.1:34.2	Don’t ruin yourself, brahmin!
thag20.1:34.3	Let your heart have trust
thag20.1:34.4	in the perfected one, the poised;
thag20.1:34.5	quickly venerate him with joined palms:
thag20.1:34.6	don’t let your head explode!”
thag20.1:35.1	“If you prioritize transmigration,
thag20.1:35.2	you don’t see the true teaching.
thag20.1:35.3	You’re following a twisted path,
thag20.1:35.4	a bad path that will lead you down.
thag20.1:36.1	Like a worm smeared with dung,
thag20.1:36.2	he is besotted with conditions.
thag20.1:36.3	Consumed by gain and honor,
thag20.1:36.4	Poṭṭhila goes on, hollow.”
thag20.1:37.1	“See Sāriputta coming!
thag20.1:37.2	It is good to see him;
thag20.1:37.3	he is freed in both ways,
thag20.1:37.4	serene inside himself;
thag20.1:38.1	free of thorns, with fetters ended,
thag20.1:38.2	master of the three knowledges, destroyer of death;
thag20.1:38.3	worthy of offerings,
thag20.1:38.4	a supreme field of merit for the people.”
thag20.1:39.1	“These many gods,
thag20.1:39.2	powerful and glorious,
thag20.1:39.3	all 10,000 of them,
thag20.1:39.4	are ministers of Brahmā.
thag20.1:39.5	They stand with joined palms
thag20.1:39.6	honoring Moggallāna:
thag20.1:40.1	‘Homage to you, O thoroughbred!
thag20.1:40.2	Homage to you, supreme among men!
thag20.1:40.3	Since your defilements are ended,
thag20.1:40.4	you, sir, are worthy of teacher’s offerings.”
thag20.1:41.1	“Venerated by men and gods,
thag20.1:41.2	he has arisen, the master of death.
thag20.1:41.3	He is unsmeared by conditions,
thag20.1:41.4	as a lotus-flower by water.
thag20.1:42.1	Knowing in an hour the thousand-fold world, together with the Brahmā realm;
thag20.1:42.2	master of psychic powers
thag20.1:42.3	and the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings;

thag20.1:43.1	“Sāriputta, the monk who has crossed over,
thag20.1:43.2	may be supreme
thag20.1:43.3	in respect of his wisdom,
thag20.1:43.4	ethics, and peace.
thag20.1:44.1	But in a moment I can create the likenesses
thag20.1:44.2	of ten million times 100,000 people!
thag20.1:44.3	I’m skilled in transformations;
thag20.1:44.4	I’m a master of physic powers.
thag20.1:45.1	A member of the Moggallāna clan, attained to perfection and mastery
thag20.1:45.2	in immersion and knowledge, wise in the teachings of the unattached,
thag20.1:45.3	with serene faculties, has burst his bonds
thag20.1:45.4	like an elephant bursts a vine.
thag20.1:46.1	I’ve served the teacher
thag20.1:46.2	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thag20.1:46.3	The heavy burden is laid down,
thag20.1:46.4	the attachment to rebirth is eradicated.
thag20.1:47.1	I’ve attained the goal
thag20.1:47.2	for the sake of which I went forth
thag20.1:47.3	from the lay life to homelessness—
thag20.1:47.4	the end of all fetters.”
thag20.1:48.1	“What kind of hell was that,
thag20.1:48.2	where Dūsī was roasted
thag20.1:48.3	after attacking the disciple Vidhura
thag20.1:48.4	along with the brahmin Kakusandha?
thag20.1:49.1	There were 100 iron spikes,
thag20.1:49.2	each one individually painful.

thag20.1:53.2	shook the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother
thag20.1:53.3	with his big toe
thag20.1:53.4	as the Saṅgha of mendicants watched.
thag20.1:54.1	Dark One, if you attack
thag20.1:54.2	a mendicant who directly knows this,
thag20.1:54.3	a disciple of the Buddha,
thag20.1:54.4	you’ll fall into suffering.
thag20.1:55.1	I’m the one who shook the Palace of Victory
thag20.1:55.2	with his big toe
thag20.1:55.3	owing to psychic power,
thag20.1:55.4	inspiring deities to awe.
thag20.1:56.1	Dark One, if you attack
thag20.1:56.2	a mendicant who directly knows this,
thag20.1:56.3	a disciple of the Buddha,
thag20.1:56.4	you’ll fall into suffering.
thag20.1:57.1	I’m the one who asked Sakka
thag20.1:57.2	in the Palace of Victory:
thag20.1:57.3	‘Sir, do you know the freedom
thag20.1:57.4	that comes with the ending of craving?’
thag20.1:57.5	And I’m the one to whom Sakka
thag20.1:57.6	admitted the truth when asked.
thag20.1:58.1	Dark One, if you attack
thag20.1:58.2	a mendicant who directly knows this,
thag20.1:58.3	a disciple of the Buddha,
thag20.1:58.4	you’ll fall into suffering.
thag20.1:59.1	I’m the one who asked Brahmā
thag20.1:59.2	in the Hall of Justice before the assembly:
thag20.1:59.3	‘Sir, do you still have the same view
thag20.1:59.4	that you had in the past?
thag20.1:59.5	Or do you see the radiance
thag20.1:59.6	transcending the Brahmā realm?’
thag20.1:60.1	And I’m the one to whom Brahmā
thag20.1:60.2	admitted the truth when asked.
thag20.1:60.3	‘Good sir, I don’t have that view
thag20.1:60.4	that I had in the past.
thag20.1:61.1	I see the radiance
thag20.1:61.2	transcending the Brahmā realm.
thag20.1:61.3	So how could I say today
thag20.1:61.4	that I am permanent and eternal?’
thag20.1:62.1	Dark One, if you attack
thag20.1:62.2	a mendicant who directly knows this,
thag20.1:62.3	a disciple of the Buddha,
thag20.1:62.4	you’ll fall into suffering.
thag20.1:63.1	I’m the one who has touched the peak of Mount Neru
thag20.1:63.2	using the power of meditative liberation.
thag20.1:63.3	I’ve visited the forests of the people
thag20.1:63.4	who dwell in the Eastern Continent.
thag20.1:64.1	Dark One, if you attack
thag20.1:64.2	a mendicant who directly knows this,
thag20.1:64.3	a disciple of the Buddha,
thag20.1:64.4	you’ll fall into suffering.
thag20.1:65.1	Though a fire doesn’t think:
thag20.1:65.2	‘I’ll burn the fool!’
thag20.1:65.3	Still the fool who attacks
thag20.1:65.4	the fire gets burnt.
thag20.1:66.1	In the same way, Māra,
thag20.1:66.2	in attacking the Realized One,
thag20.1:66.3	you’ll only burn yourself,
thag20.1:66.4	like a fool touching the flames.
thag20.1:67.1	Māra’s done a bad thing
thag20.1:67.2	in attacking the Realized One.
thag20.1:67.3	Wicked One, do you imagine that
thag20.1:67.4	your wickedness won’t bear fruit?
thag20.1:68.1	Your deeds heap up wickedness
thag20.1:68.2	that will last a long time, Terminator!
thag20.1:68.3	Forget about the Buddha, Māra!
thag20.1:68.4	And give up your hopes for the mendicants!”
thag20.1:69.1	“That is how, in the Bhesekaḷā grove,
thag20.1:69.2	the mendicant rebuked Māra.
thag20.1:69.3	That spirit, downcast,
thag20.1:69.4	disappeared right there!”
thag20.1:69.5	That is how these verses were recited by the senior venerable Mahāmoggallāna.
thag21.1:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag21.1:0.2	The Great Book
thag21.1:0.3	Chapter One
thag21.1:0.4	Vaṅgīsa
thag21.1:1.1	“Now that I’ve gone forth
thag21.1:1.2	from the lay life to homelessness,
thag21.1:1.3	I’m overrun
thag21.1:1.4	by the rude thoughts of the Dark One.
thag21.1:2.1	Even if a thousand mighty princes and great archers,
thag21.1:2.2	well trained, with strong bows,
thag21.1:2.3	were to completely surround me;
thag21.1:2.4	I would never flee.
thag21.1:3.1	And even if women come,
thag21.1:3.2	many more than that,
thag21.1:3.3	they won’t scare me,
thag21.1:3.4	for I stand firm in the teaching.
thag21.1:4.1	I heard this with my own ears
thag21.1:4.2	from the Buddha, Kinsman of the Sun,
thag21.1:4.3	about the path going to extinguishment;
thag21.1:4.4	that’s what delights my mind.
thag21.1:5.1	Wicked One, if you come near me
thag21.1:5.2	as I meditate like this,
thag21.1:5.3	I’ll make sure that you, Death,
thag21.1:5.4	won’t even see the path I take.”
thag21.1:6.1	“Giving up discontent and desire,
thag21.1:6.2	along with all thoughts of the lay life,
thag21.1:6.3	they wouldn’t get entangled in anything;
thag21.1:6.4	unentangled, disentangled: that’s a real mendicant.
thag21.1:7.1	Whether on this earth or in the sky,
thag21.1:7.2	whatever in the world is included in form
thag21.1:7.3	wears out, it is all impermanent;
thag21.1:7.4	the thoughtful live having comprehended this truth.
thag21.1:8.1	People are bound to their attachments,
thag21.1:8.2	to what is seen, heard, felt, and thought.
thag21.1:8.3	Unstirred, dispel desire for these things;
thag21.1:8.4	for one called ‘a sage’ does not cling to them.
thag21.1:9.1	Attached to the sixty wrong views, and full of their own opinions,
thag21.1:9.2	ordinary people are fixed in wrong principles.
thag21.1:9.3	But that mendicant wouldn’t join a sectarian group,
thag21.1:9.4	still less would they utter lewd speech.
thag21.1:10.1	Clever, long serene,
thag21.1:10.2	free of deceit, alert, without envy,
thag21.1:10.3	the sage has reached the state of peace;
thag21.1:10.4	and because he’s extinguished, he bides his time.”
thag21.1:11.1	“Give up conceit, Gotama!
thag21.1:11.2	Completely abandon the different kinds of conceit!
thag21.1:11.3	Besotted with the different kinds of conceit,
thag21.1:11.4	you’ve had regrets for a long time.
thag21.1:12.1	Smeared by smears and slain by conceit,
thag21.1:12.2	people fall into hell.
thag21.1:12.3	When people slain by conceit are reborn in hell,
thag21.1:12.4	they grieve for a long time.
thag21.1:13.1	But a mendicant who practices rightly,
thag21.1:13.2	winner of the path, never grieves.
thag21.1:13.3	They enjoy happiness and a good reputation,
thag21.1:13.4	and they rightly call him a ‘Seer of Truth’.
thag21.1:14.1	So don’t be hard-hearted, be energetic,
thag21.1:14.2	with hindrances given up, be pure.
thag21.1:14.3	Then with conceit given up completely,
thag21.1:14.4	use knowledge to make an end, and be at peace.”
thag21.1:15.1	“I’ve got a burning desire for pleasure;
thag21.1:15.2	my mind is on fire!
thag21.1:15.3	Please, out of compassion, Gotama,
thag21.1:15.4	tell me how to quench the flames.”
thag21.1:16.1	“Your mind is on fire
thag21.1:16.2	because of a perversion of perception.
thag21.1:16.3	Turn away from the feature of things
thag21.1:16.4	that’s attractive, provoking lust.
thag21.1:17.1	With your mind unified and serene,
thag21.1:17.2	meditate on the ugly aspects of the body.
thag21.1:17.3	With mindfulness immersed in the body,
thag21.1:17.4	be full of disillusionment.
thag21.1:18.1	Meditate on the signless,
thag21.1:18.2	give up the tendency to conceit;
thag21.1:18.3	and when you comprehend conceit,
thag21.1:18.4	you will live at peace.”
thag21.1:19.1	“Speak only such words
thag21.1:19.2	that do not hurt yourself
thag21.1:19.3	nor harm others;
thag21.1:19.4	such speech is truly well spoken.
thag21.1:20.1	Speak only pleasing words,
thag21.1:20.2	words gladly welcomed.
thag21.1:20.3	Pleasing words are those
thag21.1:20.4	that bring nothing bad to others.
thag21.1:21.1	Truth itself is the undying word:
thag21.1:21.2	this is an ancient principle.
thag21.1:21.3	Good people say that the teaching and its meaning
thag21.1:21.4	are grounded in the truth.
thag21.1:22.1	The words spoken by the Buddha
thag21.1:22.2	for realizing the sanctuary, extinguishment,
thag21.1:22.3	for making an end of suffering:
thag21.1:22.4	this really is the best kind of speech.”
thag21.1:23.1	“Deep in wisdom, intelligent,
thag21.1:23.2	expert in the variety of paths;
thag21.1:23.3	Sāriputta, so greatly wise,
thag21.1:23.4	teaches Dhamma to the mendicants.
thag21.1:24.1	He teaches in brief,
thag21.1:24.2	or he speaks at length.
thag21.1:24.3	His call, like a myna bird,
thag21.1:24.4	overflows with inspiration.
thag21.1:25.1	While he teaches
thag21.1:25.2	the mendicants listen to his sweet voice,
thag21.1:25.3	sounding attractive,
thag21.1:25.4	clear and graceful.
thag21.1:25.5	They listen joyfully,
thag21.1:25.6	their hearts elated.”
thag21.1:26.1	“Today, on the fifteenth day sabbath,
thag21.1:26.2	five hundred monks have gathered together to purify their precepts.
thag21.1:26.3	These untroubled sages have cut off their fetters and bonds,
thag21.1:26.4	they will not be reborn again.
thag21.1:27.1	Just as a wheel-rolling monarch
thag21.1:27.2	surrounded by ministers
thag21.1:27.3	travels all around this
thag21.1:27.4	land that’s girt by sea.
thag21.1:28.1	So disciples with the three knowledges,
thag21.1:28.2	destroyers of death,
thag21.1:28.3	revere the winner of the battle,
thag21.1:28.4	the unsurpassed caravan leader.
thag21.1:29.1	All are sons of the Blessed One—
thag21.1:29.2	there is no rubbish here.
thag21.1:29.3	I bow to the Kinsman of the Sun,
thag21.1:29.4	destroyer of the dart of craving.”
thag21.1:30.1	“Over a thousand mendicants
thag21.1:30.2	revere the Holy One
thag21.1:30.3	as he teaches the immaculate Dhamma,
thag21.1:30.4	extinguishment, fearing nothing from any quarter.
thag21.1:31.1	They listen to the immaculate Dhamma
thag21.1:31.2	taught by the fully awakened Buddha;
thag21.1:31.3	the Buddha is so brilliant,
thag21.1:31.4	at the fore of the mendicant Saṅgha.
thag21.1:32.1	Blessed One, your name is ‘Giant’,
thag21.1:32.2	seventh of the sages.
thag21.1:32.3	You are like a great cloud
thag21.1:32.4	that rains on your disciples.
thag21.1:33.1	I’ve left my day’s meditation,
thag21.1:33.2	out of desire to see the teacher.
thag21.1:33.3	Great hero, your disciple Vaṅgīsa
thag21.1:33.4	bows at your feet.”
thag21.1:34.1	“Having overcome Māra’s devious path,
thag21.1:34.2	he wanders with hard-heartedness dissolved.
thag21.1:34.3	See him, the liberator from bonds, unattached,
thag21.1:34.4	analyzing the teaching.
thag21.1:35.1	He has explained in many ways
thag21.1:35.2	the path to cross the flood.
thag21.1:35.3	The Seers of Truth stand unfaltering
thag21.1:35.4	in the deathless he has explained.
thag21.1:36.1	The bringer of light who has pierced the truth,
thag21.1:36.2	he has seen what lies beyond all states of being.
thag21.1:36.3	When you saw and realized this for yourself,
thag21.1:36.4	you taught it first to the group of five.
thag21.1:37.1	When the Dhamma has been so well taught,
thag21.1:37.2	how could those who know it be negligent?
thag21.1:37.3	So being diligent, we should always respectfully train
thag21.1:37.4	in the Buddha’s teaching.”
thag21.1:38.1	“The senior monk who was awakened right after the Buddha,
thag21.1:38.2	Koṇḍañña, is keenly energetic.
thag21.1:38.3	He regularly gains blissful meditative states,
thag21.1:38.4	and the three kinds of seclusion.
thag21.1:39.1	Whatever can be attained by a disciple
thag21.1:39.2	who does the Teacher’s bidding,
thag21.1:39.3	he has attained it all,
thag21.1:39.4	through diligently training himself.
thag21.1:40.1	With great power and the three knowledges,
thag21.1:40.2	expert in comprehending the minds of others,
thag21.1:40.3	Koṇḍañña, the heir to the Buddha,
thag21.1:40.4	bows at the Teacher’s feet.”
thag21.1:41.1	“As the sage, who has gone beyond suffering,
thag21.1:41.2	sits upon the mountain slope,
thag21.1:41.3	he is revered by disciples with the three knowledges,
thag21.1:41.4	destroyers of death.
thag21.1:42.1	Moggallāna, of great psychic power,
thag21.1:42.2	comprehends with his mind,
thag21.1:42.3	scrutinizing their minds,
thag21.1:42.4	liberated, free of attachments.
thag21.1:43.1	So they revere Gotama,
thag21.1:43.2	the sage gone beyond suffering,
thag21.1:43.3	who is endowed with all path factors,
thag21.1:43.4	and with a multitude of attributes.”
thag21.1:44.1	“Like the moon on a cloudless night,
thag21.1:44.2	like the shining immaculate sun,
thag21.1:44.3	so too Aṅgīrasa, O great sage,
thag21.1:44.4	your glory outshines the entire world.”
thag21.1:45.1	“We used to wander, drunk on poetry,
thag21.1:45.2	from village to village, town to town.
thag21.1:45.3	Then we saw the Buddha,
thag21.1:45.4	who has gone beyond all things.
thag21.1:46.1	He, the sage gone beyond suffering,
thag21.1:46.2	taught me the Dhamma.
thag21.1:46.3	When we heard the Dhamma, we became confident—
thag21.1:46.4	faith arose in us.
thag21.1:47.1	Hearing him speak of
thag21.1:47.2	the aggregates, the sense-fields,
thag21.1:47.3	and the elements, I understood;
thag21.1:47.4	and then I went forth to homelessness.
thag21.1:48.1	It is for the benefit of many
thag21.1:48.2	that the Realized Ones arise—
thag21.1:48.3	the men and women
thag21.1:48.4	who follow their instructions.
thag21.1:49.1	It is truly for their benefit
thag21.1:49.2	that the sage realized awakening—
thag21.1:49.3	for the monks and for the nuns
thag21.1:49.4	who see that they’ve reached certainty.
thag21.1:50.1	The seer, the Buddha,
thag21.1:50.2	the Kinsman of the Sun,
thag21.1:50.3	has well taught the four noble truths
thag21.1:50.4	out of compassion for living creatures.
thag21.1:51.1	Suffering, suffering’s origin,
thag21.1:51.2	suffering’s transcendence,
thag21.1:51.3	and the noble eightfold path
thag21.1:51.4	that leads to the stilling of suffering.
thag21.1:52.1	As these things were taught,
thag21.1:52.2	so I have seen them.
thag21.1:52.3	I’ve realized my own true goal,
thag21.1:52.4	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thag21.1:53.1	It was so welcome for me
thag21.1:53.2	to be in the presence of the Buddha.
thag21.1:53.3	Of things which are shared,
thag21.1:53.4	I encountered the best.
thag21.1:54.1	I’ve realized the perfection of direct knowledge;
thag21.1:54.2	my clairaudience is purified;
thag21.1:54.3	I am master of three knowledges, attained in psychic power,
thag21.1:54.4	I’m expert at reading the minds of others.”
thag21.1:55.1	“I ask the teacher unrivaled in wisdom,
thag21.1:55.2	who has cut off all doubts in this very life—
thag21.1:55.3	has a monk died at Aggāḷava, who was
thag21.1:55.4	well-known, famous, and quenched?
thag21.1:56.1	Nigrodhakappa was his name;
thag21.1:56.2	it was given to that brahmin by you, Blessed One.
thag21.1:56.3	He wandered in your honor, yearning for freedom, 
thag21.1:56.4	energetic, a resolute Seer of Truth.
thag21.1:57.1	O Sakyan, all-seer,
thag21.1:57.2	all of us wish to know about that disciple.
thag21.1:57.3	Our ears are eager to hear,
thag21.1:57.4	for you are truly the most excellent teacher.
thag21.1:58.1	Cut off our doubt, declare this to us;
thag21.1:58.2	your wisdom is vast, tell us of his quenching!
thag21.1:58.3	All-seer, speak among us,
thag21.1:58.4	like the thousand-eyed Sakka in the midst of the gods!
thag21.1:59.1	Whatever ties there are, or paths to delusion,
thag21.1:59.2	or things on the side of unknowing, or that are bases of doubt
thag21.1:59.3	vanish on reaching a Realized One, 
thag21.1:59.4	for his eye is the best of all people’s.
thag21.1:60.1	For if no man were ever to disperse corruptions,
thag21.1:60.2	like the wind dispersing a mass of clouds,
thag21.1:60.3	darkness would shroud the whole world;
thag21.1:60.4	not even brilliant men would shine.
thag21.1:61.1	The wise are makers of light;
thag21.1:61.2	my hero, that is what I think of you.
thag21.1:61.3	We’ve come to you for your discernment and knowledge:
thag21.1:61.4	here in this assembly, declare to us about Kappāyana.
thag21.1:62.1	Swiftly send forth your graceful voice,
thag21.1:62.2	like a goose stretching its neck, gently honking,
thag21.1:62.3	smooth in sound, with a lovely tone:
thag21.1:62.4	alert, we are all listening to you.
thag21.1:63.1	You have entirely abandoned birth and death;
thag21.1:63.2	restrained and pure, speak the Dhamma!
thag21.1:63.3	For ordinary people have no wish-maker,
thag21.1:63.4	but Realized Ones have a comprehensibility-maker.
thag21.1:64.1	Your answer is definitive, and we will adopt it,
thag21.1:64.2	for you have perfect understanding.
thag21.1:64.3	We raise our joined palms one last time,
thag21.1:64.4	one of unrivaled wisdom, don’t deliberately confuse us.
thag21.1:65.1	Knowing the teaching of the noble ones from top to bottom,
thag21.1:65.2	one of unrivaled energy, don’t deliberately confuse us.
thag21.1:65.3	Like a man in the baking summer sun would long for water,
thag21.1:65.4	I long for your voice, so let the sound rain down.
thag21.1:66.1	Surely Kappāyana did not lead the spiritual life in vain?
thag21.1:66.2	Did he realize quenching,
thag21.1:66.3	or did he still have a remnant of defilement?
thag21.1:66.4	Let us hear what kind of liberation he had!”
thag21.1:67.1	“He cut off craving for mind and body in this very life,”
thag21.1:67.2	said the Buddha,
thag21.1:67.3	“The river of darkness that had long lain within him.
thag21.1:67.4	He has entirely crossed over birth and death.”
thag21.1:67.5	So declared the Blessed One, the leader of the five.
thag21.1:68.1	“Now that I have heard your words,
thag21.1:68.2	seventh of sages, I am confident.
thag21.1:68.3	My question, it seems, was not in vain,
thag21.1:68.4	the brahmin did not deceive me.
thag21.1:69.1	As he spoke, so he acted;
thag21.1:69.2	he was a disciple of the Buddha.
thag21.1:69.3	He cut the net of death the deceiver,
thag21.1:69.4	so extended and strong.
thag21.1:70.1	Blessed One, Kappāyana saw
thag21.1:70.2	the starting point of grasping.
thag21.1:70.3	He has indeed gone far beyond
thag21.1:70.4	Death’s domain so hard to pass.
thag21.1:71.1	God of gods, best of men, I bow to you,
thag21.1:71.2	and to your son,
thag21.1:71.3	who followed your example, a great hero;
thag21.1:71.4	a giant, rightful son of a giant.”
thag21.1:71.5	That is how these verses were recited by the senior venerable Vaṅgīsa.

thag3.10:0.2	The Book of the Threes
thag3.10:0.3	Chapter One
thag3.10:0.4	Sāṭimattiya
thag3.10:1.1	In the past you had faith,
thag3.10:1.2	today you have none.
thag3.10:1.3	What’s yours is yours alone—
thag3.10:1.4	I’ve done nothing wrong.
thag3.10:2.1	Faith is impermanent, fickle:
thag3.10:2.2	or so I have seen.
thag3.10:2.3	Passions wax and wane:
thag3.10:2.4	why would a sage waste away on that account?
thag3.10:3.1	The meal of a sage is cooked
thag3.10:3.2	bit by bit in this family or that.
thag3.10:3.3	I’ll walk for alms,
thag3.10:3.4	for my legs are strong.
thag3.11:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag3.11:0.2	The Book of the Threes
thag3.11:0.3	Chapter One
thag3.11:0.4	Upāli
thag3.11:1.1	One newly gone forth,
thag3.11:1.2	who has left their home out of faith,
thag3.11:1.3	should mix with spiritual friends,
thag3.11:1.4	who are tireless and pure of livelihood.
thag3.11:2.1	One newly gone forth,
thag3.11:2.2	who has left their home out of faith,
thag3.11:2.3	a mendicant staying in the Saṅgha,
thag3.11:2.4	being wise, would train in monastic discipline.
thag3.11:3.1	One newly gone forth,
thag3.11:3.2	who has left their home out of faith,
thag3.11:3.3	skilled in what is appropriate and what is not,
thag3.11:3.4	would wander undistracted.
thag3.12:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag3.12:0.2	The Book of the Threes
thag3.12:0.3	Chapter One
thag3.12:0.4	Uttarapāla
thag3.12:1.1	I was, indeed, an astute scholar,
thag3.12:1.2	competent to think on the meaning.
thag3.12:1.3	The five kinds of sensual stimulation in the world,
thag3.12:1.4	so delusory, were my downfall.
thag3.12:2.1	Leaping into Māra’s domain,
thag3.12:2.2	I was struck by a powerful dart.
thag3.12:2.3	But I was able to free myself
thag3.12:2.4	from the trap laid by the King of Death.
thag3.12:3.1	I have given up all sensual pleasures;
thag3.12:3.2	all rebirths are shattered;
thag3.12:3.3	transmigration through births is finished;
thag3.12:3.4	now there are no more future lives.

thag3.13:0.2	The Book of the Threes
thag3.13:0.3	Chapter One
thag3.13:0.4	Abhibhūta
thag3.13:1.1	Listen up, all my relatives,
thag3.13:1.2	those who have gathered here:
thag3.13:1.3	I’ll teach you Dhamma!
thag3.13:1.4	Painful is birth again and again.
thag3.13:2.1	Rouse yourselves, try harder!
thag3.13:2.2	Devote yourselves to the instructions of the Buddha!
thag3.13:2.3	Crush the army of death,
thag3.13:2.4	as an elephant a hut of reeds.
thag3.13:3.1	Anyone who meditates diligently
thag3.13:3.2	in this teaching and training,
thag3.13:3.3	giving up transmigration,
thag3.13:3.4	will make an end to suffering.
thag3.14:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag3.14:0.2	The Book of the Threes
thag3.14:0.3	Chapter One
thag3.14:0.4	Gotama (2nd)
thag3.14:1.1	Transmigrating, I went to hell,
thag3.14:1.2	and to the ghost realm time and again.
thag3.14:1.3	Many times I dwelt long
thag3.14:1.4	in the animal realm, so full of pain.
thag3.14:2.1	I was also reborn as a human,
thag3.14:2.2	and from time to time I went to heaven.
thag3.14:2.3	I’ve stayed in realms of form and formlessness,
thag3.14:2.4	among the neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient, and the non-percipient.
thag3.14:3.1	I know well these states of existence are worthless—
thag3.14:3.2	conditioned, unstable, always in motion.
thag3.14:3.3	When I understood this self-made chain,
thag3.14:3.4	mindful, I found peace.
thag3.15:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag3.15:0.2	The Book of the Threes
thag3.15:0.3	Chapter One
thag3.15:0.4	Hārita (2nd)
thag3.15:1.1	Whoever wishes to do afterwards
thag3.15:1.2	what they should have done before
thag3.15:1.3	has lost the causes for happiness,
thag3.15:1.4	and afterwards they’re tormented by regrets.
thag3.15:2.1	You should only say what you would do;
thag3.15:2.2	you shouldn’t say what you wouldn’t do.
thag3.15:2.3	The wise will recognize
thag3.15:2.4	one who talks without doing.
thag3.15:3.1	Oh! Extinguishment is so very blissful,
thag3.15:3.2	as taught by the fully awakened Buddha:
thag3.15:3.3	sorrowless, stainless, secure,
thag3.15:3.4	where suffering all ceases.

thag3.16:0.3	Chapter One
thag3.16:0.4	Vimala (2nd)
thag3.16:1.1	Shunning bad friends,
thag3.16:1.2	associate with the best of people.
thag3.16:1.3	Stick to the advice he gave you,
thag3.16:1.4	aspiring to unshakable happiness.
thag3.16:2.1	If you’re lost in the middle of a great sea,
thag3.16:2.2	and you clamber up on a little log, you’ll sink.
thag3.16:2.3	So too, a person who lives well
thag3.16:2.4	sinks by relying on a lazy person.
thag3.16:2.5	Hence you should avoid such
thag3.16:2.6	a lazy person who lacks energy.
thag3.16:3.1	Dwell with the noble ones
thag3.16:3.2	who are secluded and determined
thag3.16:3.3	and always energetic;
thag3.16:3.4	the astute who practice absorption.

thag3.1:0.3	Chapter One
thag3.1:0.4	Aṅgaṇikabhāradvāja
thag3.1:1.1	Seeking purity the wrong way,
thag3.1:1.2	I served the sacred fire in a grove.
thag3.1:1.3	Not knowing the path to purity,
thag3.1:1.4	I mortified my flesh in search of immortality.
thag3.1:2.1	I’ve gained this happiness by means of happiness:
thag3.1:2.2	see the excellence of the teaching!
thag3.1:2.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges
thag3.1:2.4	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thag3.1:3.1	In the past I was related to Brahmā,
thag3.1:3.2	but now I really am a brahmin!
thag3.1:3.3	I am master of the three knowledges, I’m a bathed initiate,
thag3.1:3.4	I’m a scholar and a knowledge master.

thag3.2:0.3	Chapter One
thag3.2:0.4	Paccaya
thag3.2:1.1	I went forth five days ago,
thag3.2:1.2	a trainee, my heart’s desire unfulfilled.
thag3.2:1.3	I entered my dwelling
thag3.2:1.4	and resolved in my heart:
thag3.2:2.1	I won’t eat; I won’t drink;
thag3.2:2.2	I won’t leave my dwelling;
thag3.2:2.3	nor will I lie down on my side—
thag3.2:2.4	not until the dart of craving is plucked.
thag3.2:3.1	See my energy and vigor
thag3.2:3.2	as I meditate like this!
thag3.2:3.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges
thag3.2:3.4	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

thag3.3:1.1	Whoever wishes to do afterwards
thag3.3:1.2	what they should have done before
thag3.3:1.3	has lost the causes for happiness,
thag3.3:1.4	and afterwards they’re tormented by regrets.
thag3.3:2.1	You should only say what you would do;
thag3.3:2.2	you shouldn’t say what you wouldn’t do.
thag3.3:2.3	The wise will recognize

thag3.4:0.4	Dhaniya
thag3.4:1.1	If you wish to live in happiness,
thag3.4:1.2	longing for the ascetic life,
thag3.4:1.3	don’t look down on the Saṅgha’s robes,
thag3.4:1.4	or its food and drinks.
thag3.4:2.1	If you wish to live in happiness,
thag3.4:2.2	longing for the ascetic life,
thag3.4:2.3	stay in the Saṅgha’s lodgings
thag3.4:2.4	like a snake making use of a mouse’s hole.
thag3.4:3.1	If you wish to live in happiness,
thag3.4:3.2	longing for the ascetic life,
thag3.4:3.3	develop this one quality:
thag3.4:3.4	be content with whatever is offered.
thag3.5:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag3.5:0.2	The Book of the Threes
thag3.5:0.3	Chapter One
thag3.5:0.4	Mātaṅgaputta
thag3.5:1.1	“It’s too cold, too hot,
thag3.5:1.2	too late,” they say.
thag3.5:1.3	When the young neglect their work like this,
thag3.5:1.4	opportunities pass them by.
thag3.5:2.1	But one who considers heat and cold
thag3.5:2.2	as nothing more than blades of grass—
thag3.5:2.3	he does his duties as a man, 
thag3.5:2.4	and his happiness never fails.
thag3.5:3.1	With my chest I’ll thrust aside
thag3.5:3.2	the grasses, vines, and creepers,
thag3.5:3.3	and foster seclusion.
thag3.6:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag3.6:0.2	The Book of the Threes
thag3.6:0.3	Chapter One
thag3.6:0.4	Khujjasobhita
thag3.6:1.1	“One of those monks who live in Pāṭaliputta—
thag3.6:1.2	such brilliant speakers, and very learned—
thag3.6:1.3	stands at the door:
thag3.6:1.4	the old man, Khujjasobhita.
thag3.6:2.1	One of those monks who live in Pāṭaliputta—
thag3.6:2.2	such brilliant speakers, and very learned—
thag3.6:2.3	stands at the door:
thag3.6:2.4	an old man, trembling in the wind.”
thag3.6:3.1	“By war well fought, by sacrifice well made,
thag3.6:3.2	by victory in battle;
thag3.6:3.3	by leading the spiritual life:
thag3.6:3.4	that’s how one prospers in happiness.”
thag3.7:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag3.7:0.2	The Book of the Threes
thag3.7:0.3	Chapter One
thag3.7:0.4	Vāraṇa
thag3.7:1.1	Anyone among men
thag3.7:1.2	who harms other creatures:
thag3.7:1.3	that person will fall
thag3.7:1.4	both from this world and the next.
thag3.7:2.1	But someone with a mind of love,
thag3.7:2.2	compassionate for all creatures:
thag3.7:2.3	a person like that
thag3.7:2.4	makes much merit.
thag3.7:3.1	One should train in following good advice,
thag3.7:3.2	in attending closely to ascetics,
thag3.7:3.3	in sitting alone in hidden places,
thag3.7:3.4	and in calming the mind.
thag3.8:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag3.8:0.2	The Book of the Threes
thag3.8:0.3	Chapter One
thag3.8:0.4	Vassika
thag3.8:1.1	I was the only one in my family
thag3.8:1.2	who had faith and wisdom.
thag3.8:1.3	It’s good for my relatives that I’m
thag3.8:1.4	firm in principle, and ethical.
thag3.8:2.1	I corrected my family out of compassion,
thag3.8:2.2	telling them off out of love
thag3.8:2.3	for my family and relatives.
thag3.8:2.4	They performed a service for the monks
thag3.8:3.1	and then they passed away,
thag3.8:3.2	finding happiness in the heaven of the Thirty-three.
thag3.8:3.3	There, my brothers and mother
thag3.8:3.4	enjoy all the pleasures they desire.

thag3.9:0.3	Chapter One
thag3.9:0.4	Yasoja
thag3.9:1.1	“With knobbly knees,
thag3.9:1.2	thin and veiny,
thag3.9:1.3	eating and drinking but little—
thag3.9:1.4	this person’s spirit is undaunted.”
thag3.9:2.1	“Pestered by flies and mosquitoes
thag3.9:2.2	in the wilds, the formidable forest,
thag3.9:2.3	one should mindfully endure,
thag3.9:2.4	like an elephant at the head of the battle.
thag3.9:3.1	A monk alone is like the supreme Brahmā;
thag3.9:3.2	a pair of monks are like gods;
thag3.9:3.3	three are like a village;
thag3.9:3.4	and more than that is a rabble.”
thag4.10:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag4.10:0.2	The Book of the Fours
thag4.10:0.3	Chapter One
thag4.10:0.4	Dhammika
thag4.10:1.1	“Dhamma surely protects one who practices Dhamma;
thag4.10:1.2	the teaching brings happiness when practiced well.
thag4.10:1.3	This is the benefit of practicing Dhamma:
thag4.10:1.4	one doesn’t go to a bad destination.
thag4.10:2.1	It’s not the case that Dhamma and what is not Dhamma
thag4.10:2.2	lead to the same results.
thag4.10:2.3	What is not Dhamma leads to hell,
thag4.10:2.4	while Dhamma takes you to a good place.
thag4.10:3.1	So you should rouse up enthusiasm for the teachings;
thag4.10:3.2	such rejoicing is owing to the Holy One, the poised.
thag4.10:3.3	The disciples of the best of Holy Ones are firm in the teaching;
thag4.10:3.4	those wise ones are led on, headed to the very best of refuges.”
thag4.10:4.1	“The boil has been burst from its root,
thag4.10:4.2	the net of craving is eradicated.
thag4.10:4.3	He has ended transmigration, he has nothing,
thag4.10:4.4	he’s like the full moon on a bright night.”
thag4.11:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag4.11:0.2	The Book of the Fours
thag4.11:0.3	Chapter One
thag4.11:0.4	Sappaka
thag4.11:1.1	When the crane with its beautiful white wings,
thag4.11:1.2	startled by fear of the dark thundercloud,
thag4.11:1.3	flees, seeking shelter—
thag4.11:1.4	then the River Ajakaraṇī delights me.
thag4.11:2.1	When the crane, so pure and white,
thag4.11:2.2	startled by fear of the dark thundercloud,
thag4.11:2.3	seeks a cave to shelter in, but can’t see one—
thag4.11:2.4	then the River Ajakaraṇī delights me.
thag4.11:3.1	Who wouldn’t be delighted
thag4.11:3.2	by the rose-apple trees
thag4.11:3.3	that adorn both banks of the river,
thag4.11:3.4	there, behind my cave?
thag4.11:4.1	Rid of snakes, that death-mad swarm,
thag4.11:4.2	the lazy frogs croak:
thag4.11:4.3	“Today isn’t the time to stray from mountain streams;
thag4.11:4.4	Ajakaraṇī is safe, pleasant, and delightful.”

thag4.12:0.2	The Book of the Fours
thag4.12:0.3	Chapter One
thag4.12:0.4	Mudita
thag4.12:1.1	I went forth to save my life.
thag4.12:1.2	But I embraced faith
thag4.12:1.3	after receiving full ordination.
thag4.12:1.4	I strove, strong in effort:
thag4.12:2.1	gladly, let this body be broken!
thag4.12:2.2	Let this lump of meat be dissolved!
thag4.12:2.3	Let both my legs fall off
thag4.12:2.4	at the knees!
thag4.12:3.1	I won’t eat, I won’t drink,
thag4.12:3.2	I won’t leave my dwelling,
thag4.12:3.3	nor will I lie down on my side,
thag4.12:3.4	until the dart of craving is plucked.
thag4.12:4.1	As I meditate like this,
thag4.12:4.2	see my energy and vigor!
thag4.12:4.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges
thag4.12:4.4	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thag4.1:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag4.1:0.2	The Book of the Fours
thag4.1:0.3	Chapter One
thag4.1:0.4	Nāgasamāla
thag4.1:1.1	Adorned with jewelry and all dressed up,
thag4.1:1.2	with garlands, and sandalwood makeup piled on,
thag4.1:1.3	along the main street is a lady—
thag4.1:1.4	a dancer dancing as the music plays.
thag4.1:2.1	I entered for alms,
thag4.1:2.2	and while walking along I glanced at her,
thag4.1:2.3	adorned with jewelry and all dressed up,
thag4.1:2.4	like a snare of death laid down.
thag4.1:3.1	Then the realization
thag4.1:3.2	came upon me—
thag4.1:3.3	the danger became clear,
thag4.1:3.4	and I grew firmly disillusioned.
thag4.1:4.1	Then my mind was freed—
thag4.1:4.2	see the excellence of the teaching!
thag4.1:4.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges
thag4.1:4.4	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thag4.2:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag4.2:0.2	The Book of the Fours
thag4.2:0.3	Chapter One
thag4.2:0.4	Bhagu
thag4.2:1.1	Overwhelmed by drowsiness,
thag4.2:1.2	I left my dwelling.
thag4.2:1.3	Stepping up to the path for walking meditation,
thag4.2:1.4	I fell to the ground right there.
thag4.2:2.1	I rubbed my limbs, and again
thag4.2:2.2	I stepped up on the path for walking meditation.
thag4.2:2.3	I walked meditation up and down the path,
thag4.2:2.4	serene inside myself.
thag4.2:3.1	Then the realization
thag4.2:3.2	came upon me—
thag4.2:3.3	the danger became clear,
thag4.2:3.4	and I grew firmly disillusioned.
thag4.2:4.1	Then my mind was freed—
thag4.2:4.2	see the excellence of the teaching!
thag4.2:4.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges,

thag4.3:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks
thag4.3:0.2	The Book of the Fours
thag4.3:0.3	Chapter One
thag4.3:0.4	Sabhiya
thag4.3:1.1	Others don’t understand
thag4.3:1.2	that we need restraint in this.
thag4.3:1.3	But those who do understand this,
thag4.3:1.4	being clever, settle their conflicts.
thag4.3:2.1	And when those who don’t understand
thag4.3:2.2	behave as though they were immortal,
thag4.3:2.3	those who understand the Dhamma
thag4.3:2.4	are like the healthy among the sick.
thag4.3:3.1	Any lax act,
thag4.3:3.2	any corrupt observance,
thag4.3:3.3	or suspicious spiritual life,
thag4.3:3.4	is not very fruitful.
thag4.3:4.1	Whoever has no respect
thag4.3:4.2	for their spiritual companions
thag4.3:4.3	is as far from true Dhamma
thag4.3:4.4	as the sky from the earth.

thag4.4:0.2	The Book of the Fours
thag4.4:0.3	Chapter One
thag4.4:0.4	Nandaka (2nd)
thag4.4:1.1	Damn you mortal frame, you stink!
thag4.4:1.2	You’re on Māra’s side, you ooze!
thag4.4:1.3	O body, you have nine streams
thag4.4:1.4	that are flowing all the time.
thag4.4:2.1	Don’t think much of mortal frames;
thag4.4:2.2	don’t disparage the Realized Ones.
thag4.4:2.3	They’re not even aroused by heaven,
thag4.4:2.4	let alone by humans.
thag4.4:3.1	But those who are stupid fools,
thag4.4:3.2	with bad advisors, shrouded in delusion,
thag4.4:3.3	that kind of person is aroused by bodies,
thag4.4:3.4	when Māra has laid down the snare.
thag4.4:4.1	Those in whom greed, hate, and ignorance
thag4.4:4.2	have faded away;
thag4.4:4.3	such people are not aroused by bodies,
thag4.4:4.4	they’ve cut the strings, they’re no longer bound.
thag4.5:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks

thag4.5:0.3	Chapter One
thag4.5:0.4	Jambuka
thag4.5:1.1	For fifty-five years
thag4.5:1.2	I wore dust and dirt.
thag4.5:1.3	Eating one meal a month,
thag4.5:1.4	I tore out my hair and beard.
thag4.5:2.1	I stood on one foot;
thag4.5:2.2	I rejected seats;
thag4.5:2.3	I ate dried-out dung;
thag4.5:2.4	I didn’t accept food set aside for me.
thag4.5:3.1	I did many deeds of this kind,
thag4.5:3.2	which lead to a bad destination.
thag4.5:3.3	Swept away by a great flood,
thag4.5:3.4	I went to the Buddha for refuge.

thag4.6:1.1	It was so welcome for me
thag4.6:1.2	during the Gayā spring festival
thag4.6:1.3	to see the Awakened One
thag4.6:1.4	teaching the supreme Dhamma.
thag4.6:2.1	He was glorious, the teacher of a community,
thag4.6:2.2	a leader who had realized the highest.
thag4.6:2.3	In all the world with its gods,
thag4.6:2.4	he was the victor of unequaled vision.
thag4.6:3.1	A great giant, a great hero,
thag4.6:3.2	a great light free of defilement.
thag4.6:3.3	With the utter ending of all defilements,
thag4.6:3.4	the teacher fears nothing from any quarter.
thag4.6:4.1	For a long time, sadly, I was corrupted,
thag4.6:4.2	fettered by the bond of wrong view.
thag4.6:4.3	That Blessed One, Senaka,
thag4.6:4.4	released me from all ties.

thag4.7:1.3	being so disorganized
thag4.7:1.4	a fool falls into suffering.
thag4.7:2.1	Their good fortune wastes away
thag4.7:2.2	like the moon in the waning fortnight.
thag4.7:2.3	They become disgraced

thag4.7:3.2	hurrying when it’s time to hurry;
thag4.7:3.3	being so well organized,
thag4.7:3.4	an astute person comes into happiness.
thag4.7:4.1	Their good fortune flourishes

thag4.8:0.4	Rāhula
thag4.8:1.1	I am known as “Fortunate Rāhula”,
thag4.8:1.2	because I’m accomplished in both ways:
thag4.8:1.3	I am the son of the Buddha,
thag4.8:1.4	and I am seer of truths.
thag4.8:2.1	Since my defilements have ended,
thag4.8:2.2	since there are no more future lives—
thag4.8:2.3	I’m perfected, worthy of offerings,
thag4.8:2.4	master of the three knowledges, seer of the deathless.
thag4.8:3.1	Blinded by sensual pleasures, trapped in a net,
thag4.8:3.2	they are smothered over by craving;
thag4.8:3.3	bound by the Kinsman of the Negligent,
thag4.8:3.4	like a fish caught in a funnel-net trap.
thag4.8:4.1	Having thrown off those sensual pleasures,
thag4.8:4.2	having cut Māra’s bond,
thag4.8:4.3	and having plucked out craving, root and all:
thag4.8:4.4	I’m cooled, extinguished.

thag4.9:2.2	the mother of my son,
thag4.9:2.3	adorned with jewelry and all dressed up,
thag4.9:2.4	like a snare of death laid down.
thag4.9:3.1	Then the realization
thag4.9:3.2	came upon me—
thag4.9:3.3	the danger became clear,
thag4.9:3.4	and I was firmly disillusioned.

thag5.11:1.4	and even stayed together with him.
thag5.11:2.1	The Blessed One, the teacher,
thag5.11:2.2	spent much of the night in the open;
thag5.11:2.3	then he, who is so skilled in meditation,
thag5.11:2.4	entered his dwelling.
thag5.11:3.1	Spreading his outer robe,
thag5.11:3.2	Gotama made his bed,
thag5.11:3.3	like a lion in a rocky cave,
thag5.11:3.4	with fear and dread given up.
thag5.11:4.1	Then, with lovely enunciation,
thag5.11:4.2	Soṇa, a disciple of the Buddha,
thag5.11:4.3	recited the true teaching
thag5.11:4.4	before the best of Buddhas.

thag5.1:1.1	I, a monk, went to a charnel ground
thag5.1:1.2	and saw a woman’s body abandoned there,

thag5.1:1.4	full of worms that devoured.
thag5.1:2.1	Some men were disgusted,
thag5.1:2.2	seeing her dead and rotten;

thag5.2:1.4	they say: “That’s a sign of my bad luck.”
thag5.2:2.1	When a misfortune is extracted and beaten,
thag5.2:2.2	to surrender it in part would be like losing at dice;
thag5.2:2.3	but to surrender it all you’d have to be blind,
thag5.2:2.4	not seeing the even and the uneven.
thag5.2:3.1	You should only say what you would do;
thag5.2:3.2	you shouldn’t say what you wouldn’t do.

thag5.6:2.4	I was a blind, ordinary person.
thag5.6:3.1	Caught in the thicket of wrong view,
thag5.6:3.2	deluded by misapprehension.
thag5.6:3.3	Thinking impurity was purity,

thag6.11:4.1	Freed from corruptions,
thag6.11:4.2	my pure mind is unclouded.
thag6.11:4.3	Frequently reviewing this,
thag6.11:4.4	I’ll meditate without defilements.
thag6.11:5.1	Those defilements that were found in me,
thag6.11:5.2	internally and externally,
thag6.11:5.3	are all cut off without remainder,
thag6.11:5.4	and will not arise again.
thag6.11:6.1	The five aggregates are fully understood,
thag6.11:6.2	they remain, but their root is cut.
thag6.11:6.3	I have reached the ending of suffering,
thag6.11:6.4	now there’ll be no more future lives.”

thag6.12:0.4	Brahmadatta
thag6.12:1.1	From where would anger come for one free of anger,
thag6.12:1.2	tamed, living justly,
thag6.12:1.3	freed by right knowledge,
thag6.12:1.4	peaceful and poised?
thag6.12:2.1	When you get angry at an angry person
thag6.12:2.2	you just make things worse for yourself.
thag6.12:2.3	When you don’t get angry at an angry person
thag6.12:2.4	you win a battle hard to win.
thag6.12:3.1	When you know that the other is angry,
thag6.12:3.2	you act for the good of both
thag6.12:3.3	yourself and the other
thag6.12:3.4	if you’re mindful and stay calm.
thag6.12:4.1	People unfamiliar with the teaching
thag6.12:4.2	consider one who heals both
thag6.12:4.3	oneself and the other
thag6.12:4.4	to be a fool.
thag6.12:5.1	If anger arises in you,
thag6.12:5.2	reflect on the simile of the saw;
thag6.12:5.3	if craving for flavors arises in you,
thag6.12:5.4	remember the simile of the child’s flesh.
thag6.12:6.1	If your mind runs off
thag6.12:6.2	to sensual pleasures and future lives,
thag6.12:6.3	quickly curb it with mindfulness,
thag6.12:6.4	as one would curb a greedy cow eating corn.

thag6.13:0.4	Sirimaṇḍa
thag6.13:1.1	The rain saturates things that are covered up;
thag6.13:1.2	it doesn’t saturate things that are open.
thag6.13:1.3	Therefore you should open up a covered thing,
thag6.13:1.4	so the rain will not saturate it.
thag6.13:2.1	The world is beaten down by death
thag6.13:2.2	and surrounded by old age.
thag6.13:2.3	The dart of craving has struck it down,
thag6.13:2.4	and it’s always fuming with desire.
thag6.13:3.1	The world is beaten down by death,
thag6.13:3.2	caged by old age,
thag6.13:3.3	beaten constantly without respite,
thag6.13:3.4	like a thief being flogged.
thag6.13:4.1	Three things are coming, like a wall of flame:
thag6.13:4.2	death, disease, and old age.
thag6.13:4.3	No power can stand before them,
thag6.13:4.4	and no speed’s enough to flee.
thag6.13:5.1	Don’t waste your day,
thag6.13:5.2	a little or a lot.
thag6.13:5.3	Every night that passes
thag6.13:5.4	shortens your life by that much.
thag6.13:6.1	Walking or standing,
thag6.13:6.2	sitting or lying down:
thag6.13:6.3	your final night draws near;
thag6.13:6.4	you have no time to be careless.

thag6.14:0.4	Sabbakāmi
thag6.14:1.1	This two-legged body is dirty and stinking,
thag6.14:1.2	full of different carcasses,
thag6.14:1.3	and oozing all over the place—
thag6.14:1.4	but still it is cherished!
thag6.14:2.1	Like a lurking deer by a trick,
thag6.14:2.2	like a fish by a hook,
thag6.14:2.3	like a monkey by tar—
thag6.14:2.4	they trap an ordinary person.
thag6.14:3.1	Sights, sounds, tastes, smells,
thag6.14:3.2	and touches so delightful:
thag6.14:3.3	these five kinds of sensual stimulation
thag6.14:3.4	are seen in a woman’s body.
thag6.14:4.1	Those ordinary people, their minds full of lust,
thag6.14:4.2	who pursue those women:
thag6.14:4.3	they swell the horrors of the charnel ground,
thag6.14:4.4	piling up future lives.
thag6.14:5.1	One who, being mindful,
thag6.14:5.2	avoids them
thag6.14:5.3	like a snake’s head with their foot,
thag6.14:5.4	gets over clinging to the world.
thag6.14:6.1	Seeing the danger in sensual pleasures,
thag6.14:6.2	seeing renunciation as sanctuary,
thag6.14:6.3	I’ve escaped all sensual pleasures,
thag6.14:6.4	and attained the ending of defilements.

thag6.1:1.1	Seeing the demonstrations

thag6.1:1.3	was not enough for me to bow to him—
thag6.1:1.4	I was blinded by jealousy and conceit.
thag6.1:2.1	Knowing my thoughts,
thag6.1:2.2	the trainer of men scolded me.
thag6.1:2.3	I was struck with a sense of urgency,
thag6.1:2.4	so astonishing and hair-raising!
thag6.1:3.1	Rejecting the petty powers
thag6.1:3.2	I had before as a matted-hair ascetic,
thag6.1:3.3	I then went forth
thag6.1:3.4	in the victor’s instruction.
thag6.1:4.1	I used to be content with sacrifice,
thag6.1:4.2	the realm of sensual pleasures was my priority.
thag6.1:4.3	But later I eradicated desire,
thag6.1:4.4	and hatred and also delusion.
thag6.1:5.1	I know my past lives;
thag6.1:5.2	my clairvoyance is clarified;
thag6.1:5.3	I have psychic powers, and know the minds of others;
thag6.1:5.4	I have attained clairaudience.
thag6.1:6.1	I’ve attained the goal
thag6.1:6.2	for the sake of which I went forth
thag6.1:6.3	from the lay life to homelessness—
thag6.1:6.4	the ending of all fetters.

thag6.2:3.1	In faith, recollect the immeasurable teaching!
thag6.2:3.2	Your body soaked with rapture, you’ll always be elated.

thag6.4:1.1	I, Kulla, went to a charnel ground

thag6.4:1.4	full of worms that devoured.

thag6.4:2.2	diseased, filthy, rotten,

thag6.4:3.1	Taking the teaching as a mirror
thag6.4:3.2	for realizing knowledge and vision,
thag6.4:3.3	I examined this body,

thag6.4:4.1	As this is, so is that;
thag6.4:4.2	as that is, so is this.
thag6.4:4.3	As below, so above;

thag6.5:0.4	Māluṅkyaputta (1st)
thag6.5:1.1	When a person lives heedlessly,
thag6.5:1.2	craving grows in them like a parasitic creeper.
thag6.5:1.3	They jump from life to life, like a monkey
thag6.5:1.4	greedy for fruit in a forest grove.
thag6.5:2.1	Whoever is beaten by this wretched craving,
thag6.5:2.2	this attachment to the world,
thag6.5:2.3	their sorrow grows,
thag6.5:2.4	like grass in the rain.
thag6.5:3.1	But whoever prevails over this wretched craving,
thag6.5:3.2	so hard to get over in the world,
thag6.5:3.3	their sorrows fall from them,
thag6.5:3.4	like a drop from a lotus-leaf.
thag6.5:4.1	I say this to you, good people,
thag6.5:4.2	all those who have gathered here:
thag6.5:4.3	dig up the root of craving,
thag6.5:4.4	as you’d dig up the grass in search of roots.
thag6.5:4.5	Don’t let Māra break you again and again,

thag6.5:5.1	Act on the Buddha’s words,
thag6.5:5.2	don’t let the moment pass you by.
thag6.5:5.3	For if you miss your moment
thag6.5:5.4	you’ll grieve when sent to hell.
thag6.5:6.1	Negligence is always dust;

thag6.6:0.4	Sappadāsa
thag6.6:1.1	In the twenty-five years
thag6.6:1.2	since I went forth,
thag6.6:1.3	I have not found peace of mind,
thag6.6:1.4	even as long as a finger-snap.
thag6.6:2.1	Since I couldn’t get my mind unified,
thag6.6:2.2	I was racked by desire for pleasures of the senses.
thag6.6:2.3	Wailing, with outstretched arms,
thag6.6:2.4	I left my dwelling.
thag6.6:3.1	Shall I … or shall I slit my wrists?
thag6.6:3.2	What’s the point of living?
thag6.6:3.3	For how on earth can one such as me die
thag6.6:3.4	after resigning the training?
thag6.6:4.1	Then I picked up a razor,
thag6.6:4.2	I sat on a cot:
thag6.6:4.3	the razor was ready
thag6.6:4.4	to slice my vein.
thag6.6:5.1	Then the realization
thag6.6:5.2	came upon me—
thag6.6:5.3	the danger became clear,
thag6.6:5.4	and I was firmly disillusioned.
thag6.6:6.1	Then my mind was freed—
thag6.6:6.2	see the excellence of the teaching!
thag6.6:6.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges,
thag6.6:6.4	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

thag6.7:1.3	Don’t be lazy and let the kinsman of the heedless,
thag6.7:1.4	the King of Death, catch you in his trap.
thag6.7:2.1	Like a wave in the mighty ocean,
thag6.7:2.2	rebirth and old age sweep you under.
thag6.7:2.3	Make a safe island of yourself,
thag6.7:2.4	for you have no other shelter.
thag6.7:3.1	The teacher has mastered this path,
thag6.7:3.2	which transcends chains, and the fear of birth and old age.
thag6.7:3.3	Be diligent all the time
thag6.7:3.4	and dedicate yourself to practice.
thag6.7:4.1	Free yourself from your former bonds!
thag6.7:4.2	Wearing your outer robe, with shaven head, eating almsfood,
thag6.7:4.3	don’t delight in play or sleep,
thag6.7:4.4	dedicate yourself to absorption, Kātiyāna.
thag6.7:5.1	Meditate and conquer, Kātiyāna,
thag6.7:5.2	you’re an expert in the path to sanctuary.
thag6.7:5.3	Attaining unexcelled purity,
thag6.7:5.4	you’ll be quenched, as a flame by water.
thag6.7:6.1	A lamp of feeble flame
thag6.7:6.2	is bent down by the wind, like a creeper;
thag6.7:6.3	just so, kinsman of Indra,
thag6.7:6.4	shake off Māra, without grasping.
thag6.7:6.5	Free of lust for feelings,
thag6.7:6.6	await your time here, cooled.

thag6.8:1.1	It was well-taught by the seer,
thag6.8:1.2	the Buddha, Kinsman of the Sun,
thag6.8:1.3	who has transcended all fetters,
thag6.8:1.4	and destroyed all rolling-on.
thag6.8:2.1	Emancipating, it leads across,
thag6.8:2.2	drying up the root of craving,
thag6.8:2.3	and, having cut off the root of poison, the slaughter-house,
thag6.8:2.4	it leads to quenching.
thag6.8:3.1	By breaking the root of unknowing,
thag6.8:3.2	it smashes the mechanism of deeds,
thag6.8:3.3	and drops the thunderbolt of knowledge
thag6.8:3.4	on the taking up of consciousnesses.
thag6.8:4.1	It informs us of our feelings,
thag6.8:4.2	releasing us from grasping,
thag6.8:4.3	contemplating with understanding
thag6.8:4.4	all states of existence as a pit of burning coals.
thag6.8:5.1	It’s very sweet and very deep,
thag6.8:5.2	holding birth and death at bay;
thag6.8:5.3	it is the noble eightfold path—
thag6.8:5.4	the stilling of suffering, bliss.
thag6.8:6.1	Knowing deed as deed
thag6.8:6.2	and result as result;
thag6.8:6.3	seeing dependently originated phenomena
thag6.8:6.4	as if they were in a clear light;
thag6.8:6.5	leading to the great sanctuary and peace,
thag6.8:6.6	it’s excellent at the end.

thag6.9:0.3	Chapter One
thag6.9:0.4	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:1.1	I was drunk with the pride of birth
thag6.9:1.2	and wealth and authority.
thag6.9:1.3	I wandered about intoxicated
thag6.9:1.4	with my own gorgeous body.
thag6.9:2.1	No-one was my equal or my better—
thag6.9:2.2	or so I thought.
thag6.9:2.3	I was such an arrogant fool,
thag6.9:2.4	stuck up, waving my own flag.
thag6.9:3.1	I never paid homage to anyone:
thag6.9:3.2	not even my mother or father,
thag6.9:3.3	nor others esteemed as respectable.
thag6.9:3.4	I was stiff with pride, lacking regard for others.
thag6.9:4.1	When I saw the foremost leader,
thag6.9:4.2	the most excellent of charioteers,
thag6.9:4.3	shining like the sun,
thag6.9:4.4	at the fore of the mendicant Saṅgha,
thag6.9:5.1	I discarded conceit and vanity,
thag6.9:5.2	and, with a clear and confident heart,
thag6.9:5.3	I bowed down with my head
thag6.9:5.4	to the most excellent of all beings.
thag6.9:6.1	The conceit of superiority and the conceit of inferiority
thag6.9:6.2	have been given up and eradicated.
thag6.9:6.3	The conceit “I am” is cut off,
thag6.9:6.4	and every kind of conceit is destroyed.

thag7.1:1.1	Adorned with jewelry and all dressed up,
thag7.1:1.2	with her garland and her makeup on,
thag7.1:1.3	and her feet so brightly rouged:
thag7.1:1.4	the courtesan was wearing sandals.
thag7.1:2.1	Stepping off her sandals in front of me,
thag7.1:2.2	her palms joined in greeting,
thag7.1:2.3	smiling, she spoke to me
thag7.1:2.4	so softly and so sweet:
thag7.1:3.1	“You’re too young to go forth—
thag7.1:3.2	come, stay in my teaching!
thag7.1:3.3	Enjoy human sensual pleasures,
thag7.1:3.4	I’ll give you riches.
thag7.1:3.5	I promise this is the truth—
thag7.1:3.6	I swear it by the Sacred Flame.
thag7.1:4.1	And when we’ve grown old together,
thag7.1:4.2	both of us leaning on staffs,
thag7.1:4.3	we shall both go forth,
thag7.1:4.4	and win on both counts.”
thag7.1:5.1	I saw the courtesan seducing me,
thag7.1:5.2	her palms joined in greeting,
thag7.1:5.3	adorned with jewelry and all dressed up,
thag7.1:5.4	like a snare of death laid down.
thag7.1:6.1	Then the realization
thag7.1:6.2	came upon me—
thag7.1:6.3	the danger became clear
thag7.1:6.4	and I grew firmly disillusioned.
thag7.1:7.1	Then my mind was freed—
thag7.1:7.2	see the excellence of the Dhamma!

thag7.2:1.4	he practices absorption; he is truly well-favoured.
thag7.2:2.1	Some delight in clay drums,
thag7.2:2.2	in arched harps, and in cymbals.
thag7.2:2.3	But here, at the foot of a tree,
thag7.2:2.4	I delight in the Buddha’s teaching.
thag7.2:3.1	If the Buddha were to grant me one wish,
thag7.2:3.2	and I were to get what I wished for,
thag7.2:3.3	I’d choose for the whole world
thag7.2:3.4	constant mindfulness of the body.
thag7.2:4.1	Those who’ve judged me on appearance,
thag7.2:4.2	and those swayed by my voice,
thag7.2:4.3	are full of desire and greed;
thag7.2:4.4	they don’t know me.
thag7.2:5.1	Not knowing what’s inside,
thag7.2:5.2	nor seeing what’s outside,
thag7.2:5.3	the fool shut in on every side,
thag7.2:5.4	gets carried away by a voice.
thag7.2:6.1	Not knowing what’s inside,
thag7.2:6.2	but seeing what’s outside,
thag7.2:6.3	seeing the fruit outside,
thag7.2:6.4	they’re also carried away by a voice.
thag7.2:7.1	Understanding what’s inside,
thag7.2:7.2	and seeing what’s outside,

thag7.3:2.2	wishing me well and wanting the best for me,
thag7.3:2.3	my mother and father
thag7.3:2.4	took me to see the Buddha.
thag7.3:3.1	“We had this son with difficulty;
thag7.3:3.2	he is delicate and dainty.
thag7.3:3.3	We offer him to you, Lord,
thag7.3:3.4	to attend upon the victor.”
thag7.3:4.1	The teacher, having accepted me,
thag7.3:4.2	declared to Ānanda:
thag7.3:4.3	“Quickly give him the going-forth—
thag7.3:4.4	this one will be a thoroughbred!”
thag7.3:5.1	After he, the teacher, had sent me forth,
thag7.3:5.2	the victor entered his dwelling.
thag7.3:5.3	Before the sun set
thag7.3:5.4	my mind was freed.
thag7.3:6.1	The teacher didn’t forget me;
thag7.3:6.2	when he came out from seclusion,
thag7.3:6.3	he said: “Come Bhadda!”
thag7.3:6.4	That was my ordination.
thag7.3:7.1	At seven years old
thag7.3:7.2	I received ordination.
thag7.3:7.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges;
thag7.3:7.4	oh, the excellence of the teaching!

thag7.4:0.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:1.1	I saw the supreme person
thag7.4:1.2	walking mindfully in the shade of the terrace,
thag7.4:1.3	so I approached,
thag7.4:1.4	and bowed to the supreme among men.
thag7.4:2.1	Arranging my robe over one shoulder
thag7.4:2.2	and clasping my hands together,
thag7.4:2.3	I walked alongside that stainless one,
thag7.4:2.4	supreme among all beings.
thag7.4:3.1	The wise one, expert in questions,
thag7.4:3.2	questioned me.
thag7.4:3.3	Brave and fearless,
thag7.4:3.4	I answered the teacher.
thag7.4:4.1	When all his questions were answered,
thag7.4:4.2	the Realized One congratulated me.
thag7.4:4.3	Looking around the mendicant Saṅgha,
thag7.4:4.4	he said the following:
thag7.4:5.1	“It is a blessing for the people of Aṅga and Magadha
thag7.4:5.2	that this person enjoys their
thag7.4:5.3	robe and almsfood,
thag7.4:5.4	requisites and lodgings,
thag7.4:5.5	their respect and service—
thag7.4:5.6	it’s a blessing for them,” he declared.
thag7.4:6.1	“Sopāka, from this day on
thag7.4:6.2	you are invited to come and see me.
thag7.4:6.3	And Sopāka, let this
thag7.4:6.4	be your ordination.”
thag7.4:7.1	At seven years old
thag7.4:7.2	I received ordination.
thag7.4:7.3	I bear my final body—
thag7.4:7.4	oh, the excellence of the teaching!

thag7.5:0.4	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:1.1	I broke the reeds off with my hands,
thag7.5:1.2	made a hut, and stayed there.
thag7.5:1.3	That’s how I became known
thag7.5:1.4	as “Reed-breaker”.
thag7.5:2.1	But now it’s not appropriate
thag7.5:2.2	for me to break reeds with my hands.
thag7.5:2.3	The training rules have been laid down for us
thag7.5:2.4	by Gotama the renowned.
thag7.5:3.1	Previously, I, Sarabhaṅga,
thag7.5:3.2	didn’t see the disease in its entirety.
thag7.5:3.3	But now I have seen the disease,
thag7.5:3.4	as I’ve practiced what was taught by he who is beyond the gods.
thag7.5:4.1	Gotama traveled by that straight road;
thag7.5:4.2	the same path traveled by Vipassī,
thag7.5:4.3	by Sikhī, Vessabhū,
thag7.5:4.4	Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa.
thag7.5:5.1	These seven Buddhas have plunged into the ending,
thag7.5:5.2	free of craving, without grasping,
thag7.5:5.3	having become Dhamma, poised.
thag7.5:5.4	They have taught this Dhamma
thag7.5:6.1	out of compassion for living creatures—
thag7.5:6.2	suffering, origin, path,
thag7.5:6.3	and cessation, the ending of suffering.
thag7.5:6.4	In these four noble truths,
thag7.5:7.1	the endless suffering of transmigration
thag7.5:7.2	finally comes to an end.
thag7.5:7.3	When the body breaks up,
thag7.5:7.4	and life comes to an end,
thag7.5:7.5	there are no future lives;
thag7.5:7.6	I’m everywhere well-freed.

thag8.1:0.4	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:1.1	Don’t get involved in lots of work,
thag8.1:1.2	avoid people, and don’t try to acquire things.
thag8.1:1.3	If you’re eager and greedy for flavors,
thag8.1:1.4	you’ll miss the goal that brings such happiness.
thag8.1:2.1	They know it really is a bog,
thag8.1:2.2	this homage and veneration in respectable families.
thag8.1:2.3	Honor is a subtle dart, hard to extract,
thag8.1:2.4	and hard for a sinner to give up.
thag8.1:3.1	The deeds of a mortal aren’t bad
thag8.1:3.2	because of what others do.
thag8.1:3.3	You yourself should not do bad,
thag8.1:3.4	for mortals have deeds as their kin.
thag8.1:4.1	You’re not a bandit because of what someone says,
thag8.1:4.2	you’re not a sage because of what someone says;
thag8.1:4.3	but as you know yourself,
thag8.1:4.4	so the gods will know you.
thag8.1:5.1	Others don’t understand
thag8.1:5.2	that we need restraint in this.
thag8.1:5.3	But those who do understand this,
thag8.1:5.4	being clever, settle their conflicts.
thag8.1:6.1	A wise person lives on
thag8.1:6.2	even after loss of wealth;
thag8.1:6.3	but without gaining wisdom,
thag8.1:6.4	even a rich person doesn’t really live.
thag8.1:7.1	All is heard with the ear,
thag8.1:7.2	all is seen with the eye;
thag8.1:7.3	the wise ought not forsake
thag8.1:7.4	all that is seen and heard.
thag8.1:8.1	Though you have eyes, be as if blind;
thag8.1:8.2	though you have ears, be as if deaf;
thag8.1:8.3	though you have wisdom, be as if dumb;
thag8.1:8.4	though you have strength, be as if feeble.
thag8.1:8.5	And when issues come up
thag8.1:8.6	lie as still as a corpse.

thag8.2:1.1	Free of anger and hostility,
thag8.2:1.2	free of deceit, and rid of slander;

thag8.2:1.4	doesn’t grieve after passing away.
thag8.2:2.1	Free of anger and hostility,
thag8.2:2.2	free of deceit, and rid of slander;
thag8.2:2.3	that’s how a mendicant with sense doors always guarded
thag8.2:2.4	doesn’t grieve after passing away.
thag8.2:3.1	Free of anger and hostility,
thag8.2:3.2	free of deceit, and rid of slander;
thag8.2:3.3	that’s how a mendicant of good morals
thag8.2:3.4	doesn’t grieve after passing away.
thag8.2:4.1	Free of anger and hostility,
thag8.2:4.2	free of deceit, and rid of slander;

thag8.2:5.1	Free of anger and hostility,
thag8.2:5.2	free of deceit, and rid of slander;
thag8.2:5.3	that’s how a mendicant of good wisdom,
thag8.2:5.4	doesn’t grieve after passing away.
thag8.2:6.1	Whoever has faith in the Realized One,
thag8.2:6.2	unwavering and well grounded;
thag8.2:6.3	whose ethical conduct is good,
thag8.2:6.4	praised and loved by the noble ones;
thag8.2:7.1	who has confidence in the Saṅgha,
thag8.2:7.2	and correct view:
thag8.2:7.3	they’re said to be prosperous;
thag8.2:7.4	their life is not in vain.
thag8.2:8.1	So let the wise devote themselves
thag8.2:8.2	to faith, ethical behavior,
thag8.2:8.3	confidence, and insight into the teaching,
thag8.2:8.4	remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.

thag8.3:0.4	Mahāpanthaka
thag8.3:1.1	When I first saw the Teacher
thag8.3:1.2	who fears nothing from any quarter,
thag8.3:1.3	I was struck with a sense of urgency,
thag8.3:1.4	seeing the supreme among men.
thag8.3:2.1	Anyone who, having found such a Teacher,
thag8.3:2.2	would lose them again,
thag8.3:2.3	is like someone who, when Lucky Luck comes to them,
thag8.3:2.4	would drive her away with their hands and feet.
thag8.3:3.1	Then I left behind my children and wives,
thag8.3:3.2	my riches and my grain;
thag8.3:3.3	I had my hair and beard cut off,
thag8.3:3.4	and went forth to homelessness.
thag8.3:4.1	Endowed with the monastic training and livelihood,
thag8.3:4.2	my sense faculties well-restrained,
thag8.3:4.3	paying homage to the Buddha,
thag8.3:4.4	I meditated undefeated.
thag8.3:5.1	Then a wish occurred to me,
thag8.3:5.2	my heart’s truest wish:
thag8.3:5.3	I wouldn’t sit down, not even for a moment,
thag8.3:5.4	until the dart of craving was plucked.
thag8.3:6.1	As I meditate like this,
thag8.3:6.2	see my energy and vigor!
thag8.3:6.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges,
thag8.3:6.4	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thag8.3:7.1	I know my past lives,
thag8.3:7.2	my clairvoyance is clarified;
thag8.3:7.3	I’m perfected, worthy of offerings,
thag8.3:7.4	liberated, free of attachments.
thag8.3:8.1	Then, at the end of the night,
thag8.3:8.2	as the rising of the sun drew near,
thag8.3:8.3	all craving was dried up,
thag8.3:8.4	so I sat down cross-legged.

thag9.1:1.3	When an astute person fully understands this, and they are mindful, practicing absorption:
thag9.1:1.4	there is no greater pleasure than this.
thag9.1:2.1	When clinging, the carrier of suffering,
thag9.1:2.2	and craving, the carrier of this painful mass of proliferation,
thag9.1:2.3	are destroyed, and one is mindful, practicing absorption:
thag9.1:2.4	there is no greater pleasure than this.
thag9.1:3.1	When the eightfold way, so full of grace,
thag9.1:3.2	the supreme path, cleanser of all corruptions,
thag9.1:3.3	is seen with wisdom; and one is mindful, practicing absorption:
thag9.1:3.4	there is no greater pleasure than this.
thag9.1:4.1	When one develops that peaceful state,
thag9.1:4.2	sorrowless, stainless, unconditioned,
thag9.1:4.3	cleanser of all corruptions, cutter of fetters and bonds:
thag9.1:4.4	there is no greater pleasure than this.
thag9.1:5.1	When the thunder-cloud rumbles in the sky,
thag9.1:5.2	while the rain pours on the path of birds everywhere,
thag9.1:5.3	and a monk has gone to a mountain cave, practicing absorption:
thag9.1:5.4	there is no greater pleasure than this.
thag9.1:6.1	When sitting on a riverbank covered in flowers,
thag9.1:6.2	garlanded with brightly colored forest plants,
thag9.1:6.3	one is truly happy, practicing absorption:
thag9.1:6.4	there is no greater pleasure than this.
thag9.1:7.1	When it is midnight in a lonely forest,
thag9.1:7.2	and the sky rains, and the lions roar,
thag9.1:7.3	and a monk has gone to a mountain cave, practicing absorption:
thag9.1:7.4	there is no greater pleasure than this.
thag9.1:8.1	When one’s own thoughts have been cut off,
thag9.1:8.2	between two mountains, sheltered inside a cleft,
thag9.1:8.3	without stress or heartlessness, practicing absorption:
thag9.1:8.4	there is no greater pleasure than this.
thag9.1:9.1	When one is happy, destroyer of stains, heartlessness, and sorrow,
thag9.1:9.2	free of obstructions, entanglements, and thorns,
thag9.1:9.3	and with all defilements annihilated, practicing absorption:
thag9.1:9.4	there is no greater pleasure than this.

thig10.1:1.3	Associating with good friends,
thig10.1:1.4	even a fool becomes astute.
thig10.1:2.1	Associate with good people,
thig10.1:2.2	for that is how wisdom grows.
thig10.1:2.3	Should you associate with good people,

thig10.1:3.2	its origin and cessation,

thig10.1:4.1	“‘A woman’s life is painful,’

thig10.1:4.3	‘and for a co-wife it’s especially so.
thig10.1:4.4	After giving birth just once,
thig10.1:5.1	some women even cut their own throat,

thig10.1:9.2	I saw my son’s flesh being eaten.
thig10.1:9.3	With my family destroyed, condemned by all,

thig10.1:10.1	I’ve developed the noble eightfold path
thig10.1:10.2	leading to the deathless.
thig10.1:10.3	I’ve realized quenching,
thig10.1:10.4	as seen in the mirror of the Dhamma.
thig10.1:11.1	I’ve plucked out the dart,
thig10.1:11.2	laid down the burden, and done what needed to be done.”

thig11.1:1.1	“The two of us were co-wives,
thig11.1:1.2	though we were mother and daughter.
thig11.1:1.3	I was struck with a sense of urgency,
thig11.1:1.4	so astonishing and hair-raising!
thig11.1:2.1	Curse those filthy sensual pleasures,
thig11.1:2.2	so nasty and thorny,
thig11.1:2.3	where we, both mother and daughter,
thig11.1:2.4	had to be co-wives together.
thig11.1:3.1	Seeing the danger in sensual pleasures,
thig11.1:3.2	seeing renunciation as sanctuary,
thig11.1:3.3	I went forth in Rājagaha
thig11.1:3.4	from the lay life to homelessness.
thig11.1:4.1	I know my past lives;
thig11.1:4.2	my clairvoyance is clarified;
thig11.1:4.3	I comprehend the minds of others;
thig11.1:4.4	my clairaudience is purified;
thig11.1:5.1	I've realized the psychic powers,
thig11.1:5.2	and attained the ending of defilements.
thig11.1:5.3	I’ve realized the six kinds of direct knowledge,
thig11.1:5.4	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thig11.1:6.1	I created a four-horsed chariot
thig11.1:6.2	using my psychic powers.
thig11.1:6.3	Then I bowed at the feet of the Buddha,
thig11.1:6.4	the glorious protector of the world.”
thig11.1:7.1	“You’ve come to this sal tree all crowned with flowers,
thig11.1:7.2	and stand at its root all alone.
thig11.1:7.3	But you have no companion with you,
thig11.1:7.4	silly girl, aren’t you afraid of rascals?”
thig11.1:8.1	“Even if 100,000 rascals like this
thig11.1:8.2	were to gang up,
thig11.1:8.3	I’d stir not a hair nor tremble.
thig11.1:8.4	What could you do to me all alone, Māra?
thig11.1:9.1	I’ll vanish,
thig11.1:9.2	or I’ll enter your belly;
thig11.1:9.3	I could stand between your eyebrows
thig11.1:9.4	and you still wouldn’t see me.
thig11.1:10.1	I’m the master of my own mind,
thig11.1:10.2	I’ve developed the bases of psychic power well.
thig11.1:10.3	I’ve realized the six kinds of direct knowledge,
thig11.1:10.4	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thig11.1:11.1	Sensual pleasures are like swords and stakes;
thig11.1:11.2	the aggregates are their chopping block.
thig11.1:11.3	What you call sensual delight
thig11.1:11.4	is now no delight for me.
thig11.1:12.1	Relishing is destroyed in every respect,

thig12.1:1.1	“I’m a water-carrier. Even when it’s cold,
thig12.1:1.2	I must always plunge into the water;
thig12.1:1.3	I fear I’ll get the stick from noble ladies,
thig12.1:1.4	harassed by fear of abuse and anger.
thig12.1:2.1	Brahmin, what are you afraid of,
thig12.1:2.2	that you always plunge into the water,
thig12.1:2.3	your limbs trembling
thig12.1:2.4	in the freezing cold?”
thig12.1:3.1	“Oh, but you already know,
thig12.1:3.2	Madam Puṇṇikā, when you ask me:

thig12.1:3.4	to ward off the wickedness I have done.
thig12.1:4.1	Whosoever young or old
thig12.1:4.2	performs a wicked deed,

thig12.1:6.1	Would not they all go to heaven, then:
thig12.1:6.2	all the frogs and the turtles,

thig12.1:7.4	and others of evil deeds:
thig12.1:7.5	by ablution in water they too would be

thig12.1:8.1	If these rivers washed away
thig12.1:8.2	the bad deeds of the past,
thig12.1:8.3	then they’d also wash off goodness,
thig12.1:8.4	and thereby you would be excluded.
thig12.1:9.1	Brahmin, the thing that you are afraid of,
thig12.1:9.2	when you always plunge into the water,
thig12.1:9.3	do not do that very thing,

thig13.2:2.3	I ask you now, Rohiṇī:
thig13.2:2.4	why do you like ascetics?
thig13.2:3.1	They don’t like to work, they’re lazy,
thig13.2:3.2	they live on charity;

thig13.2:4.2	you’ve questioned me about ascetics.
thig13.2:4.3	I shall extol for you

thig13.2:5.1	They like to work, they’re not lazy;
thig13.2:5.2	by giving up greed and hate,
thig13.2:5.3	they do the best kind of work—
thig13.2:5.4	that’s why I like ascetics.
thig13.2:6.1	As for the three roots of evil,
thig13.2:6.2	by pure deeds they shake them off.
thig13.2:6.3	They have given up all wickedness—

thig13.2:12.2	they don’t look back with longing,
thig13.2:12.3	but proceed without concern—
thig13.2:12.4	that’s why I like ascetics.
thig13.2:13.1	They hoard no goods in storerooms,
thig13.2:13.2	nor in pots or baskets.
thig13.2:13.3	They seek food prepared by others—
thig13.2:13.4	that’s why I like ascetics.
thig13.2:14.1	They don’t receive silver,
thig13.2:14.2	or gold whether coined or uncoined;
thig13.2:14.3	feeding on whatever comes that day,
thig13.2:14.4	that’s why I like ascetics.
thig13.2:15.1	They have gone forth from different families,

thig13.3:18.6	I’ll dedicate your religious donation.”
thig13.3:19.1	Then Kāḷa set out
thig13.3:19.2	for the bank of the Nerañjara River.
thig13.3:19.3	He saw the Awakened One
thig13.3:19.4	teaching the deathless state:
thig13.3:20.1	suffering, suffering’s origin,
thig13.3:20.2	suffering’s transcendence,
thig13.3:20.3	and the noble eightfold path
thig13.3:20.4	that leads to the stilling of suffering.
thig13.3:21.1	He paid homage at his feet,
thig13.3:21.2	circling him to his right,
thig13.3:21.3	and conveyed Cāpā’s dedication;
thig13.3:21.4	then he went forth to homelessness.
thig13.3:21.5	He attained the three knowledges,
thig13.3:21.6	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thig13.4:0.1	Verses of the Senior Nuns
thig13.4:0.2	The Book of the Twenties
thig13.4:0.3	Sundarī
thig13.4:1.1	“Before, when your children passed away,
thig13.4:1.2	you would expose them to be eaten.
thig13.4:1.3	All day and all night
thig13.4:1.4	you’d be racked with despair.
thig13.4:2.1	Today, brahmin lady, you have exposed
thig13.4:2.2	seven children in all to be eaten;
thig13.4:2.3	Vāseṭṭhī, what is the reason why
thig13.4:2.4	you’re not so filled with despair?”
thig13.4:3.1	“Many hundreds of sons,
thig13.4:3.2	hundreds of family circles,
thig13.4:3.3	both mine and yours, brahmin,
thig13.4:3.4	have been eaten in the past.
thig13.4:4.1	Having known the escape
thig13.4:4.2	from rebirth and death
thig13.4:4.3	I neither grieve nor lament,
thig13.4:4.4	nor do I despair.”
thig13.4:5.1	“Wow, Vaseṭṭhī, the words you speak
thig13.4:5.2	really are amazing!
thig13.4:5.3	Whose teaching did you understand
thig13.4:5.4	that you say these things?”
thig13.4:6.1	“Brahmin, the Awakened One
thig13.4:6.2	at the city of Mithilā,
thig13.4:6.3	teaches the Dhamma so that living creatures
thig13.4:6.4	may abandon all suffering.
thig13.4:7.1	After hearing the perfected one’s teaching,
thig13.4:7.2	brahmin, which is free of all attachments,
thig13.4:7.3	having understood the true teaching there,
thig13.4:7.4	I’ve swept away grief for children.”
thig13.4:8.1	“I too shall go
thig13.4:8.2	to the city of Mithilā.
thig13.4:8.3	Hopefully the Buddha may release me
thig13.4:8.4	from all suffering.”
thig13.4:9.1	The brahmin saw the Buddha,
thig13.4:9.2	liberated, free of attachments.
thig13.4:9.3	He taught him the Dhamma,
thig13.4:9.4	the sage gone beyond suffering:
thig13.4:10.1	suffering, suffering’s origin,
thig13.4:10.2	suffering’s transcendence,
thig13.4:10.3	and the noble eightfold path
thig13.4:10.4	that leads to the stilling of suffering.
thig13.4:11.1	Having understood the true teaching there,
thig13.4:11.2	he chose to go forth.
thig13.4:11.3	Three days later
thig13.4:11.4	Sujāta realized the three knowledges.
thig13.4:12.1	“Please, charioteer, go;
thig13.4:12.2	take back this carriage.
thig13.4:12.3	Bidding my brahmin lady good health, say:
thig13.4:12.4	‘The brahmin has now gone forth.
thig13.4:12.5	After three days,
thig13.4:12.6	Sujāta realized the three knowledges.’”
thig13.4:13.1	Then taking the carriage,
thig13.4:13.2	along with a thousand coins, the charioteer
thig13.4:13.3	bade the brahmin lady good health, and said:
thig13.4:13.4	“The brahmin has now gone forth.
thig13.4:13.5	After three days,
thig13.4:13.6	Sujāta realized the three knowledges.”
thig13.4:14.1	Hearing that the brahmin had the three knowledges, the lady replied:
thig13.4:14.2	“I present to you this horse and carriage,
thig13.4:14.3	O charioteer, along with 1000 coins,
thig13.4:14.4	and a full bowl as a gift.”
thig13.4:15.1	“Keep the horse and carriage, lady,
thig13.4:15.2	along with the thousand coins.
thig13.4:15.3	I too shall go forth in his presence,
thig13.4:15.4	the one of such splendid wisdom.”
thig13.4:16.1	“Elephants, cattle, jeweled earrings,
thig13.4:16.2	such opulent domestic wealth:
thig13.4:16.3	having given it up, your father went forth,
thig13.4:16.4	enjoy these riches Sundarī,
thig13.4:16.5	you are the family heir.”
thig13.4:17.1	“Elephants, cattle, jeweled earrings,
thig13.4:17.2	such delightful domestic wealth:
thig13.4:17.3	having given it up, my father went forth,
thig13.4:17.4	racked by grief for his son.
thig13.4:17.5	I too shall go forth,
thig13.4:17.6	racked by grief for my brother.”
thig13.4:18.1	“Sundarī, may the wish you desire
thig13.4:18.2	come true.
thig13.4:18.3	Leftovers as gleanings,
thig13.4:18.4	and cast-off rags as robes—
thig13.4:18.5	make do with these,
thig13.4:18.6	free of defilements regarding the next life.”
thig13.4:19.1	“Ma’am, while I am still a trainee nun,
thig13.4:19.2	my clairvoyance is clarified;
thig13.4:19.3	I know my past lives,
thig13.4:19.4	the places I used to live.
thig13.4:20.1	Relying on a fine lady like you,
thig13.4:20.2	a senior nun who beautifies the Sangha,
thig13.4:20.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges,
thig13.4:20.4	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
thig13.4:21.1	Give me permission ma’am,
thig13.4:21.2	I wish to go to Sāvatthī,
thig13.4:21.3	where I shall roar my lion’s roar
thig13.4:21.4	before the best of Buddhas.”
thig13.4:22.1	“Sundarī, see the Teacher!
thig13.4:22.2	Golden colored, golden skinned,
thig13.4:22.3	tamer of the untamed,
thig13.4:22.4	the Awakened One who fears nothing from any quarter.”
thig13.4:23.1	“See Sundarī coming,
thig13.4:23.2	liberated, free of attachments.
thig13.4:23.3	desireless, detached,
thig13.4:23.4	her task completed, without defilements.”
thig13.4:24.1	“Having set forth from Bārāṇasī
thig13.4:24.2	and come to your presence, great hero,
thig13.4:24.3	your disciple Sundarī
thig13.4:24.4	bows at your feet.
thig13.4:25.1	You are the Buddha, you are the Teacher,
thig13.4:25.2	I am your rightful daughter, brahmin,
thig13.4:25.3	born of your mouth.
thig13.4:25.4	I’ve completed the task and am free of defilements.”
thig13.4:26.1	“Then welcome, good lady,
thig13.4:26.2	you’re by no means unwelcome.
thig13.4:26.3	For this is how the tamed come
thig13.4:26.4	bowing at the Teacher’s feet;
thig13.4:26.5	desireless, detached,
thig13.4:26.6	the task completed, without defilements.”
thig13.5:0.1	Verses of the Senior Nuns
thig13.5:0.2	The Book of the Twenties
thig13.5:0.3	Subhā, the Smith’s Daughter
thig13.5:1.1	“I was so young, my clothes so fresh,
thig13.5:1.2	at that time I heard the teaching.
thig13.5:1.3	Being diligent,
thig13.5:1.4	I comprehended the truth;
thig13.5:2.1	and then I became profoundly dispassionate
thig13.5:2.2	towards all sensual pleasures.
thig13.5:2.3	Seeing fear in identity,
thig13.5:2.4	I longed for renunciation.
thig13.5:3.1	Giving up my family circle,
thig13.5:3.2	bonded servants and workers,
thig13.5:3.3	and my flourishing villages and lands,
thig13.5:3.4	so delightful and pleasant,
thig13.5:4.1	I went forth;
thig13.5:4.2	all that is no small wealth.
thig13.5:4.3	Now that I’ve gone forth in faith like this,
thig13.5:4.4	in the true teaching so well proclaimed,
thig13.5:5.1	since I desire to have nothing,
thig13.5:5.2	it would not be appropriate
thig13.5:5.3	to take back gold and money,
thig13.5:5.4	having already got rid of them.
thig13.5:6.1	Money or gold
thig13.5:6.2	doesn’t lead to peace and awakening.
thig13.5:6.3	It doesn’t befit an ascetic,
thig13.5:6.4	it’s not the wealth of the noble ones;
thig13.5:7.1	it’s just greed and vanity,
thig13.5:7.2	confusion and growing decadence,
thig13.5:7.3	dubious, troublesome—
thig13.5:7.4	there is nothing lasting there.
thig13.5:8.1	Depraved and heedless,
thig13.5:8.2	unenlightened folk, their hearts corrupt,
thig13.5:8.3	fight each other,
thig13.5:8.4	creating conflict.
thig13.5:9.1	Killing, caging, misery,
thig13.5:9.2	loss, grief, and lamentation;
thig13.5:9.3	those sunk in sensual pleasures
thig13.5:9.4	see many disastrous things.
thig13.5:10.1	My family, why do you urge me on
thig13.5:10.2	to pleasures, as if you were my enemies?
thig13.5:10.3	You know I’ve gone forth,
thig13.5:10.4	seeing fear in sensual pleasures.
thig13.5:11.1	It’s not due to gold, coined or uncoined,
thig13.5:11.2	that defilements come to an end.
thig13.5:11.3	Sensual pleasures are enemies and murderers,
thig13.5:11.4	hostile forces that bind you to thorns.
thig13.5:12.1	My family, why do you urge me on
thig13.5:12.2	to pleasures, as if you were my enemies?
thig13.5:12.3	You know I’ve gone forth,
thig13.5:12.4	shaven, wrapped in my outer robe.
thig13.5:13.1	Leftovers as gleanings,
thig13.5:13.2	and cast-off rags as robes—
thig13.5:13.3	that’s what’s fitting for me,
thig13.5:13.4	the essentials of the homeless life.
thig13.5:14.1	Great hermits expel sensual pleasures,
thig13.5:14.2	both human and divine.
thig13.5:14.3	Safe in their sanctuary, they are freed,
thig13.5:14.4	having found unshakable happiness.
thig13.5:15.1	May I not encounter sensual pleasures,
thig13.5:15.2	for no shelter is found in them.
thig13.5:15.3	Sensual pleasures are enemies and murderers,
thig13.5:15.4	as painful as a bonfire.
thig13.5:16.1	Greed is an obstacle, a threat,
thig13.5:16.2	full of anguish and thorns;
thig13.5:16.3	it is out of balance,
thig13.5:16.4	a great gateway to confusion.
thig13.5:17.1	Hazardous and terrifying,
thig13.5:17.2	sensual pleasures are like a snake’s head,
thig13.5:17.3	where fools delight,
thig13.5:17.4	the blind ordinary folk.
thig13.5:18.1	Stuck in the swamp of sensuality,
thig13.5:18.2	there are so many ignorant in the world.
thig13.5:18.3	They know nothing of the end
thig13.5:18.4	of rebirth and death.
thig13.5:19.1	Because of sensual pleasures,
thig13.5:19.2	people jump right on to the path that goes to a bad place.
thig13.5:19.3	So many walk the path
thig13.5:19.4	that brings disease onto themselves.
thig13.5:20.1	That’s how sensual pleasures create enemies;
thig13.5:20.2	they are so tormenting, so corrupting,
thig13.5:20.3	trapping beings with the world’s material delights,
thig13.5:20.4	they are nothing less than the bonds of death.
thig13.5:21.1	Maddening, enticing,
thig13.5:21.2	sensual pleasures derange the mind.
thig13.5:21.3	They’re a snare laid by Māra
thig13.5:21.4	for the corruption of beings.
thig13.5:22.1	Sensual pleasures are infinitely dangerous,
thig13.5:22.2	they’re full of suffering, a terrible poison;
thig13.5:22.3	offering little gratification, they’re makers of strife,
thig13.5:22.4	withering bright qualities away.
thig13.5:23.1	Since I’ve created so much ruination
thig13.5:23.2	because of sensual pleasures,
thig13.5:23.3	I will not relapse to them again,
thig13.5:23.4	but will always delight in quenching.
thig13.5:24.1	Fighting against sensual pleasures,
thig13.5:24.2	longing for that cool state,
thig13.5:24.3	I shall meditate diligently
thig13.5:24.4	for the ending of all fetters.
thig13.5:25.1	Sorrowless, stainless, secure:
thig13.5:25.2	I’ll follow that path,
thig13.5:25.3	the straight noble eightfold way
thig13.5:25.4	by which the hermits have crossed over.”
thig13.5:26.1	“Look at this: Subhā the smith’s daughter,
thig13.5:26.2	standing firm in the teaching.
thig13.5:26.3	She has entered the imperturbable state,
thig13.5:26.4	meditating at the root of a tree.
thig13.5:27.1	It’s just eight days since she went forth,
thig13.5:27.2	full of faith in the beautiful teaching.
thig13.5:27.3	Guided by Uppalavaṇṇā,
thig13.5:27.4	she is master of the three knowledges, destroyer of death.
thig13.5:28.1	This one is freed from slavery and debt,
thig13.5:28.2	a nun with faculties developed.
thig13.5:28.3	Detached from all attachments,
thig13.5:28.4	she has completed the task and is free of defilements.”
thig13.5:29.1	Thus did Sakka, lord of all creatures,
thig13.5:29.2	along with a host of gods,
thig13.5:29.3	having come by their psychic powers,
thig13.5:29.4	honor Subhā, the smith’s daughter.
thig13.5:31.1	The Book of the Twenties is finished.
thig14.1:0.1	Verses of the Senior Nuns
thig14.1:0.2	The Book of the Thirties
thig14.1:0.3	Subhā of Jīvaka’s Mango Grove
thig14.1:1.1	Going to the lovely mango grove
thig14.1:1.2	of Jīvaka, the nun Subhā
thig14.1:1.3	was held up by a rascal.
thig14.1:1.4	Subhā said this to him:
thig14.1:2.1	“What harm have I done to you,
thig14.1:2.2	that you stand in my way?
thig14.1:2.3	Sir, it’s not proper that a man
thig14.1:2.4	should touch a woman gone forth.
thig14.1:3.1	This training was taught by the Holy One,
thig14.1:3.2	it is a serious matter in my teacher’s instructions.
thig14.1:3.3	I am pure and rid of blemishes,
thig14.1:3.4	so why do you stand in my way?
thig14.1:4.1	One whose mind is sullied against one unsullied;
thig14.1:4.2	one who is lustful against one free of lust;
thig14.1:4.3	unblemished, my mind is freed in every respect,
thig14.1:4.4	so why do you stand in my way?”
thig14.1:5.1	“You’re young and flawless—
thig14.1:5.2	what will going-forth do for you?
thig14.1:5.3	Throw away the ocher robe,
thig14.1:5.4	come and play in the blossom grove.
thig14.1:6.1	Everywhere, the scent of pollen wafts sweet,
thig14.1:6.2	born of the flowering woods.
thig14.1:6.3	The start of spring is a happy time—
thig14.1:6.4	come and play in the blossom grove.
thig14.1:7.1	And trees crested with flowers
thig14.1:7.2	cry out, as it were, in the breeze.
thig14.1:7.3	But what kind of fun will you have
thig14.1:7.4	if you plunge into the woods all alone?
thig14.1:8.1	Frequented by packs of predators,
thig14.1:8.2	and she-elephants aroused by rutting bulls;
thig14.1:8.3	you wish to go without a friend
thig14.1:8.4	to the deserted, awe-inspiring forest.
thig14.1:9.1	Like a shining doll of gold,
thig14.1:9.2	like a nymph wandering in a park of colorful vines,
thig14.1:9.3	your matchless beauty will shine
thig14.1:9.4	in graceful clothes of exquisite muslin.
thig14.1:10.1	I’ll be under your sway,
thig14.1:10.2	if we are to stay in the forest.
thig14.1:10.3	I love no creature more than you,
thig14.1:10.4	O pixie with such bashful eyes.
thig14.1:11.1	Were you to take up my invitation—
thig14.1:11.2	‘Come, be happy, and live in a house’—
thig14.1:11.3	you’ll stay in a longhouse sheltered from wind;
thig14.1:11.4	let the ladies look to your needs.
thig14.1:12.1	Dressed in exquisite muslin,
thig14.1:12.2	put on your garlands and your cosmetics.
thig14.1:12.3	I’ll make all sorts of adornments for you,
thig14.1:12.4	of gold and gems and pearls.
thig14.1:13.1	Climb onto a costly bed,
thig14.1:13.2	its coverlet so clean and nice,
thig14.1:13.3	with a new woolen mattress,
thig14.1:13.4	so fragrant, sprinkled with sandalwood.
thig14.1:14.1	As a blue lily risen from the water
thig14.1:14.2	remains untouched by men,
thig14.1:14.3	so too, O chaste and holy lady,
thig14.1:14.4	your limbs grow old unshared.”
thig14.1:15.1	“This carcass is full of carrion, it swells
thig14.1:15.2	the charnel ground, for its nature is to fall apart.
thig14.1:15.3	What do you think is so essential in it
thig14.1:15.4	that you stare at me so crazily?”
thig14.1:16.1	“Your eyes are like those of a doe,
thig14.1:16.2	or a pixie in the mountains;
thig14.1:16.3	seeing them,
thig14.1:16.4	my sensual desire grows all the more.
thig14.1:17.1	Set in your flawless face of golden sheen,
thig14.1:17.2	your eyes compare to a blue lily’s bud;
thig14.1:17.3	seeing them,
thig14.1:17.4	my sensual excitement grows all the more.
thig14.1:18.1	Though you may wander far, I’ll still think of you,
thig14.1:18.2	with your lashes so long, and your vision so clear.
thig14.1:18.3	I love no eyes more than yours,
thig14.1:18.4	O pixie with such bashful eyes.”
thig14.1:19.1	“You’re setting out on the wrong road!
thig14.1:19.2	You’re looking to take the moon for your toy!
thig14.1:19.3	You’re trying to leap over Mount Meru!
thig14.1:19.4	You, who are hunting a child of the Buddha!
thig14.1:20.1	For in this world with all its gods,
thig14.1:20.2	there will be no more lust anywhere in me.
thig14.1:20.3	I don’t even know what kind it could be,
thig14.1:20.4	it’s been smashed root and all by the path.
thig14.1:21.1	Cast out like sparks from fiery coals,
thig14.1:21.2	it’s worth no more than a bowl of poison.
thig14.1:21.3	I don’t even see what kind it could be,
thig14.1:21.4	it’s been smashed root and all by the path.
thig14.1:22.1	Well may you try to seduce the type of lady
thig14.1:22.2	who has not reflected on these things,
thig14.1:22.3	or who has never attended the Teacher:
thig14.1:22.4	but *this* is a lady who knows—now you’re in trouble!
thig14.1:23.1	No matter if I am reviled or praised,
thig14.1:23.2	or feel pleasure or pain: I stay mindful.
thig14.1:23.3	Knowing that conditions are ugly,
thig14.1:23.4	my mind clings to nothing.
thig14.1:24.1	I am a disciple of the Holy One,
thig14.1:24.2	riding in the carriage of the eightfold path.
thig14.1:24.3	The dart pulled out, free of defilements,
thig14.1:24.4	I’m happy to have reached an empty place.
thig14.1:25.1	I’ve seen brightly painted
thig14.1:25.2	dolls and wooden puppets,
thig14.1:25.3	tied to sticks and strings,
thig14.1:25.4	and made to dance in many ways.
thig14.1:26.1	But when the sticks and strings are taken off—
thig14.1:26.2	loosed, disassembled, dismantled,
thig14.1:26.3	irrecoverable, stripped to parts—
thig14.1:26.4	on what could the mind be fixed?
thig14.1:27.1	That’s what my body is really like,
thig14.1:27.2	without those things it can’t go on.
thig14.1:27.3	This being so,
thig14.1:27.4	on what could the mind be fixed?
thig14.1:28.1	It’s like when you see a mural on a wall,
thig14.1:28.2	painted with orpiment,
thig14.1:28.3	and your vision gets confused,
thig14.1:28.4	falsely perceiving that it is a person.
thig14.1:29.1	Though it’s as worthless as a magic trick,
thig14.1:29.2	or a golden tree seen in a dream,
thig14.1:29.3	you blindly chase what is hollow,
thig14.1:29.4	like a puppet show among the people.
thig14.1:30.1	An eye is just a ball in a socket,
thig14.1:30.2	with a pupil in the middle, and tears,
thig14.1:30.3	and mucus comes from there as well,
thig14.1:30.4	and so different eye-parts are lumped all together.”
thig14.1:31.1	The pretty lady ripped out her eye.
thig14.1:31.2	With no attachment in her mind at all, she said:
thig14.1:31.3	“Come now, take this eye,”
thig14.1:31.4	and gave it to the man right then.
thig14.1:32.1	And at that moment he lost his lust,
thig14.1:32.2	and asked for her forgiveness:
thig14.1:32.3	“May you be well, O chaste and holy lady;
thig14.1:32.4	such a thing will not happen again.
thig14.1:33.1	Attacking a person such as this
thig14.1:33.2	is like holding on to a blazing fire,
thig14.1:33.3	or grabbing a deadly viper!
thig14.1:33.4	May you be well, please forgive me.”
thig14.1:34.1	When that nun was released
thig14.1:34.2	she went to the presence of the excellent Buddha.
thig14.1:34.3	Seeing the one with excellent marks of merit,
thig14.1:34.4	her eye became just as it was before.

thig15.1:0.2	The Book of the Forties
thig15.1:0.3	Isidāsī
thig15.1:1.1	In Pāṭaliputta, the cream of the world,
thig15.1:1.2	the city named for a flower,
thig15.1:1.3	there were two nuns from the Sakyan clan,
thig15.1:1.4	both of them ladies of quality.
thig15.1:2.1	One was named Isidāsī, the second Bodhī.
thig15.1:2.2	They both were accomplished in ethics,
thig15.1:2.3	lovers of meditation and chanting,
thig15.1:2.4	learned, crushing corruptions.
thig15.1:3.1	They wandered for alms and had their meal.
thig15.1:3.2	When they had washed their bowls,
thig15.1:3.3	they sat happily in a private place
thig15.1:3.4	and started a conversation.
thig15.1:4.1	“You’re so lovely, Venerable Isidāsī,
thig15.1:4.2	your youth has not yet faded.
thig15.1:4.3	What problem did you see that made you
thig15.1:4.4	dedicate your life to renunciation?”
thig15.1:5.1	Being pressed like this in private,
thig15.1:5.2	Isidāsī, skilled in teaching Dhamma,
thig15.1:5.3	voiced the following words.
thig15.1:5.4	“Bodhī, hear how I went forth.
thig15.1:6.1	In the fine town of Ujjenī,
thig15.1:6.2	my father was a financier, a good and moral man.
thig15.1:6.3	I was his only daughter,
thig15.1:6.4	dear, beloved, and cherished.
thig15.1:7.1	Then some suitors came for me
thig15.1:7.2	from the top family of Sāketa.
thig15.1:7.3	They were sent by a financier abounding in wealth,
thig15.1:7.4	to whom my father then gave me as daughter-in-law.
thig15.1:8.1	Come morning and come night,
thig15.1:8.2	I bowed with my head to the feet
thig15.1:8.3	of my father and mother-in-law,
thig15.1:8.4	just as I had been told.
thig15.1:9.1	Whenever I saw my husband’s sisters,
thig15.1:9.2	his brothers, his servants,
thig15.1:9.3	or even he, my one and only,
thig15.1:9.4	I nervously gave them a seat.
thig15.1:10.1	Whatever they wanted—food and drink,
thig15.1:10.2	treats, or whatever was in the cupboard—
thig15.1:10.3	I brought out and offered to them,
thig15.1:10.4	ensuring each got what was fitting.
thig15.1:11.1	Having risen bright and early,
thig15.1:11.2	I approached the main house,
thig15.1:11.3	washed my hands and feet,
thig15.1:11.4	and went to my husband with joined palms.
thig15.1:12.1	Taking a comb, adornments,
thig15.1:12.2	eyeshadow, and a mirror,
thig15.1:12.3	I myself did the makeup for my husband,
thig15.1:12.4	as if I were his beautician.
thig15.1:13.1	I myself cooked the rice;
thig15.1:13.2	I myself washed the pots.
thig15.1:13.3	I looked after my husband
thig15.1:13.4	like a mother her only child.
thig15.1:14.1	Thus I showed my devotion to him,
thig15.1:14.2	a loving, virtuous, and humble servant,
thig15.1:14.3	getting up early, and working tirelessly:
thig15.1:14.4	yet still my husband did me wrong.
thig15.1:15.1	He said to his mother and father:
thig15.1:15.2	“I’ll take my leave and go,
thig15.1:15.3	I can’t stand to live together with Isidāsī
thig15.1:15.4	staying in the same house.”
thig15.1:16.1	“Son, don’t speak like this!
thig15.1:16.2	Isidāsī is astute and competent,
thig15.1:16.3	she gets up early and works tirelessly,
thig15.1:16.4	son, why doesn’t she please you?”
thig15.1:17.1	“She hasn’t done anything to hurt me,
thig15.1:17.2	but I just can’t stand to live with her.
thig15.1:17.3	As far as I’m concerned, she’s just horrible.
thig15.1:17.4	I’ve had enough, I’ll take my leave and go.”
thig15.1:18.1	When they heard his words,
thig15.1:18.2	my father-in-law and mother-in-law asked me:
thig15.1:18.3	“What did you do wrong?
thig15.1:18.4	Tell us honestly, have no fear.”
thig15.1:19.1	“I’ve done nothing wrong,
thig15.1:19.2	I haven’t hurt him, or said anything bad.
thig15.1:19.3	What can I possibly do,
thig15.1:19.4	when my husband finds me so hateful?”
thig15.1:20.1	They led me back to my father’s home,
thig15.1:20.2	distraught, overcome with suffering, and said:
thig15.1:20.3	“By caring for our son,
thig15.1:20.4	we’ve lost her, so lovely and lucky!”
thig15.1:21.1	Next my dad gave me to the household
thig15.1:21.2	of a second wealthy family-man.
thig15.1:21.3	For this he got half the bride-price
thig15.1:21.4	of that which the financier paid.
thig15.1:22.1	In his house I also lived a month,
thig15.1:22.2	before he too wanted me gone;
thig15.1:22.3	though I served him like a slave,
thig15.1:22.4	virtuous and doing no wrong.
thig15.1:23.1	My father then spoke to a beggar for alms,
thig15.1:23.2	a tamer of others and of himself:
thig15.1:23.3	“Be my son-in-law;
thig15.1:23.4	set aside your rags and bowl.”
thig15.1:24.1	He stayed a fortnight before he said to my dad:
thig15.1:24.2	“Give me back my rag robes,
thig15.1:24.3	my bowl, and my cup—
thig15.1:24.4	I’ll wander begging for alms again.”
thig15.1:25.1	So then my mum and my dad
thig15.1:25.2	and my whole group of relatives said:
thig15.1:25.3	“What has not been done for you here?
thig15.1:25.4	Quickly, tell us what we can do for you!”
thig15.1:26.1	When they spoke to him like this he said,
thig15.1:26.2	“If I can make do for myself, that is enough.
thig15.1:26.3	I can’t stand to live together with Isidāsī
thig15.1:26.4	staying in the same house.”
thig15.1:27.1	Released, he left.
thig15.1:27.2	But I sat all alone contemplating:
thig15.1:27.3	“Having taken my leave, I’ll go,
thig15.1:27.4	either to die or to go forth.”
thig15.1:28.1	But then the venerable lady Jinadattā,
thig15.1:28.2	learned and virtuous,
thig15.1:28.3	who had memorized the monastic law,
thig15.1:28.4	came to my dad’s house in search of alms.
thig15.1:29.1	When I saw her,
thig15.1:29.2	I got up from my seat and prepared it for her.
thig15.1:29.3	When she had taken her seat,
thig15.1:29.4	I honored her feet and offered her a meal,
thig15.1:30.1	satisfying her with food and drink,
thig15.1:30.2	treats, or whatever was in the cupboard.
thig15.1:30.3	Then I said:
thig15.1:30.4	“Ma’am, I wish to go forth!”
thig15.1:31.1	But my dad said to me:
thig15.1:31.2	“Child, practice Dhamma right here!
thig15.1:31.3	Satisfy ascetics and twice-born brahmins
thig15.1:31.4	with food and drink.”
thig15.1:32.1	Then I said to my dad,
thig15.1:32.2	crying, my joined palms raised to him:
thig15.1:32.3	“I’ve done bad things in the past;
thig15.1:32.4	I shall wear that bad deed away.”
thig15.1:33.1	And my dad said to me:
thig15.1:33.2	“May you attain awakening, the highest state,
thig15.1:33.3	and may you find the extinguishment
thig15.1:33.4	that was realized by the best of men!”
thig15.1:34.1	I bowed down to my mother and father,
thig15.1:34.2	and my whole group of relatives;
thig15.1:34.3	and then, seven days after going forth,
thig15.1:34.4	I realized the three knowledges.
thig15.1:35.1	I know my last seven lives;
thig15.1:35.2	I shall relate to you the deeds
thig15.1:35.3	of which this life is the fruit and result:
thig15.1:35.4	focus your whole mind on that.
thig15.1:36.1	In the city of Erakacca
thig15.1:36.2	I was a goldsmith with lots of money.
thig15.1:36.3	Drunk on the pride of youth,
thig15.1:36.4	I had sex with someone else’s wife.
thig15.1:37.1	Having passed away from there,
thig15.1:37.2	I burned in hell for a long time.
thig15.1:37.3	Rising up from there
thig15.1:37.4	I was conceived in a monkey’s womb.
thig15.1:38.1	When I was only seven days old,
thig15.1:38.2	I was castrated by the monkey chief.
thig15.1:38.3	This was the fruit of that deed,
thig15.1:38.4	because of adultery with another’s wife.
thig15.1:39.1	Having passed away from there,
thig15.1:39.2	passing away in Sindhava grove,
thig15.1:39.3	I was conceived in the womb
thig15.1:39.4	of a lame, one-eyed she-goat.
thig15.1:40.1	I carried children on my back for twelve years,
thig15.1:40.2	and all the while I was castrated,
thig15.1:40.3	worm-eaten, and tail-less,
thig15.1:40.4	because of adultery with another’s wife.
thig15.1:41.1	Having passed away from there,
thig15.1:41.2	I was reborn in a cow
thig15.1:41.3	owned by a cattle merchant.
thig15.1:41.4	A red calf, castrated, for twelve months
thig15.1:42.1	I drew a big plow.
thig15.1:42.2	I shouldered a cart,
thig15.1:42.3	blind, tail-less, feeble,
thig15.1:42.4	because of adultery with another’s wife.
thig15.1:43.1	Having passed away from there,
thig15.1:43.2	I was born of a slave in the street,
thig15.1:43.3	neither woman nor man,
thig15.1:43.4	because of adultery with another’s wife.
thig15.1:44.1	I died at thirty years of age,
thig15.1:44.2	and was reborn as a girl in a carter’s family.
thig15.1:44.3	We were poor, of little wealth,
thig15.1:44.4	greatly oppressed by creditors.
thig15.1:45.1	Because of the huge interest we owed,
thig15.1:45.2	I was dragged away screaming,
thig15.1:45.3	taken by force from the family home
thig15.1:45.4	by a caravan leader.
thig15.1:46.1	When I was sixteen years old,
thig15.1:46.2	his son named Giridāsa,
thig15.1:46.3	seeing that I was a girl of marriageable age,
thig15.1:46.4	took me as his wife.
thig15.1:47.1	He also had another wife,
thig15.1:47.2	a virtuous and well-known lady of quality,
thig15.1:47.3	faithful to her husband;
thig15.1:47.4	yet I stirred up resentment in her.
thig15.1:48.1	As the fruit of that deed,
thig15.1:48.2	they abandoned me and left,
thig15.1:48.3	though I served them like a slave.
thig15.1:48.4	Now I’ve made an end to this as well.”

thig16.1:0.1	Verses of the Senior Nuns
thig16.1:0.2	The Great Book
thig16.1:0.3	Sumedhā
thig16.1:1.1	In Mantāvatī city, Sumedhā,
thig16.1:1.2	the daughter of King Koñca’s chief queen,
thig16.1:1.3	was converted by those
thig16.1:1.4	who practice the Buddha’s teaching.
thig16.1:2.1	She was virtuous, a brilliant speaker,
thig16.1:2.2	learned, and trained in the Buddha’s instructions.
thig16.1:2.3	She went up to her mother and father and said:
thig16.1:2.4	“Pay heed, both of you!
thig16.1:3.1	I delight in extinguishment!
thig16.1:3.2	No life is eternal, not even that of the gods;
thig16.1:3.3	what then of sensual pleasures, so hollow,
thig16.1:3.4	offering little gratification and much anguish.
thig16.1:4.1	Sensual pleasures are bitter as the venom of a snake,
thig16.1:4.2	yet fools are infatuated by them.
thig16.1:4.3	Sent to hell for a very long time,
thig16.1:4.4	they are beaten and tortured.
thig16.1:5.1	Those who grow in wickedness
thig16.1:5.2	always sorrow in the underworld due to their own bad deeds.
thig16.1:5.3	They’re fools, unrestrained in body,
thig16.1:5.4	mind, and speech.
thig16.1:6.1	Those witless, senseless fools,
thig16.1:6.2	obstructed by the origin of suffering,
thig16.1:6.3	are ignorant, not understanding the noble truths
thig16.1:6.4	when they are being taught.
thig16.1:7.1	Most people, mum, ignorant of the truths
thig16.1:7.2	taught by the excellent Buddha,
thig16.1:7.3	look forward to the next life,
thig16.1:7.4	longing for rebirth among the gods.
thig16.1:8.1	Yet even rebirth among the gods
thig16.1:8.2	in an impermanent state is not eternal.
thig16.1:8.3	But fools are not scared
thig16.1:8.4	of being reborn time and again.
thig16.1:9.1	Four lower realms and two other realms
thig16.1:9.2	may be gained somehow or other.
thig16.1:9.3	But for those who end up in a lower realm,
thig16.1:9.4	there is no way to go forth in the hells.
thig16.1:10.1	May you both grant me permission to go forth
thig16.1:10.2	in the dispensation of him of the ten powers.
thig16.1:10.3	Living at ease, I shall apply myself
thig16.1:10.4	to giving up rebirth and death.
thig16.1:11.1	What’s the point in hope, in a new life,
thig16.1:11.2	in this useless, hollow body?
thig16.1:11.3	Grant me permission, I shall go forth
thig16.1:11.4	to make an end of craving for a new life.
thig16.1:12.1	A Buddha has arisen, the time has come,
thig16.1:12.2	the unlucky moment has passed.
thig16.1:12.3	As long as I live I’ll never betray
thig16.1:12.4	my ethical precepts or my celibate path.”
thig16.1:13.1	Then Sumedhā said to her parents:
thig16.1:13.2	“So long as I remain a lay person,
thig16.1:13.3	I’ll refuse to eat any food,
thig16.1:13.4	until I’ve fallen under the sway of death.”
thig16.1:14.1	Upset, her mother burst into tears,
thig16.1:14.2	while her father, though grieved,
thig16.1:14.3	tried his best to persuade her
thig16.1:14.4	as she lay collapsed on the longhouse roof.
thig16.1:15.1	“Get up child, why do you grieve so?
thig16.1:15.2	You’re already betrothed to be married!
thig16.1:15.3	King Anīkaratta the handsome
thig16.1:15.4	is in Vāraṇavatī: he is your betrothed.
thig16.1:16.1	You shall be the chief queen,
thig16.1:16.2	wife of King Anīkaratta.
thig16.1:16.3	Ethical precepts, the celibate path—
thig16.1:16.4	going forth is hard to do, my child.
thig16.1:17.1	As a royal there is command, wealth, authority,
thig16.1:17.2	and the happiness of possessions.
thig16.1:17.3	Enjoy sensual pleasures while you’re still young!
thig16.1:17.4	Let your wedding take place, my child!”
thig16.1:18.1	Then Sumedhā said to him:
thig16.1:18.2	“Let this not come to pass! Existence is hollow!
thig16.1:18.3	I shall either go forth or die,
thig16.1:18.4	but I shall never marry.
thig16.1:19.1	Why cling to this rotting body so foul,
thig16.1:19.2	stinking of fluids,
thig16.1:19.3	a horrifying water-bag of corpses,
thig16.1:19.4	always oozing, full of filth?
thig16.1:20.1	Knowing it like I do, what’s the point?
thig16.1:20.2	A carcass is vile, smeared with flesh and blood,
thig16.1:20.3	food for birds and swarms of worms—
thig16.1:20.4	why have we been given it?
thig16.1:21.1	Before long the body, bereft of consciousness,
thig16.1:21.2	is carried out to the charnel ground,
thig16.1:21.3	to be tossed aside like an old log
thig16.1:21.4	by relatives in disgust.
thig16.1:22.1	When they’ve tossed it away in the charnel ground,
thig16.1:22.2	to be eaten by others, your own parents
thig16.1:22.3	bathe themselves, disgusted;
thig16.1:22.4	what then of people at large?
thig16.1:23.1	They’re attached to this hollow carcass,
thig16.1:23.2	this mass of sinews and bone;
thig16.1:23.3	this rotting body
thig16.1:23.4	full of saliva, tears, feces, and pus.
thig16.1:24.1	If anyone were to dissect it,
thig16.1:24.2	turning it inside out,
thig16.1:24.3	the unbearable stench
thig16.1:24.4	would disgust even their own mother.
thig16.1:25.1	Properly examining
thig16.1:25.2	the aggregates, elements, and sense fields
thig16.1:25.3	as conditioned, rooted in birth, suffering—
thig16.1:25.4	why would I wish for marriage?
thig16.1:26.1	Let three hundred sharp swords
thig16.1:26.2	fall on my body everyday!
thig16.1:26.3	Even if the slaughter lasted 100 years
thig16.1:26.4	it’d be worth it if it led to the end of suffering.
thig16.1:27.1	One who understands the Teacher’s words
thig16.1:27.2	would put up with this slaughter:
thig16.1:27.3	‘Long for you is transmigration
thig16.1:27.4	being killed time and time again.’
thig16.1:28.1	Among gods and humans,
thig16.1:28.2	in the realm of animals or that of demons,
thig16.1:28.3	among the ghosts or in the hells,
thig16.1:28.4	endless killings are seen.
thig16.1:29.1	The hells are full of killing,
thig16.1:29.2	for the corrupt who have fallen to the underworld.
thig16.1:29.3	Even among the gods there is no shelter,
thig16.1:29.4	for no happiness excels extinguishment.
thig16.1:30.1	Those who are committed to the dispensation
thig16.1:30.2	of him of the ten powers attain extinguishment.
thig16.1:30.3	Living at ease, they apply themselves
thig16.1:30.4	to giving up rebirth and death.
thig16.1:31.1	On this very day, dad, I shall renounce:
thig16.1:31.2	what’s to enjoy in hollow riches?
thig16.1:31.3	I’m disillusioned with sensual pleasures,
thig16.1:31.4	they’re like vomit, made like a palm stump.”
thig16.1:32.1	As she spoke thus to her father,
thig16.1:32.2	Anīkaratta, to whom she was betrothed,
thig16.1:32.3	approached from Vāraṇavatī
thig16.1:32.4	at the time appointed for the marriage.
thig16.1:33.1	Then Sumedhā took up a knife,
thig16.1:33.2	and cut off her hair, so black, thick, and soft.
thig16.1:33.3	Shutting herself in the longhouse,
thig16.1:33.4	she entered the first absorption.
thig16.1:34.1	And as she entered it there,
thig16.1:34.2	Anīkaratta arrived at the city.
thig16.1:34.3	Then in the longhouse, Sumedhā
thig16.1:34.4	well developed the perception of impermanence.
thig16.1:35.1	As she investigated in meditation,
thig16.1:35.2	Anīkaratta quickly climbed the stairs.
thig16.1:35.3	His limbs adorned with gems and gold,
thig16.1:35.4	he begged Sumedhā with joined palms:
thig16.1:36.1	“As a royal there is command, wealth, authority,
thig16.1:36.2	and the happiness of possessions.
thig16.1:36.3	Enjoy sensual pleasures while you’re still young!
thig16.1:36.4	Sensual pleasures are hard to find in the world!
thig16.1:37.1	I’ve handed royalty to you—
thig16.1:37.2	enjoy riches, give gifts!
thig16.1:37.3	Don’t be sad;
thig16.1:37.4	your parents are upset.”
thig16.1:38.1	Sumedhā, having no use for sensual pleasures,
thig16.1:38.2	and having done away with delusion, spoke right back:
thig16.1:38.3	“Do not take pleasure in sensuality!
thig16.1:38.4	See the danger in sensual pleasures!
thig16.1:39.1	Mandhātā, king of four continents,
thig16.1:39.2	foremost in enjoying sensual pleasures,
thig16.1:39.3	died unsated,
thig16.1:39.4	his desires unfulfilled.
thig16.1:40.1	Were the seven jewels to rain from the sky
thig16.1:40.2	all over the ten directions,
thig16.1:40.3	there would be no sating of sensual pleasures:
thig16.1:40.4	people die insatiable.
thig16.1:41.1	Like a butcher’s knife and chopping block,
thig16.1:41.2	sensual pleasures are like a snake’s head.
thig16.1:41.3	They burn like a fire-brand,
thig16.1:41.4	they resemble a skeleton.
thig16.1:42.1	Sensual pleasures are impermanent and unstable,
thig16.1:42.2	they’re full of suffering, a terrible poison;
thig16.1:42.3	like a hot iron ball,
thig16.1:42.4	the root of misery, their fruit is pain.
thig16.1:43.1	Sensual pleasures are like fruits of a tree,
thig16.1:43.2	like lumps of meat, painful,
thig16.1:43.3	they trick you like a dream;
thig16.1:43.4	sensual pleasures are like borrowed goods.
thig16.1:44.1	Sensual pleasures are like swords and stakes;
thig16.1:44.2	a disease, a boil, misery and trouble.
thig16.1:44.3	Like a pit of glowing coals,
thig16.1:44.4	the root of misery, fear and slaughter.
thig16.1:45.1	Thus sensual pleasures have been explained
thig16.1:45.2	to be obstructions, so full of suffering.
thig16.1:45.3	Please leave! As for me,
thig16.1:45.4	I have no trust in a new life.
thig16.1:46.1	What can someone else do for me
thig16.1:46.2	when their own head is burning?
thig16.1:46.3	When stalked by old age and death,
thig16.1:46.4	you should strive to destroy them.”
thig16.1:47.1	She opened the door
thig16.1:47.2	and saw her parents with Anīkaratta,
thig16.1:47.3	sitting crying on the floor.
thig16.1:47.4	And so she said this:
thig16.1:48.1	“Transmigration is long for fools,
thig16.1:48.2	crying again and again at that with no known beginning—
thig16.1:48.3	the death of a father,
thig16.1:48.4	the killing of a brother or of themselves.
thig16.1:49.1	Remember the ocean of tears, of milk, of blood—
thig16.1:49.2	transmigration with no known beginning.
thig16.1:49.3	Remember the bones piled up
thig16.1:49.4	by beings transmigrating.
thig16.1:50.1	Remember the four oceans
thig16.1:50.2	compared with tears, milk, and blood.
thig16.1:50.3	Remember bones piled up high as Mount Vipula
thig16.1:50.4	in the course of a single eon.
thig16.1:51.1	Transmigration with no known beginning
thig16.1:51.2	is compared to this broad land of India;
thig16.1:51.3	if divided into lumps the size of jujube seeds,
thig16.1:51.4	they’d still be fewer than his mother’s mothers.
thig16.1:52.1	Remember the grass, sticks, and leaves,
thig16.1:52.2	compare that with no known beginning:
thig16.1:52.3	if split into pieces four inches in size,
thig16.1:52.4	they’d still be fewer than his father’s fathers.
thig16.1:53.1	Remember the one-eyed turtle and the yoke with a hole
thig16.1:53.2	blown in the ocean from east to west—
thig16.1:53.3	sticking the head in the hole
thig16.1:53.4	is a metaphor for gaining a human birth.
thig16.1:54.1	Remember the form of this unlucky body,
thig16.1:54.2	insubstantial as a lump of foam.
thig16.1:54.3	See the aggregates as impermanent,
thig16.1:54.4	remember the hells so full of anguish.
thig16.1:55.1	Remember those swelling the charnel grounds
thig16.1:55.2	again and again in life after life.
thig16.1:55.3	Remember the threat of the crocodile!
thig16.1:55.4	Remember the four truths!
thig16.1:56.1	When the deathless is there to be found,
thig16.1:56.2	why would you drink the five bitter poisons?
thig16.1:56.3	For every enjoyment of sensual pleasures
thig16.1:56.4	is so much more bitter than them.
thig16.1:57.1	When the deathless is there to be found,
thig16.1:57.2	why would you burn for sensual pleasures?
thig16.1:57.3	For every enjoyment of sensual pleasures
thig16.1:57.4	is burning, boiling, bubbling, seething.
thig16.1:58.1	When there is freedom from enmity,
thig16.1:58.2	why would you want your enemy, sensual pleasures?
thig16.1:58.3	Like kings, fire, robbers, flood, and people you dislike,
thig16.1:58.4	sensual pleasures are very much your enemy.
thig16.1:59.1	When liberation is there to be found,
thig16.1:59.2	what good are sensual pleasures that kill and bind?
thig16.1:59.3	For though unwilling, when sensual pleasures are there,
thig16.1:59.4	they are subject to the pain of killing and binding.
thig16.1:60.1	As a blazing grass torch
thig16.1:60.2	burns one who grasps it without letting go,
thig16.1:60.3	sensual pleasures are like a grass torch,
thig16.1:60.4	burning those who do not let go.
thig16.1:61.1	Don’t give up abundant happiness
thig16.1:61.2	for the trivial joys of sensual pleasure.
thig16.1:61.3	Don’t suffer hardship later,
thig16.1:61.4	like a catfish on a hook.
thig16.1:62.1	Deliberately control yourself among sensual pleasures!
thig16.1:62.2	You’re like a dog fixed to a chain:
thig16.1:62.3	sensual pleasures will surely devour you
thig16.1:62.4	as hungry outcasts would a dog.
thig16.1:63.1	Harnessed to sensual pleasure,
thig16.1:63.2	you undergo endless pain,
thig16.1:63.3	along with much mental anguish:
thig16.1:63.4	relinquish sensual pleasures, they don’t last!
thig16.1:64.1	When the unaging is there to be found,
thig16.1:64.2	what good are sensual pleasures in which is old age?
thig16.1:64.3	All rebirths everywhere
thig16.1:64.4	are bonded to death and sickness.
thig16.1:65.1	This is the ageless, this is the deathless!
thig16.1:65.2	This is the ageless and deathless, the sorrowless state!
thig16.1:65.3	Free of enmity, unconstricted,
thig16.1:65.4	faultless, fearless, without tribulations.
thig16.1:66.1	This deathless has been realized by many;
thig16.1:66.2	even today it can be obtained
thig16.1:66.3	by those who properly apply themselves;
thig16.1:66.4	but it’s impossible if you don’t try.”
thig16.1:67.1	So said Sumedhā,
thig16.1:67.2	lacking delight in conditioned things.
thig16.1:67.3	Soothing Anīkaratta,
thig16.1:67.4	Sumedhā cast her hair on the ground.
thig16.1:68.1	Standing up, Anīkaratta
thig16.1:68.2	raised his joined palms to her father and begged:
thig16.1:68.3	“Let go of Sumedhā, so that she may go forth!
thig16.1:68.4	She will see the truth of liberation.”
thig16.1:69.1	Released by her mother and father,
thig16.1:69.2	she went forth, afraid of grief and fear.
thig16.1:69.3	While still a trainee nun she realized the six direct knowledges,
thig16.1:69.4	along with the highest fruit.
thig16.1:70.1	The extinguishment of the princess
thig16.1:70.2	was incredible and amazing;
thig16.1:70.3	on her deathbed, she declared
thig16.1:70.4	her several past lives.
thig16.1:71.1	“In the time of the Buddha Koṇāgamana,
thig16.1:71.2	we three friends gave the gift
thig16.1:71.3	of a newly-built dwelling
thig16.1:71.4	in the Saṅgha’s monastery.
thig16.1:72.1	Ten times, a hundred times,
thig16.1:72.2	a thousand times, ten thousand times,
thig16.1:72.3	we were reborn among the gods,
thig16.1:72.4	let alone among humans.
thig16.1:73.1	We were mighty among the gods,
thig16.1:73.2	let alone among humans!
thig16.1:73.3	I was queen to a king with the seven treasures—
thig16.1:73.4	I was the treasure of a wife.
thig16.1:74.1	That was the cause, that the origin, that the root,
thig16.1:74.2	that was the acceptance of the dispensation;
thig16.1:74.3	that first meeting culminated in extinguishment
thig16.1:74.4	for one delighting in the teaching.
thig16.1:75.1	So say those who have faith in the words
thig16.1:75.2	of the one unrivaled in wisdom.
thig16.1:75.3	They’re disillusioned with being reborn,
thig16.1:75.4	and being disillusioned they become dispassionate.”
thig16.1:76.1	That is how these verses were recited by the senior nun Sumedhā.
thig16.1:76.2	The Great Book is finished.
thig16.1:77.5	The Verses of the Senior Nuns are finished.

thig2.1:1.3	With mind unified and serene,
thig2.1:1.4	meditate on the ugly aspects of the body.
thig2.1:2.1	Meditate on the signless,
thig2.1:2.2	give up the underlying tendency to conceit;
thig2.1:2.3	and when you comprehend conceit,
thig2.1:2.4	you will live at peace.
thig2.1:3.1	That is how the Buddha regularly advised the senior nun Nandā with these verses.

thig2.3:1.2	so very well freed from the pounding of the pestle!
thig2.3:1.3	My disgusting husband inflated like a mushroom,
thig2.3:1.4	my mortar wafted like an eel.
thig2.3:2.1	Now, as for greed and hate:
thig2.3:2.2	I sear them and sizzle them up.
thig2.3:2.3	Having gone to the root of a tree,
thig2.3:2.4	I meditate happily, thinking, “Oh, what bliss!”

thig2.4:1.2	amounted to the nation of Kāsi.
thig2.4:1.3	By setting that price,
thig2.4:1.4	the townsfolk made me priceless.
thig2.4:2.1	Then, growing disillusioned with my form,
thig2.4:2.2	I became dispassionate.
thig2.4:2.3	Don’t journey on and on,
thig2.4:2.4	transmigrating through rebirths!

thig2.8:1.1	My dear mother, I examined this body,
thig2.8:1.2	up from the soles of the feet,
thig2.8:1.3	and down from the tips of the hairs,
thig2.8:1.4	so impure and foul-smelling.
thig2.8:2.1	Meditating like this,
thig2.8:2.2	all my lust is eradicated.

thig3.1:1.1	In the twenty-five years
thig3.1:1.2	since I went forth,
thig3.1:1.3	I don’t know that I had ever found
thig3.1:1.4	serenity in my mind.
thig3.1:2.1	I had failed to find peace of heart,

thig3.2:2.2	in whom I had faith.
thig3.2:2.3	She taught me the Dhamma:
thig3.2:2.4	the aggregates, sense fields, and elements.
thig3.2:3.1	When I had heard her teaching,
thig3.2:3.2	in accordance with her instructions,
thig3.2:3.3	I sat cross-legged for seven days without moving,
thig3.2:3.4	given over to rapture and bliss.

thig3.3:2.2	and signlessness whenever I want.
thig3.3:2.3	I am the Buddha’s rightful daughter,
thig3.3:2.4	always delighting in quenching.
thig3.3:3.1	All sensual pleasures are cut off,

thig3.4:1.1	Leaving my day’s meditation
thig3.4:1.2	on Vulture’s Peak Mountain,
thig3.4:1.3	I saw an elephant on the riverbank
thig3.4:1.4	having just come up from his bath.
thig3.4:2.1	A man, taking a pole with a hook,
thig3.4:2.2	asked the elephant, “Give me your foot.”
thig3.4:2.3	The elephant presented his foot,
thig3.4:2.4	and the man mounted him.
thig3.4:3.1	Seeing a wild beast so tamed,
thig3.4:3.2	submitting to human control,
thig3.4:3.3	my mind became serene:
thig3.4:3.4	*that* is why I’ve gone to the forest!

thig3.5:1.3	Eighty-four thousand people,
thig3.5:1.4	all named ‘living being’,
thig3.5:1.5	have been burnt in this funeral ground:
thig3.5:1.6	which one do you grieve for?”
thig3.5:2.1	“Oh! For you have plucked the arrow from me,
thig3.5:2.2	so hard to see, stuck in the heart.
thig3.5:2.3	You’ve swept away the grief for my daughter
thig3.5:2.4	in which I once was mired.
thig3.5:3.1	Today I’ve plucked the arrow,
thig3.5:3.2	I’m hungerless, extinguished.
thig3.5:3.3	I go for refuge to that sage, the Buddha,
thig3.5:3.4	to his teaching, and to the Sangha.”

thig3.6:1.1	“What’s up with these people in Rājagaha?
thig3.6:1.2	They sprawl like they’ve been drinking mead!
thig3.6:1.3	They don’t attend on Sukkā
thig3.6:1.4	as she teaches the Buddha’s instructions.
thig3.6:2.1	But the wise—
thig3.6:2.2	it’s as if they drink it up,
thig3.6:2.3	so irresistible, delicious and nutritious,
thig3.6:2.4	like travelers enjoying a cool cloud.”
thig3.6:3.1	“She’s known as Sukkā because of her bright qualities,
thig3.6:3.2	free of greed, serene.

thig3.7:1.4	don’t regret it later.”
thig3.7:2.1	“Sensual pleasures are like swords and stakes
thig3.7:2.2	the aggregates are their chopping block.
thig3.7:2.3	What you call sensual delight
thig3.7:2.4	is now no delight for me.
thig3.7:3.1	Relishing is destroyed in every respect,

thig4.1:0.3	Bhaddā Kāpilānī
thig4.1:1.1	Kassapa is the son and heir of the Buddha,
thig4.1:1.2	whose mind is immersed in samādhi.
thig4.1:1.3	He knows his past lives,
thig4.1:1.4	he sees heaven and places of loss,
thig4.1:2.1	and has attained the end of rebirth:
thig4.1:2.2	that sage has perfect insight.
thig4.1:2.3	It’s because of these three knowledges
thig4.1:2.4	that the brahmin is a master of the three knowledges.
thig4.1:3.1	In exactly the same way, Bhaddā Kāpilānī
thig4.1:3.2	is master of the three knowledges, destroyer of death.
thig4.1:3.3	She bears her final body,
thig4.1:3.4	having vanquished Māra and his mount.
thig4.1:4.1	Seeing the danger of the world,
thig4.1:4.2	both of us went forth.
thig4.1:4.3	Now we are tamed, our defilements have ended;
thig4.1:4.4	we’ve become cooled and quenched.

thig5.10:1.1	Plowing the fields,
thig5.10:1.2	sowing seeds in the ground,
thig5.10:1.3	supporting partners and children,
thig5.10:1.4	young men acquire wealth.
thig5.10:2.1	I am accomplished in ethics,
thig5.10:2.2	and I do the Teacher’s bidding,
thig5.10:2.3	being neither lazy nor restless—
thig5.10:2.4	why then do I not achieve quenching?
thig5.10:3.1	Having washed my feet,
thig5.10:3.2	I took note of the water,
thig5.10:3.3	seeing the foot-washing water
thig5.10:3.4	flowing from high ground to low.
thig5.10:4.1	My mind became serene,
thig5.10:4.2	like a fine thoroughbred steed.
thig5.10:4.3	Then, taking a lamp,
thig5.10:4.4	I entered my dwelling,
thig5.10:4.5	inspected the bed,
thig5.10:4.6	and sat on my cot.
thig5.10:5.1	Then, grabbing the pin,
thig5.10:5.2	I drew out the wick.
thig5.10:5.3	The liberation of my heart
thig5.10:5.4	was like the quenching of the lamp.

thig5.11:1.1	“Taking a pestle,
thig5.11:1.2	young men pound corn.
thig5.11:1.3	Supporting partners and children,
thig5.11:1.4	young men acquire wealth.
thig5.11:2.1	Do the Buddha’s bidding,
thig5.11:2.2	you won’t regret it.
thig5.11:2.3	Having quickly washed your feet,
thig5.11:2.4	sit in a discreet place to meditate.
thig5.11:2.5	Devoted to serenity of heart,
thig5.11:2.6	do the Buddha’s bidding.”
thig5.11:3.1	After hearing her words,
thig5.11:3.2	the instructions of Paṭācārā,
thig5.11:3.3	they washed their feet
thig5.11:3.4	and retired to a discreet place.
thig5.11:3.5	Devoted to serenity of heart,
thig5.11:3.6	they did the Buddha’s bidding.
thig5.11:4.1	In the first watch of the night,
thig5.11:4.2	they recollected their past lives.
thig5.11:4.3	In the middle watch of the night,
thig5.11:4.4	they purified their clairvoyance.
thig5.11:4.5	In the last watch of the night,
thig5.11:4.6	they shattered the mass of darkness.
thig5.11:5.1	They rose and paid homage at her feet:
thig5.11:5.2	“We have done your bidding;
thig5.11:5.3	we shall abide honoring you,
thig5.11:5.4	as the thirty gods honor Indra,
thig5.11:5.5	undefeated in battle.
thig5.11:5.6	Masters of the three knowledges, we are free of defilements.”
thig5.11:6.1	That is how thirty senior nuns declared their enlightenment in the presence of Paṭācārā.

thig5.12:0.3	Candā
thig5.12:1.1	I used to be in a sorry state.
thig5.12:1.2	As a childless widow,
thig5.12:1.3	bereft of friends or relatives,
thig5.12:1.4	I got neither food nor clothes.
thig5.12:2.1	I took a bowl and a staff
thig5.12:2.2	and went begging from family to family.
thig5.12:2.3	For seven years I wandered,
thig5.12:2.4	burned by heat and cold.
thig5.12:3.1	Then I saw a nun
thig5.12:3.2	receiving food and drink.
thig5.12:3.3	Approaching her, I said:
thig5.12:3.4	“Send me forth to homelessness.”
thig5.12:4.1	Out of compassion for me,
thig5.12:4.2	Paṭācārā gave me the going forth.
thig5.12:4.3	Then, having advised me,
thig5.12:4.4	she urged me on to the ultimate goal.
thig5.12:5.1	After hearing her words,
thig5.12:5.2	I did her bidding.
thig5.12:5.3	The lady’s advice was not in vain:
thig5.12:5.4	master of the three knowledges, I am free of defilements.

thig5.1:1.1	In the twenty-five years
thig5.1:1.2	since I went forth
thig5.1:1.3	I have not found peace of mind,
thig5.1:1.4	even for as long as a finger-snap.
thig5.1:2.1	Failing to find peace of heart,
thig5.1:2.2	corrupted by sensual desire,
thig5.1:2.3	I cried with flailing arms
thig5.1:2.4	as I entered a dwelling.
thig5.1:3.1	I approached a nun
thig5.1:3.2	in whom I had faith.
thig5.1:3.3	She taught me the Dhamma:
thig5.1:3.4	the aggregates, sense fields, and elements.
thig5.1:4.1	When I heard her teaching,
thig5.1:4.2	I retired to a discreet place.
thig5.1:4.3	I know my past lives;
thig5.1:4.4	my clairvoyance is purified;
thig5.1:5.1	I comprehend the minds of others;
thig5.1:5.2	my clairaudience is purified;
thig5.1:5.3	I've realized the psychic powers,
thig5.1:5.4	and attained the ending of defilements.
thig5.1:5.5	I have realized the six kinds of direct knowledge,
thig5.1:5.6	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

thig5.2:0.3	Vimalā, the Former Courtesan
thig5.2:1.1	Intoxicated by my appearance,
thig5.2:1.2	my figure, my beauty, my fame,
thig5.2:1.3	and owing to my youth,
thig5.2:1.4	I despised other women.
thig5.2:2.1	I adorned this body,
thig5.2:2.2	so fancy, cooed over by fools,
thig5.2:2.3	and stood at the brothel door,
thig5.2:2.4	like a hunter laying a snare.
thig5.2:3.1	I stripped for them,
thig5.2:3.2	revealing my many hidden treasures.
thig5.2:3.3	Creating an intricate illusion,
thig5.2:3.4	I laughed, teasing those men.
thig5.2:4.1	Today, having wandered for alms,
thig5.2:4.2	my head shaven, wearing the outer robe,
thig5.2:4.3	I sat at the root of a tree to meditate;
thig5.2:4.4	I've gained freedom from thought.
thig5.2:5.1	All bonds are cut off,
thig5.2:5.2	both human and divine.
thig5.2:5.3	Having wiped out all defilements,

thig5.3:1.1	Due to improper attention,
thig5.3:1.2	I was racked by desire for pleasures of the senses.
thig5.3:1.3	I was restless in the past,
thig5.3:1.4	lacking control over my mind.
thig5.3:2.1	Overcome by corruptions,
thig5.3:2.2	pursuing perceptions of the beautiful,
thig5.3:2.3	I gained no peace of mind.
thig5.3:2.4	Under the sway of lustful thoughts,
thig5.3:3.1	thin, pale, and wan,
thig5.3:3.2	for seven years I wandered,
thig5.3:3.3	full of pain,
thig5.3:3.4	finding no happiness by day or night.
thig5.3:4.1	Taking a rope
thig5.3:4.2	I entered deep into the forest, thinking:
thig5.3:4.3	“It’s better that I hang myself
thig5.3:4.4	than I return to a lesser life.”
thig5.3:5.1	I made a strong noose
thig5.3:5.2	and tied it to the branch of a tree.
thig5.3:5.3	Casting it round my neck,
thig5.3:5.4	my mind was freed.

thig5.4:1.2	diseased, filthy, and rotten.
thig5.4:1.3	With mind unified and serene,
thig5.4:1.4	meditate on the ugly aspects of the body:
thig5.4:2.1	as this is, so is that,
thig5.4:2.2	as that is, so is this.
thig5.4:2.3	A foul stink wafts from it,
thig5.4:2.4	it is the fools’ delight.”
thig5.4:3.1	Reviewing my body in such a way,
thig5.4:3.2	tireless all day and night,
thig5.4:3.3	having broken through
thig5.4:3.4	with my own wisdom, I saw.
thig5.4:4.1	Being diligent,
thig5.4:4.2	properly investigating,
thig5.4:4.3	I truly saw the body
thig5.4:4.4	both inside and out.
thig5.4:5.1	Then, growing disillusioned with my body,
thig5.4:5.2	I became dispassionate within.
thig5.4:5.3	Diligent, detached,
thig5.4:5.4	I’m quenched and at peace.

thig5.5:1.1	In the past I worshiped the sacred flame,
thig5.5:1.2	the moon, the sun, and the gods.
thig5.5:1.3	Having gone to a river ford,
thig5.5:1.4	I plunged into the water.
thig5.5:2.1	Undertaking many vows,
thig5.5:2.2	I shaved half my head.
thig5.5:2.3	Preparing a bed on the ground,
thig5.5:2.4	I ate no food at night.
thig5.5:3.1	I loved my ornaments and decorations;
thig5.5:3.2	and with baths and oil-massages,
thig5.5:3.3	I pandered to this body,
thig5.5:3.4	racked by desire for pleasures of the senses.
thig5.5:4.1	But then I gained faith,
thig5.5:4.2	and went forth to homelessness.
thig5.5:4.3	Truly seeing the body,
thig5.5:4.4	desire for sensual pleasure is eradicated.
thig5.5:5.1	All rebirths are cut off,
thig5.5:5.2	wishes and aspirations too.
thig5.5:5.3	Detached from all attachments,
thig5.5:5.4	I've found peace of mind.

thig5.6:0.3	Mittākāḷī
thig5.6:1.1	Having gone forth out of faith
thig5.6:1.2	from the lay life to homelessness,
thig5.6:1.3	I wandered here and there,
thig5.6:1.4	jealous of possessions and honors.
thig5.6:2.1	Neglecting the highest goal,
thig5.6:2.2	I pursued the lowest.
thig5.6:2.3	Under the sway of corruptions,
thig5.6:2.4	I never knew the goal of the ascetic life.
thig5.6:3.1	I was struck with a sense of urgency
thig5.6:3.2	as I was sitting in my hut:
thig5.6:3.3	“I’m walking the wrong path,
thig5.6:3.4	under the sway of craving.
thig5.6:4.1	My life is short,
thig5.6:4.2	trampled by old age and sickness.
thig5.6:4.3	Before this body breaks apart,
thig5.6:4.4	there is no time for me to be careless.”
thig5.6:5.1	I examined in line with reality
thig5.6:5.2	the rise and fall of the aggregates.
thig5.6:5.3	I stood up with mind liberated,
thig5.6:5.4	having fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

thig5.7:1.1	While staying at home
thig5.7:1.2	I heard the teaching from a mendicant.
thig5.7:1.3	I saw the stainless Dhamma,
thig5.7:1.4	extinguishment, the imperishable state.
thig5.7:2.1	Leaving behind my son and my daughter,
thig5.7:2.2	my riches and my grain,
thig5.7:2.3	I had my hair cut off,
thig5.7:2.4	and went forth to homelessness.
thig5.7:3.1	As a trainee nun,
thig5.7:3.2	I developed the direct path.
thig5.7:3.3	I gave up greed and hate,
thig5.7:3.4	along with associated defilements.
thig5.7:4.1	When I was fully ordained as a nun,
thig5.7:4.2	I recollected my past lives,
thig5.7:4.3	and purified my clairvoyance,
thig5.7:4.4	immaculate and fully developed.
thig5.7:5.1	Conditions are born of causes, crumbling;
thig5.7:5.2	having seen them as other,
thig5.7:5.3	I gave up all defilements,
thig5.7:5.4	I’m cooled and quenched.

thig5.8:0.3	Soṇā
thig5.8:1.1	I gave birth to ten sons
thig5.8:1.2	in this form, this bag of bones.
thig5.8:1.3	Then, when feeble and old,
thig5.8:1.4	I approached a nun.
thig5.8:2.1	She taught me the Dhamma:
thig5.8:2.2	the aggregates, sense fields, and elements.
thig5.8:2.3	When I heard her teaching,
thig5.8:2.4	I shave off my hair and went forth.
thig5.8:3.1	When I was a trainee nun,
thig5.8:3.2	my clairvoyance was clarified,
thig5.8:3.3	and I knew my past lives,
thig5.8:3.4	the places I used to live.
thig5.8:4.1	I meditate on the signless,
thig5.8:4.2	my mind unified and serene.
thig5.8:4.3	I achieved the immediate liberation,
thig5.8:4.4	extinguished by not grasping.
thig5.8:5.1	The five aggregates are fully understood;
thig5.8:5.2	they remain, but their root is cut.
thig5.8:5.3	Curse you, wretched old age!
thig5.8:5.4	now there’ll be no more future lives.

thig5.9:0.3	Bhaddā Kuṇḍalakesā
thig5.9:1.1	My hair mown off, covered in mud,
thig5.9:1.2	I used to wander wearing just one robe.
thig5.9:1.3	I saw fault where there was none,
thig5.9:1.4	and was blind to the actual fault.
thig5.9:2.1	Leaving my day’s meditation
thig5.9:2.2	on Vulture’s Peak Mountain,
thig5.9:2.3	I saw the stainless Buddha
thig5.9:2.4	at the fore of the mendicant Saṅgha.
thig5.9:3.1	I bent my knee and bowed,
thig5.9:3.2	and in his presence raised my joined palms.
thig5.9:3.3	“Come Bhaddā,” he said;
thig5.9:3.4	that was my ordination.
thig5.9:4.1	“I’ve wandered among the Aṅgans and Magadhans,
thig5.9:4.2	the Vajjīs, Kāsīs, and Kosalans.
thig5.9:4.3	I have eaten the almsfood of the nations
thig5.9:4.4	free of debt for fifty years.”
thig5.9:5.1	“O! He has made so much merit!
thig5.9:5.2	That lay follower is so very wise.
thig5.9:5.3	He gave a robe to Bhaddā,
thig5.9:5.4	who is released from all ties.”

thig6.1:0.2	The Book of the Sixes
thig6.1:0.3	Paṭācārā, Who Had a Following of Five Hundred
thig6.1:1.1	“One whose path you do not know,
thig6.1:1.2	not whence they came nor where they went;
thig6.1:1.3	though they came from who knows where,
thig6.1:1.4	you mourn that being, crying, ‘Oh my son!’
thig6.1:2.1	But one whose path you do know,
thig6.1:2.2	whence they came or where they went;
thig6.1:2.3	that one you do not lament—
thig6.1:2.4	such is the nature of living creatures.
thig6.1:3.1	Unasked he came,
thig6.1:3.2	he left without leave.
thig6.1:3.3	He must have come from somewhere,
thig6.1:3.4	and stayed who knows how many days.
thig6.1:3.5	He left from here by one road,
thig6.1:3.6	he will go from there by another.
thig6.1:4.1	Departing with the form of a human,
thig6.1:4.2	he will go on transmigrating.
thig6.1:4.3	As he came, so he went:
thig6.1:4.4	why cry over that?”
thig6.1:5.1	“Oh! For you have plucked the arrow from me,
thig6.1:5.2	so hard to see, stuck in the heart.
thig6.1:5.3	You’ve swept away the grief for my son,
thig6.1:5.4	in which I once was mired.
thig6.1:6.1	Today I’ve plucked the arrow,
thig6.1:6.2	I’m hungerless, extinguished.
thig6.1:6.3	I go for refuge to that sage, the Buddha,
thig6.1:6.4	to his teaching, and to the Sangha.”
thig6.1:7.1	That is how Paṭācārā, who had a following of five hundred, declared her enlightenment.

thig6.2:0.3	Vāseṭṭhī
thig6.2:1.1	Struck down with grief for my son,
thig6.2:1.2	deranged, out of my mind,
thig6.2:1.3	naked, my hair flying,
thig6.2:1.4	I wandered here and there.
thig6.2:2.1	I lived on rubbish heaps,
thig6.2:2.2	in cemeteries and highways.
thig6.2:2.3	For three years I wandered,
thig6.2:2.4	stricken by hunger and thirst.
thig6.2:3.1	Then I saw the Holy One,
thig6.2:3.2	who had gone to the city of Mithilā.
thig6.2:3.3	Tamer of the untamed,
thig6.2:3.4	the Awakened One fears nothing from any quarter.
thig6.2:4.1	Regaining my mind,
thig6.2:4.2	I paid homage and sat down.
thig6.2:4.3	Out of compassion
thig6.2:4.4	Gotama taught me the Dhamma.
thig6.2:5.1	After hearing his teaching,
thig6.2:5.2	I went forth to homelessness.
thig6.2:5.3	Applying myself to the Teacher’s words,
thig6.2:5.4	I realized the state of grace.
thig6.2:6.1	All sorrows are cut off,
thig6.2:6.2	given up, they end here.
thig6.2:6.3	I've fully understood the basis
thig6.2:6.4	from which grief comes to be.

thig6.3:0.3	Khemā
thig6.3:1.1	“You’re so young and beautiful!
thig6.3:1.2	I too am young, just a youth.
thig6.3:1.3	Come, Khemā, let us enjoy
thig6.3:1.4	the music of a five-piece band.”
thig6.3:2.1	“This body is rotting,
thig6.3:2.2	ailing and frail,
thig6.3:2.3	I’m horrified and repelled by it,
thig6.3:2.4	and I’ve eradicated sensual craving.
thig6.3:3.1	Sensual pleasures are like swords and stakes;
thig6.3:3.2	the aggregates are their chopping block.
thig6.3:3.3	What you call sensual delight
thig6.3:3.4	is now no delight for me.
thig6.3:4.1	Relishing is destroyed in every respect,
thig6.3:4.2	and the mass of darkness is shattered.
thig6.3:4.3	So know this, Wicked One:
thig6.3:4.4	you’re beaten, terminator!”
thig6.3:5.1	“Worshiping the stars,
thig6.3:5.2	serving the sacred flame in a grove;
thig6.3:5.3	failing to grasp the true nature of things,
thig6.3:5.4	foolish me, I thought this was purity.
thig6.3:6.1	But now I worship the Awakened One,
thig6.3:6.2	supreme among men.
thig6.3:6.3	Doing the teacher’s bidding,
thig6.3:6.4	I am released from all suffering.”

thig6.4:0.2	The Book of the Sixes
thig6.4:0.3	Sujātā
thig6.4:1.1	I was adorned with jewelry and all dressed up,
thig6.4:1.2	with garlands, and sandalwood makeup piled on,
thig6.4:1.3	all covered over with decorations,
thig6.4:1.4	and surrounded by my maids.
thig6.4:2.1	Taking food and drink,
thig6.4:2.2	staples and dainties in no small amount,
thig6.4:2.3	I left my house
thig6.4:2.4	and took myself to the park.
thig6.4:3.1	I enjoyed myself there and played about,
thig6.4:3.2	and then, returning to my own house,
thig6.4:3.3	I saw a monastic dwelling,
thig6.4:3.4	and so I entered the Añjana grove at Sāketa.
thig6.4:4.1	Seeing the light of the world,
thig6.4:4.2	I paid homage and sat down.
thig6.4:4.3	Out of compassion
thig6.4:4.4	the seer taught me the Dhamma.
thig6.4:5.1	When I heard the great hermit,
thig6.4:5.2	I penetrated the truth.
thig6.4:5.3	Right there I encountered the Dhamma,
thig6.4:5.4	the stainless, deathless state.
thig6.4:6.1	Then, having understood the true teaching,

thig6.4:6.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges;
thig6.4:6.4	the Buddha’s bidding was not in vain.

thig6.5:0.3	Anopamā
thig6.5:1.1	I was born into an eminent family,
thig6.5:1.2	affluent and wealthy,
thig6.5:1.3	endowed with a beautiful complexion and figure;
thig6.5:1.4	Majjha’s true-born daughter.
thig6.5:2.1	I was sought by princes,
thig6.5:2.2	coveted by sons of the wealthy.
thig6.5:2.3	One sent a messenger to my father:
thig6.5:2.4	“Give me Anopamā!
thig6.5:3.1	However much your daughter
thig6.5:3.2	Anopamā weighs,
thig6.5:3.3	I'll give you eight times that
thig6.5:3.4	in gold and gems.”
thig6.5:4.1	When I saw the Awakened One,
thig6.5:4.2	the world’s Elder, unsurpassed,
thig6.5:4.3	I paid homage at his feet,
thig6.5:4.4	then sat down to one side.
thig6.5:5.1	Out of compassion,
thig6.5:5.2	Gotama taught me the Dhamma.
thig6.5:5.3	While sitting in that seat,
thig6.5:5.4	I realized the third fruit.
thig6.5:6.1	Then, having shaved off my hair,
thig6.5:6.2	I went forth to homelessness.
thig6.5:6.3	This is the seventh day
thig6.5:6.4	since my craving dried up.

thig6.6:0.3	Mahāpajāpati Gotamī
thig6.6:1.1	Oh Buddha, my hero: homage to you!
thig6.6:1.2	Supreme among all beings,
thig6.6:1.3	who released me from suffering,
thig6.6:1.4	and many other beings as well.
thig6.6:2.1	All suffering is fully understood;
thig6.6:2.2	craving—its cause—is dried up;
thig6.6:2.3	the eightfold path has been developed;
thig6.6:2.4	and cessation has been realized by me.
thig6.6:3.1	Previously I was a mother, a son,
thig6.6:3.2	a father, a brother, and a grandmother.
thig6.6:3.3	Failing to grasp the true nature of things,
thig6.6:3.4	I’ve transmigrated without reward.
thig6.6:4.1	Since I have seen the Blessed One,
thig6.6:4.2	this bag of bones is my last.
thig6.6:4.3	Transmigration through births is finished,
thig6.6:4.4	now there’ll be no more future lives.
thig6.6:5.1	I see the disciples in harmony,
thig6.6:5.2	energetic and resolute,
thig6.6:5.3	always staunchly vigorous—
thig6.6:5.4	this is homage to the Buddhas!
thig6.6:6.1	It was truly for the benefit of many
thig6.6:6.2	that Māyā gave birth to Gotama.
thig6.6:6.3	He swept away the mass of suffering
thig6.6:6.4	for those stricken by sickness and death.

thig6.7:0.3	Guttā
thig6.7:1.1	Guttā, you have given up your child,
thig6.7:1.2	your wealth, and all that you love.
thig6.7:1.3	Foster the goal for which you went forth;
thig6.7:1.4	do not fall under the mind’s control.
thig6.7:2.1	Beings deceived by the mind,
thig6.7:2.2	playing in Māra’s domain,
thig6.7:2.3	ignorant, they journey on,
thig6.7:2.4	transmigrating through countless rebirths.
thig6.7:3.1	Sensual desire and ill will,
thig6.7:3.2	and identity view;
thig6.7:3.3	misapprehension of precepts and observances,
thig6.7:3.4	and doubt as the fifth.
thig6.7:4.1	O nun, when you have given up
thig6.7:4.2	these lower fetters,
thig6.7:4.3	you won’t come back
thig6.7:4.4	to this world again.
thig6.7:5.1	And when you’re rid of greed,
thig6.7:5.2	conceit, ignorance, and restlessness,
thig6.7:5.3	having cut the fetters,
thig6.7:5.4	you’ll make an end to suffering.
thig6.7:6.1	Having wiped out transmigration,
thig6.7:6.2	and fully understood rebirth,
thig6.7:6.3	hungerless in this very life,
thig6.7:6.4	you will live at peace.

thig6.8:0.3	Vijayā
thig6.8:1.1	Four or five times
thig6.8:1.2	I left my dwelling;
thig6.8:1.3	I had failed to find peace of heart,
thig6.8:1.4	or any control over my mind.
thig6.8:2.1	I approached a nun
thig6.8:2.2	and politely questioned her.
thig6.8:2.3	She taught me the Dhamma:
thig6.8:2.4	the elements and sense fields,
thig6.8:3.1	the four noble truths,
thig6.8:3.2	the faculties and the powers,
thig6.8:3.3	the awakening factors, and the eightfold path
thig6.8:3.4	for the attainment of the highest goal.
thig6.8:4.1	After hearing her words,
thig6.8:4.2	I did her bidding.
thig6.8:4.3	In the first watch of the night,
thig6.8:4.4	I recollected my past lives.
thig6.8:5.1	In the middle watch of the night,
thig6.8:5.2	I purified my clairvoyance.
thig6.8:5.3	In the last watch of the night,
thig6.8:5.4	I shattered the mass of darkness.
thig6.8:6.1	I then meditated pervading my body
thig6.8:6.2	with rapture and bliss.
thig6.8:6.3	On the seventh day I stretched out my feet,
thig6.8:6.4	having shattered the mass of darkness.

ud1.10:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud1.10:0.2	With Bāhiya 
ud1.10:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud1.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud1.10:1.3	Now at that time Bāhiya of the Bark Cloth was residing by Suppāraka on the ocean shore, where he was honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And he received robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. 
ud1.10:1.4	Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, 
ud1.10:1.5	“I am one of those in the world who are perfected or on the path to perfection.”
ud1.10:2.1	Then a deity who was a former relative of Bāhiya, having compassion and wanting what’s best for him, approached him and said: 
ud1.10:2.2	“Bāhiya, you’re not a perfected one, nor on the path to perfection. 
ud1.10:2.3	You don’t have the practice by which you might become a perfected one or one on the path to perfection.” 
ud1.10:3.1	“Then who exactly are those in the world who are perfected or on the path to perfection?”
ud1.10:3.2	“In the northern lands there is a city called Sāvatthī. 
ud1.10:3.3	There that Blessed One is now staying, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. 
ud1.10:3.4	He is a perfected one and teaches the Dhamma for the sake of perfection.”
ud1.10:4.1	Impelled by that deity, Bāhiya left Suppāraka right away.
ud1.10:4.2	Sojourning no more than a single night in any place, he made his way to Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery in the Jeta Grove at Sāvatthī.
ud1.10:4.3	At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air. 
ud1.10:4.4	Bāhiya approached them and said,
ud1.10:4.5	“Sirs, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha? 
ud1.10:4.6	For I want to see him.” 
ud1.10:4.7	“He has entered an inhabited area for almsfood, Bāhiya.”
ud1.10:5.1	Then Bāhiya rushed out of the Jeta Grove and entered Sāvatthī, where he saw the Buddha walking for alms. He was impressive and inspiring, with peaceful faculties and mind, attained to the highest self-control and serenity, like an elephant with tamed, guarded, and controlled faculties. 
ud1.10:5.2	Bāhiya went up to the Buddha, bowed down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said, 
ud1.10:5.3	“Sir, let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach me the Dhamma! 
ud1.10:5.4	That would be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”
ud1.10:5.5	The Buddha said this: 
ud1.10:5.6	“It’s not the time, Bāhiya, so long as I have entered an inhabited area for almsfood.”
ud1.10:6.1	For a second time, Bāhiya said,
ud1.10:6.2	“But you never know, sir, when life is at risk, either the Buddha’s or my own.
ud1.10:6.3	Let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach me the Dhamma! 
ud1.10:6.4	That would be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”
ud1.10:6.5	For a second time, the Buddha said,
ud1.10:6.6	“It’s not the time, Bāhiya, so long as I have entered an inhabited area for almsfood.”
ud1.10:7.1	For a third time, Bāhiya said,
ud1.10:7.2	“But you never know, sir, when life is at risk, either the Buddha’s or my own.
ud1.10:7.3	Let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach me the Dhamma! 
ud1.10:7.4	That would be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”
ud1.10:8.1	“In that case, Bāhiya, you should train like this: 
ud1.10:8.2	‘In the seen will be merely the seen; in the heard will be merely the heard; in the thought will be merely the thought; in the known will be merely the known.’
ud1.10:8.3	That’s how you should train. 
ud1.10:8.4	When you have trained in this way,
ud1.10:8.5	you won’t be ‘by that’. 
ud1.10:8.6	When you’re not ‘by that’, you won’t be ‘in that’. 
ud1.10:8.6	When you’re not ‘in that’, you won’t be in this world or the world beyond or between the two. 
ud1.10:8.7	Just this is the end of suffering.” 
ud1.10:9.1	Then, due to this brief Dhamma teaching of the Buddha, Bāhiya’s mind was right away freed from defilements by not grasping. 
ud1.10:10.1	And when the Buddha had given Bāhiya this brief advice he left. 
ud1.10:10.2	But soon after the Buddha had left, a cow with a baby calf charged at Bāhiya and took his life. 
ud1.10:11.1	Then the Buddha wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he departed the city together with several mendicants and saw that Bāhiya had passed away.
ud1.10:11.2	He said to the monks, 
ud1.10:11.3	“Mendicants, pick up Bāhiya’s corpse. Having lifted it onto a cot and carried it, cremate it and build a monument. 
ud1.10:11.4	Mendicants, one of your spiritual companions has passed away.”
ud1.10:12.1	“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. They did as the Buddha asked, then returned to the Buddha
ud1.10:12.2	and said, 
ud1.10:12.3	“Sir, Bāhiya’s corpse has been cremated and a monument built for him.
ud1.10:12.4	Where has he been reborn in his next life?” 
ud1.10:12.5	“Mendicants, Bāhiya was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings. 
ud1.10:12.6	Bāhiya of the Bark Cloth has become fully extinguished.”
ud1.10:13.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud1.10:14.1	“Where water and earth, 
ud1.10:14.2	fire and air find no footing:
ud1.10:14.3	there no star does shine,
ud1.10:14.4	nor does the sun shed its light;
ud1.10:14.5	there the moon glows not, 
ud1.10:14.6	yet no darkness is found.
ud1.10:15.1	And when a sage, a brahmin, finds understanding
ud1.10:15.2	through their own sagacity,
ud1.10:15.3	then from forms and formless,
ud1.10:15.4	from pleasure and pain they are released.”
ud1.1:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud1.1:0.2	Upon Awakening (1st)
ud1.1:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud1.1:1.2	At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the tree of awakening on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. 
ud1.1:1.3	There the Buddha sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom. 
ud1.1:1.4	When seven days had passed, the Buddha emerged from that state of immersion. In the first part of the night, he reflected on dependent origination in forward order: 
ud1.1:2.1	“When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. That is: 
ud1.1:2.2	Ignorance is a condition for choices. 
ud1.1:2.3	Choices are a condition for consciousness. 
ud1.1:2.4	Consciousness is a condition for name and form. 
ud1.1:2.5	Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. 
ud1.1:2.6	The six sense fields are conditions for contact. 
ud1.1:2.7	Contact is a condition for feeling. 
ud1.1:2.8	Feeling is a condition for craving. 
ud1.1:2.9	Craving is a condition for grasping. 
ud1.1:2.10	Grasping is a condition for continued existence. 
ud1.1:2.11	Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. 
ud1.1:2.12	Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. 
ud1.1:2.13	That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.” 
ud1.1:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud1.1:4.1	“When things become clear 
ud1.1:4.2	to the keen, meditating brahmin, 
ud1.1:4.3	his doubts are dispelled, 
ud1.1:4.4	since he understands each thing and its cause.”

ud1.2:1.3	There the Buddha sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom. 
ud1.2:1.4	When seven days had passed, the Buddha emerged from that state of immersion. In the second part of the night, he reflected on dependent origination in reverse order: 
ud1.2:2.1	“When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is: 
ud1.2:2.2	When ignorance ceases, choices cease. 
ud1.2:2.3	When choices cease, consciousness ceases. 
ud1.2:2.4	When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. 
ud1.2:2.5	When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. 
ud1.2:2.6	When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. 
ud1.2:2.7	When contact ceases, feeling ceases. 
ud1.2:2.8	When feeling ceases, craving ceases. 
ud1.2:2.9	When craving ceases, grasping ceases. 
ud1.2:2.10	When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. 
ud1.2:2.11	When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. 
ud1.2:2.12	When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. 
ud1.2:2.13	That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.” 
ud1.2:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud1.2:4.1	“When things become clear 
ud1.2:4.2	to the keen, meditating brahmin, 
ud1.2:4.3	his doubts are dispelled, 
ud1.2:4.4	since he’s known the end of conditions.”

ud1.3:0.2	Upon Awakening (3rd)
ud1.3:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud1.3:1.2	At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the tree of awakening on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. 
ud1.3:1.3	There the Buddha sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom. 
ud1.3:1.4	When seven days had passed, the Buddha emerged from that state of immersion. In the last part of the night, he reflected on dependent origination in forward and reverse order: 
ud1.3:2.1	“When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. 
ud1.3:2.2	When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is: 
ud1.3:2.3	Ignorance is a condition for choices. 
ud1.3:2.4	Choices are a condition for consciousness. 
ud1.3:2.5	Consciousness is a condition for name and form. 
ud1.3:2.6	Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. 
ud1.3:2.7	The six sense fields are conditions for contact. 
ud1.3:2.8	Contact is a condition for feeling. 
ud1.3:2.9	Feeling is a condition for craving. 
ud1.3:2.10	Craving is a condition for grasping. 
ud1.3:2.11	Grasping is a condition for continued existence. 
ud1.3:2.12	Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. 
ud1.3:2.13	Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. 
ud1.3:2.14	That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. 
ud1.3:3.1	When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. 
ud1.3:3.2	When choices cease, consciousness ceases. 
ud1.3:3.3	When consciousness ceases, name and form cease.

ud1.3:3.12	That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.” 
ud1.3:4.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud1.3:5.1	“When things become clear 
ud1.3:5.2	to the keen, meditating brahmin, 
ud1.3:5.3	he remains, scattering Māra’s army, 
ud1.3:5.4	as the sun lights up the sky.”

ud1.4:0.2	Whiny
ud1.4:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud1.4:1.2	At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. 
ud1.4:1.3	There the Buddha sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom. 
ud1.4:1.4	When seven days had passed, the Buddha emerged from that state of immersion.
ud1.4:2.1	Then a certain brahmin of the whiny sort went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. 
ud1.4:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side, 
ud1.4:2.3	and said, 
ud1.4:2.4	“Master Gotama, how do you define a brahmin? And what are the things that make one a brahmin?”
ud1.4:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud1.4:4.1	“A brahmin who has banished bad qualities, 
ud1.4:4.2	—not whiny, not stained, but self-controlled,
ud1.4:4.3	a complete knowledge master who has completed the spiritual journey—
ud1.4:4.4	may rightly proclaim the brahmin doctrine,
ud1.4:4.5	not proud of anything in the world.”
ud1.5:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud1.5:0.2	The Brahmin
ud1.5:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud1.5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud1.5:1.3	Now at that time a number of senior monks approached the Buddha—Venerables Sāriputta, Mahāmoggallāna, Mahākassapa, Mahākaccāna, Mahākoṭṭhita, Mahākappina, Mahācunda, Anuruddha, Revata, and Nanda.
ud1.5:2.1	The Buddha saw them coming off in the distance, 
ud1.5:2.2	and addressed the mendicants: 
ud1.5:2.3	“These, mendicants, are brahmins coming! 
ud1.5:2.4	These are brahmins coming!”
ud1.5:2.5	When he said this, a certain mendicant of the brahmin caste asked the Buddha, 
ud1.5:2.6	“Sir, how do you define a brahmin? And what are the things that make one a brahmin?”
ud1.5:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud1.5:4.1	“Having banished bad qualities,
ud1.5:4.2	those who live always mindful,
ud1.5:4.3	with fetters ended, awakened,
ud1.5:4.4	they are the world’s true brahmins.”
ud1.6:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud1.6:0.2	With Mahākassapa
ud1.6:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud1.6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
ud1.6:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Mahākassapa was staying in the Pipphali cave, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill. 
ud1.6:1.4	Then after some time he recovered from that illness.
ud1.6:1.5	It occurred to him,
ud1.6:1.6	“Why not enter Rājagaha for almsfood?” 
ud1.6:2.1	Now at that time five hundred deities were ready and eager for the chance to offer alms to Mahākassapa.
ud1.6:2.2	But Mahākasspa refused those deities. In the morning, he robed up, took his bowl and robe, and entered Rājagaha for alms. 
ud1.6:2.3	He went to the streets of the poor, the destitute, and the weavers.
ud1.6:2.4	The Buddha saw him wandering for alms in the streets of the poor, the destitute, and the weavers.
ud1.6:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud1.6:4.1	“The stranger, providing for no other,
ud1.6:4.2	tamed, grounded in the essence,
ud1.6:4.3	with defilements ended and flaws purged:
ud1.6:4.4	that’s who I call a brahmin.”
ud1.7:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud1.7:0.2	At Ajakalāpaka
ud1.7:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud1.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in Pāvā at the Ajakalāpaka tree shrine, the haunt of the native spirit Ajakalāpaka. 
ud1.7:1.3	Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down. 
ud1.7:1.4	Then Ajakalāpaka, wanting to make the Buddha feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, approached him, and while not far away yelled three times, “Grr! Arrgh!” Then he added, 
ud1.7:1.5	“Now that’s a goblin for you, ascetic!”
ud1.7:2.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud1.7:3.1	“When a brahmin has got over
ud1.7:3.2	their own issues,
ud1.7:3.3	they transcend this goblin
ud1.7:3.4	and his grunts.”
ud1.8:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud1.8:0.2	With Saṅgāmaji 
ud1.8:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud1.8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud1.8:1.3	Now at that time around Venerable Saṅgāmaji had arrived at Sāvatthī to see the Buddha. 
ud1.8:1.4	His former wife heard
ud1.8:1.5	that he had arrived,
ud1.8:1.6	and went to the Jetavana, taking their boy.
ud1.8:2.1	Now at that time Venerable Saṅgāmaji was sitting at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation. 
ud1.8:2.2	Then his former wife went up to him and said, 
ud1.8:2.3	“I have a little child, ascetic, so please provide for me.”
ud1.8:2.4	When she said this, Saṅgāmaji kept silent.
ud1.8:3.1	For a second time she said, 
ud1.8:3.2	“I have a little child, ascetic, so please provide for me.”
ud1.8:3.3	For a second time, Saṅgāmaji kept silent. 
ud1.8:4.1	For a third time she said, 
ud1.8:4.2	“I have a little child, ascetic, so please provide for me.”
ud1.8:4.3	For a third time, Saṅgāmaji kept silent. 
ud1.8:5.1	Then she put down the boy in front of Saṅgāmaji, saying,
ud1.8:5.2	“This is your child, ascetic. Provide for him.”
ud1.8:6.1	But Saṅgāmaji neither looked at the boy nor spoke to him. 
ud1.8:6.2	Then his former wife went a little distance away. Looking back, she saw Saṅgāmaji ignoring the boy, and thought,
ud1.8:6.3	“This ascetic doesn’t even want his child.”
ud1.8:6.4	She returned to pick up the boy, then left.
ud1.8:6.5	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha saw how Saṅgāmaji’s went back for the child. 
ud1.8:7.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud1.8:8.1	“When she came he was not glad,
ud1.8:8.2	when she left he did not grieve.
ud1.8:8.3	Victorious in battle, freed from chains,
ud1.8:8.4	that’s who I call a brahmin.”
ud1.9:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud1.9:0.2	1.9 Dreadlocked Ascetics
ud1.9:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud1.9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Gayā on Gayā Head. 
ud1.9:1.3	Now at that time—during the cold spell when the snow falls in the dead of winter—many dreadlocked ascetics plunged in and out of the Gayā river. Plunging and showering, they served the sacred flame, thinking:
ud1.9:1.4	‘Through this there is purity.’”
ud1.9:2.1	The Buddha saw them plunging in and out.
ud1.9:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud1.9:4.1	“Purity doesn’t come from water,
ud1.9:4.2	no matter how many people bathe there.
ud1.9:4.3	One who has truth and principle,
ud1.9:4.4	they are pure, they are brahmins.”
ud2.10:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud2.10:0.2	With Bhaddiya 
ud2.10:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud2.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Anupiya in a mango grove.
ud2.10:1.3	Now at that time, Venerable Bhaddiya the son of Kāḷīgodhā, even in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, frequently expressed this heartfelt sentiment:
ud2.10:1.4	“Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!” 
ud2.10:2.1	Several mendicants heard him
ud2.10:2.3	and thought,
ud2.10:2.4	“Without a doubt, Venerable Bhaddiya leads the spiritual life dissatisfied. 
ud2.10:2.5	It’s when recalling the pleasures of royalty he formerly enjoyed as a lay person that, even in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, he frequently expresses this heartfelt sentiment:
ud2.10:2.6	‘Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!’
ud2.10:3.1	Then those mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was happening.
ud2.10:4.1	So the Buddha addressed a certain monk, 
ud2.10:4.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Bhaddiya that 
ud2.10:4.3	the teacher summons him.” 
ud2.10:5.1	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Bhaddiya and said to him, 
ud2.10:5.2	“Reverend Bhaddiya, the teacher summons you.” 
ud2.10:5.3	“Yes, reverend,” Bhaddiya replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 
ud2.10:6.1	“Is it really true, Bhaddiya, that even in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, you frequently express this heartfelt sentiment:
ud2.10:6.2	‘Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!’”
ud2.10:6.3	“Yes, sir.” 
ud2.10:7.1	“But why do you say this?” 
ud2.10:7.3	“Formerly, as a lay person ruling the land, my guard was well organized within and without the royal compound, within and without the city, and within and without the country. 
ud2.10:7.4	But although I was guarded and defended in this way, I remained fearful, scared, suspicious, and nervous. 
ud2.10:7.5	But these days, even when alone in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, I’m not fearful, scared, suspicious, or nervous. I live relaxed, unruffled, surviving on charity, my heart free as a wild deer. 
ud2.10:7.6	It is for this reason that, even in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, I frequently expressed this heartfelt sentiment:
ud2.10:7.7	‘Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!’”
ud2.10:8.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud2.10:9.1	“They who hide no anger within, 
ud2.10:9.2	gone beyond any kind of existence;
ud2.10:9.3	happy, free from fear and sorrow—
ud2.10:9.4	even the gods can’t see them.” 
ud2.1:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud2.1:0.2	With Mucalinda
ud2.1:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud2.1:1.2	At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the Mucalinda tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. 
ud2.1:1.3	There the Buddha sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom. 
ud2.1:2.1	Just then a great storm blew up out of season, bringing seven days of rain, cold winds, and clouds. 
ud2.1:2.2	Mucalinda, the dragon king, came out from his abode, encircled the Buddha’s body with seven coils and spread his large hood over his head, thinking,
ud2.1:2.3	“May the Buddha not be hot or cold, nor be bothered by flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, or reptiles.” 
ud2.1:3.1	When seven days had passed, the Buddha emerged from that state of immersion.
ud2.1:3.2	When he knew the sky was clear, Mucalinda unwrapped his coils from the Buddha’s body. Hiding his own form, he manifested in the form of a brahmin youth. He stood in front of the Buddha, venerating him with joined palms.
ud2.1:4.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud2.1:5.1	“Seclusion is happiness for the contented
ud2.1:5.2	who see the teaching they have learned. 
ud2.1:5.3	Kindness for the world is happiness
ud2.1:5.4	for one who’d not harm a living creature. 
ud2.1:6.1	Dispassion for the world is happiness
ud2.1:6.2	for one who has gone beyond sensual pleasures. 
ud2.1:6.3	But dispelling the conceit ʻI am’
ud2.1:6.4	is truly the ultimate happiness.” 
ud2.2:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud2.2:0.2	Kings 
ud2.2:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud2.2:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud2.2:1.3	Now at that time, after the meal, on return from almsround, several mendicants sat together in the assembly hall and this discussion came up among them: 
ud2.2:1.4	“Which of these two kings has greater wealth, riches, treasury, dominion, vehicles, forces, might, and power: King Seniya Bimbisāra of Māgadha or King Pasenadi of Kosala?”
ud2.2:1.5	At that point the conversation among those mendicants was left unfinished. 
ud2.2:2.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat, went to the assembly hall, sat down on the seat spread out, 
ud2.2:2.2	and addressed the mendicants: 
ud2.2:2.3	“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?” 
ud2.2:3.1	So the mendicants told him what they had been talking about when the Buddha arrived. The Buddha said, 
ud2.2:4.1	“Mendicants, it is not appropriate for you gentlemen who have gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness to talk about such things. 
ud2.2:4.2	When you’re sitting together you should do one of two things: 
ud2.2:4.3	discuss the teachings or keep noble silence.”
ud2.2:5.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud2.2:6.1	“Neither the pleasures of the senses,
ud2.2:6.2	nor even divine happiness,
ud2.2:6.3	is worth even a sixteenth part 
ud2.2:6.4	of the happiness of craving’s end.” 
ud2.3:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud2.3:0.2	A Stick
ud2.3:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud2.3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud2.3:1.3	Now at that time, between Sāvatthī and the Jeta Grove, several boys were hitting a snake with a stick. 
ud2.3:1.4	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
ud2.3:1.5	He saw the boys hitting the snake.
ud2.3:2.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud2.3:3.1	“Creatures love happiness,
ud2.3:3.2	so if you hurt them with a stick
ud2.3:3.3	in search of your own happiness,
ud2.3:3.4	after death you’ll find no happiness.
ud2.3:4.1	Creatures love happiness,
ud2.3:4.2	so if you don’t hurt them with a stick
ud2.3:4.3	in search of your own happiness,
ud2.3:4.4	after death you will find happiness.”
ud2.4:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud2.4:0.2	Esteem
ud2.4:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud2.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud2.4:1.3	Now at that time the Buddha was honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And he received robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. 
ud2.4:1.4	And the mendicant Saṅgha was also honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And they received robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. 
ud2.4:1.5	But the wanderers who followed other paths were not honored, respected, esteemed, revered, and venerated. And they didn’t receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. 
ud2.4:1.6	Then those wanderers who followed other paths, unable to bear the esteem of the mendicant Sangha, abused, attacked, harassed, and troubled the mendicants in the village and the wilderness.
ud2.4:2.1	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 
ud2.4:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud2.4:4.1	“When struck by pleasure and pain in the village or wilderness,
ud2.4:4.2	regard it not as self or other.
ud2.4:4.3	Contacts strike because of attachment;
ud2.4:4.4	how would contacts strike one free of attachment?”
ud2.5:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud2.5:0.2	A Lay Follower
ud2.5:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud2.5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud2.5:1.3	Now at that time a certain lay follower from Icchānaṅgalaka arrived at Sāvatthī on some business. 
ud2.5:1.4	Having concluded his business in Sāvatthī he went to see the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
ud2.5:1.5	The Buddha said this to him: 
ud2.5:1.6	“It’s been a long time, lay follower, since you took the opportunity to come here.” 
ud2.5:2.1	“For a long time I’ve wanted to come and see the Buddha, but I wasn’t able, being prevented by my many duties and responsibilities.” 
ud2.5:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud2.5:4.1	“One who has nothing is happy indeed,
ud2.5:4.2	a learned person who has assessed the teaching.
ud2.5:4.3	See how troubled are those with attachments,
ud2.5:4.4	a person bound tight to people.”
ud2.6:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud2.6:0.2	The Pregnant Woman
ud2.6:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud2.6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud2.6:1.3	Now at that time a certain wanderer had a young brahmin wife who was pregnant and about to give birth.
ud2.6:1.4	She said to him,
ud2.6:1.5	“Go, brahmin, bring oil for my delivery.”
ud2.6:2.1	The wanderer said,
ud2.6:2.2	“But where, my dear, can I get oil?”
ud2.6:2.3	For a second time, she said,
ud2.6:2.4	‘Go, brahmin, bring oil for my delivery.’ 
ud2.6:2.5	For a second time, the wanderer said,
ud2.6:2.6	“But where, my dear, can I get oil?”
ud2.6:2.7	For a third time, she said,
ud2.6:2.8	‘Go, brahmin, bring oil for my delivery.’ 
ud2.6:3.1	Now at that time ghee and oil were being given away to any ascetic or brahmin at the storehouse of King Pasenadi of Kosala. But it was only to drink there, not to take away.
ud2.6:4.1	Knowing this, the wanderer thought,
ud2.6:4.3	“Why don’t I go to the king’s storehouse, drink as much oil as I can, then come home and throw it up so it can be used for the delivery?”
ud2.6:5.1	Then he did just that. But when he got home he was unable to either bring it up or pass it out.
ud2.6:5.2	He rolled to and fro, suffering painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings.
ud2.6:6.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
ud2.6:6.2	He saw the wanderer in agony.
ud2.6:7.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud2.6:8.1	“Oh! How happy are those with nothing! 
ud2.6:8.2	Hence knowledge masters are people with nothing.
ud2.6:8.3	See how troubled are those with attachments,
ud2.6:8.4	a person bound tight to people.”
ud2.7:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud2.7:0.2	An Only Son 
ud2.7:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud2.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud2.7:1.3	Now at that time a certain lay follower’s dear and beloved only child passed away. 
ud2.7:2.1	Then in the middle of the day several lay followers with wet clothes and hair went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them: 
ud2.7:2.2	“Why, lay followers, have you come here in the middle of the day with wet clothes and hair?” 
ud2.7:3.1	The lay follower replied,
ud2.7:3.2	“Sir, my dear and beloved only child has passed away. 
ud2.7:3.3	That’s why we came here in the middle of the day with wet clothes and hair.” 
ud2.7:4.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud2.7:5.1	“Hosts of gods and most human beings are bound
ud2.7:5.2	to what seems dear and pleasant.
ud2.7:5.3	Miserable and exhausted,
ud2.7:5.4	they fall under the sway of the King of Death.
ud2.7:6.1	The diligent, who day and night
ud2.7:6.2	leave behind what seems pleasant,
ud2.7:6.3	dig out the root of misery—
ud2.7:6.4	Death’s bait so hard to escape.”
ud2.8:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud2.8:0.2	Suppavāsā 
ud2.8:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud2.8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kuṇḍiyā in the Kuṇḍadhāna Grove.
ud2.8:1.3	Now at that time Suppavāsā the Koliyan had been pregnant for seven years, and in difficult labor for seven days.
ud2.8:1.4	While suffering painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings, three thoughts helped her endure:
ud2.8:1.5	“Oh! The Blessed One is indeed a fully awakened Buddha, who teaches the Dhamma for giving up suffering such as this.
ud2.8:1.6	Oh! The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is indeed practicing well, who practice for giving up suffering such as this.
ud2.8:1.7	Oh! Extinguishment is so very blissful, where such suffering as this is not found.”
ud2.8:2.1	Then Suppavāsā addressed her husband,
ud2.8:2.2	“Please, master, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. 
ud2.8:2.4	And then say: 
ud2.8:2.5	‘Suppavāsā the Koliyan has been pregnant for seven years, and in difficult labor for seven days.
ud2.8:2.6	While suffering painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings, three thoughts help her endure:
ud2.8:2.7	“Oh! The Blessed One is indeed a fully awakened Buddha, who teaches the Dhamma for giving up suffering such as this.
ud2.8:2.8	Oh! The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is indeed practicing well, who practice for giving up suffering such as this.
ud2.8:2.9	Oh! Extinguishment is so very blissful, where such suffering as this is not found.”’”
ud2.8:3.1	“Excellent idea,” he replied. He went to the Buddha and told him of his wife’s struggles. The Buddha said,
ud2.8:4.1	“May Suppavāsā the Koliyan be happy and healthy! May she give birth to a healthy child!”
ud2.8:4.2	As soon as he spoke, Suppavāsā, happy and healthy, gave birth to a healthy child.
ud2.8:5.1	Saying “Yes, sir,” the Koliyan gentleman approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he returned to his own house.
ud2.8:5.2	He saw that his wife, happy and healthy, had given birth to a healthy child,
ud2.8:5.3	and thought, 
ud2.8:5.4	“It’s incredible, it’s amazing! The Realized One has such psychic power and might! For as soon as he spoke, Suppavāsā, happy and healthy, gave birth to a healthy child.”
ud2.8:5.5	He became uplifted and overjoyed, full of rapture and happiness. 
ud2.8:6.1	Then Suppavāsā addressed her husband,
ud2.8:6.2	“Please, master, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. 
ud2.8:6.4	And then say, 
ud2.8:6.5	‘Suppavāsā the Koliyan, who was pregnant for seven years, and in difficult labor for seven days,
ud2.8:6.6	is now happy and healthy and has given birth to a healthy child.
ud2.8:6.7	She invites the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha to a meal for seven days.
ud2.8:6.8	Sir, may the Buddha please accept seven meals from Suppavāsā.’” 
ud2.8:7.1	“Excellent idea,” he replied. He went to the Buddha, told him the good news, and conveyed his wife’s invitation. 
ud2.8:9.1	Now at that time a certain lay follower had already invited the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha for the meal on the following day.
ud2.8:9.2	That lay follower was Venerable Mahāmoggallāna’s supporter. 
ud2.8:9.3	Then the Buddha addressed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, 
ud2.8:9.4	“Please, Moggallāna, go to the that lay follower and say to him,
ud2.8:9.5	‘Suppavāsā the Koliyan, who was pregnant for seven years, and in difficult labor for seven days,
ud2.8:9.6	is now happy and healthy and has given birth to a healthy child.
ud2.8:9.7	She invites the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha to a meal for seven days.
ud2.8:9.8	Let Suppavāvā make seven meals, afterwards you can make yours.’
ud2.8:9.9	He is your supporter.”
ud2.8:10.1	“Yes, sir,” replied Mahāmoggallāna. He went to that lay follower and conveyed the Buddha’s request.
ud2.8:11.1	“If, sir, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna can guarantee me three things—
ud2.8:11.2	wealth, life, and faith—
ud2.8:11.3	then let Suppavāvā make seven meals, afterwards I shall make mine.”
ud2.8:11.4	“I can guarantee you two things—
ud2.8:11.5	wealth and life.
ud2.8:11.6	But as for faith, you alone are the guarantor.”
ud2.8:12.1	“If, sir Venerable Mahāmoggallāna can guarantee me two things—
ud2.8:12.2	wealth and life—
ud2.8:12.3	then let Suppavāvā make seven meals, afterwards I shall make mine.”
ud2.8:13.1	Having persuaded that lay follower, Mahāmoggallāna went to the Buddha and said,
ud2.8:13.2	“I’ve persuaded the lay follower. 
ud2.8:13.3	Let Suppavāvā make seven meals, afterwards he shall make his.”
ud2.8:14.1	For seven days Suppavāsā served and satisfied the Buddha with her own hands with a variety of delicious foods. 
ud2.8:14.2	And she made her little boy bow to the Buddha and the mendicant Sangha.
ud2.8:15.1	Then Sāriputta said to the boy,
ud2.8:15.2	“I hope you’re keeping well, little boy; I hope you’re alright. I hope that you are not in pain.” 
ud2.8:15.3	“How could I be keeping well? How could I be alright?
ud2.8:15.4	For seven years I lived in a pot of blood.”
ud2.8:16.1	Then Suppavāsā, thinking,
ud2.8:16.2	“My child is conversing with the General of the Dhamma!” was uplifted and overjoyed, full of rapture and happiness.
ud2.8:16.3	Knowing this, the Buddha said to her, 
ud2.8:16.4	“Would you like to have another child like this?”
ud2.8:16.5	“Sir, I would like to have seven more children like this!”
ud2.8:17.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud2.8:18.1	“Pain in the guise of pleasure,
ud2.8:18.2	the disliked in the guise of the liked,
ud2.8:18.3	suffering in the guise of happiness,
ud2.8:18.4	overpower the negligent.”
ud2.9:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud2.9:0.2	With Visākhā 
ud2.9:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud2.9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. 
ud2.9:1.3	Now at that time Visākhā was caught up in some business with King Pasenadi.
ud2.9:1.4	But the king’s settlement did not meet her expectations.
ud2.9:2.1	Then, in the middle of the day, she went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
ud2.9:2.2	The Buddha said to her: 
ud2.9:2.3	“So, Visākhā, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?” 
ud2.9:2.4	“Sir, I am caught up in some business with King Pasenadi.
ud2.9:2.5	But the king’s settlement did not meet my expectations.”
ud2.9:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud2.9:4.1	“All under another’s control is suffering,
ud2.9:4.2	all under one’s own authority is pleasing;
ud2.9:4.3	what’s shared is stressful for both parties,
ud2.9:4.4	for bonds are hard to escape.”
ud3.10:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud3.10:0.2	The World 
ud3.10:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud3.10:1.2	At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the tree of awakening on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. 
ud3.10:1.3	There the Buddha sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom. 
ud3.10:2.1	When seven days had passed, the Buddha emerged from that state of immersion and surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha.
ud3.10:2.2	He saw sentient beings tormented with many torments, and burning with many fevers
ud3.10:2.3	born of greed, hate, and delusion.
ud3.10:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud3.10:4.1	“This world, born in torment,
ud3.10:4.2	overcome by contact, speaks of disease as the self.
ud3.10:4.3	For whatever it thinks it is, 
ud3.10:4.4	it turns out to be something else.
ud3.10:5.1	The world is attached to continued existence, overcome by continued existence,
ud3.10:5.2	taking pleasure only in continued existence, yet it becomes something else. 
ud3.10:5.3	What it enjoys, that is the fear;
ud3.10:5.4	what it fears, that is the suffering.
ud3.10:5.5	But this spiritual life is led 
ud3.10:5.6	in order to give up continued existence. 
ud3.10:6.1	Of the ascetics and brahmins who say that through continued existence one is freed from continued existence, none are themselves freed from continued existence, I say. 
ud3.10:6.2	Of the ascetics and brahmins who say that through annihilation of existence one escapes from continued existence, none have themselves escaped from continued existence, I say. 
ud3.10:7.1	For this suffering originates dependent on all attachment. With the ending of all grasping there is no origination of suffering.
ud3.10:7.2	Just look at this world!
ud3.10:7.3	Mired in all sorts of ignorance, beings in love with being are not released from continued existence.
ud3.10:7.4	Whatever states of continued existence there are—everywhere, all over—all are impermanent, suffering, and perishable. 
ud3.10:8.1	In this way one seeing with right wisdom 
ud3.10:8.2	in accord with truth,
ud3.10:8.3	gives up craving for continued existence,
ud3.10:8.4	while not look forward to ending existence.
ud3.10:8.5	Extinguishment comes from the ending of all cravings;
ud3.10:8.6	fading away and cessation with nothing left over.
ud3.10:9.1	There is no further existence
ud3.10:9.2	for that mendicant extinguished without grasping.
ud3.10:9.3	Victorious in battle, such a one has defeated Māra;
ud3.10:9.4	they’ve gone beyond all states of existence.”
ud3.1:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud3.1:0.2	Born of the Fruits of deeds
ud3.1:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud3.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud3.1:1.3	Now, at that time a certain mendicant was sitting not far from the Buddha cross-legged, with his body straight. As a result of past deeds, he suffered painful, sharp, severe, and acute feelings, which he endured unperturbed, with mindfulness and awareness.
ud3.1:2.1	The Buddha saw him meditating and enduring that pain.
ud3.1:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud3.1:4.1	“A mendicant who has left all deeds behind,
ud3.1:4.2	shaking off the dust of past deeds,
ud3.1:4.3	unselfish, steady, poised,
ud3.1:4.4	has no need to complain.”
ud3.2:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud3.2:0.2	With Nanda 
ud3.2:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud3.2:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud3.2:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Nanda, the Buddha’s brother and maternal cousin, informed several mendicants: 
ud3.2:1.4	“I lead the spiritual life dissatisfied.
ud3.2:1.5	I am unable to keep up the spiritual life. I shall resign the training and return to a lesser life.”
ud3.2:2.1	Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was happening. 
ud3.2:3.1	So the Buddha addressed a certain monk, 
ud3.2:3.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Nanda that 
ud3.2:3.3	the teacher summons him.” 
ud3.2:3.4	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Nanda and said to him, 
ud3.2:3.5	“Reverend Nanda, the teacher summons you.” 
ud3.2:4.1	“Yes, reverend,” Nanda replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 
ud3.2:5.1	“Is it really true, Nanda, that you informed several mendicants that 
ud3.2:5.2	you are unable to keep up the spiritual life; that you shall resign the training and return to a lesser life?”
ud3.2:5.3	“Yes, sir,” he replied. 
ud3.2:6.1	“But why are you so dissatisfied with the spiritual life?”
ud3.2:6.2	“As I left my house, sir, the finest lady of the Sakyan land, her hair half-combed, glanced at me and said,
ud3.2:6.3	‘Hurry back, master.’
ud3.2:6.4	Recalling that, I am dissatisfied and shall resign the training.”
ud3.2:7.1	Then the Buddha took Nanda by the arm and, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared among the gods of the Thirty-Three. 
ud3.2:8.1	Now at that time five hundred dove-footed nymphs had come to attend to Sakka, the lord of gods. 
ud3.2:8.2	Then the Buddha said to Nanda, 
ud3.2:8.3	“Nanda, do you see these five hundred dove-footed nymphs?” 
ud3.2:8.4	“Yes, sir,” he replied. 
ud3.2:9.1	“What do you think, Nanda? Who is more attractive, good-looking, and lovely—the finest lady of the Sakyan land, or these five hundred dove-footed nymphs?” 
ud3.2:9.2	“Compared to these five hundred dove-footed nymphs, the finest lady of the Sakyan land is like a deformed monkey with its ears and nose cut off.
ud3.2:9.3	She doesn’t count, there’s no comparison, she’s not worth a fraction.
ud3.2:9.4	These five hundred dove-footed nymphs are far more attractive, good-looking, and lovely.” 
ud3.2:10.1	“Rejoice, Nanda, rejoice! 
ud3.2:10.2	I guarantee you five hundred dove-footed nymphs.”
ud3.2:10.3	“If, sir, you guarantee me five hundred dove-footed nymphs, I shall happily lead the spiritual life under the Buddha.” 
ud3.2:11.1	Then the Buddha took Nanda by the arm and, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the gods of the Thirty-Three and reappeared at Jeta’s Grove. 
ud3.2:12.1	The mendicants heard,
ud3.2:12.2	“It seems Venerable Nanda—who is both the Buddha’s half-brother and maternal cousin—leads the spiritual life for the sake of nymphs.
ud3.2:12.3	And it seems that the Buddha guaranteed him five hundred dove-footed nymphs.”
ud3.2:13.1	Monks who were his friends accused him of being a hireling and a lackey,
ud3.2:13.2	“It seems Nanda is a hireling, it seems he is a lackey: he leads the spiritual life for the sake of nymphs.
ud3.2:13.3	And it seems that the Buddha guaranteed him five hundred dove-footed nymphs.”
ud3.2:14.1	Then Nanda—horrified, repelled, and disgusted at being called a hireling and a lackey—living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
ud3.2:14.2	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” 
ud3.2:14.3	Venerable Nanda became one of the perfected. 
ud3.2:15.1	Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him: 
ud3.2:15.2	“Sir, Venerable Nanda—who is both the Buddha’s half-brother and maternal cousin—has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. He lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.”
ud3.2:15.3	And the knowledge also came to the Buddha:
ud3.2:15.4	“Nanda has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. He lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.”
ud3.2:16.1	Then, when the night had passed, Nanda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
ud3.2:16.2	“Sir, you guaranteed me five hundred dove-footed nymphs. I release you from that promise.” 
ud3.2:16.3	“Nanda, I comprehended your mind and knew that 
ud3.2:16.4	you had realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom.
ud3.2:16.5	And deities also told me about this.
ud3.2:16.7	As soon as your mind was freed from defilements by not grasping, I was released from that promise.”
ud3.2:17.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud3.2:18.1	“The mendicant who has crossed over the bog,
ud3.2:18.2	who has crushed the thorns of sensuality,
ud3.2:18.3	who has reached the end of delusion,
ud3.2:18.4	trembles not at pleasure and pain.”
ud3.3:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud3.3:0.2	With Yasoja
ud3.3:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud3.3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud3.3:1.3	Now at that time around five hundred mendicants headed by Yasoja arrived at Sāvatthī to see the Buddha. 
ud3.3:1.4	At that, those visiting mendicants, while exchanging pleasantries with the resident mendicants, preparing their lodgings, and putting away their bowls and robes, made a dreadful racket. 
ud3.3:2.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda, 
ud3.3:2.2	“Ānanda, who’s making that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!” 
ud3.3:2.3	“Sir, those five hundred mendicants headed by Yasoja have arrived at Sāvatthī to see the Buddha. 
ud3.3:2.4	It’s those visiting mendicants who, while exchanging pleasantries with the resident mendicants, preparing their lodgings, and putting away their bowls and robes, made a dreadful racket.” 
ud3.3:2.5	“Well then, Ānanda, in my name tell those mendicants that 
ud3.3:2.6	the teacher summons them.” 
ud3.3:3.1	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. He went to those mendicants and said, 
ud3.3:3.2	“Venerables, the teacher summons you.” 
ud3.3:3.3	“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants. Then they rose from their seats and went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them,
ud3.3:4.1	“Mendicants, what’s with that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!” 
ud3.3:4.2	When he said this, Venerable Yasoja said to the Buddha, 
ud3.3:4.3	“Sir, these five hundred mendicants headed by Yasoja have arrived at Sāvatthī to see the Buddha. 
ud3.3:4.4	It’s these visiting mendicants who, while exchanging pleasantries with the resident mendicants, preparing their lodgings, and putting away their bowls and robes, made a dreadful racket.” 
ud3.3:4.5	“Go away, mendicants, I dismiss you. You are not to stay in my presence.” 
ud3.3:5.1	“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. They got up from their seats, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. They set their lodgings in order and left, taking their bowls and robes. 
ud3.3:5.2	Traveling stage by stage in the land of the Vajjīs, they arrived at the Vaggumudā River. They built leaf huts near the riverbank and there they entered the rainy season.
ud3.3:6.1	Then Venerable Yasoja, having entered the rainy season, addressed the mendicants:
ud3.3:6.2	“Out of compassion, reverends, the Buddha dismissed us, wanting what’s best for us.
ud3.3:6.3	Come, let us live in such a way that the Buddha would be pleased with us.”
ud3.3:6.4	“Yes, reverend,” they replied. 
ud3.3:6.5	Then those mendicants, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, all realized the three knowledges in that same rainy season.
ud3.3:7.1	When the Buddha had stayed in Sāvatthī as long as he wished, he set out for Vesālī. 
ud3.3:7.2	Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Vesālī, 
ud3.3:7.3	where he stayed in the hall with the peaked roof. 
ud3.3:8.1	Then, having applied his mind to comprehending the minds of the mendicants staying on the bank of the river Vaggumudā, the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,
ud3.3:8.2	“A light, it appears to me, has arisen in this quarter, Ānanda; a brightness has arisen.
ud3.3:8.3	I’m not put off at the thought of going to where the mendicants are staying on the bank of the river Vaggumudā.
ud3.3:8.4	Send a message to those mendicants:
ud3.3:8.5	“Venerables, the teacher summons you.” 
ud3.3:9.1	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. He went to one of mendicants and said, 
ud3.3:9.2	“Please, Reverend, go to the staying on the bank of the river Vaggumudā and say to them,
ud3.3:9.3	“Venerables, the teacher summons you. He wants to see you.” 
ud3.3:10.1	“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants.
ud3.3:10.2	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof, and reappeared in front of those mendicants on the bank of the river Vaggumudā.
ud3.3:10.3	Then he said to those mendicants, 
ud3.3:10.4	“Venerables, the teacher summons you. He wants to see you.” 
ud3.3:11.1	“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants. They set their lodgings in order and took their bowls and robes. 
ud3.3:11.2	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from the bank of the river Vaggumudā, and reappeared in the presence of the Buddha in the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
ud3.3:11.3	But at that time the Buddha was sitting immersed in imperturbable meditation. 
ud3.3:11.4	Then those mendicants thought, 
ud3.3:11.5	“What kind of meditation is the Buddha practicing right now?”
ud3.3:11.6	They thought, 
ud3.3:11.7	“He is practicing the imperturbable meditation.”
ud3.3:11.8	They all sat in imperturbable meditation.
ud3.3:12.1	And then, as the night was getting late, in the first watch of the night, Venerable Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said, 
ud3.3:12.2	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the first watch of the night, and the visiting mendicants have been sitting long. 
ud3.3:12.3	Sir, please greet the visiting mendicants.”
ud3.3:12.4	But the Buddha kept silent. 
ud3.3:13.1	For a second time, as the night was getting late, in the middle watch of the night, Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said, 
ud3.3:13.2	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the second watch of the night, and the visiting mendicants have been sitting long. 
ud3.3:13.5	Sir, please greet the visiting mendicants.”
ud3.3:13.6	But for a second time the Buddha kept silent. 
ud3.3:14.1	For a third time, as the night was getting late, in the last watch of the night, Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said, 
ud3.3:14.2	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the last watch of the night; dawn stirs, bringing joy to the night, and the visiting mendicants have been sitting long. 
ud3.3:14.7	Sir, please greet the visiting mendicants.”
ud3.3:15.1	Then the Buddha emerged from that immersion and addressed Ānanda,
ud3.3:15.2	“If you’d known, Ānanda, you wouldn’t have said so much.
ud3.3:15.3	Both I and these five hundred mendicants have been sitting in imperturbable meditation.”
ud3.3:16.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud3.3:17.1	“A mendicant who has beaten the thorns of sensuality—
ud3.3:17.2	and abuse, killing, and caging—
ud3.3:17.3	steady as a mountain, imperturbable,
ud3.3:17.4	trembles not at pleasure and pain.”
ud3.4:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud3.4:0.2	With Sāriputta 
ud3.4:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud3.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud3.4:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far from the Buddha cross-legged, with his body straight, and mindfulness established right there. 
ud3.4:1.4	The Buddha saw him meditating there.
ud3.4:2.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud3.4:3.1	“As a rocky mountain
ud3.4:3.2	is unwavering and well grounded,
ud3.4:3.3	so when delusion ends,
ud3.4:3.4	a monk, like a mountain, doesn’t tremble.”

ud3.5:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud3.5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud3.5:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was sitting not far from the Buddha cross-legged, with his body straight and mindfulness of the body well-established in himself.
ud3.5:1.4	The Buddha saw him meditating there.
ud3.5:2.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud3.5:3.1	“With mindfulness of the body established,
ud3.5:3.2	restrained in the six fields of contact,
ud3.5:3.3	a mendicant always immersed in samādhi
ud3.5:3.4	would know quenching in themselves.”
ud3.6:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud3.6:0.2	With Pilindavaccha 
ud3.6:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud3.6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
ud3.6:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Pilindavaccha addressed the mendicants as “lowlifes”. 
ud3.6:1.4	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
ud3.6:1.5	“Sir, Venerable Pilindavaccha addresses the mendicants as ‘lowlifes’.”
ud3.6:2.1	So the Buddha addressed a certain monk, 
ud3.6:2.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Pilindavaccha that 
ud3.6:2.3	the Teacher summons him.” 
ud3.6:2.4	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Pilindavaccha and said to him, 
ud3.6:2.5	“Reverend Pilindavaccha, the teacher summons you.” 
ud3.6:3.1	“Yes, reverend,” Pilindavaccha replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 
ud3.6:3.2	“Is it really true, Vaccha, that you addressed the mendicants as ‘lowlifes’?”
ud3.6:3.3	“Yes, sir,” he replied. 
ud3.6:4.1	Then, having applied his mind to Pilindavaccha’s past lives, the Buddha said to the mendicants,
ud3.6:4.2	“Mendicants, don’t complain about the mendicant Vaccha. 
ud3.6:4.3	He doesn’t addresses the mendicants as ‘lowlifes’ out of hate.
ud3.6:4.4	For five hundred lives without interruption he was reborn in a brahmin family. 
ud3.6:4.5	For a long time, he has addressed people as ‘lowlife’. 
ud3.6:4.6	That’s why he addresses the mendicants as ‘lowlifes’.”
ud3.6:5.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud3.6:6.1	“In whom dwells no deceit or conceit,
ud3.6:6.2	rid of greed, unselfish, with no need for hope,
ud3.6:6.3	 with anger eliminated, quenched:
ud3.6:6.4	they are a brahmin, an ascetic, a mendicant.”
ud3.7:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud3.7:0.2	5.7 Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud3.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
ud3.7:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Mahākassapa was staying in the Pipphali cave. Having entered a certain state of immersion, he sat cross-legged for seven days without moving.
ud3.7:1.4	When seven days had passed, Mahākassapa emerged from that state of immersion.
ud3.7:1.5	It occurred to him,
ud3.7:1.6	“Why not enter Rājagaha for almsfood?” 
ud3.7:2.1	Now at that time five hundred deities were ready and eager for the chance to offer alms to Mahākassapa.
ud3.7:2.2	But Mahākasspa refused those deities. In the morning, he robed up, took his bowl and robe, and entered Rājagaha for alms. 
ud3.7:2.3	Now at that time Sakka, lord of Gods, wished to give alms to Mahākassapa.
ud3.7:3.2	Having manifested in the appearance of a weaver, he worked the loom while the demon maiden Sujā fed the shuttle.
ud3.7:3.3	Then, as Mahākassapa wandered indiscriminately for almsfood in Rājagaha, he approached Sakka’s house.
ud3.7:3.4	Seeing Mahākassapa coming off in the distance, 
ud3.7:3.5	Sakka came out of his house, greeted him, and took the bowl from his hand. He re-entered the house and filled the bowl with rice from the pot.
ud3.7:3.6	That almsfood had many tasty soups and sauces.
ud3.7:3.7	Then it occurred to Mahākassapa,
ud3.7:3.8	“Now, what being is this who has such psychic power?” 
ud3.7:3.9	It occurred to him,
ud3.7:3.10	“This is Sakka, lord of Gods.”
ud3.7:3.11	Knowing this, he said to Sakka,
ud3.7:3.12	“This is your doing, Kosiya;
ud3.7:3.13	don’t do such a thing again.” 
ud3.7:3.14	“But sir, Kassapa, we too need merit!
ud3.7:3.15	We too ought make merit.”
ud3.7:4.1	Then Sakka bowed and respectfully circled Mahākassapa, keeping him on his right. Then he rose into the air and, sitting cross-legged in the sky, expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times: 
ud3.7:4.2	“Oh the gift, the best gift is well established in Kassapa!
ud3.7:4.3	Oh the gift, the best gift is well established in Kassapa!
ud3.7:4.4	Oh the gift, the best gift is well established in Kassapa!”
ud3.7:4.5	With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard Sakka express this heartfelt sentiment while sitting in the sky. 
ud3.7:5.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud3.7:6.1	“A mendicant who relies on alms,
ud3.7:6.2	self-supported, providing for no other;
ud3.7:6.3	the poised one is envied by even the gods,
ud3.7:6.4	calm and ever mindful.”
ud3.8:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud3.8:0.2	One Who Eats Only Almsfood
ud3.8:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud3.8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud3.8:1.3	Now at that time, after the meal, on return from almsround, several mendicants sat together in the in the pavilion by the kari tree and this discussion came up among them: 
ud3.8:2.1	“Reverends, when a mendicant who eats only almsfood is wandering for alms, from time to time they get to see pleasing sights, hear pleasing sounds, smell pleasing smells, taste pleasing tastes, and encounter pleasing touches.
ud3.8:2.2	They wander for alms being honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed.
ud3.8:2.3	Come, we too should eat only almsfood.
ud3.8:2.4	From time to time we too will get to see pleasing sights, hear pleasing sounds, smell pleasing smells, taste pleasing tastes, and encounter pleasing touches.
ud3.8:2.5	We too shall wander for alms being honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed.”
ud3.8:2.6	At that point the conversation among those mendicants was left unfinished. 
ud3.8:3.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the pavilion by the kari tree, where he sat on the seat spread out 
ud3.8:3.2	and addressed the mendicants: 
ud3.8:3.3	“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was unfinished?” 
ud3.8:4.1	So the mendicants told him what they had been talking about. The Buddha said, 
ud3.8:6.1	“Mendicants, it is not appropriate for you gentlemen who have gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness to talk about such things. 
ud3.8:6.2	When you’re sitting together you should do one of two things: 
ud3.8:6.3	discuss the teachings or keep noble silence.”
ud3.8:7.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud3.8:8.1	“A mendicant who relies on alms,
ud3.8:8.2	self-supported, providing for no other;
ud3.8:8.3	the poised one is envied by even the gods,
ud3.8:8.4	but not if they’re after popularity and reputation.”
ud3.9:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud3.9:0.2	Professions
ud3.9:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud3.9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud3.9:1.3	Now at that time, after the meal, on return from almsround, several mendicants sat together in the pavilion and this discussion came up among them: 
ud3.9:1.4	“Who knows a craft? 
ud3.9:1.5	Who is studying which craft?
ud3.9:1.6	Which is the best craft?”
ud3.9:2.1	In answer, some said that
ud3.9:2.2	elephant-craft is the best of crafts.
ud3.9:2.3	Others said that the best craft is
ud3.9:2.4	horse-craft,
ud3.9:2.6	or chariot-craft,
ud3.9:2.8	or archery,
ud3.9:2.10	or swordsmanship,
ud3.9:2.12	or computing,
ud3.9:2.14	or accounting,
ud3.9:2.16	or calculating,
ud3.9:2.18	or writing,
ud3.9:2.20	or poetry,
ud3.9:2.22	or cosmology,
ud3.9:2.24	or geomancy.
ud3.9:2.25	At that point the conversation among those mendicants was left unfinished. 
ud3.9:3.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall. He sat down on the seat spread out, 
ud3.9:3.2	and addressed the mendicants: 
ud3.9:3.3	“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was unfinished?” 
ud3.9:4.1	So the mendicants told him what they had been talking about when the Buddha arrived. The Buddha said, 
ud3.9:6.1	“Mendicants, it is not appropriate for you gentlemen who have gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness to talk about such things. 
ud3.9:6.2	When you’re sitting together you should do one of two things: 
ud3.9:6.3	discuss the teachings or keep noble silence.”
ud3.9:7.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud3.9:8.1	“Living without a craft, light, desiring the good,
ud3.9:8.2	with senses controlled, everywhere free; 
ud3.9:8.3	a migrant with no shelter, unselfish, with no need for hope,
ud3.9:8.4	having given up conceit, wandering alone: that is a mendicant.”
ud4.10:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud4.10:0.2	The Peacefulness of Sāriputta
ud4.10:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud4.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud4.10:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far from the Buddha cross-legged, with his body straight, reviewing his own peacefulness. 
ud4.10:2.1	The Buddha saw him meditating there.
ud4.10:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud4.10:4.1	“With mind at peace, so full of peace,
ud4.10:4.2	for a mendicant who has cut the cord,
ud4.10:4.3	transmigration through births is finished:
ud4.10:4.4	they’re freed from Māra’s bonds.”
ud4.1:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud4.1:0.2	With Meghiya 
ud4.1:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud4.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Cālikā, on the Cālikā mountain. 
ud4.1:1.3	Now, at that time Venerable Meghiya was the Buddha’s attendant. 
ud4.1:1.4	Then Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, 
ud4.1:1.5	“Sir, I’d like to enter Jantu village for alms.” 
ud4.1:1.6	“Please, Meghiya, go at your convenience.” 
ud4.1:2.1	Then Meghiya robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Jantu village for alms. 
ud4.1:2.2	After the meal, on his return from almsround in Jantu village, he went to the shore of Kimikālā river. 
ud4.1:2.3	As he was going for a walk along the shore of the river he saw a lovely and delightful mango grove. 
ud4.1:2.4	When he saw this he thought, 
ud4.1:2.5	“Oh, this mango grove is lovely and delightful! It’s truly good enough for meditation for a kinsman who wants to meditate. 
ud4.1:2.6	If the Buddha allows me, I’ll come back to this mango grove to meditate.” 
ud4.1:3.1	Then Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding, 
ud4.1:4.8	“If the Buddha allows me, I’ll go back to that mango grove to meditate.” 
ud4.1:5.1	When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,
ud4.1:5.2	“We’re alone, Meghiya. Wait until another mendicant comes.” 
ud4.1:6.1	For a second time Meghiya said to the Buddha, 
ud4.1:6.2	“Sir, the Buddha has nothing more to do, and nothing that needs improvement. 
ud4.1:6.3	But I have. 
ud4.1:6.4	If you allow me, I’ll go back to that mango grove to meditate.” 
ud4.1:6.5	For a second time the Buddha said,
ud4.1:6.6	“We’re alone, Meghiya. Wait until another mendicant comes.” 
ud4.1:7.1	For a third time Meghiya said to the Buddha, 
ud4.1:7.2	“Sir, the Buddha has nothing more to do, and nothing that needs improvement. 
ud4.1:7.3	But I have. 
ud4.1:7.4	If you allow me, I’ll go back to that mango grove to meditate.” 
ud4.1:7.5	“Meghiya, since you speak of meditation, what can I say? 
ud4.1:7.6	Please, Meghiya, go at your convenience.” 
ud4.1:8.1	Then Meghiya got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went to that mango grove, and, having plunged deep into it, sat at the root of a certain tree for the day’s meditation. 
ud4.1:8.2	But while Meghiya was meditating in that mango grove he was beset mostly by three kinds of bad, unskillful thoughts, namely, 
ud4.1:8.3	sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts. 
ud4.1:9.1	Then he thought, 
ud4.1:9.2	“It’s incredible, it’s amazing! 
ud4.1:9.3	I’ve gone forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith, 
ud4.1:9.4	but I’m still harassed by these three kinds of bad, unskillful thoughts: 
ud4.1:9.5	sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts.” 
ud4.1:10.1	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Meghiya came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told the Buddha what had happened. 
ud4.1:11.1	“Meghiya, when the heart’s release is not ripe, five things help it ripen. 
ud4.1:11.2	What five? 
ud4.1:12.1	Firstly, a mendicant has good friends, companions, and associates. 
ud4.1:12.2	This is the first thing … 
ud4.1:13.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. 
ud4.1:13.2	This is the second thing … 
ud4.1:14.1	Furthermore, a mendicant gets to take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart and leads solely to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment when they want, without trouble or difficulty. That is, talk about fewness of wishes, contentment, seclusion, aloofness, arousing energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom.’ 
ud4.1:14.2	This is the third thing … 
ud4.1:15.1	Furthermore, a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. 
ud4.1:15.2	This is the fourth thing … 
ud4.1:16.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. 
ud4.1:16.2	This is the fifth thing that, when the heart’s release is not ripe, helps it ripen. 
ud4.1:16.3	These are the five things that, when the heart’s release is not ripe, help it ripen. 
ud4.1:17.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to be ethical …
ud4.1:18.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart … 
ud4.1:19.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to be energetic … 
ud4.1:20.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to be wise … 
ud4.1:21.1	But then, a mendicant grounded on these five things should develop four further things. 
ud4.1:21.2	They should develop the perception of ugliness to give up greed, love to give up hate, mindfulness of breathing to cut off thinking, and perception of impermanence to uproot the conceit ‘I am’. 
ud4.1:21.3	When you perceive impermanence, the perception of not-self becomes stabilized. 
ud4.1:21.4	Perceiving not-self, you uproot the conceit ‘I am’ and attain extinguishment in this very life.” 
ud4.1:22.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud4.1:23.1	“With thoughts whether low or fine,
ud4.1:23.2	excitement in the mind arises.
ud4.1:23.3	Not understanding these thoughts in the mind,
ud4.1:23.4	one with mind astray runs all over the place.
ud4.1:24.1	Having understood these thoughts in the mind,
ud4.1:24.2	an awakened one—keen, restrained, and mindful—
ud4.1:24.3	has given up them all;
ud4.1:24.4	excitement in the mind no longer arises.”
ud4.2:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud4.2:0.2	Restless
ud4.2:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud4.2:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā. 
ud4.2:1.3	Now at that time several mendicants were staying not far from the Buddha in a wilderness hut. They were restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties. 
ud4.2:2.1	The Buddha saw those mendicants staying nearby.
ud4.2:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud4.2:4.1	“Unguarded in body,
ud4.2:4.2	ruined by wrong view,
ud4.2:4.3	overcome with dullness and drowsiness,
ud4.2:4.4	you fall under Māra’s sway.
ud4.2:5.1	That’s why you should guard the mind,
ud4.2:5.2	with right thoughts your pasture,
ud4.2:5.3	and right view at the fore.
ud4.2:5.4	Having understood rise and fall,
ud4.2:5.5	a mendicant who has overcome dullness and drowsiness
ud4.2:5.6	would cast off all bad destinies.” 
ud4.3:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud4.3:0.2	The Cowherd 
ud4.3:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud4.3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. 
ud4.3:1.3	And then the Buddha left the road, went to the root of a certain tree, and sat down on the seat spread out. 
ud4.3:2.1	Then a certain cowherd went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. 
ud4.3:2.2	The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk. 
ud4.3:3.1	Then the cowherd said to the Buddha, 
ud4.3:3.2	“Sir, may the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me.” 
ud4.3:3.3	The Buddha consented in silence. 
ud4.3:3.4	The cowherd got up from his seat, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 
ud4.3:4.1	And when the night had passed the cowherd had plenty of thick milk-rice prepared in his own home, with fresh ghee. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, 
ud4.3:4.2	“Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.” 
ud4.3:5.1	The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe and, together with the Sangha of monks, went to the house of that cowherd, where he sat down on the prepared seat in the dining hall. 
ud4.3:5.2	Then the cowherd served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a thick milk-rice and fresh ghee. 
ud4.3:5.3	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, the cowherd took a low seat and sat to one side. 
ud4.3:5.4	The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which he got up and left. 
ud4.3:5.5	But soon after the Buddha had left, the cowherd was killed by a certain man in the gap between village borders. 
ud4.3:6.1	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 
ud4.3:7.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud4.3:8.1	“A wrongly directed mind
ud4.3:8.2	would do you more harm
ud4.3:8.3	than a hater to the hated,
ud4.3:8.4	or an enemy to their foe.”
ud4.4:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud4.4:0.2	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud4.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
ud4.4:1.3	At that time Venerables Sāriputta and Moggallāna were staying near the pigeons’ alcove. 
ud4.4:1.4	Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was sitting outdoors in the moonlight, his head freshly shaven, having entered a certain state of immersion.
ud4.4:2.1	Now at that time two native spirits who were friends were on their way from the north to the south on some business. 
ud4.4:2.2	They saw Sāriputta meditating there.
ud4.4:2.3	One of the spirits said to the other,
ud4.4:2.4	“I feel inspired, friend, to give this ascetic a blow on the head!” 
ud4.4:2.5	The other spirit replied,
ud4.4:2.6	“Enough, friend, don’t hit the ascetic!
ud4.4:2.7	That is an eminent ascetic, powerful and mighty!”
ud4.4:3.1	For a second time the first spirit said to the other, 
ud4.4:3.2	“I feel inspired, friend, to give this ascetic a blow on the head!” 
ud4.4:3.3	For a second time, the other spirit replied,
ud4.4:3.4	“Enough, friend, don’t hit the ascetic!
ud4.4:3.5	That is an eminent ascetic, powerful and mighty!”
ud4.4:3.6	For a third time the first spirit said to the other, 
ud4.4:3.7	“I feel inspired, friend, to give this ascetic a blow on the head!” 
ud4.4:3.8	For a third time, the other spirit replied,
ud4.4:3.9	“Enough, friend, don’t hit the ascetic!
ud4.4:3.10	That is an eminent ascetic, powerful and mighty!”
ud4.4:4.1	Ignoring his friend, the first spirit struck Sāriputta.
ud4.4:4.2	The blow was so strong it would have felled a bull elephant seven or seven and a half cubits tall, or split apart a great mountain peak.
ud4.4:4.3	But then the spirit, crying out, “I burn, I burn!” fell into the Great Hell right there.
ud4.4:5.1	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, Venerable Moggallāna saw that spirit striking Venerable Sāriputta. 
ud4.4:5.2	He approached him and said,
ud4.4:5.3	“I hope you’re keeping well, reverend; I hope you’re alright. I hope that you are not in pain.” 
ud4.4:5.4	“I am alright, Reverend Moggallāna; 
ud4.4:5.5	but my head does hurt a little.”
ud4.4:6.1	“It’s incredible, Reverend Sāriputta, it’s amazing! 
ud4.4:6.2	How mighty and powerful is Venerable Sāriputta!
ud4.4:6.3	Just now, a native spirit struck you on the head.
ud4.4:6.4	The blow was so strong it would have felled a bull elephant seven or seven and a half cubits tall, or split apart a great mountain peak.
ud4.4:6.5	Yet you say, ‘I am alright, Reverend Moggallāna; 
ud4.4:6.6	but my head does hurt a little.’”
ud4.4:7.1	“It’s incredible, Reverend Moggallāna, it’s amazing!
ud4.4:7.2	How mighty and powerful is Venerable Moggallāna, in that he can even see a native spirit!
ud4.4:7.3	Whereas I can’t even see a mud-goblin right now.” 
ud4.4:8.1	With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard that discussion between those two spiritual giants. 
ud4.4:9.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud4.4:10.1	“One whose mind is like a rock,
ud4.4:10.2	steady, never trembling,
ud4.4:10.3	free of desire for desirable things,
ud4.4:10.4	not getting annoyed when things are annoying:
ud4.4:10.5	from where will suffering strike one
ud4.4:10.6	whose mind is developed like this?”
ud4.5:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud4.5:0.2	A Bull Elephant 
ud4.5:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud4.5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. 
ud4.5:1.3	Now at that time Buddha lived crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their ministers, and teachers of other paths and their disciples.
ud4.5:1.4	Crowded, he lived in suffering and discomfort.
ud4.5:1.5	Then he thought, 
ud4.5:1.6	“These days I live crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their ministers, and teachers of other paths and their disciples.
ud4.5:1.7	Crowded, I live in suffering and discomfort.
ud4.5:1.8	Why don’t I live alone, withdrawn from the group?”
ud4.5:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kosambi for alms. 
ud4.5:2.2	After the meal, on his return from almsround, he set his lodgings in order himself. Taking his bowl and robe, without informing his attendants or taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha, he set out to go wandering alone towards Pārileyya, with no companion. 
ud4.5:2.3	When he eventually arrived, 
ud4.5:2.4	he stayed in a protected forest grove, at the foot of an auspicious sal tree. 
ud4.5:3.1	A certain bull elephant was also living crowded by live crowded by other males, females, younglings, and cubs. He ate the grass they’d trampled, and they ate the broken branches he dragged down. He drank muddy water, and after his bath the female elephants bumped into him. 
ud4.5:3.2	Crowded, he lived in suffering and discomfort.
ud4.5:3.3	Then he thought, 
ud4.5:3.4	“These days I live crowded by other males, females, younglings, and cubs. I eat the grass they’ve trampled, and they eat the broken branches I’ve dragged down. I drink muddy water, and after my bath the female elephants bump into me. Crowded, I live in suffering and discomfort.
ud4.5:3.5	Why don’t I live alone, withdrawn from the herd?”
ud4.5:4.1	So he left the herd and went to Pārileyya, where he approached the Buddha in the protected forest grove at the foot of an auspicious sal tree. 
ud4.5:4.2	There he attended on the Buddha, clearing the vegetation from the place where the Buddha stayed, and using his trunk to set out water for drinking and washing.
ud4.5:5.1	Then as the Buddha was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, 
ud4.5:5.2	“Formerly I lived crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their ministers, and teachers of other paths and their disciples. Crowded, I live in suffering and discomfort.
ud4.5:5.3	But now I live uncrowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their ministers, and teachers of other paths and their disciples. Being uncrowded, I live in happiness and comfort.”
ud4.5:6.1	And to the bull elephant also this thought came to mind, 
ud4.5:6.2	“Formerly I lived crowded by other males, females, younglings, and cubs. I ate the grass they’d trampled, and they ate the broken branches I’d dragged down. I drank muddy water, and after my bath the female elephants bumped into me. Crowded, I lived in suffering and discomfort.
ud4.5:6.3	But now I live uncrowded by other males, females, younglings, and cubs. I eat untrampled grass, and other elephants don’t eat the broken branches I have dragged down. I don’t drink muddy water, and the female elephants don’t bump into me after my bath. Being uncrowded, I live in happiness and comfort.”
ud4.5:7.1	Then, understanding his own seclusion and knowing what that elephant was thinking, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud4.5:8.1	“The giant elephant, 
ud4.5:8.2	with tusks like chariot-poles, 
ud4.5:8.3	agrees heart to heart with the spiritual giant, 
ud4.5:8.4	since each finds joy in the woods alone.” 
ud4.6:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud4.6:0.2	With Piṇḍola
ud4.6:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud4.6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud4.6:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja was sitting not far from the Buddha cross-legged, with his body straight. He was one who lived in the wilderness, ate only almsfood, wore rag robes, and owned just three robes. He was of few wishes, content, secluded, aloof, and energetic, an advocate of austerities, dedicated to the higher mind.
ud4.6:2.1	The Buddha saw him meditating there.
ud4.6:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud4.6:4.1	“Not speaking ill nor doing harm; 
ud4.6:4.2	restraint in the monastic code; 
ud4.6:4.3	moderation in eating; 
ud4.6:4.4	staying in remote lodgings; 
ud4.6:4.5	commitment to the higher mind—
ud4.6:4.6	this is the instruction of the Buddhas.”
ud4.7:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud4.7:0.2	With Sāriputta 
ud4.7:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud4.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud4.7:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far from the Buddha cross-legged, with his body straight. He was of few wishes, content, secluded, aloof, energetic, dedicated to the higher mind.
ud4.7:2.1	The Buddha saw him meditating there.
ud4.7:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud4.7:4.1	“A sage of higher consciousness, diligent,
ud4.7:4.2	training in the ways of sagacity:
ud4.7:4.3	there are no sorrows for one thus poised,
ud4.7:4.4	calm and ever mindful.”
ud4.8:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud4.8:0.2	With Sundarī
ud4.8:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud4.8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud4.8:1.3	Now at that time the Buddha was honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And he received robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. 
ud4.8:1.4	And the mendicant Saṅgha was also honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And they received robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. 
ud4.8:1.5	But the wanderers who followed other paths were not honored, respected, esteemed, revered, and venerated. And they didn’t receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. 
ud4.8:2.1	Then those wanderers who followed other paths, unable to bear the esteem of the mendicant Sangha, approached the female wanderer Sundarī and said,
ud4.8:2.2	“Sister, are you able to do something for the welfare of your kin?”
ud4.8:2.3	“What can I do, venerables?
ud4.8:2.4	How can I help?
ud4.8:2.5	I’d even give my life for the welfare of my kin.”
ud4.8:3.1	“Well then, sister, frequently visit Jeta’s Grove.” 
ud4.8:3.2	“Yes, venerables,” she replied, and did as they asked.
ud4.8:4.1	When those wanderers knew
ud4.8:4.2	that Sundarī had been clearly seen by many people frequently visiting Jeta’s Grove,
ud4.8:4.3	they killed her and dumped her in the ditch around Jeta’s Grove. Then they went to see King Pasenadi of Kosala and said to him,
ud4.8:4.4	“Great king, we cannot find the female wanderer Sundarī.”
ud4.8:4.5	“But where do you suspect she is?” 
ud4.8:4.6	“At Jeta’s Grove, great king.”
ud4.8:4.7	“Well then, search Jeta’s Grove.”
ud4.8:5.1	So the wanderers searched Jeta’s Grove. They pulled her body up from the ditch where they had dumped it, and lifted it on a bier. Having entered Sāvatthī, they went from street to street, from square to square, complaining to people:
ud4.8:6.1	“See the deed of the Sakyan ascetics! 
ud4.8:6.2	Shameless are these Sakyan ascetics, immoral and wicked. They are liars and fake celibates.
ud4.8:6.3	Sure, they claim to be of principled and moral conduct, to be celibate, truthful, ethical, and of good character. 
ud4.8:6.4	But they have no asceticism, no spirituality.
ud4.8:6.5	Asceticism and spirituality are lost to them!
ud4.8:6.6	Where is their asceticism, where their spirituality?
ud4.8:6.7	They have abandoned asceticism and spirituality!
ud4.8:6.8	How on earth can a man, having done a man’s business, kill a woman!”
ud4.8:7.1	Then at that time when the people of Sāvatthī saw the mendicants they abused and insulted them with rude, harsh words:
ud4.8:8.1	“Shameless are these Sakyan ascetics, immoral, wicked, liars, and fake celibates.
ud4.8:8.2	Sure, they claim to be of principled and moral conduct, to be celibate, truthful, ethical, and of good character. 
ud4.8:8.3	But they have no asceticism, no spirituality.
ud4.8:8.4	Asceticism and spirituality are lost to them!
ud4.8:8.5	Where is their asceticism, where their spirituality?
ud4.8:8.6	They have abandoned asceticism and spirituality!
ud4.8:8.7	How on earth can a man, having done a man’s business, kill a woman!”
ud4.8:9.1	Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
ud4.8:9.2	Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was happening. 
ud4.8:11.1	“That rumor, mendicants, won’t last long. It will only be seven days, then it will vanish.
ud4.8:11.2	So you may respond to those critics with this verse.”
ud4.8:12.1	“A liar goes to hell, 
ud4.8:12.2	as does one who denies what they did.
ud4.8:12.3	Both are equal in the hereafter,
ud4.8:12.4	those men of base deeds.”
ud4.8:13.1	The mendicants memorized that verse in the Buddha’s presence, then used it to respond to those critics.
ud4.8:15.1	People thought, 
ud4.8:15.2	“These Sakyan ascetics didn’t do it, it was not done by them, they swear it.”
ud4.8:15.3	That rumor didn’t last long. It was seven days, then it vanished.
ud4.8:16.1	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
ud4.8:17.1	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! 
ud4.8:17.2	How well said this was by the Buddha: 
ud4.8:17.3	‘That rumor, mendicants, won’t last long. It will only be seven days, then it will vanish.’
ud4.8:17.4	That rumor has vanished, sir.”
ud4.8:18.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud4.8:19.1	“People out of control stab with words,
ud4.8:19.2	like they stab a tusker in battle with darts.
ud4.8:19.3	When they hear a harsh word spoken,
ud4.8:19.4	a mendicant should endure with no anger in heart.”
ud4.9:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud4.9:0.2	With Upasena
ud4.9:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud4.9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
ud4.9:1.3	Then as Venerable Upasena Vaṅgantaputta was in private retreat this thought came to his mind: 
ud4.9:1.4	“I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate! 
ud4.9:1.5	My Teacher is the Blessed One, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.
ud4.9:1.6	Well explained is the teaching and training in which I have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness.
ud4.9:1.7	My spiritual companions are ethical and of good character.
ud4.9:1.8	I have fulfilled the precepts. 
ud4.9:1.9	My mind is unified and serene.
ud4.9:1.10	I am a perfected one who has ended the defilements.
ud4.9:1.11	I am of great might and power.
ud4.9:1.12	My life has been good, and my death will be good.”
ud4.9:2.1	Then, knowing what that Venerable Upasena was thinking, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud4.9:3.1	“One who has no guilt in life,
ud4.9:3.2	nor grief at facing death:
ud4.9:3.3	that wise one who has seen the truth,
ud4.9:3.4	grieves not among the grieving. 
ud4.9:4.1	For the mendicant with peaceful mind,
ud4.9:4.2	who has cut off craving for continued existence,
ud4.9:4.3	Transmigration through births is finished,
ud4.9:4.4	there are no future lives for them.” 
ud5.10:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud5.10:0.2	With Cūḷapanthaka
ud5.10:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud5.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud5.10:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Cūḷapanthaka was sitting not far from the Buddha cross-legged, with his body straight, and mindfulness established right there. 
ud5.10:2.1	The Buddha saw him meditating there.
ud5.10:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud5.10:4.1	“Steady in body, steady in mind,
ud5.10:4.2	standing, sitting or lying down:
ud5.10:4.3	a mendicant focusing on this mindfulness
ud5.10:4.4	gains an ever higher distinction. 
ud5.10:4.5	And when they have done so,
ud5.10:4.6	they vanish from the King of Death.”
ud5.1:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud5.1:0.2	Who Is More Dear?
ud5.1:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud5.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud5.1:1.3	Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala was upstairs in the royal longhouse together with Queen Mallikā. 
ud5.1:1.4	Then King Pasenadi addressed Queen Mallikā, 
ud5.1:1.5	“Mallikā, is there anyone more dear to you than yourself?” 
ud5.1:2.1	“No, great king, there isn’t. 
ud5.1:2.2	But is there anyone more dear to you than yourself?” 
ud5.1:2.3	“For me also, Mallikā, there’s no-one.” 
ud5.1:3.1	Then King Pasenadi of Kosala came downstairs from the stilt longhouse, went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 
ud5.1:5.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud5.1:6.1	“Having explored every quarter with the mind, 
ud5.1:6.3	Likewise for others, each holds themselves dear; 
ud5.1:6.4	so one who loves themselves would harm no other.”
ud5.2:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud5.2:0.2	Short-lived
ud5.2:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud5.2:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud5.2:1.3	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Ānanda came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
ud5.2:1.4	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!
ud5.2:1.5	How short-lived was the Blessed One’s mother! For seven days after the Blessed One was born, his mother passed away and was reborn in the host of Joyful Gods.”
ud5.2:2.1	“That’s so true, Ānanda! For the mothers of beings intent of awakening are short-lived.
ud5.2:2.2	Seven days after the beings intent on awakening are born, their mothers pass away and are reborn in the host of Joyful Gods.”
ud5.2:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud5.2:4.1	“Whether born or to be born,
ud5.2:4.2	all depart, leaving the body behind.
ud5.2:4.3	The skillful, understanding that all is lost,
ud5.2:4.4	would keenly practice the spiritual life.”
ud5.3:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud5.3:0.2	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud5.3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
ud5.3:1.3	At that time in Rājagaha there was a leper called Suppabuddha. 
ud5.3:1.4	He was poor, destitute, and pitiful. 
ud5.3:1.5	Now, at that time the Buddha was teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly. 
ud5.3:2.1	Suppabuddha saw the crowd seated off in the distance
ud5.3:2.2	and thought, 
ud5.3:2.3	“Surely some variety of foods will be distributed there.
ud5.3:2.4	Why don’t I approach the crowd?
ud5.3:2.5	Hopefully I’ll get something to eat.”
ud5.3:3.1	So he approached the crowd
ud5.3:3.2	where he saw the Buddha teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly. 
ud5.3:3.3	When he saw this he thought, 
ud5.3:3.4	“There’s no food being distributed here.
ud5.3:3.5	The ascetic Gotama is teaching Dhamma in an assembly. 
ud5.3:3.6	Why don’t I also listen to the teaching?”
ud5.3:3.7	Right there he sat down to one side, thinking,
ud5.3:3.8	“I also will listen to the teaching.”
ud5.3:4.1	Then the Buddha focused on comprehending the minds of everyone in the Saṅgha, thinking, 
ud5.3:4.2	“Who here is capable of understanding the teaching?”
ud5.3:4.3	He saw Suppabuddha sitting in the assembly,
ud5.3:4.4	and thought, 
ud5.3:4.5	“He is capable of understanding the teaching.”
ud5.3:4.6	He gave a step by step talk especially for Suppabuddha
ud5.3:4.7	on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation. 
ud5.3:4.8	When the Buddha knew that Suppabuddha’s mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, elated, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: 
ud5.3:4.9	suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. 
ud5.3:4.10	Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, 
ud5.3:4.11	in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma in Suppabuddha: 
ud5.3:4.12	“Everything that has a beginning has an end.” 
ud5.3:5.1	Then Suppabuddha saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He rose from his seat and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said:
ud5.3:6.1	“Excellent, sir! Excellent! 
ud5.3:6.2	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
ud5.3:6.3	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
ud5.3:6.4	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
ud5.3:7.1	After Suppabuddha had been educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired with a Dhamma talk by the Buddha, he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving. 
ud5.3:7.2	But soon after Suppabuddha had left, a cow with a baby calf charged at him and took his life. 
ud5.3:8.1	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said,
ud5.3:8.3	“The leper called Suppabuddha, after being educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired with a Dhamma talk by the Buddha, has passed away.
ud5.3:8.4	Where has he been reborn in his next life?” 
ud5.3:9.1	“Mendicants, Suppabuddha was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings. 
ud5.3:9.2	With the ending of three fetters, Suppabuddha is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.” 
ud5.3:10.1	When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha, 
ud5.3:10.2	“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why Suppabuddha became a leper,
ud5.3:10.3	poor, destitute, and pitiful?”
ud5.3:11.1	“Once upon a time, mendicants, Suppabuddha used to be a financier’s son right here in Rājagaha.
ud5.3:11.2	On his way to visit a park, he saw Tagarasikhi, a Buddha awakened for themselves, entering the city for alms. 
ud5.3:11.3	When he saw this he thought, 
ud5.3:11.4	“Who is this leper wandering about with his leper’s robe?”
ud5.3:11.5	Before leaving, he spat on the ground and turned his left side to Tagarasikhi.
ud5.3:11.6	As a result of that deed he burned in hell for many years, for many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of years. 
ud5.3:11.7	And as a residual result of that same deed, he became a leper right here in Rājagaha, poor, destitute and pitiful. 
ud5.3:11.8	But owing to faith in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One, he undertook ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.
ud5.3:11.9	After undertaking these things, when his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three. 
ud5.3:11.10	There he outshines the other gods in beauty and glory.” 
ud5.3:12.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud5.3:13.1	“As a well-sighted man would avoid rough paths,
ud5.3:13.2	so long as strength is found;
ud5.3:13.3	an astute person in the living world,
ud5.3:13.4	would shun bad deeds.” 
ud5.4:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud5.4:0.2	5.4 The Boys
ud5.4:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud5.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud5.4:1.3	Now at that time, between Sāvatthī and the Jeta Grove, several boys were tormenting some fish. 
ud5.4:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
ud5.4:2.2	He saw the boys tormenting the fish.
ud5.4:2.3	He went to them and said, 
ud5.4:2.4	“Boys, do you fear pain? Do you dislike pain?”
ud5.4:2.5	“Yes, sir,” they replied. “We dislike pain.”
ud5.4:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud5.4:4.1	“If you fear pain,
ud5.4:4.2	If you dislike pain,
ud5.4:4.3	don’t do bad deeds
ud5.4:4.4	either openly or in secret.
ud5.4:5.1	If you should do a bad deed,
ud5.4:5.2	now or in the future,
ud5.4:5.3	you won’t be freed from suffering,
ud5.4:5.4	though you fly away and flee.” 
ud5.5:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud5.5:0.2	Sabbath 
ud5.5:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud5.5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. 
ud5.5:1.3	Now, at that time it was the sabbath, and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks. 
ud5.5:2.1	And then, as the night was getting late, in the first watch of the night, Venerable Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said, 
ud5.5:2.2	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the first watch of the night, and the Saṅgha has been sitting long. 
ud5.5:2.3	Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the mendicants.” 
ud5.5:2.4	But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent. 
ud5.5:3.1	For a second time, as the night was getting late, in the middle watch of the night, Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said, 
ud5.5:3.2	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the first watch of the night, and the Saṅgha has been sitting long. 
ud5.5:3.3	Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the mendicants.” 
ud5.5:3.4	But for a second time the Buddha kept silent. 
ud5.5:4.1	For a third time, as the night was getting late, in the last watch of the night, Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said, 
ud5.5:4.2	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the first watch of the night, and the Saṅgha has been sitting long. 
ud5.5:4.3	Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the mendicants.” 
ud5.5:4.4	“Ānanda, the assembly is not pure.” 
ud5.5:5.1	Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought, 
ud5.5:5.2	“Who is the Buddha talking about?” 
ud5.5:5.4	Then he focused on comprehending the minds of everyone in the Saṅgha. 
ud5.5:5.5	He saw that unethical person, of bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual practitioner—though claiming to be one—rotten inside, corrupt, and depraved, sitting in the middle of the Saṅgha. 
ud5.5:5.6	When he saw him he got up from his seat, went up to him and said, 
ud5.5:5.7	“Get up, reverend. The Buddha has seen you. 
ud5.5:5.8	You can’t live in communion with the mendicants.” 
ud5.5:5.9	But when he said this, that person kept silent. 
ud5.5:6.1	For a second time and a third time,
ud5.5:6.2	he asked that monk to leave.
ud5.5:6.5	But for a third time that person kept silent. 
ud5.5:7.1	Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna took that person by the arm, ejected him out the gate, and bolted the door. Then he went up to the Buddha, and said to him, 
ud5.5:7.2	“I have ejected that person. 
ud5.5:7.3	The assembly is pure. 
ud5.5:7.4	Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the mendicants.” 
ud5.5:7.5	“It’s incredible, Moggallāna, it’s amazing, 
ud5.5:7.6	how that silly man waited to be taken by the arm!” 
ud5.5:8.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, 
ud5.5:8.2	“From this day forth, mendicants, I will not perform the sabbath or recite the monastic code. 
ud5.5:8.3	Now you should perform the sabbath and recite the monastic code. 
ud5.5:8.4	It’s impossible, mendicants, it can’t happen that a Realized One could recite the monastic code in an impure assembly. 
ud5.5:9.1	Seeing these eight incredible and amazing things the demons love the ocean. 
ud5.5:9.2	What eight? 
ud5.5:10.1	The ocean gradually slants, slopes, and inclines, with no abrupt precipice. 
ud5.5:10.3	This is the first thing the demons love about the ocean. 
ud5.5:11.1	Furthermore, the ocean is consistent and doesn’t overflow its boundaries. 
ud5.5:11.3	This is the second thing the demons love about the ocean. 
ud5.5:12.1	Furthermore, the ocean doesn’t accommodate a corpse, but quickly carries it to the shore and strands it on the beach. 
ud5.5:12.3	This is the third thing the demons love about the ocean. 
ud5.5:13.1	Furthermore, when they reach the ocean, all the great rivers—that is, the Ganges, Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and Mahī—lose their names and clans and are simply considered ‘the ocean’. 
ud5.5:13.3	This is the fourth thing the demons love about the ocean. 
ud5.5:14.1	Furthermore, for all the world’s streams that reach it, and the rain that falls from the sky, the ocean never empties or fills up. 
ud5.5:14.3	This is the fifth thing the demons love about the ocean. 
ud5.5:15.1	Furthermore, the ocean has just one taste, the taste of salt. 
ud5.5:15.3	This is the sixth thing the demons love about the ocean. 
ud5.5:16.1	Furthermore, the ocean is full of many kinds of treasures, such as pearls, gems, beryl, conch, quartz, coral, silver, gold, rubies, and emeralds. 
ud5.5:16.3	This is the seventh thing the demons love about the ocean. 
ud5.5:17.1	Furthermore, many great beings live in the ocean, such as leviathans, leviathan-gulpers, leviathan-gulper-gulpers, demons, dragons, and fairies. In the ocean there are life-forms a hundred leagues long, or even two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, or five hundred leagues long. 
ud5.5:17.3	This is the eighth thing the demons love about the ocean. 
ud5.5:17.4	Seeing these eight incredible and amazing things the demons love the ocean. 
ud5.5:18.1	In the same way, seeing eight incredible and amazing things, mendicants, the mendicants love this teaching and training. 
ud5.5:18.2	What eight? 
ud5.5:19.1	The ocean gradually slants, slopes, and inclines, with no abrupt precipice. 
ud5.5:19.2	In the same way in this teaching and training the penetration to enlightenment comes from gradual training, progress, and practice, not abruptly. 
ud5.5:19.4	This is the first thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training. 
ud5.5:20.1	The ocean is consistent and doesn’t overflow its boundaries. 
ud5.5:20.2	In the same way, when a training rule is laid down for my disciples they wouldn’t break it even for the sake of their own life. 
ud5.5:20.4	This is the second thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training. 
ud5.5:21.1	The ocean doesn’t accommodate a corpse, but quickly carries it to the shore and strands it on the beach. 
ud5.5:21.2	In the same way, the Saṅgha doesn’t accommodate a person who is unethical, of bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual practitioner—though claiming to be one—rotten inside, corrupt, and depraved. But they quickly gather and expel them. Even if such a person is sitting in the middle of the Saṅgha, they’re far from the Saṅgha, and the Saṅgha is far from them. 
ud5.5:21.4	This is the third thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training. 
ud5.5:22.1	Furthermore, when they reach the ocean, all the great rivers—that is, the Ganges, Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and Mahī—lose their names and clans and are simply considered ‘the ocean’. 
ud5.5:22.2	In the same way, when they go forth from the lay life to homelessness, all four castes—aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers—lose their former names and clans and are simply considered ‘Sakyan ascetics’. 
ud5.5:22.4	This is the fourth thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training. 
ud5.5:23.1	For all the world’s streams that reach it, and the rain that falls from the sky, the ocean never empties or fills up. 
ud5.5:23.2	In the same way, though several mendicants become fully extinguished through the natural principle of extinguishment, without anything left over, the natural principle of extinguishment never empties or fills up. 
ud5.5:23.4	This is the fifth thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training. 
ud5.5:24.1	The ocean has just one taste, the taste of salt. 
ud5.5:24.2	In the same way, this teaching and training has one taste, the taste of freedom. 
ud5.5:24.4	This is the sixth thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training. 
ud5.5:25.1	The ocean is full of many kinds of treasures, such as pearls, gems, beryl, conch, quartz, coral, silver, gold, rubies, and emeralds. 
ud5.5:25.2	In the same way, this teaching and training is full of many kinds of treasures, such as the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path. 
ud5.5:25.4	This is the seventh thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training. 
ud5.5:26.1	Many great beings live in the ocean, such as leviathans, leviathan-gulpers, leviathan-gulper-gulpers, demons, dragons, and fairies. In the ocean there are life-forms a hundred leagues long, or even two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, or five hundred leagues long. 
ud5.5:26.2	In the same way, great beings live in this teaching and training, and these are those beings. The stream-enterer and the one practicing to realize the fruit of stream-entry. The once-returner and the one practicing to realize the fruit of once-return. The non-returner and the one practicing to realize the fruit of non-return. The perfected one, and the one practicing for perfection. 
ud5.5:26.4	This is the eighth thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training. 
ud5.5:26.5	Seeing these eight incredible and amazing things, the mendicants love this teaching and training.” 
ud5.5:27.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud5.5:28.1	“The rain saturates things that are covered up;
ud5.5:28.2	it doesn’t saturate things that are open.
ud5.5:28.3	Therefore you should open up a covered thing,
ud5.5:28.4	so the rain will not saturate it.”
ud5.6:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud5.6:0.2	With Soṇa 
ud5.6:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud5.6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud5.6:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying in the land of the Avantis near Kuraraghara on Steep Mountain. 
ud5.6:1.4	And the layman Soṇa of the pointy ears was Mahākaccānas attendant. 
ud5.6:2.1	Then as Soṇa was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, 
ud5.6:2.2	“As I understand Venerable Mahākaccāna’s teachings, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. 
ud5.6:2.3	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from lay life to homelessness?” 
ud5.6:3.1	Then Soṇa went up to Mahākaccāna, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what he was thinking. Then he said,
ud5.6:4.4	“May Venerable Mahākaccāna please give me the going forth!” 
ud5.6:5.1	When this was said, Mahākaccāna said to him, 
ud5.6:5.2	“It’s hard to lead the spiritual life as long as you live, eating in one part of the day and sleeping alone.
ud5.7:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud5.7:0.2	With Revata the Doubter
ud5.7:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud5.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud5.7:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Revata the Doubter was sitting not far from the Buddha cross-legged, with his body straight, reviewing his own purification through overcoming doubt. 
ud5.7:2.1	The Buddha saw him meditating there.
ud5.7:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud5.7:4.1	“Any doubts about this world or the world beyond, 
ud5.7:4.2	about one’s own experiences or those of another:
ud5.7:4.3	those who meditate give them all up,
ud5.7:4.4	keenly practicing the spiritual life.”
ud5.8:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud5.8:0.2	Schism in the Saṅgha 
ud5.8:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud5.8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
ud5.8:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms. 
ud5.8:2.1	Devadatta saw him wandering for alms,
ud5.8:2.2	so he went up to him and said,
ud5.8:2.3	“From this day forth, Reverend Ānanda, I shall perform the sabbath and legal proceedings of the Saṅgha apart from the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants.” 
ud5.8:3.1	Then Ānanda wandered for alms in Rājagaha. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, 
ud5.8:3.2	and told him what had just happened, adding:
ud5.8:4.5	“Today, sir, Devadatta will split the Saṅgha. He will perform the sabbath and legal proceedings of the Saṅgha.”
ud5.8:5.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud5.8:6.1	“It’s easy for the good to do good,
ud5.8:6.2	and hard for the good to do bad.
ud5.8:6.3	It’s easy for the bad to do bad,
ud5.8:6.4	but for the noble ones, bad is hard to do.”
ud5.9:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud5.9:0.2	Teasing
ud5.9:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud5.9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. 
ud5.9:1.3	Now at that time several students were passing by not far from the Buddha in a teasing manner. 
ud5.9:1.4	The Buddha saw them.
ud5.9:2.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud5.9:3.1	“Dolts pretending to be astute, 
ud5.9:3.2	they talk, their words right out of bounds. 
ud5.9:3.3	They blab at will, their mouths agape, 
ud5.9:3.4	and no-one knows what leads them on.”
ud6.10:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud6.10:0.2	Arising
ud6.10:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud6.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud6.10:1.3	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
ud6.10:2.1	“Sir, so long as the Realized Ones, the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas do not arise in the world, the wanderers who follow other paths are honored, respected, esteemed, revered, and venerated. And they receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.
ud6.10:2.2	But when the Realized Ones do arise in the world, the wanderers who follow other paths are no longer honored, respected, esteemed, revered, and venerated. And they do not receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.
ud6.10:2.3	Now only the Buddha is honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And he receives robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.”
ud6.10:3.1	“That’s so true, Ānanda. So long as the Realized Ones do not arise in the world, the wanderers who follow other paths are honored, respected, esteemed, revered, and venerated. And they receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.
ud6.10:3.2	But when the Realized Ones do arise in the world, the wanderers who follow other paths are no longer honored in this way.
ud6.10:3.3	Now only the Realized One is honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And he receives robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And so does the mendicant Saṅgha.”
ud6.10:4.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud6.10:5.1	“The glow-worm shines so long
ud6.10:5.2	as the beacon of the sun does not rise.
ud6.10:5.3	But when the sun has come up,
ud6.10:5.4	that light is erased and shines no more.
ud6.10:6.1	So too the reasoners shine bright
ud6.10:6.2	so long as the Buddhas don’t arise in the world.
ud6.10:6.3	The reasoners are not purified, nor are their disciples.
ud6.10:6.4	Having bad views, they are not freed from suffering.”
ud6.1:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud6.1:0.2	Surrendering the Life Force 
ud6.1:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud6.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
ud6.1:1.3	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms. 
ud6.1:1.4	Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Ānanda: 
ud6.1:1.5	“Ānanda, get your sitting cloth. 
ud6.1:1.6	Let’s go to the Cāpāla shrine for the day’s meditation.” 
ud6.1:2.1	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha. 
ud6.1:2.2	Then the Buddha went up to the Cāpāla shrine, where he sat on the seat spread out. 
ud6.1:2.3	When he was seated he said to Venerable Ānanda: 
ud6.1:3.1	“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla shrines are all lovely. 
ud6.1:3.2	Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon. 
ud6.1:3.3	The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.” 
ud6.1:4.1	But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. 
ud6.1:4.2	He didn’t beg the Buddha, 
ud6.1:4.3	“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra. 
ud6.1:4.4	For a second time … 
ud6.1:4.5	and for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda: 
ud6.1:5.1	“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla shrines are all lovely. 
ud6.1:5.2	Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon. 
ud6.1:5.3	The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.” 
ud6.1:6.1	But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. 
ud6.1:6.2	He didn’t beg the Buddha, 
ud6.1:6.3	“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra. 
ud6.1:7.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda, 
ud6.1:7.2	“Go now, Ānanda, at your convenience.” 
ud6.1:7.3	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He rose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before sitting at the root of a tree close by. 
ud6.1:8.1	And then, not long after Ānanda had left, Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha, stood to one side, and said to him: 
ud6.1:9.1	“May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. 
ud6.1:9.2	Sir, you once made this statement: 
ud6.1:9.3	‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and practice in line with the teachings. Not until they practice properly, living in line with the teaching. Not until they’ve learned their teacher’s doctrine, and explain, teach, assert, establish, disclose, analyze, and make it clear. Not until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis.’ 
ud6.1:9.4	Today you do have such monk disciples. 
ud6.1:9.5	May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. 
ud6.1:10.1	Sir, you once made this statement: 
ud6.1:10.2	‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have nun disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ … 
ud6.1:10.3	Today you do have such nun disciples. 
ud6.1:11.2	‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have layman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ 
ud6.1:11.3	Today you do have such layman disciples. 
ud6.1:12.2	‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have laywoman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ 
ud6.1:12.3	Today you do have such laywoman disciples. 
ud6.1:12.4	May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. 
ud6.1:13.1	Sir, you once made this statement: 
ud6.1:13.2	‘Not until my spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.’ 
ud6.1:13.3	Today your spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans. 
ud6.1:13.4	May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. 
ud6.1:14.1	When this was said, the Buddha said to Māra, 
ud6.1:14.2	“Relax, Wicked One. The final extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon. 
ud6.1:14.3	Three months from now the Realized One will finally be extinguished.” 
ud6.1:15.1	So at the Cāpāla tree shrine the Buddha, mindful and aware, surrendered the life force. 
ud6.1:15.2	When he did so there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky. 
ud6.1:16.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud6.1:17.1	“Weighing up the incomparable against an extension of life, 
ud6.1:17.2	the sage surrendered the life force. 
ud6.1:17.3	Happy inside, serene, 
ud6.1:17.4	he burst out of this self-made chain like a suit of armor.” 
ud6.2:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud6.2:0.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics 
ud6.2:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud6.2:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. 
ud6.2:1.3	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and sat outside the gate. 
ud6.2:1.4	Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. 
ud6.2:2.1	Now at that time seven matted-hair ascetics, seven Jain ascetics, seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloth ascetics, and seven wanderers passed by not far from the Buddha. Their armpits and bodies were hairy, and their nails were long; and they carried their stuff with shoulder-poles. 
ud6.2:3.1	King Pasenadi saw them passing by.
ud6.2:3.2	He got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward those various ascetics, and pronounced his name three times: 
ud6.2:3.3	“Sirs, I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala! 
ud6.2:3.4	I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!
ud6.2:3.5	I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!” 
ud6.2:4.1	Then, soon after those ascetics had left, King Pasenadi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
ud6.2:4.2	Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, 
ud6.2:4.3	“Sir, are they among those in the world who are perfected ones or who are on the path to perfection?” 
ud6.2:5.1	“Great king, as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures, living at home with your children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, perfumes, and makeup, and accepting gold and money, it’s hard for you to know who is perfected or on the path to perfection. 
ud6.2:6.1	You can get to know a person’s ethics by living with them. But only after a long time, not casually; only when paying attention, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless. 
ud6.2:6.2	You can get to know a person’s purity by dealing with them. … 
ud6.2:6.3	You can get to know a person’s resilience in times of trouble. … 
ud6.2:6.4	You can get to know a person’s wisdom by discussion. But only after a long time, not casually; only when paying attention, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless.” 
ud6.2:7.1	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing,
ud6.2:7.2	how well said this was by the Buddha. … 
ud6.2:8.1	Sir, these are my spies, my undercover agents returning after spying on the country. 
ud6.2:8.2	First they go undercover, then I have them report to me. 
ud6.2:8.3	And now—when they have washed off the dust and dirt, and are nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed, and dressed in white—they will amuse themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.” 
ud6.2:9.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud6.2:10.1	“Don’t strive in every situation,
ud6.2:10.2	don’t become another’s man.
ud6.2:10.3	Don’t live depending on another,
ud6.2:10.4	and don’t trade in the teaching.”

ud6.3:0.2	The Buddha’s Reviewing
ud6.3:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud6.3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud6.3:1.3	Now at that time the Buddha was sitting reviewing his own giving up of many bad, unskillful qualities, and the many skillful qualities he had fully developed.
ud6.3:2.1	Then, knowing the many bad, unskillful qualities that he had given up and the many skillful qualities he had fully developed, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud6.3:3.1	“What was before then was not;
ud6.3:3.2	what before was not then was.
ud6.3:3.3	It never was, nor will it be,
ud6.3:3.4	nor is it found today.”
ud6.4:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud6.4:0.2	Followers of Other Paths (1st)
ud6.4:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud6.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud6.4:1.3	Now at that time several ascetics, brahmins, and wanderers who followed various other paths were residing in Sāvatthī, holding different views and opinions, relying on different views.
ud6.4:2.1	There were some ascetics and brahmins who had this doctrine and view: 
ud6.4:2.2	“The cosmos is eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.” 
ud6.4:3.1	Others held views such as the following, each regarding their own view as true and others as silly.
ud6.4:3.2	“The cosmos is not eternal.”
ud6.4:4.2	“The world is finite.”
ud6.4:5.2	“The world is infinite.”
ud6.4:6.2	“The soul and the body are the same thing.”
ud6.4:7.2	“The soul and the body are different things.”
ud6.4:8.2	“A Realized One exists after death.” 
ud6.4:9.2	“A Realized One doesn’t exist after death.” 
ud6.4:10.2	“A Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death.”
ud6.4:11.2	“A Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death.” 
ud6.4:12.1	They were arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words: 
ud6.4:12.2	“Such is Truth, such is not Truth!
ud6.4:12.3	Such is not Truth, such is Truth!”
ud6.4:13.1	Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
ud6.4:13.2	Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was happening. The Buddha said:
ud6.4:16.1	“The wanderers who follow other paths are blind and sightless.
ud6.4:16.2	They don't understand what is beneficial or what is not beneficial, nor what is the truth and what is not the truth.
ud6.4:16.3	That’s why they are arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words.
ud6.4:17.1	Once upon a time, mendicants, right here in Sāvatthī there was a certain king. 
ud6.4:17.2	Then the king addressed a man, 
ud6.4:17.3	‘Please, mister, gather all those blind from birth throughout Sāvatthī and bring them together in one place.’
ud6.4:17.4	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ that man replied. He did as the king asked, then said to him,
ud6.4:17.5	‘Your Majesty, the blind people throughout Sāvatthī have been gathered.’
ud6.4:17.6	‘Well then, my man, show them an elephant.’ 
ud6.4:17.7	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ that man replied. He did as the king asked.
ud6.4:18.1	To some of the blind people he showed the elephant’s head, saying,
ud6.4:18.2	‘Here is the elephant.’
ud6.4:18.3	To some of them he showed the elephant’s ear, saying,
ud6.4:18.4	‘Here is the elephant.’
ud6.4:18.5	To some of them he showed the elephant’s tusk, saying,
ud6.4:18.6	‘Here is the elephant.’
ud6.4:18.7	To some of them he showed the elephant’s trunk, saying,
ud6.4:18.8	‘Here is the elephant.’
ud6.4:18.9	To some of them he showed the elephant’s flank, saying,
ud6.4:18.10	‘Here is the elephant.’
ud6.4:18.11	To some of them he showed the elephant’s leg, saying,
ud6.4:18.12	‘Here is the elephant.’
ud6.4:18.13	To some of them he showed the elephant’s thigh, saying,
ud6.4:18.14	‘Here is the elephant.’
ud6.4:18.15	To some of them he showed the elephant’s tail, saying,
ud6.4:18.16	‘Here is the elephant.’
ud6.4:18.17	To some of them he showed the tip of the elephant’s tail, saying,
ud6.4:18.18	‘Here is the elephant.’
ud6.4:19.1	Then he approached the king and said,
ud6.4:19.2	‘Your Majesty, the blind people have been shown the elephant.
ud6.4:19.3	Please go at your convenience.’ 
ud6.4:20.1	Then the king went up to the blind people and said, 
ud6.4:20.2	‘Have you seen the elephant?’
ud6.4:20.3	‘Yes, Your Majesty, we have been shown the elephant.’
ud6.4:20.4	‘Then tell us, what kind of thing is an elephant?’
ud6.4:21.1	The blind people who had been shown the elephant’s head said,
ud6.4:21.2	‘Your Majesty, an elephant is like a pot.’
ud6.4:22.1	Those who had been shown the ear said,
ud6.4:22.2	‘An elephant is like a winnowing fan.’
ud6.4:23.1	Those who had been shown the tusk said,
ud6.4:23.2	‘An elephant is like a ploughshare.’
ud6.4:24.1	Those who had been shown the trunk said,
ud6.4:24.2	‘An elephant is like a plough-pole.’
ud6.4:25.1	Those who had been shown the flank said,
ud6.4:25.2	‘An elephant is like a storehouse.’
ud6.4:26.1	Those who had been shown the leg said,
ud6.4:26.2	‘An elephant is like a pillar.’
ud6.4:27.1	Those who had been shown the thigh said,
ud6.4:27.2	‘An elephant is like a mortar.’
ud6.4:28.1	Those who had been shown the tail said,
ud6.4:28.2	‘An elephant is like a pestle.’
ud6.4:29.1	Those who had been shown the tip of the tail said,
ud6.4:29.2	‘An elephant is like a broom.’
ud6.4:30.1	Saying, ‘Such is an elephant, not such!
ud6.4:30.2	Such is not an elephant, such is!’ they punched each other with their fists.
ud6.4:30.3	At that, the king was pleased.
ud6.4:31.1	In the same way, mendicants, the wanderers who follow other paths are blind and sightless.
ud6.4:31.2	They don't understand what is beneficial or what is not beneficial, nor what is the truth and what is not the truth.
ud6.4:31.3	That’s why they are arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words.
ud6.4:31.4	‘Such is Truth, such is not!
ud6.4:31.5	Such is not Truth, such is!’”
ud6.4:32.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud6.4:33.1	“Some ascetics and brahmins, it seems,
ud6.4:33.2	cling to these things.
ud6.4:33.3	Arguing, they quarrel,
ud6.4:33.4	the folk who see just one part.”

ud6.5:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud6.5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud6.5:1.3	Now at that time several ascetics, brahmins, and wanderers who followed various other paths were residing in Sāvatthī, holding different views and opinions, relying on different views.
ud6.5:2.1	There were some ascetics and brahmins who had this doctrine and view: 
ud6.5:2.2	“The self and the cosmos are eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.” 
ud6.5:3.1	Others held views such as the following, each regarding their own view as true and others as silly.
ud6.5:3.2	“The self and the cosmos are not eternal.”
ud6.5:4.2	“The self and the cosmos are both eternal and not eternal.”
ud6.5:5.2	“The self and the cosmos are neither eternal nor not eternal.”
ud6.5:6.2	“The self and the cosmos are made by oneself.”
ud6.5:7.2	“The self and the cosmos are made by another.”
ud6.5:8.2	“The self and the cosmos are made by both oneself and another.”
ud6.5:9.2	“The self and the cosmos have arisen by chance, not made by oneself or another.”
ud6.5:10.2	“Pleasure and pain are eternal, and the self and the cosmos.”
ud6.5:11.2	“Pleasure and pain are not eternal, and the self and the cosmos.”
ud6.5:12.2	“Pleasure and pain are both eternal and not eternal, and the self and the cosmos.”
ud6.5:13.2	“Pleasure and pain are neither eternal nor not eternal, and the self and the cosmos.”

ud6.5:17.2	“Pleasure and pain have arisen by chance, not made by oneself or another, and the self and the cosmos.”
ud6.5:18.1	They were arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words: 
ud6.5:18.2	‘Such is Truth, such is not Truth!
ud6.5:18.3	Such is not Truth, such is Truth!”
ud6.5:19.1	Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
ud6.5:19.2	Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was happening.

ud6.6:24.3	There are some who do not realize this,

ud6.8:1.3	Now at that time two gangs were both hopelessly in love with a certain courtesan.
ud6.8:1.4	Quarreling, arguing, and disputing, they attacked each other with fists, stones, rods, and swords,

ud6.8:5.2	Those for whom the training is the essence, or precepts and observances, celibacy, and service as the essence: this is one extreme.
ud6.8:5.3	Those who say,

ud7.10:1.3	Now at that time, while King Udena was visiting a park, his royal compound burned down. Five hundred women died, with Queen Sāmāvatī at their head.
ud7.10:2.1	Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Kosambi for alms. 
ud7.10:2.2	Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him had happened. They asked the Buddha,
ud7.10:2.5	“Sir, where have those laywomen been reborn in the next life?”
ud7.10:3.1	“Among those laywomen there were stream-enterers, once-returners, and non-returners.
ud7.10:3.2	None of those laywomen died without some fruit of the practice.”

ud7.1:2.1	Then after being taught like this Bhaddiya’s mind was freed from defilements by not grasping.
ud7.1:3.1	The Buddha saw what had happened.

ud7.4:2.2	He saw how attached the people were.
ud7.4:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:

ud7.4:4.2	they are smothered over by craving;
ud7.4:4.3	bound by the Kinsman of the Negligent,

ud7.5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud7.5:1.3	Then Venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf, closely following several mendicants, approached the Buddha.
ud7.5:2.1	The Buddha saw Venerable Bhaddiya coming off in the distance—ugly, unsightly, deformed, and despised by most of the mendicants.
ud7.5:2.2	The Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
ud7.5:3.1	“Mendicants, do you see this monk coming—ugly, unsightly, deformed, and despised by most of the mendicants?” 
ud7.5:3.2	“Yes, sir.” 
ud7.5:4.1	“That mendicant is very mighty and powerful. It’s not easy to find an attainment that he has not already attained. 
ud7.5:4.2	And he has realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lives having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.”

ud7.7:2.1	Then, understanding his own giving up of the concepts of identity that emerge from the proliferation of perceptions, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud7.7:3.1	“There is no proliferation remaining in them,

ud7.8:2.1	The Buddha saw him meditating there.
ud7.8:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:

ud7.8:4.3	‘It might not be, and it might not be mine, 
ud7.8:4.4	It will not be, and it will not be mine.’
ud7.8:4.5	Meditating stage by stage on that,

ud7.9:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud7.9:0.2	The Well
ud7.9:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud7.9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Mallas together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a brahmin town of the Mallas named Thūṇa. 
ud7.9:1.3	The brahmins and householders of Thūṇa heard: 
ud7.9:1.4	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—while wandering in the land of the Mallas has arrived at Thūṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.”
ud7.9:1.5	They filled the well with grass and chaff right to the top, thinking,
ud7.9:1.6	“Don’t let these shavelings, these fake ascetics drink the water.” 
ud7.9:2.1	And then the Buddha left the road, went to the root of a tree, and sat down on the seat spread out. 
ud7.9:2.2	When he was seated he said to Venerable Ānanda: 
ud7.9:2.3	“Please, Ānanda, fetch me some water from that well.” 
ud7.9:3.1	When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, 
ud7.9:3.2	“Just now, sir, the brahimns and householders of Thūṇa filled the well with grass and chaff right to the top, thinking,
ud7.9:3.3	‘Don’t let these shavelings, these fake ascetics drink the water.’
ud7.9:4.1	For a second time, 
ud7.9:4.2	and for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda: 
ud7.9:4.3	“Please, Ānanda, fetch me some water from that well.” 
ud7.9:4.4	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his bowl he went to the well. 
ud7.9:4.5	As he approached the well, all the grass and chaff erupted out of the well-mouth. The water stood transparent, unclouded, and clear right up to the top, seeming to overflow. 
ud7.9:5.1	Then Venerable Ānanda thought, 
ud7.9:5.2	“It’s incredible, it’s amazing! The Realized One has such psychic power and might! 
ud7.9:5.3	For when I approached this well, all the grass and chaff erupted out of the well-mouth. The water stood transparent, unclouded, and clear right up to the top, seeming to overflow.”
ud7.9:5.4	Gathering a bowl of drinking water he went back to the Buddha, and said to him, 
ud7.9:5.5	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! The Realized One has such psychic power and might! 
ud7.9:5.6	For when I approached that well, all the grass and chaff erupted out of the well-mouth. The water stood transparent, unclouded, and clear right up to the top, seeming to overflow.
ud7.9:5.7	Drink the water, Blessed One! Drink the water, Holy One!” 
ud7.9:6.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud7.9:7.1	“What difference would a well make 
ud7.9:7.2	if water is there all the time?
ud7.9:7.3	Having cut off craving at the root,
ud7.9:7.4	who would go out on a quest?”

ud8.10:0.2	Dabba (2nd)
ud8.10:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud8.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
ud8.10:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
ud8.10:1.4	“Mendicants!” 
ud8.10:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
ud8.10:1.6	The Buddha said this: 
ud8.10:2.1	“Mendicants, when Dabba the Mallian rose into the air and, sitting cross-legged in the sky, entered and withdrew from the fire element before becoming fully extinguished, his body burning and combusting left neither ashes nor soot to be found.
ud8.10:2.2	It’s like when ghee or oil blaze and burn, and neither ashes nor soot are found. 
ud8.10:2.3	In the same way, when Dabba the Mallian rose into the air and, sitting cross-legged in the sky, entered and withdrew from the fire element before becoming fully extinguished, his body burning and combusting left neither ashes nor soot to be found.”
ud8.10:3.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud8.10:4.1	“When an iron bar is struck
ud8.10:4.2	by heat and flame
ud8.10:4.3	the heat gradually dissipates,
ud8.10:4.4	and where it has gone no-one knows.
ud8.10:5.1	In the same way for the rightly released, 
ud8.10:5.2	who have crossed the flood of sensual bonds,
ud8.10:5.3	and attained unshakable happiness,
ud8.10:5.4	where they have gone cannot be found.”

ud8.1:1.3	Now at that time the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about extinguishment. 
ud8.1:1.4	And those mendicants were paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear. 
ud8.1:2.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud8.1:3.1	“There is, mendicants, that dimension where there is no earth, no water, no fire, no wind; no dimension of infinite space, no dimension of infinite consciousness, no dimension of nothingness, no dimension of neither perception nor non-perception; no this world, no other world, no moon or sun.
ud8.1:3.2	There, mendicants, I say there is no coming or going or remaining or passing away or reappearing.

ud8.2:3.1	“It’s hard to see what they call the ‘uninclined’,
ud8.2:3.2	for the truth is not easy to see.

ud8.3:3.2	If there were no unborn, unproduced, unmade, and unconditioned, then you would find no escape here from the born, produced, made, and conditioned.

ud8.5:0.2	With Cunda 
ud8.5:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud8.5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Mallas together with a large Saṅgha when he arrived at Pāvā. 
ud8.5:1.3	There he stayed in Cunda the smith’s mango grove. 
ud8.5:2.1	Cunda heard that the Buddha had arrived and was staying in his mango grove. 
ud8.5:2.2	Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. 
ud8.5:2.3	The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk. 
ud8.5:2.4	Then Cunda said to the Buddha, 
ud8.5:2.5	“Sir, may the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me.” 
ud8.5:2.6	The Buddha consented in silence. 
ud8.5:3.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Cunda got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 
ud8.5:3.2	And when the night had passed Cunda had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home, and plenty of pork on the turn. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, 
ud8.5:3.3	“Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.” 
ud8.5:4.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Cunda together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out 
ud8.5:4.2	and addressed Cunda, 
ud8.5:4.3	“Cunda, please serve me with the pork on the turn that you’ve prepared. 
ud8.5:4.4	And serve the mendicant Saṅgha with the other foods.” 
ud8.5:4.5	“Yes, sir,” replied Cunda, and did as he was asked. 
ud8.5:5.1	Then the Buddha addressed Cunda, 
ud8.5:5.2	“Cunda, any pork on the turn that’s left over, you should bury it in a pond. 
ud8.5:5.3	I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could properly digest it except for the Realized One.” 
ud8.5:5.4	“Yes, sir,” replied Cunda. He did as he was asked, then came back to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. 
ud8.5:5.5	Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. 
ud8.5:6.1	After the Buddha had eaten Cunda’s meal, he fell severely ill with bloody dysentery, struck by dreadful pains, close to death. 
ud8.5:6.2	But he endured unperturbed, with mindfulness and situational awareness. 
ud8.5:7.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda, 
ud8.5:7.2	“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Kusinārā.” 
ud8.5:7.3	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. 
ud8.5:8.1	I’ve heard that after eating 
ud8.5:8.2	the meal of Cunda the smith, 
ud8.5:8.3	the wise one fell severely ill, 
ud8.5:8.4	with pains, close to death. 
ud8.5:9.1	A severe sickness struck the Teacher 
ud8.5:9.2	who had eaten the pork on the turn. 
ud8.5:9.3	While still purging the Buddha said: 
ud8.5:9.4	“I’ll go to the citadel of Kusinārā.” 
ud8.5:10.1	Then the Buddha left the road and went to the root of a certain tree, where he addressed Ānanda, 
ud8.5:10.2	“Please, Ānanda, fold my outer robe in four and spread it out for me. I am tired and will sit down.” 
ud8.5:10.3	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda, and did as he was asked. 
ud8.5:10.4	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out, 
ud8.5:10.5	and said to Venerable Ānanda, 
ud8.5:10.6	“Please, Ānanda, fetch me some water. I am thirsty and will drink.” 
ud8.5:11.1	When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, 
ud8.5:11.2	“Sir, just now around five hundred carts have passed by. The shallow water has been churned up by their wheels, and it flows cloudy and murky. 
ud8.5:11.3	The Kakutthā river is not far away, with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful. 
ud8.5:11.4	There the Buddha can drink and cool his limbs.” 
ud8.5:12.1	For a second time, 
ud8.5:12.2	and a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda,
ud8.5:12.3	“Please, Ānanda, fetch me some water. I am thirsty and will drink.” 
ud8.5:12.4	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his bowl he went to the river. 
ud8.5:12.5	Now, though the shallow water in that river had been churned up by wheels, and flowed cloudy and murky, when Ānanda approached it flowed transparent, clear, and unclouded. 
ud8.5:13.1	Then Venerable Ānanda thought, 
ud8.5:13.2	“It’s incredible, it’s amazing! The Realized One has such psychic power and might! 
ud8.5:13.3	For though the shallow water in that river had been churned up by wheels, and flowed cloudy and murky, when I approached it flowed transparent, clear, and unclouded.” 
ud8.5:13.4	Gathering a bowl of drinking water he went back to the Buddha, and said to him, 
ud8.5:13.5	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! The Realized One has such psychic power and might! 
ud8.5:13.6	For though the shallow water in that river had been churned up by wheels, and flowed cloudy and murky, when I approached it flowed transparent, clear, and unclouded.
ud8.5:13.7	Drink the water, Blessed One! Drink the water, Holy One!” 
ud8.5:14.1	So the Buddha drank the water. 
ud8.5:14.2	Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants went to the Kakutthā River. He plunged into the river and bathed and drank. 
ud8.5:14.3	And when he had emerged, he went to the mango grove, where he addressed Venerable Cundaka, 
ud8.5:14.4	“Please, Cundaka, fold my outer robe in four and spread it out for me. I am tired and will lie down.” 
ud8.5:15.1	“Yes, sir,” replied Cundaka, and did as he was asked. 
ud8.5:15.2	And then the Buddha laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. 
ud8.5:15.3	But Cundaka sat down right there in front of the Buddha. 
ud8.5:16.1	Having gone to Kakutthā Creek, 
ud8.5:16.2	whose water was transparent, sweet, and clear, 
ud8.5:16.3	the Teacher, being tired, plunged in, 
ud8.5:16.4	the Realized One, without compare in the world. 
ud8.5:17.1	And after bathing and drinking the Teacher emerged. 
ud8.5:17.2	Before the group of mendicants, in the middle, the Buddha, 
ud8.5:17.3	the Teacher who rolled forth the present dispensation, 
ud8.5:17.4	the great hermit went to the mango grove. 
ud8.5:17.5	He addressed the mendicant named Cundaka: 
ud8.5:17.6	“Spread out my folded robe so I can lie down.” 
ud8.5:18.1	The evolved one urged Cunda, 
ud8.5:18.2	who quickly spread the folded robe. 
ud8.5:18.3	The Teacher lay down so tired, 
ud8.5:18.4	while Cunda sat there before him. 
ud8.5:19.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda, 
ud8.5:19.2	“Now it may happen, Ānanda, that others may give rise to some regret for Cunda the smith: 
ud8.5:19.3	‘It’s your loss, friend Cunda, it’s your misfortune, in that the Realized One became fully extinguished after eating his last almsmeal from you.’ 
ud8.5:19.4	You should get rid of remorse in Cunda the smith like this: 
ud8.5:20.1	‘You’re fortunate, friend Cunda, you’re so very fortunate,
ud8.5:20.2	in that the Realized One became fully extinguished after eating his last almsmeal from you. 
ud8.5:20.3	I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha. 
ud8.5:20.4	There are two almsmeal offerings that have identical fruit and result, and are more fruitful and beneficial than other almsmeal offerings. 
ud8.5:20.5	What two? 
ud8.5:20.6	The almsmeal after eating which a Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening; and the almsmeal after eating which he becomes fully extinguished through the natural principle of extinguishment, without anything left over. 
ud8.5:20.7	These two almsmeal offerings have identical fruit and result, and are more fruitful and beneficial than other almsmeal offerings. 
ud8.5:21.1	You’ve accumulated a deed that leads to long life, beauty, happiness, fame, heaven, and sovereignty.’ 
ud8.5:21.2	You should dispel remorse in Cunda the smith like this.”
ud8.5:22.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud8.5:23.1	“A giver’s merit grows; 
ud8.5:23.2	enmity doesn’t build up when you have self-control. 
ud8.5:23.3	A skillful person gives up bad things—
ud8.5:23.4	with the end of greed, hate, and delusion, they’re extinguished.” 
ud8.6:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud8.6:0.2	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village 
ud8.6:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud8.6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Magadhans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at the village of Pāṭali. 
ud8.6:1.3	The lay followers of Pāṭali Village heard that he had arrived. 
ud8.6:1.5	So they went to see him, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
ud8.6:1.7	“Sir, please consent to come to our guest house.” 
ud8.6:1.8	The Buddha consented in silence. 
ud8.6:2.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, the lay followers of Pāṭali Village got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the guest house, where they spread carpets all over, prepared seats, set up a water jar, and placed a lamp. Then they went back to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and told him of their preparations, saying: 
ud8.6:2.3	“Please, sir, come at your convenience.” 
ud8.6:3.1	In the morning, the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the guest house together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Having washed his feet he entered the guest house and sat against the central column facing east. 
ud8.6:3.2	The Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet, entered the guest house, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them. 
ud8.6:3.3	The lay followers of Pāṭali Village also washed their feet, entered the guest house, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Buddha right in front of them. 
ud8.6:3.4	Then the Buddha addressed them: 
ud8.6:4.1	“Householders, there are these five drawbacks for an unethical person because of their failure in ethics. 
ud8.6:4.2	What five? 
ud8.6:4.3	Firstly, an unethical person loses substantial wealth on account of negligence. 
ud8.6:4.4	This is the first drawback. 
ud8.6:5.1	Furthermore, an unethical person gets a bad reputation. 
ud8.6:5.2	This is the second drawback. 
ud8.6:6.1	Furthermore, an unethical person enters any kind of assembly timid and embarrassed, whether it’s an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics. 
ud8.6:6.2	This is the third drawback. 
ud8.6:7.1	Furthermore, an unethical person feels lost when they die. 
ud8.6:7.2	This is the fourth drawback. 
ud8.6:8.1	Furthermore, an unethical person, when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. 
ud8.6:8.2	This is the fifth drawback. 
ud8.6:8.3	These are the five drawbacks for an unethical person because of their failure in ethics. 
ud8.6:9.1	There are these five benefits for an ethical person because of their accomplishment in ethics. 
ud8.6:9.2	What five? 
ud8.6:9.3	Firstly, an ethical person gains substantial wealth on account of diligence. 
ud8.6:9.4	This is the first benefit. 
ud8.6:10.1	Furthermore, an ethical person gets a good reputation. 
ud8.6:10.2	This is the second benefit. 
ud8.6:11.1	Furthermore, an ethical person enters any kind of assembly bold and self-assured, whether it’s an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics. 
ud8.6:11.2	This is the third benefit. 
ud8.6:12.1	Furthermore, an ethical person dies not feeling lost. 
ud8.6:12.2	This is the fourth benefit. 
ud8.6:13.1	Furthermore, when an ethical person’s body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. 
ud8.6:13.2	This is the fifth benefit. 
ud8.6:13.3	These are the five benefits for an ethical person because of their accomplishment in ethics.” 
ud8.6:14.1	The Buddha spent most of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the lay followers of Pāṭali Village with a Dhamma talk. Then he dismissed them, 
ud8.6:14.2	“The night is getting late, householders. Please go at your convenience.” 
ud8.6:14.3	And then the lay followers of Pāṭali Village approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving. 
ud8.6:14.4	Soon after they left the Buddha entered a private cubicle. 
ud8.6:15.1	Now at that time the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra were building a citadel at Pāṭali Village to keep the Vajjis out. 
ud8.6:15.2	At that time thousands of deities were taking possession of building sites in Pāṭali Village. 
ud8.6:15.3	Illustrious rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by illustrious deities. 
ud8.6:15.4	Middling rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by middling deities. 
ud8.6:15.5	Lesser rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by lesser deities. 
ud8.6:16.1	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha saw those deities taking possession of building sites in Pāṭali Village,
ud8.6:16.2	and the people building houses in accord with the station of the deities.
ud8.6:16.5	The Buddha rose at the crack of dawn and addressed Ānanda, 
ud8.6:17.1	“Ānanda, who is building a citadel at Pāṭali Village?” 
ud8.6:17.2	“Sir, the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra are building a citadel to keep the Vajjis out.” 
ud8.6:17.3	“It’s as if they were building the citadel in consultation with the gods of the Thirty-Three. 
ud8.6:17.5	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw those deities taking possession of building sites. 
ud8.6:17.6	Illustrious rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by illustrious deities. 
ud8.6:17.7	Middling rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by middling deities. 
ud8.6:17.8	Lesser rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by lesser deities. 
ud8.6:17.9	As far as the civilized region extends, as far as the trading zone extends, this will be the chief city: the Pāṭaliputta trade center. 
ud8.6:17.10	But Pāṭaliputta will face three threats: 
ud8.6:17.11	from fire, flood, and dissension.” 
ud8.6:18.1	Then the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra approached the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
ud8.6:18.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they stood to one side and said, 
ud8.6:18.4	“Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept today’s meal from me?” 
ud8.6:19.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, they went to their own guest house, where they had a variety of delicious foods prepared. Then they had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, 
ud8.6:19.2	“Itʼs time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.” 
ud8.6:20.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to their guest house together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out. 
ud8.6:20.2	Then Sunidha and Vassakāra served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with their own hands with a variety of delicious foods. 
ud8.6:21.1	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Sunidha and Vassakāra took a low seat and sat to one side. 
ud8.6:21.2	The Buddha expressed his appreciation with these verses: 
ud8.6:22.1	“In the place he makes his dwelling, 
ud8.6:22.2	having fed the astute 
ud8.6:22.3	and the virtuous here, 
ud8.6:22.4	the restrained spiritual practitioners, 
ud8.6:23.1	he should dedicate an offering 
ud8.6:23.2	to the deities there. 
ud8.6:23.3	Venerated, they venerate him; 
ud8.6:23.4	honored, they honor him. 
ud8.6:24.1	After that they have compassion for him, 
ud8.6:24.2	like a mother for the child at her breast. 
ud8.6:24.3	A man beloved of the deities 
ud8.6:24.4	always sees nice things.” 
ud8.6:25.1	When the Buddha had expressed his appreciation to Sunidha and Vassakāra with these verses, he got up from his seat and left. 
ud8.6:26.1	Sunidha and Vassakāra followed behind the Buddha, thinking, 
ud8.6:26.2	“The gate through which the ascetic Gotama departs today shall be named the Gotama Gate. 
ud8.6:26.3	The ford at which he crosses the Ganges River shall be named the Gotama Ford.” 
ud8.6:27.1	Then the gate through which the Buddha departed was named the Gotama Gate. 
ud8.6:27.2	Then the Buddha came to the Ganges River. 
ud8.6:27.3	Now at that time the Ganges was full to the brim so a crow could drink from it. 
ud8.6:27.4	Wanting to cross from the near to the far shore, some people were seeking a boat, some a dinghy, while some were tying up a raft. 
ud8.6:27.5	But, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, the Buddha, together with the mendicant Saṅgha, vanished from the near shore and landed on the far shore. 
ud8.6:28.1	He saw all those people wanting to cross over. 
ud8.6:29.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud8.6:30.1	“Those who cross a deluge or stream 
ud8.6:30.2	have built a bridge and left the marshes behind. 
ud8.6:30.3	While some people are still tying a raft, 
ud8.6:30.4	intelligent people have crossed over.” 
ud8.7:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud8.7:0.2	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud8.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was traveling along the road between in the Kosalan lands with Venerable Nāgasamāla as his second monk.
ud8.7:1.3	Nāgasamāla saw a fork in the road
ud8.7:1.4	and said to the Buddha, 
ud8.7:1.5	“Sir, this is the road, 
ud8.7:1.6	let us go this way.”
ud8.7:1.7	But when he said this the Buddha responded,
ud8.7:1.8	“Nāgasamāla, this is the road, 
ud8.7:1.9	let us go this way.”
ud8.7:2.1	For a second time, 
ud8.7:2.2	and a  third time Nāgasamāla said to the Buddha,
ud8.7:2.3	“Sir, this is the road, 
ud8.7:2.4	let us go this way.”
ud8.7:2.5	And for a third time the Buddha responded,
ud8.7:2.6	“Nāgasamāla, this is the road, 
ud8.7:2.7	let us go this way.”
ud8.7:2.8	Then Nāgasamāla put the Buddha’s bowl and robes down on the ground right there and left, saying,
ud8.7:2.9	“Sir, here are your bowl and robes.”
ud8.7:3.1	Then as Nāgasamāla was going down that road, he was set upon by bandits who struck him with fists and feet, broke his bowl, and tore up his outer robe.
ud8.7:3.2	Then Nāgasamāla—with his bowl broken and his outer robe torn—went to the Buddha and told him what had happened.
ud8.7:4.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud8.7:5.1	“Walkaing together, dwelling as one,
ud8.7:5.2	the knowledge master mixes with foolish folk.
ud8.7:5.3	Knowing this, they give up wickedness,
ud8.7:5.4	like a milk-drinking heron the water.”
ud8.8:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud8.8:0.2	With Visākhā 
ud8.8:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud8.8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. 
ud8.8:1.3	Now at that time the dear and beloved granddaughter of Visākhā Migāra’s Mother had just passed away. 
ud8.8:1.4	Then, in the middle of the day, Visākhā with wet clothes and hair went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 
ud8.8:1.5	The Buddha said to her,
ud8.8:2.1	“So, Visākhā, where are you coming from in the middle of the day with wet clothes and hair?” 
ud8.8:2.2	“Sir, my beloved granddaughter has just passed away.”
ud8.8:2.3	That’s why I here in the middle of the day with wet clothes and hair.” 
ud8.8:2.4	“Visākhā, would you like as many children and grandchildren as there are people in the whole of Sāvatthī?”
ud8.8:2.5	“I would, sir.”
ud8.8:3.1	“But Visākhā, how many people pass away each day in Sāvatthī?”
ud8.8:3.2	“Every day, sir, there are ten people passing away in Sāvatthī.
ud8.8:3.3	Or else there are nine,
ud8.8:3.4	eight,
ud8.8:3.5	seven,
ud8.8:3.6	six,
ud8.8:3.7	five,
ud8.8:3.8	four,
ud8.8:3.9	three,
ud8.8:3.10	two,
ud8.8:3.11	or at least one person who passes away every day in Sāvatthī.
ud8.8:3.12	Sāvatthī is never without someone passing away.” 
ud8.8:4.1	“What do you think, Visākhā? Would there ever be a time when your clothes and hair were not wet?”
ud8.8:4.2	“No, sir.
ud8.8:4.3	Enough, sir, with so many children and grandchildren.”
ud8.8:5.1	“Those who have a hundred loved ones, Visākhā, have a hundred sufferings.
ud8.8:5.2	Those who have a ninety loved ones,
ud8.8:5.3	or eighty,
ud8.8:5.4	seventy,
ud8.8:5.5	sixty,
ud8.8:5.6	fifty,
ud8.8:5.7	forty, 
ud8.8:5.8	thirty,
ud8.8:5.9	twenty, 
ud8.8:5.10	ten,
ud8.8:5.11	nine,
ud8.8:5.12	eight,
ud8.8:5.13	seven,
ud8.8:5.14	six,
ud8.8:5.15	five,
ud8.8:5.16	four,
ud8.8:5.17	three,
ud8.8:5.18	two,
ud8.8:5.19	or one loved one have one suffering.
ud8.8:5.20	“Those who have no loved ones have no suffering. They are free of sorrow, stains, and anguish I say.”
ud8.8:6.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud8.8:7.1	“All the sorrows and lamentations
ud8.8:7.2	and the countless forms of suffering in the world
ud8.8:7.3	occur because of those that we love;
ud8.8:7.4	without loved ones they do not occur.
ud8.8:8.1	That’s why those who have no loved ones at all in the world
ud8.8:8.2	are happy and free of grief.
ud8.8:8.3	So aspiring to the sorrowless and stainless,
ud8.8:8.4	have no loved ones in the world at all.”
ud8.9:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings
ud8.9:0.2	With Dabba (1st)
ud8.9:1.1	So I have heard. 
ud8.9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
ud8.9:1.3	Then Venerable Dabba the Mallian went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
ud8.9:1.5	“Holy One, it is the time for my full extinguishment.”
ud8.9:1.6	“Please, Dabba, do as you see fit.” 
ud8.9:2.1	Then Dabba rose from his seat, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he rose into the air and, sitting cross-legged in the sky, entered and withdrew from the fire element before becoming fully extinguished.
ud8.9:3.1	Then when he became fully extinguished while sitting in the sky, his body burning and combusting left neither ashes nor soot to be found.
ud8.9:3.2	It’s like when ghee or oil blaze and burn, and neither ashes nor soot are found. 
ud8.9:4.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
ud8.9:5.1	“The body is broken up, perception has ceased,
ud8.9:5.2	all feelings have become cool;
ud8.9:5.3	choices are stilled, 
ud8.9:5.4	and consciousness come to an end.”
