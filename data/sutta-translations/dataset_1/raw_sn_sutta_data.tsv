sn1.11:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn1.11:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. 
sn1.11:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
sn1.11:1.4	“Mendicants!” 
sn1.11:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
sn1.11:1.6	The Buddha said this: 
sn1.11:2.1	“Once upon a time, mendicants, a certain deity of the company of the Thirty-Three was amusing themselves in the Garden of Delight, escorted by a band of nymphs, and supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation. On that occasion they recited this verse: 
sn1.11:3.1	‘They don’t know pleasure 
sn1.11:3.2	who don’t see the Garden of Delight! 
sn1.11:3.3	It’s the abode of lordly gods, 
sn1.11:3.4	the glorious host of Thirty!’ 
sn1.11:4.1	When they had spoken, another deity replied with this verse: 
sn1.11:5.1	‘Fool, don’t you understand 
sn1.11:5.2	the saying of the perfected ones: 
sn1.11:5.3	All conditions are impermanent, 
sn1.11:5.4	their nature is to rise and fall; 
sn1.11:5.5	having arisen, they cease; 
sn1.11:5.6	their stilling is true bliss.’”

sn1.20:0.3	20. With Samiddhi 
sn1.20:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn1.20:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monastery. 
sn1.20:1.3	Then Venerable Samiddhi rose at the crack of dawn and went to the hot springs to bathe. 
sn1.20:1.4	When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying himself. 
sn1.20:1.5	Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire hot springs, went up to Samiddhi, and, standing in the air, addressed him in verse: 
sn1.20:2.1	“Mendicant, you seek alms before you eat; 
sn1.20:2.2	you wouldn’t seek alms after eating. 
sn1.20:2.3	But you should eat first, then seek alms: 
sn1.20:2.4	don’t let the time pass you by.” 
sn1.20:3.1	“I actually don’t know the time; 
sn1.20:3.2	it’s hidden and unseen. 
sn1.20:3.3	That’s why I seek alms before eating, 
sn1.20:3.4	so that the time may not pass me by!” 
sn1.20:4.1	Then that deity landed on the ground and said to Samiddhi, 
sn1.20:4.2	“You’ve gone forth while young, mendicant. You’re black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life, and you’ve never flirted with sensual pleasures. 
sn1.20:4.3	Enjoy human sensual pleasures! 
sn1.20:4.4	Don’t give up what is visible in the present to chase after what takes effect over time.” 
sn1.20:5.1	“I’m not, good sir; 
sn1.20:5.2	I’m giving up what takes effect over time to chase after what is visible in the present. 
sn1.20:5.3	For the Buddha has said that sensual pleasures take effect over time, with much suffering and distress, and they’re all the more full of drawbacks. 
sn1.20:5.4	But this teaching is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.” 
sn1.20:6.1	“But in what way, mendicant, has the Buddha said that sensual pleasures take effect over time, with much suffering and distress, and they’re all the more full of drawbacks? 
sn1.20:6.2	And how is this teaching visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves?” 
sn1.20:7.1	“I’m junior, good sir, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. 
sn1.20:7.2	I’m not able to explain this in detail. 
sn1.20:7.3	But the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is staying near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monatery. 
sn1.20:7.4	You should go to him and ask about this matter. 
sn1.20:7.5	And you should remember it in line with the Buddha’s answer.” 
sn1.20:8.1	“It’s not easy for us to approach the Buddha, as he is surrounded by other illustrious deities. 
sn1.20:8.2	If you go to the Buddha and ask him about this matter, we’ll come along and listen to the teaching.” 
sn1.20:8.3	“Yes, good sir,” Venerable Samiddhi replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then he added:

sn1.20:18.2	“Ask, mendicant, ask! For I have arrived.” 
sn1.20:19.1	Then the Buddha addressed the deity in verse: 
sn1.20:20.1	“Sentient beings who perceive the communicable, 
sn1.20:20.2	become established in the communicable. 
sn1.20:20.3	Not understanding the communicable,

sn1.20:21.1	But having fully understood the communicable, 
sn1.20:21.2	they don’t identify as a communicator,

sn1.20:22.2	Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.” 
sn1.20:23.1	“If you think that ‘I’m equal,

sn1.20:23.3	Unwavering in the face of the three discriminations, 
sn1.20:23.4	you’ll have no thought ‘I’m equal or special’.

sn1.31:6.3	Understanding the true teaching of the good, 
sn1.31:6.4	you grieve not among the grieving.” 
sn1.31:7.1	Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
sn1.31:8.1	“Associate only with the virtuous! 
sn1.31:8.2	Try to get close to the virtuous!

sn1.32:2.1	“Because of stinginess and negligence 
sn1.32:2.2	a gift is not given. 
sn1.32:2.3	Wanting merit, 
sn1.32:2.4	a smart person would give.” 
sn1.32:3.1	Then another deity recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: 
sn1.32:4.1	“When a miser fails to give because of fear, 
sn1.32:4.2	the very thing they’re afraid of comes to pass. 
sn1.32:4.3	The hunger and thirst 
sn1.32:4.4	that a miser fears 
sn1.32:4.5	hurt the fool 
sn1.32:4.6	in this world and the next. 
sn1.32:5.1	So you should dispel stinginess, 
sn1.32:5.2	overcoming that stain, and give a gift. 
sn1.32:5.3	The good deeds of sentient beings 
sn1.32:5.4	support them in the next world.” 
sn1.32:6.1	Then another deity recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: 
sn1.32:7.1	“Among the dead they do not die, 
sn1.32:7.2	those who, like fellow travelers on the road, 
sn1.32:7.3	are happy to provide, though they have but little. 
sn1.32:7.4	This is an ancient principle. 
sn1.32:8.1	Some who have little are happy to provide, 
sn1.32:8.2	while some who have much don’t wish to give. 
sn1.32:8.3	An offering given from little 
sn1.32:8.4	is multiplied a thousand times.” 
sn1.32:9.1	Then another deity recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: 
sn1.32:10.1	“Giving what’s hard to give, 
sn1.32:10.2	doing what’s hard to do; 
sn1.32:10.3	the wicked don’t act like this, 
sn1.32:10.4	for the teaching of the good is hard to follow. 
sn1.32:11.1	That’s why the virtuous and the wicked 
sn1.32:11.2	have different destinations after leaving this place. 
sn1.32:11.3	The wicked go to hell, 
sn1.32:11.4	while the virtuous are bound for heaven.” 
sn1.32:12.1	Then another deity said to the Buddha, 
sn1.32:12.2	“Sir, who has spoken well?” 
sn1.32:13.1	“You’ve all spoken well in your own way. However, listen to me also: 
sn1.32:14.1	A hundred thousand people making a thousand sacrifices 
sn1.32:14.2	isn’t worth a fraction 
sn1.32:14.3	of one who lives rightly, wandering for gleanings, 
sn1.32:14.4	or one who supports their partner from what little they have.” 
sn1.32:15.1	Then another deity addressed the Buddha in verse: 
sn1.32:16.1	“Why doesn’t that sacrifice of theirs, so abundant and magnificent, 
sn1.32:16.2	equal the value of a moral person’s gift? 
sn1.32:16.3	How is it that a hundred thousand people making a thousand sacrifices 
sn1.32:16.4	isn’t worth a fraction of what’s offered by such a person?” 
sn1.32:17.1	“Some give based on immorality—
sn1.32:17.2	after injuring, killing, and tormenting. 
sn1.32:17.3	Such an offering—tearful, violent—
sn1.32:17.4	in no way equals the value of a moral person’s gift. 
sn1.32:18.1	That’s how it is that a hundred thousand people making a thousand sacrifices 
sn1.32:18.2	isn’t worth a fraction of what’s offered by such a person.”

sn1.33:7.3	And it’s also good to give out of faith. 
sn1.33:7.4	Giving and warfare are similar, they say, 
sn1.33:7.5	for even a few of the good may conquer the many. 
sn1.33:7.6	If a faithful person gives even a little,

sn1.33:12.4	And it’s also good to give legitimate wealth. 
sn1.33:12.5	And it’s also good to give intelligently. 
sn1.33:13.1	The Holy One praises giving intelligently 
sn1.33:13.2	to those worthy of offerings here in the world of the living. 
sn1.33:13.3	What’s given to these is very fruitful, 
sn1.33:13.4	like seeds sown in a fertile field.” 
sn1.33:14.1	Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence:

sn1.33:15.5	And it’s also good to give intelligently. 
sn1.33:15.6	And it’s also good to be restrained when it comes to living creatures. 
sn1.33:16.1	One who lives without harming any living being 
sn1.33:16.2	never does bad because of others’ blame; 
sn1.33:16.3	for in that case they praise the coward, not the brave; 
sn1.33:16.4	and the virtuous never do bad out of fear.”

sn1.38:1.3	Now at that time the Buddha’s foot had been cut by a splinter. 
sn1.38:1.4	The Buddha was stricken by harrowing pains; physical feelings that were painful, sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, and disagreeable. 
sn1.38:1.5	But he endured unperturbed, with mindfulness and situational awareness. 
sn1.38:1.6	And then he spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware. 
sn1.38:2.1	Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Satullapa Group, lighting up the entire Maddukucchi, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. 
sn1.38:2.2	Standing to one side, one deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence: 
sn1.38:2.3	“The ascetic Gotama is such an elephant, sir!

sn1.38:7.1	Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence: 
sn1.38:7.2	“The ascetic Gotama is truly tamed, sir! 
sn1.38:7.3	And as someone tamed, he endures painful physical feelings … unperturbed.” 
sn1.38:8.1	Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence: 
sn1.38:8.2	“See, his immersion is so well developed, and his mind is so well freed—not leaning forward or pulling back, and not held in place by forceful suppression. 
sn1.38:8.3	If anyone imagines that they can overcome such an elephant of a man, a lion of a man, a thoroughbred of a man, a chief bull of a man, a behemoth of a man, a tamed man—what is that but a failure to see?” 
sn1.38:9.1	“Learned in the five Vedas, brahmins practice 
sn1.38:9.2	mortification for a full century.

sn1.38:11.1	Someone who’s fond of conceit can’t be tamed,

sn10.1:1.3	Then the native spirit Indaka went up to the Buddha, and addressed him in verse: 
sn10.1:2.1	“The Buddhas say that form is not the soul. 
sn10.1:2.2	Then how does this body manifest? 
sn10.1:2.3	Where do the bones and liver come from?

sn10.2:1.2	Then a spirit named Sakka went up to the Buddha, and addressed him in verse: 
sn10.2:2.1	“You’ve given up all ties, 
sn10.2:2.2	and are fully freed. 
sn10.2:2.3	It’s not a good idea for you, ascetic, 
sn10.2:2.4	to be instructing others.” 
sn10.2:3.1	“No matter what the apparent reason 
sn10.2:3.2	why people are together, Sakka, 
sn10.2:3.3	it’s unworthy for a wise person 
sn10.2:3.4	to not think of the other with compassion. 
sn10.2:4.1	If you instruct others 
sn10.2:4.2	with a mind clear and confident, 
sn10.2:4.3	your compassion and empathy 
sn10.2:4.4	don’t create attachments.”

sn10.3:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Gayā on the cut-stone ledge in the haunt of Spiky the native spirit. 
sn10.3:1.2	Now at that time the native spirits Shaggy and Spiky were passing by not far from the Buddha. 
sn10.3:1.3	So Shaggy said to Spiky, 
sn10.3:1.4	“That’s an ascetic.” 
sn10.3:1.5	“That’s no ascetic, he’s a faker! 
sn10.3:1.6	I’ll soon find out whether he’s an ascetic or a faker.” 
sn10.3:2.1	Then Spiky went up to the Buddha and leaned up against his body, 
sn10.3:2.2	but the Buddha pulled away. 
sn10.3:2.3	Then Spiky said to the Buddha, 
sn10.3:2.4	“Are you afraid, ascetic?” 
sn10.3:2.5	“No, sir, I’m not afraid. 
sn10.3:2.6	But your touch is nasty.” 
sn10.3:2.7	“I will ask you a question, ascetic. 
sn10.3:2.8	If you don’t answer me, I’ll drive you insane, or explode your heart, or grab you by the feet and throw you to the far shore of the Ganges!”

sn10.4:2.3	Each new day is better for the mindful,

sn10.5:1.2	Now at that time a certain lay woman had a son named Sānu who had been possessed by a native spirit. 
sn10.5:1.3	And as that lay woman wept, on that occasion she recited these verses: 
sn10.5:2.1	“I have heard this from the perfected ones. 
sn10.5:2.2	The native spirits will not mess with anyone

sn10.5:3.5	But now today I see

sn10.5:4.1	“What you heard from the perfected ones is right.

sn10.5:6.2	this saying of the native spirits: 
sn10.5:6.3	Don’t do bad deeds 
sn10.5:6.4	either openly or in secret. 
sn10.5:7.1	If you should do a bad deed, 
sn10.5:7.2	or you’re doing one now, 
sn10.5:7.3	you won’t be freed from suffering,

sn10.5:8.2	or for one who’s alive but has disappeared. 
sn10.5:8.3	I’m alive and you can see me,

sn10.5:9.1	“Son, they cry for the dead,

sn10.5:9.4	only to come back here again: 
sn10.5:9.5	they cry for them as well,

sn10.5:10.1	My dear, you’ve been rescued from hot coals,

sn10.7:1.2	Now at that time the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about extinguishment. 
sn10.7:1.3	And those mendicants were paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear.

sn11.1:0.3	1. With Suvīra 
sn11.1:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn11.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
sn11.1:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
sn11.1:1.4	“Mendicants!” 
sn11.1:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
sn11.1:1.6	The Buddha said this: 
sn11.1:2.1	“Once upon a time, mendicants, the demons marched against the gods. 
sn11.1:2.2	Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the god Suvīra, 
sn11.1:2.3	‘Dear Suvīra, the demons march against the gods! 
sn11.1:2.4	Go, and march against the demons!’ 
sn11.1:2.5	‘Yes, lord,’ replied Suvīra. But he fell into negligence. 
sn11.1:2.6	For a second time Sakka addressed Suvīra, 
sn11.1:2.7	‘Dear Suvīra, the demons march against the gods! 
sn11.1:2.8	Go, and march against the demons!’ 
sn11.1:2.9	‘Yes, lord,’ replied Suvīra. But for a second time he fell into negligence. 
sn11.1:2.10	For a third time Sakka addressed Suvīra, 
sn11.1:2.11	‘Dear Suvīra, the demons march against the gods! 
sn11.1:2.12	Go, and march against the demons!’ 
sn11.1:2.13	‘Yes, lord,’ replied Suvīra. But for a third time he fell into negligence. 
sn11.1:2.14	Then Sakka addressed the god Suvīra in verse: 
sn11.1:3.1	‘Suvīra, go to that place 
sn11.1:3.2	where you can achieve happiness 
sn11.1:3.3	without working for it or trying hard—
sn11.1:3.4	and take me with you!’ 
sn11.1:4.1	‘That a lazy man who does no work, 
sn11.1:4.2	and doesn’t do his duty, 
sn11.1:4.3	should fulfill all his desires: 
sn11.1:4.4	Sakka, grant me this boon!’ 
sn11.1:5.1	‘Suvīra, go to that place 
sn11.1:5.2	where a lazy man who does no work 
sn11.1:5.3	prospers in unending happiness—
sn11.1:5.4	and take me with you!’

sn11.1:8.1	So, mendicants, even Sakka, lord of gods—while living off of the fruit of his good and bad deeds, and ruling as sovereign lord over these gods of the Thirty-Three—will speak in praise of initiative and energy. 
sn11.1:8.2	But since you have gone forth in such a well explained teaching and training, it would be truly beautiful for you to try hard, strive, and make an effort to attain the unattained, achieve the unachieved, and realize the unrealized!”

sn11.22:1.1	Near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove. 
sn11.22:1.2	 
sn11.22:1.3	“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a native spirit who was ugly and deformed. He sat on the throne of Sakka, lord of gods. 
sn11.22:1.4	But the gods of the Thirty-Three complained, grumbled, and objected, 
sn11.22:1.5	‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing!

sn11.22:3.2	‘Good sir, I am Sakka, lord of gods! Good sir, I am Sakka, the lord of gods!’ 
sn11.22:3.3	But the more Sakka pronounced his name, the uglier and more deformed the spirit became, 
sn11.22:3.4	until eventually it vanished right there. 
sn11.22:3.5	Then Sakka, lord of gods, guiding the gods of the Thirty-Three, recited this verse:

sn11.3:1.5	The Buddha said this: 
sn11.3:2.1	“Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons. 
sn11.3:2.2	Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three: 
sn11.3:3.1	‘Good sirs, when the gods are fighting, if you get scared or terrified, just look up at my banner’s crest. 
sn11.3:3.2	Then your fear and terror will go away.

sn11.3:7.1	However, when they look up at those banner’s crests their fear and terror might go away or it might not. 
sn11.3:8.1	Why is that? 
sn11.3:8.2	Because Sakka is not free of greed, hate, and delusion. He is fearful, scared, nervous, quick to flee. 
sn11.3:9.1	But, mendicants, I say this: 
sn11.3:9.2	If you’ve gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut and you get scared or terrified, just recollect me: 
sn11.3:9.3	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
sn11.3:9.4	Then your fear and terror will go away. 
sn11.3:10.1	If you can’t recollect me, then recollect the teaching: 
sn11.3:10.2	‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ 
sn11.3:10.3	Then your fear and terror will go away. 
sn11.3:11.1	If you can’t recollect the teaching, then recollect the Saṅgha: 
sn11.3:11.2	‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ 
sn11.3:11.3	Then your fear and terror will go away. 
sn11.3:12.1	Why is that? 
sn11.3:12.2	Because the Realized One is free of greed, hate, and delusion. He is fearless, brave, bold, and stands his ground.” 
sn11.3:12.3	That is what the Buddha said. 
sn11.3:12.4	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
sn11.3:13.1	“In the wilderness, at a tree’s root, 
sn11.3:13.2	or an empty hut, O mendicants, 
sn11.3:13.3	recollect the Buddha, 
sn11.3:13.4	and no fear will come to you. 
sn11.3:14.1	If you can’t recollect the Buddha—
sn11.3:14.2	the eldest in the world, the bull of a man—
sn11.3:14.3	then recollect the teaching, 
sn11.3:14.4	emancipating, well taught. 
sn11.3:15.1	If you can’t recollect the teaching—
sn11.3:15.2	emancipating, well taught—
sn11.3:15.3	then recollect the Saṅgha, 
sn11.3:15.4	the supreme field of merit.

sn11.3:16.2	the teaching, and the Saṅgha, mendicants, 
sn11.3:16.3	fear and terror 
sn11.3:16.4	and goosebumps will be no more.”

sn11.4:1.1	At Sāvatthī. 
sn11.4:1.2	“Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons. 
sn11.4:1.3	Then Vepacitti, lord of demons, addressed the demons, 
sn11.4:1.4	‘My good sirs, if the demons defeat the gods in this battle, bind Sakka, the lord of gods, by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the castle of demons.’ 
sn11.4:1.5	Meanwhile, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three, 
sn11.4:1.6	‘My good sirs, if the gods defeat the demons in this battle, bind Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the Sudhamma hall of the gods.’ 
sn11.4:1.7	In that battle the gods won and the demons lost. 
sn11.4:1.8	So the gods of the Thirty-Three bound Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and brought him to Sakka’s presence in the Sudhamma hall of the gods. 
sn11.4:1.9	And as Sakka was entering and leaving the hall, Vepacitti abused and insulted him with rude, harsh words. 
sn11.4:1.10	So Mātali the charioteer addressed Sakka in verse, 
sn11.4:2.1	‘O Maghavā, O Sakka, 
sn11.4:2.2	is it from fear or from weakness 
sn11.4:2.3	that you put up with such harsh words 
sn11.4:2.4	in the presence of Vepacitti?’ 
sn11.4:3.1	‘It’s not out of fear or weakness 
sn11.4:3.2	that I’m patient with Vepacitti. 
sn11.4:3.3	For how can a sensible person like me 
sn11.4:3.4	get in a fight with a fool?’ 
sn11.4:4.1	‘Fools would vent even more 
sn11.4:4.2	if there’s no-one to put a stop to them. 
sn11.4:4.3	So a wise one should stop 
sn11.4:4.4	a fool with forceful punishment.’ 
sn11.4:5.1	‘I think that this is the only way 
sn11.4:5.2	to put a stop to a fool, 
sn11.4:5.3	when you know that the other is upset, 
sn11.4:5.4	be mindful and stay calm.’ 
sn11.4:6.1	‘I see this fault, Vāsava, 
sn11.4:6.2	in just being patient. 
sn11.4:6.3	When a fool thinks, 
sn11.4:6.4	“He puts up with me out of fear,” 
sn11.4:6.5	the idiot will go after you even harder, 
sn11.4:6.6	like a cow chasing someone who runs away.’ 
sn11.4:7.1	‘Let him think this if he wishes, or not—
sn11.4:7.2	“He puts up with me out of fear.” 
sn11.4:7.3	Of goals culminating in one’s own good, 
sn11.4:7.4	none better than patience is found. 
sn11.4:8.1	When a strong person 
sn11.4:8.2	puts up with a weakling, 
sn11.4:8.3	they call that the ultimate patience, 
sn11.4:8.4	for a weakling must always be patient. 
sn11.4:9.1	The strength of folly 
sn11.4:9.2	is really just weakness, they say. 
sn11.4:9.3	But no-one can challenge a person 
sn11.4:9.4	who’s strong, guarded by the teaching. 
sn11.4:10.1	When you get angry at an angry person 
sn11.4:10.2	you just make things worse for yourself. 
sn11.4:10.3	When you don’t get angry at an angry person 
sn11.4:10.4	you win a battle hard to win. 
sn11.4:11.1	When you know that the other is angry, 
sn11.4:11.2	you act for the good of both 
sn11.4:11.3	yourself and the other 
sn11.4:11.4	if you’re mindful and stay calm. 
sn11.4:12.1	People unfamiliar with the teaching 
sn11.4:12.2	consider one who heals both 
sn11.4:12.3	oneself and the other 
sn11.4:12.4	to be a fool.’ 
sn11.4:13.1	So, mendicants, even Sakka, lord of gods—while living off of the fruit of his good and bad deeds, and ruling as sovereign lord over these gods of the Thirty-Three—will speak in praise of patience and gentleness. 
sn11.4:13.2	But since you have gone forth in such a well explained teaching and training, it would be truly beautiful for you to be patient and gentle!”

sn12.12:1.4	Solid food, whether coarse or fine; contact is the second, mental intention the third, and consciousness the fourth. 
sn12.12:1.5	These are the four fuels that maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born.” 
sn12.12:2.1	When he said this, Venerable Phagguna of the Top-Knot said to the Buddha, 
sn12.12:2.2	“But sir, who consumes the fuel for consciousness?” 
sn12.12:2.3	“That’s not a fitting question,” said the Buddha. 
sn12.12:2.4	“I don’t speak of one who consumes. 
sn12.12:2.5	If I were to speak of one who consumes, then it would be fitting to ask 
sn12.12:2.6	who consumes. 
sn12.12:2.7	But I don’t speak like that. 
sn12.12:2.8	Hence it would be fitting to ask: 
sn12.12:2.9	‘Consciousness is a fuel for what?’ 
sn12.12:2.10	And a fitting answer to this would be:

sn12.12:3.1	“But sir, who contacts?” 
sn12.12:3.2	“That’s not a fitting question,” said the Buddha. 
sn12.12:3.3	“I don’t speak of one who contacts. 
sn12.12:3.4	If I were to speak of one who contacts, then it would be fitting to ask 
sn12.12:3.5	who contacts.

sn12.17:2.8	“I don’t want to ask much.” 
sn12.17:2.9	“Ask what you wish, Kassapa.” 
sn12.17:3.1	“Well, Master Gotama, is suffering made by oneself?” 
sn12.17:3.2	“Not so, Kassapa,” said the Buddha. 
sn12.17:3.3	“Then is suffering made by another?”

sn12.17:3.5	“Well, is suffering made by both oneself and another?” 
sn12.17:3.6	“Not so, Kassapa,” said the Buddha. 
sn12.17:3.7	“Then does suffering arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?” 
sn12.17:3.8	“Not so, Kassapa,” said the Buddha. 
sn12.17:3.9	“Well, is there no such thing as suffering?” 
sn12.17:3.10	“It’s not that there’s no such thing as suffering. 
sn12.17:3.11	Suffering is real.” 
sn12.17:3.12	“Then Master Gotama doesn’t know nor see suffering.” 
sn12.17:3.13	“It’s not that I don’t know or see suffering. 
sn12.17:3.14	I do know suffering, 
sn12.17:3.15	I do see suffering.” 
sn12.17:4.1	“Master Gotama, when asked these questions, you say ‘not so’. 
sn12.17:4.2

sn12.17:4.10	Teach me about suffering!” 
sn12.17:5.1	“Suppose that the person who does the deed experiences the result. Then for one who has existed since the beginning, suffering is made by oneself. This statement leans toward eternalism. 
sn12.17:5.2	Suppose that one person does the deed and another experiences the result. Then for one stricken by feeling, suffering is made by another. This statement leans toward annihilationism. 
sn12.17:5.3	Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way: 
sn12.17:5.4	‘Ignorance is a condition for choices.

sn12.17:6.1	When this was said, Kassapa said to the Buddha, 
sn12.17:6.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent! 
sn12.17:6.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
sn12.17:6.4	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
sn12.17:6.5	Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” 
sn12.17:7.1	“Kassapa, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood. 
sn12.17:7.2	However, I have recognized individual differences.” 
sn12.17:8.1	“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.” 
sn12.17:9.1	And the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. 
sn12.17:9.2	Not long after his ordination, Venerable Kassapa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
sn12.17:9.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” 
sn12.17:9.4	And Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfected.

sn12.19:6.1	For an astute person hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, this body has been produced. But the astute person has given up that ignorance and finished that craving. 
sn12.19:6.2	Why is that? 
sn12.19:6.3	The astute person has completed the spiritual journey for the complete ending of suffering. 
sn12.19:6.4	Therefore, when their body breaks up, the astute person is not reborn in another body.

sn12.1:0.3	1. Dependent Origination 
sn12.1:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn12.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
sn12.1:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
sn12.1:1.4	“Mendicants!” 
sn12.1:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
sn12.1:1.6	The Buddha said this: 
sn12.1:1.7	“Mendicants, I will teach you dependent origination. 
sn12.1:1.8	Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
sn12.1:1.9	“Yes, sir,” they replied. 
sn12.1:1.10	The Buddha said this: 
sn12.1:2.1	“And what is dependent origination? 
sn12.1:2.2	Ignorance is a condition for choices. 
sn12.1:2.3	Choices are a condition for consciousness. 
sn12.1:2.4	Consciousness is a condition for name and form. 
sn12.1:2.5	Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. 
sn12.1:2.6	The six sense fields are conditions for contact. 
sn12.1:2.7	Contact is a condition for feeling. 
sn12.1:2.8	Feeling is a condition for craving. 
sn12.1:2.9	Craving is a condition for grasping. 
sn12.1:2.10	Grasping is a condition for continued existence. 
sn12.1:2.11	Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. 
sn12.1:2.12	Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. 
sn12.1:2.13	That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. 
sn12.1:2.14	This is called dependent origination. 
sn12.1:3.1	When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. 
sn12.1:3.2	When choices cease, consciousness ceases. 
sn12.1:3.3	When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. 
sn12.1:3.4	When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. 
sn12.1:3.5	When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. 
sn12.1:3.6	When contact ceases, feeling ceases. 
sn12.1:3.7	When feeling ceases, craving ceases. 
sn12.1:3.8	When craving ceases, grasping ceases. 
sn12.1:3.9	When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. 
sn12.1:3.10	When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. 
sn12.1:3.11	When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. 
sn12.1:3.12	That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.” 
sn12.1:3.13	That is what the Buddha said. 
sn12.1:3.14	Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.

sn12.20:1.3	Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
sn12.20:1.4	“Yes, sir,” they replied. 
sn12.20:1.5	The Buddha said this: 
sn12.20:2.1	“And what is dependent origination? 
sn12.20:2.2	Rebirth is a condition for old age and death. 
sn12.20:2.3	Whether Realized Ones arise or not, this law of nature persists, this regularity of natural principles, this invariance of natural principles, specific conditionality. 
sn12.20:2.4	A Realized One understands this and comprehends it, 
sn12.20:2.5	then he explains, teaches, asserts, establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals it. 
sn12.20:2.6	‘Look,’ he says, 
sn12.20:2.7	‘Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’ 
sn12.20:3.1	Continued existence is a condition for rebirth …

sn12.20:3.12	A Realized One understands this and comprehends it,

sn12.20:3.14	‘Look,’ he says, 
sn12.20:3.15	‘Ignorance is a condition for choices.’ 
sn12.20:3.16	So the fact that this is real, not unreal, not otherwise; the specific conditionality of it: 
sn12.20:3.17	this is called dependent origination. 
sn12.20:4.1	And what are the dependently originated phenomena? 
sn12.20:4.2	Old age and death are impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated, liable to end, vanish, fade away, and cease. 
sn12.20:4.3	Rebirth … 
sn12.20:4.4	Continued existence … 
sn12.20:4.5	Grasping …

sn12.20:4.11	Consciousness … 
sn12.20:4.12	Choices … 
sn12.20:4.13	Ignorance is impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated, liable to end, vanish, fade away, and cease. 
sn12.20:4.14	These are called the dependently originated phenomena. 
sn12.20:5.1	When a noble disciple has clearly seen with right wisdom this dependent origination and these dependently originated phenomena as they are, it’s impossible for them to turn back to the past, thinking: 
sn12.20:5.2	‘Did I exist in the past? Did I not exist in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? After being what, what did I become in the past?’ 
sn12.20:5.3	Or to turn forward to the future, thinking: 
sn12.20:5.4	‘Will I exist in the future? Will I not exist in the future? What will I be in the future? How will I be in the future? After being what, what will I become in the future?’ 
sn12.20:5.5	Or to be undecided about the present, thinking: 
sn12.20:5.6	‘Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? This sentient being—where did it come from? And where will it go?’ 
sn12.20:5.7	 
sn12.20:5.8	Why is that? 
sn12.20:5.9	Because that noble disciple has clearly seen with right wisdom this dependent origination and these dependently originated phenomena as they are.”

sn12.2:13.4	These are called choices. 
sn12.2:14.1	And what is ignorance? 
sn12.2:14.2	Not knowing about suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. 
sn12.2:14.3	This is called ignorance. 
sn12.2:15.1	And so, ignorance is a condition for choices. 
sn12.2:15.2	Choices are a condition for consciousness. … 
sn12.2:15.3	That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. 
sn12.2:15.4	When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. 
sn12.2:15.5	When choices cease, consciousness ceases. …

sn12.31:0.3	31. What Has Come to Be 
sn12.31:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī. 
sn12.31:1.2	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta, 
sn12.31:1.3	“Sāriputta, this was said in ‘The Way to the Beyond’, in ‘The Questions of Ajita’: 
sn12.31:2.1	‘There are those who have assessed the teaching, 
sn12.31:2.2	and many kinds of trainees here.
sn12.31:2.3	Tell me about their behavior, good sir,
sn12.31:2.4	when asked, for you are alert.’
sn12.31:3.1	How should we see the detailed meaning of this brief statement?” 
sn12.31:3.2	When he said this, Sāriputta kept silent.

sn12.31:7.1	“Sāriputta, do you see that this has come to be?” 
sn12.31:7.2	“Sir, one truly sees with right wisdom that this has come to be. 
sn12.31:7.3	Seeing this, one is practicing for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding what has come to be. 
sn12.31:7.4	One truly sees with right wisdom that it originated with that as fuel. 
sn12.31:7.5	Seeing this, one is practicing for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding the fuel for its origination. 
sn12.31:7.6	One truly sees with right wisdom that when that fuel ceases, what has come to be is liable to cease. 
sn12.31:7.7	Seeing this, one is practicing for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding what is liable to cease. 
sn12.31:7.8	In this way one is a trainee. 
sn12.31:8.1	And what, sir, is one who has assessed the teaching? 
sn12.31:8.2	Sir, one truly sees with right wisdom that this has come to be. 
sn12.31:8.3	Seeing this, one is freed by not grasping through disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding what has come to be. 
sn12.31:8.4	One truly sees with right wisdom that it originated with that as fuel.

sn12.31:9.1	‘There are those who have assessed the teaching,

sn12.32:1.1	At Sāvatthī. 
sn12.32:1.2	Then the mendicant Kaḷāra the Aristocrat went up to Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. 
sn12.32:1.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him, 
sn12.32:1.4	“Reverend Sāriputta, the mendicant Phagguna of the Top-Knot has resigned the training and returned to a lesser life.” 
sn12.32:1.5	“That venerable mustn’t have got any satisfaction in this teaching and training.” 
sn12.32:2.1	“Well then, has Venerable Sāriputta found satisfaction in this teaching and training?” 
sn12.32:3.1	“Reverend, I have no uncertainty.” 
sn12.32:3.2	“But what of the future?” 
sn12.32:4.1	“I have no doubt.” 
sn12.32:5.1	Then Kaḷāra the Aristocrat went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
sn12.32:5.2	“Sir, Venerable Sāriputta has declared enlightenment: 
sn12.32:5.3	‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’” 
sn12.32:6.1	So the Buddha addressed a certain monk,

sn12.32:6.3	the teacher summons him.” 
sn12.32:6.4	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Sāriputta and said to him, 
sn12.32:6.5	“Reverend Sāriputta, the teacher summons you.” 
sn12.32:6.6	“Yes, reverend,” replied Sāriputta. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, 
sn12.32:6.7	“Sāriputta, is it really true that you have declared enlightenment: 
sn12.32:6.8	‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence”’?” 
sn12.32:6.9	“Sir, I did not state the meaning in these words and phrases.” 
sn12.32:6.10	“Sāriputta, no matter how a gentleman declares enlightenment, what he has declared should be regarded as such.” 
sn12.32:6.11	“Sir, did I not also say that 
sn12.32:6.12	I did not state the meaning in these words and phrases?” 
sn12.32:7.1	“Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you:

sn12.32:7.3	“I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”’

sn12.32:8.2	 
sn12.32:8.3	 
sn12.32:8.4	I would answer:

sn12.32:8.7	I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’

sn12.32:12.9	These three feelings are impermanent,

sn12.32:15.1	“Good, good, Sāriputta!

sn12.32:15.3	‘I have no uncertainty regarding the defilements spoken of by the ascetic. I have no doubt that I’ve given them up.’” 
sn12.32:15.4	That is what the Buddha said. 
sn12.32:15.5	When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. 
sn12.32:16.1	Then soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Sāriputta said to the mendicants, 
sn12.32:16.2	“Reverends, the first question that the Buddha asked me was something that I’d not previously considered, so I hesitated. 
sn12.32:16.3	But when the Buddha agreed with my answer, I thought: 
sn12.32:16.4	‘If the Buddha were to question me all day on this matter in different words and ways, I could answer all day with different words and ways. 
sn12.32:16.5	If he were to question me all night,

sn12.32:17.1	Then Kaḷāra the Aristocrat went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,

sn12.33:1.4	“Yes, sir,” they replied. 
sn12.33:1.5	The Buddha said this: 
sn12.33:2.1	“And what are the forty-four grounds for knowledge? 
sn12.33:2.2	Knowledge of old age and death, knowledge of the origin of old age and death, knowledge of the cessation of old age and death, and knowledge of the practice that leads to the cessation of old age and death.

sn12.33:2.13	These are called the forty-four grounds for knowledge. 
sn12.33:3.1	And what is old age and death? 
sn12.33:3.2	The old age, decrepitude, broken teeth, grey hair, wrinkly skin, diminished vitality, and failing faculties of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings. 
sn12.33:3.3	This is called old age. 
sn12.33:3.4	The passing away, perishing, disintegration, demise, mortality, death, decease, breaking up of the aggregates, and laying to rest of the corpse of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.

sn12.33:3.7	This is called old age and death. 
sn12.33:4.1	Rebirth is the origin of old age and death. 
sn12.33:4.2	When rebirth ceases, old age and death cease. 
sn12.33:4.3	The practice that leads to the cessation of old age and death is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: 
sn12.33:4.4	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 
sn12.33:5.1	A noble disciple understands old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation. This is their knowledge of the present phenomenon.

sn12.33:6.1	Whatever ascetics and brahmins in the past directly knew old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation, all of them directly knew these things in exactly the same way that I do now. 
sn12.33:7.1	Whatever ascetics and brahmins in the future will directly know old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation, all of them will directly know these things in exactly the same way that I do now. 
sn12.33:7.2	This is their inferential knowledge. 
sn12.33:8.1	A noble disciple has purified and cleansed these two knowledges—
sn12.33:8.2	knowledge of the present phenomena, and inferential knowledge. 
sn12.33:8.3	When a noble disciple has done this, they’re called ‘one accomplished in view’, ‘one accomplished in vision’, ‘one who has come to the true teaching’, ‘one who sees this true teaching’, ‘one endowed with a trainee’s knowledge’, ‘one who has entered the stream of the teaching’, ‘a noble one with penetrative wisdom’, and ‘one who stands pushing open the door of the deathless’.

sn12.33:9.13	These are called choices. 
sn12.33:10.1	Ignorance is the origin of choices.

sn12.51:0.3	51. A Full Inquiry 
sn12.51:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn12.51:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
sn12.51:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
sn12.51:1.4	“Mendicants!” 
sn12.51:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
sn12.51:1.6	The Buddha said this: 
sn12.51:2.1	“Mendicants, how do you define a mendicant who is making a full inquiry for the complete ending of suffering?” 
sn12.51:2.2	“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” 
sn12.51:2.3	“Well then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
sn12.51:2.4	“Yes, sir,” they replied. 
sn12.51:2.5	The Buddha said this: 
sn12.51:3.1	“Mendicants, take a mendicant who makes a full inquiry: 
sn12.51:3.2	‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms. 
sn12.51:3.3	What is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of this suffering? 
sn12.51:3.4	When what exists do old age and death come to be? When what does not exist do old age and death not come to be?’ 
sn12.51:3.5	While making a full inquiry they understand: 
sn12.51:3.6	‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms. The source of this suffering is rebirth. 
sn12.51:3.7	When rebirth exists, old age and death come to be. When rebirth doesn’t exist, old age and death don’t come to be.’ 
sn12.51:4.1	They understand old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation. And they practice in line with that path. 
sn12.51:4.2	This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of old age and death. 
sn12.51:5.1	Then they inquire further: 
sn12.51:5.2	‘But what is the source of this rebirth? When what exists does rebirth come to be? And when what does not exist does rebirth not come to be?’ 
sn12.51:5.3	While making a full inquiry they understand: 
sn12.51:5.4	‘Continued existence is the source of rebirth. 
sn12.51:5.5	When continued existence exists, rebirth comes to be. When continued existence does not exist, rebirth doesn’t come to be.’ 
sn12.51:6.1	They understand rebirth, its origin, its cessation, and the fitting practice for its cessation. And they practice in line with that path. 
sn12.51:6.2	This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of rebirth. 
sn12.51:7.1	Then they inquire further: 
sn12.51:7.2	‘But what is the source of this continued existence? …’ … 
sn12.51:7.3	‘But what is the source of this grasping? …’ … 
sn12.51:7.4	‘But what is the source of this craving? …’ … 
sn12.51:7.5	‘But what is the source of this feeling? …’ … 
sn12.51:7.6	‘But what is the source of this contact? …’ … 
sn12.51:7.7	‘But what is the source of these six sense fields? …’ … 
sn12.51:7.8	‘But what is the source of this name and form? …’ … 
sn12.51:7.9	‘But what is the source of this consciousness? …’ … 
sn12.51:7.10	‘But what is the source of these choices? 
sn12.51:7.11	When what exists do choices come to be? When what does not exist do choices not come to be?’ 
sn12.51:7.12	While making a full inquiry they understand: 
sn12.51:7.13	‘Ignorance is the source of choices. 
sn12.51:7.14	When ignorance exists, choices come to be. When ignorance does not exist, choices don’t come to be.’ 
sn12.51:8.1	They understand choices, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation. And they practice in line with that path. 
sn12.51:8.2	This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of choices. 
sn12.51:9.1	If an ignorant individual makes a good choice, their consciousness enters a good realm. 
sn12.51:9.2	If they make a bad choice, their consciousness enters a bad realm. 
sn12.51:9.3	If they make an imperturbable choice, their consciousness enters an imperturbable realm. 
sn12.51:9.4	When a mendicant has given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge, they don’t make a good choice, a bad choice, or an imperturbable choice. 
sn12.51:9.5	Not choosing or intending, they don’t grasp at anything in the world. 
sn12.51:9.6	Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished. 
sn12.51:9.7	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
sn12.51:10.1	If they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. 
sn12.51:10.2	If they feel a painful feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. 
sn12.51:10.3	If they feel a neutral feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. 
sn12.51:10.4	If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it detached. 
sn12.51:10.5	If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it detached. 
sn12.51:10.6	If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached. 
sn12.51:11.1	Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’ 
sn12.51:11.2	They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here. Only bodily remains will be left.’ 
sn12.51:12.1	Suppose a person were to remove a hot clay pot from a potter’s kiln and place it down on level ground. 
sn12.51:12.2	Its heat would dissipate right there, and the shards would be left behind. 
sn12.51:12.3	In the same way, feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’ 
sn12.51:12.4	They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here. Only bodily remains will be left.’ 
sn12.51:13.1	What do you think, mendicants? 
sn12.51:13.2	Would a mendicant who has ended the defilements still make good choices, bad choices, or imperturbable choices?” 
sn12.51:13.3	“No, sir.” 
sn12.51:14.1	“And when there are no choices at all, with the cessation of choices, would consciousness still be found?” 
sn12.51:14.2	“No, sir.” 
sn12.51:15.1	“And when there’s no consciousness at all, would name and form still be found?”

sn12.51:19.2	“No, sir.” 
sn12.51:20.1	“And when there’s no craving at all, would grasping still be found?” 
sn12.51:20.2	“No, sir.” 
sn12.51:21.1	“And when there’s no grasping at all, would continued existence still be found?” 
sn12.51:21.2	“No, sir.” 
sn12.51:22.1	“And when there’s no continued existence at all, would rebirth still be found?” 
sn12.51:22.2	“No, sir.” 
sn12.51:23.1	“And when there’s no rebirth at all, would old age and death still be found?” 
sn12.51:23.2	“No, sir.” 
sn12.51:24.1	“Good, good, mendicants! That’s how it is, not otherwise. 
sn12.51:24.2	Trust me on this, mendicants; be convinced. Have no doubts or uncertainties in this matter.

sn12.61:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn12.61:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. … 
sn12.61:1.3	“Mendicants, when it comes to this body made up of the four primary elements, an uneducated ordinary person might become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed. 
sn12.61:1.4	Why is that? 
sn12.61:1.5	This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to accumulate and disperse, to be taken up and laid to rest. 
sn12.61:1.6	That’s why, when it comes to this body, an uneducated ordinary person might become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed. 
sn12.61:2.1	But when it comes to that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’, an uneducated ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned, dispassionate, or freed. 
sn12.61:2.2	Why is that? 
sn12.61:2.3	Because for a long time they’ve been attached to it, thought of it as their own, and mistaken it: 
sn12.61:2.4	‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’ 
sn12.61:2.5	That’s why, when it comes to this mind, an uneducated ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed. 
sn12.61:3.1	But an uneducated ordinary person would be better off taking this body made up of the four primary elements to be their self, rather than the mind. 
sn12.61:3.2	Why is that? 
sn12.61:3.3	This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to last for a year, or for two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or a hundred years, or even longer. 
sn12.61:4.1	But that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all night. 
sn12.61:4.2	It’s like a monkey moving through the forest. It grabs hold of one branch, lets it go, and grabs another; then it lets that go and grabs yet another. 
sn12.61:4.3	In the same way, that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all night. 
sn12.61:5.1	In this case, a learned noble disciple carefully and properly attends to dependent origination itself: 
sn12.61:5.2	‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. 
sn12.61:5.3	When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is: 
sn12.61:5.4	Ignorance is a condition for choices.

sn12.61:6.1	Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. 
sn12.61:6.2	Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.

sn12.63:1.3	What four? 
sn12.63:1.4	Solid food, whether coarse or fine; contact is the second, mental intention the third, and consciousness the fourth. 
sn12.63:1.5	These are the four fuels that maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born. 
sn12.63:2.1	And how should you regard solid food? 
sn12.63:2.2	Suppose a couple who were husband and wife set out to cross a desert, taking limited supplies. 
sn12.63:2.3	They had an only child, dear and beloved. 
sn12.63:2.4	As the couple were crossing the desert their limited quantity of supplies would run out, 
sn12.63:2.5	and they’d still have the rest of the desert to cross. 
sn12.63:2.6	Then it would occur to that couple: 
sn12.63:2.7	‘Our limited quantity of supplies has run out, 
sn12.63:2.8	and we still have the rest of the desert to cross.

sn12.63:3.4	“Wouldn’t they eat that food just so they could make it across the desert?” 
sn12.63:3.5	“Yes, sir.” 
sn12.63:3.6	“I say that this is how you should regard solid food. 
sn12.63:3.7	When solid food is completely understood, desire for the five kinds of sensual stimulation is completely understood. 
sn12.63:3.8	When desire for the five kinds of sensual stimulation is completely understood, a noble disciple is bound by no fetter that might return them again to this world.

sn12.63:5.3	Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain. 
sn12.63:5.4	Then two strong men would grab them by the arms and drag them towards the pit of glowing coals. 
sn12.63:5.5	Then that person’s intention, aim, and wish would be to get far away. 
sn12.63:5.6	Why is that? 
sn12.63:5.7	Because that person would think: 
sn12.63:5.8	‘If I fall in that pit of glowing coals, that will result in my death or deadly pain.’ 
sn12.63:5.9	I say that this is how you should regard mental intention as fuel.

sn12.63:5.11	When the three cravings are completely understood, a noble disciple has nothing further to do, I say. 
sn12.63:6.1	And how should you regard consciousness as fuel? 
sn12.63:6.2	Suppose they were to arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to the king, saying: 
sn12.63:6.3	‘Your Majesty, this is a bandit, a criminal. Punish him as you will.’ 
sn12.63:6.4	The king would say: 
sn12.63:6.5	‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the morning with a hundred spears!’ 
sn12.63:6.6	The king’s men did as they were told. 
sn12.63:6.7	Then at midday the king would say: 
sn12.63:6.8	‘My men, how is that man?’ 
sn12.63:6.9	‘He’s still alive, Your Majesty.’ 
sn12.63:6.10	The king would say: 
sn12.63:6.11	‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the middle of the day with a hundred spears!’ 
sn12.63:6.12	The king’s men did as they were told. 
sn12.63:6.13	Then late in the afternoon the king would say: 
sn12.63:6.14	‘My men, how is that man?’ 
sn12.63:6.15	‘He’s still alive, Your Majesty.’ 
sn12.63:6.16	The king would say: 
sn12.63:6.17	‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the late afternoon with a hundred spears!’ 
sn12.63:6.18	The king’s men did as they were told. 
sn12.63:6.19	What do you think, mendicants? 
sn12.63:6.20	Would that man experience pain and distress from being struck with three hundred spears a day?” 
sn12.63:6.21	“Sir, that man would experience pain and distress from being struck with one spear, 
sn12.63:6.22	let alone three hundred spears!” 
sn12.63:6.23	“I say that this is how you should regard consciousness as fuel. 
sn12.63:6.24	When consciousness as fuel is completely understood, name and form is completely understood. When name and form are completely understood, a noble disciple has nothing further to do, I say.”

sn12.64:1.2	“Mendicants, there are these four fuels. They maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born. 
sn12.64:1.3	What four? 
sn12.64:1.4	Solid food, whether coarse or fine; contact is the second, mental intention the third, and consciousness the fourth. 
sn12.64:1.5	These are the four fuels that maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born.

sn12.64:2.6	Where there is rebirth, old age, and death in the future, I say this is full of sorrow, anguish, and distress.

sn12.65:0.3	65. The City 
sn12.65:1.1	At Sāvatthī. 
sn12.65:1.2	“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought: 
sn12.65:1.3	‘Alas, this world has fallen into trouble. It’s born, grows old, dies, passes away, and is reborn, 
sn12.65:1.4	yet it doesn’t understand how to escape from this suffering, from old age and death. 
sn12.65:1.5	Oh, when will an escape be found from this suffering, from old age and death?’ 
sn12.65:1.6	Then it occurred to me: 
sn12.65:1.7	‘When what exists is there old age and death? What is a condition for old age and death?’ 
sn12.65:1.8	Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: 
sn12.65:1.9	‘When rebirth exists there’s old age and death. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’ 
sn12.65:2.1	Then it occurred to me: 
sn12.65:2.2	‘When what exists is there rebirth? …

sn12.65:2.10	What is a condition for name and form?’ 
sn12.65:2.11	Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: 
sn12.65:2.12	‘When consciousness exists there are name and form. Consciousness is a condition for name and form.’ 
sn12.65:2.13	Then it occurred to me: 
sn12.65:2.14	‘When what exists is there consciousness? What is a condition for consciousness?’ 
sn12.65:2.15	Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: 
sn12.65:2.16	‘When name and form exist there’s consciousness. Name and form are a condition for consciousness.’ 
sn12.65:3.1	Then it occurred to me: 
sn12.65:3.2	This consciousness turns back from name and form, and doesn’t go beyond that. 
sn12.65:3.3	This is the extent to which one may be reborn, grow old, die, pass away, or reappear. That is: name and form are conditions for consciousness. 
sn12.65:3.4	Consciousness is a condition for name and form. 
sn12.65:3.5	Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. 
sn12.65:3.6	The six sense fields are conditions for contact. … 
sn12.65:3.7	That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. 
sn12.65:3.8	‘Origination, origination.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another. 
sn12.65:4.1	Then it occurred to me: 
sn12.65:4.2	‘When what doesn’t exist is there no old age and death? 
sn12.65:4.3	When what ceases do old age and death cease?’ 
sn12.65:4.4	Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: 
sn12.65:4.5	‘When rebirth doesn’t exist there is no old age and death. 
sn12.65:4.6	When rebirth ceases old age and death cease.’ 
sn12.65:4.7	Then it occurred to me:

sn12.65:6.1	Then it occurred to me: 
sn12.65:6.2	I have discovered the path to awakening. That is: 
sn12.65:6.3	When name and form cease, consciousness ceases. 
sn12.65:6.4	When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. 
sn12.65:6.5	When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. 
sn12.65:6.6	When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. … 
sn12.65:6.7	That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases. 
sn12.65:6.8	‘Cessation, cessation.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another. 
sn12.65:7.1	Suppose a person was walking through a forest. They’d see an ancient path, an ancient route traveled by humans in the past. 
sn12.65:7.2	Following it along, 
sn12.65:7.3	they’d see an ancient city, an ancient capital, inhabited by humans in the past. It was lovely, complete with parks, groves, lotus ponds, and embankments. 
sn12.65:7.4	Then that person would inform a king or their minister:

sn12.65:7.6	Following it along I saw an ancient city, an ancient capital, inhabited by humans in the past. It was lovely, complete with parks, groves, lotus ponds, and embankments. 
sn12.65:7.7	Sir, you should rebuild that city!’ 
sn12.65:7.8	Then that king or their minister would have that city rebuilt. 
sn12.65:7.9	And after some time that city was successful and prosperous and full of people, attained to growth and expansion. 
sn12.65:7.10	In the same way, I saw an ancient path, an ancient route traveled by fully awakened Buddhas in the past. 
sn12.65:8.1	And what is that ancient path, the ancient road traveled by fully awakened Buddhas in the past? 
sn12.65:8.2	It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: 
sn12.65:8.3	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 
sn12.65:8.4	This is that ancient path, the ancient road traveled by fully awakened Buddhas in the past. 
sn12.65:8.5	Following it along, I directly knew old age and death, 
sn12.65:8.6	their origin, 
sn12.65:8.7	their cessation, 
sn12.65:8.8	and the practice that leads to their cessation.

sn12.65:8.23	and the practice that leads to their cessation. 
sn12.65:8.24	Having directly known this, I told the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. 
sn12.65:8.25	And that’s how this spiritual life has become successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.”

sn12.66:0.3	66. Self-examination 
sn12.66:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn12.66:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma. 
sn12.66:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
sn12.66:1.4	“Mendicants!” 
sn12.66:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
sn12.66:1.6	The Buddha said this: 
sn12.66:1.7	“Mendicants, do you perform inner self-examination?” 
sn12.66:1.8	When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha, 
sn12.66:1.9	“Sir, I perform inner self-examination.” 
sn12.66:1.10	“But mendicant, how do you perform inner self-examination?” 
sn12.66:1.11	Then that mendicant answered, 
sn12.66:1.12	but the Buddha was not happy with the answer. 
sn12.66:2.1	When he had spoken, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, 
sn12.66:2.2	“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! 
sn12.66:2.3	Let the Buddha speak of the inner self-examination. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” 
sn12.66:2.4	“Well then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
sn12.66:2.5	“Yes, sir,” they replied. 
sn12.66:2.6	The Buddha said this: 
sn12.66:3.1	“Take a mendicant who performs inner self-examination: 
sn12.66:3.2	‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms. 
sn12.66:3.3	But what is the source of this suffering? When what exists do old age and death come to be? And when what does not exist do old age and death not come to be?’ 
sn12.66:3.4	While examining they know: 
sn12.66:3.5	‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms. 
sn12.66:3.6	The source of this suffering is attachment. When attachments exist old age and death come to be. And when attachments do not exist old age and death don’t come to be.’ 
sn12.66:3.7	They understand old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation. 
sn12.66:3.8	And they practice in line with that path. 
sn12.66:3.9	This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of old age and death. 
sn12.66:4.1	They perform further inner self-examination: 
sn12.66:4.2	‘But what is the source of this attachment? When what exists does attachment come to be? And when what does not exist does attachment not come to be?’ 
sn12.66:4.3	While examining they know: 
sn12.66:4.4	‘The source of this attachment is craving. When craving exists attachments come to be. And when craving doesn’t exist attachments don’t come to be.’ 
sn12.66:4.5	They understand attachments, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation. 
sn12.66:4.6	And they practice in line with that path. 
sn12.66:4.7	This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of attachments. 
sn12.66:5.1	They perform further inner self-examination: 
sn12.66:5.2	‘But where does that craving arise and where does it settle?’ 
sn12.66:5.3	While examining they know: 
sn12.66:5.4	‘That craving arises and settles on whatever in the world seems nice and pleasant. 
sn12.66:5.5	And what in the world seems nice and pleasant? 
sn12.66:5.6	The eye in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles.

sn12.66:5.9	tongue …

sn12.66:6.1	There were ascetics and brahmins of the past who saw the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as permanent, as pleasurable, as self, as healthy, and as safe. 
sn12.66:6.2	Their craving grew. 
sn12.66:6.3	As their craving grew, their attachments grew. 
sn12.66:6.4	As their attachments grew, their suffering grew. 
sn12.66:6.5	And as their suffering grew, they were not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They were not freed from suffering, I say. 
sn12.66:7.1	There will be ascetics and brahmins in the future who will see the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as permanent, as pleasurable, as self, as healthy, and as safe. 
sn12.66:7.2	Their craving will grow. 
sn12.66:7.3	As their craving grows, their attachments will grow. 
sn12.66:7.4	As their attachments grow, their suffering will grow. 
sn12.66:7.5	And as their suffering grows, they will not be freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They will not be freed from suffering, I say.

sn12.66:9.1	Suppose there was a bronze cup of beverage that had a nice color, aroma, and flavor. 
sn12.66:9.2	But it was mixed with poison. 
sn12.66:9.3	Then along comes a man struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. 
sn12.66:9.4	They’d say to him: 
sn12.66:9.5	‘Here, mister, this bronze cup of beverage has a nice color, aroma, and flavor. 
sn12.66:9.6	But it’s mixed with poison. 
sn12.66:9.7	Drink it if you like. 
sn12.66:9.8	If you drink it, the color, aroma, and flavor will be appetizing, but it will result in death or deadly pain.’ 
sn12.66:9.9	He wouldn’t reject that beverage. Hastily, without reflection, he’d drink it, 
sn12.66:9.10	resulting in death or deadly pain.

sn12.66:10.1	There were ascetics and brahmins of the past who saw the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as impermanent, as suffering, as not-self, as diseased, and as dangerous. 
sn12.66:10.2	They gave up craving. 
sn12.66:10.3	Giving up craving, they gave up attachments.

sn12.66:11.1	There will be ascetics and brahmins in the future who will see the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as impermanent, as suffering, as not-self, as diseased, and as dangerous.

sn12.66:13.4	They’d say to him: 
sn12.66:13.5	‘Here, mister, this bronze cup of beverage has a nice color, aroma, and flavor. 
sn12.66:13.6	Drink it if you like. 
sn12.66:13.7	If you drink it, its nice color, aroma, and flavor will refresh you. But drinking it will result in death or deadly pain.’ 
sn12.66:13.8	Then that man might think:

sn12.67:0.3	67. Bundles of Reeds 
sn12.67:1.1	At one time Venerable Sāriputta and Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita were staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana. 
sn12.67:1.2	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita came out of retreat, went to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him. 
sn12.67:1.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Sāriputta: 
sn12.67:1.4	“Well, Reverend Sāriputta, are old age and death made by oneself? Or by another? Or by both oneself and another? Or do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?” 
sn12.67:1.5	“No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, old age and death are not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. 
sn12.67:1.6	Rather, rebirth is a condition for old age and death.” 
sn12.67:2.1	“Well, Reverend Sāriputta, is rebirth made by oneself? Or by another? Or by both oneself and another? Or does it arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?” 
sn12.67:2.2	“No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, rebirth is not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor does it arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. 
sn12.67:2.3	Rather, continued existence is a condition for rebirth.” 
sn12.67:3.1	“Well, Reverend Sāriputta, is continued existence made by oneself? …” … 
sn12.67:3.2	“Is grasping made by oneself? …” … 
sn12.67:3.3	“Is craving made by oneself? …” … 
sn12.67:3.4	“Is feeling made by oneself? …” … 
sn12.67:3.5	“Is contact made by oneself? …” … 
sn12.67:3.6	“Are the six sense fields made by oneself? …” … 
sn12.67:3.7	“Well, Reverend Sāriputta, are name and form made by oneself? Or by another? Or by both oneself and another? Or do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?” 
sn12.67:3.8	“No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, name and form are not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. 
sn12.67:3.9	Rather, consciousness is a condition for name and form.” 
sn12.67:4.1	“Well, Reverend Sāriputta, is consciousness made by oneself? Or by another? Or by both oneself and another? Or does it arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?” 
sn12.67:4.2	“No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, consciousness is not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor does it arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. 
sn12.67:4.3	Rather, name and form are conditions for consciousness.” 
sn12.67:5.1	“Just now I understood you to say: 
sn12.67:5.2	‘No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, name and form are not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. 
sn12.67:5.3	Rather, consciousness is a condition for name and form.’ 
sn12.67:6.1	But I also understood you to say: 
sn12.67:6.2	‘No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, consciousness is not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor does it arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. 
sn12.67:6.3	Rather, name and form are conditions for consciousness.’ 
sn12.67:7.1	How then should we see the meaning of this statement?” 
sn12.67:7.2	“Well then, reverend, I shall give you a simile. 
sn12.67:7.3	For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said. 
sn12.67:7.4	Suppose there were two bundles of reeds leaning up against each other. 
sn12.67:7.5	In the same way, name and form are conditions for consciousness. 
sn12.67:7.6	Consciousness is a condition for name and form. 
sn12.67:7.7	Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. 
sn12.67:7.8	The six sense fields are conditions for contact. … 
sn12.67:7.9	That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. 
sn12.67:7.10	If the first of those bundles of reeds were to be pulled away, the other would collapse. 
sn12.67:7.11	And if the other were to be pulled away, the first would collapse. 
sn12.67:7.12	In the same way, when name and form cease, consciousness ceases. 
sn12.67:7.13	When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. 
sn12.67:7.14	When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. 
sn12.67:7.15	When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. … 
sn12.67:7.16	That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.” 
sn12.67:8.1	“It’s incredible, Reverend Sāriputta, it’s amazing! 
sn12.67:8.2	 
sn12.67:8.3	How well spoken this was by Venerable Sāriputta! 
sn12.67:8.4	And we can express our agreement with Venerable Sāriputta’s statement on these thirty-six grounds.

sn12.70:2.1	Now at that time the wanderer Susīma was residing at Rājagaha together with a large community of wanderers. 
sn12.70:2.2	Then his community said to Susīma, 
sn12.70:2.3	“Reverend Susīma, please lead the spiritual life with the ascetic Gotama. 
sn12.70:2.4	Memorize that teaching and have us recite it with you. 
sn12.70:2.5	When we’ve memorized it we’ll recite it to the laity.

sn12.70:2.7	“Yes, reverends,” replied Susīma. Then he went to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him. 
sn12.70:2.8	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda, 
sn12.70:2.9	“Reverend Ānanda, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.”

sn12.70:3.3	he wishes to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.” 
sn12.70:3.4	“Well then, Ānanda, give Susīma the going forth.” 
sn12.70:3.5	And the wanderer Susīma received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. 
sn12.70:4.1	Now at that time several mendicants had declared their enlightenment in the Buddha’s presence:

They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, do you see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. And do you understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds?” 
sn12.70:9.2	“No, reverend.” 
sn12.70:10.1	“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you have direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless, transcending form?” 
sn12.70:10.2	“No, reverend.” 
sn12.70:11.1	“Well now, venerables, how could there be such a declaration when these things are not attained?” 
sn12.70:11.2	“Reverend Susīma, we are freed by wisdom.” 
sn12.70:12.1	“I don’t understand the detailed meaning of what you have said in brief. 
sn12.70:12.2	Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.” 
sn12.70:12.3	“Reverend Susīma, whether you understand or not, we are freed by wisdom.” 
sn12.70:13.1	Then Susīma went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, 
sn12.70:13.2	and informed the Buddha of all he had discussed with those mendicants. 
sn12.70:13.3	“Susīma, first comes knowledge of the stability of natural principles. Afterwards there is knowledge of extinguishment.” 
sn12.70:14.1	“Sir, I don’t understand the detailed meaning of what you have said in brief. 
sn12.70:14.2	Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.” 
sn12.70:14.3	“Reverend Susīma, whether you understand or not, first comes knowledge of the stability of natural principles. Afterwards there is knowledge of extinguishment. 
sn12.70:15.1	What do you think, Susīma? 
sn12.70:15.2	Is form permanent or impermanent?” 
sn12.70:15.3	“Impermanent, sir.” 
sn12.70:15.4	“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” 
sn12.70:15.5	“Suffering, sir.” 
sn12.70:15.6	“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: 
sn12.70:15.7	‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 
sn12.70:15.8	“No, sir.” 
sn12.70:15.9	“Is feeling permanent or impermanent?” 
sn12.70:15.10	“Impermanent, sir.” 
sn12.70:15.11	“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” 
sn12.70:15.12	“Suffering, sir.” 
sn12.70:15.13	“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: 
sn12.70:15.14	‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 
sn12.70:15.15	“No, sir.” 
sn12.70:15.16	“Is perception permanent or impermanent?” 
sn12.70:15.17	“Impermanent, sir.” … 
sn12.70:15.18	“Are choices permanent or impermanent?” 
sn12.70:15.19	“Impermanent, sir.” 
sn12.70:15.20	“But if they’re impermanent, are they suffering or happiness?” 
sn12.70:15.21	“Suffering, sir.” 
sn12.70:15.22	“But if they’re impermanent, suffering, and perishable, are they fit to be regarded thus: 
sn12.70:15.23	‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 
sn12.70:15.24	“No, sir.” 
sn12.70:15.25	“Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?” 
sn12.70:15.26	“Impermanent, sir.” 
sn12.70:15.27	“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” 
sn12.70:15.28	“Suffering, sir.” 
sn12.70:15.29	“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: 
sn12.70:15.30	‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 
sn12.70:15.31	“No, sir.” 
sn12.70:16.1	“So, Susīma, you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ 
sn12.70:16.2	You should truly see any kind of feeling at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* feeling—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ 
sn12.70:16.3	You should truly see any kind of perception at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* perception—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ 
sn12.70:16.4	You should truly see any kind of choices at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all choices*—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ 
sn12.70:16.5	You should truly see any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ 
sn12.70:17.1	Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. 
sn12.70:17.2	Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. 
sn12.70:17.3	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
sn12.70:18.1	Susīma, do you see that rebirth is a condition for old age and death?” 
sn12.70:18.2	“Yes, sir.” 
sn12.70:18.3	“Do you see that continued existence is a condition for rebirth?” 
sn12.70:18.4	“Yes, sir.” 
sn12.70:18.5	“Do you see that grasping is a condition for continued existence?” 
sn12.70:18.6	“Yes, sir.” 
sn12.70:18.7	“Do you see that craving is a condition for grasping?” 
sn12.70:18.8	“Yes, sir.” 
sn12.70:18.9	“Do you see that feeling is a condition for craving … 
sn12.70:18.10	contact is a condition for feeling … 
sn12.70:18.11	the six sense fields are conditions for contact … 
sn12.70:18.12	name and form are conditions for the six sense fields …

sn12.70:18.16	“Yes, sir.” 
sn12.70:19.1	“Do you see that when rebirth ceases old age and death cease?” 
sn12.70:19.2	“Yes, sir.” 
sn12.70:19.3	“Do you see that when continued existence ceases rebirth ceases?” 
sn12.70:19.4	“Yes, sir.” 
sn12.70:19.5	“Do you see that when grasping ceases continued existence ceases …

sn12.70:19.14	“Yes, sir.” 
sn12.70:20.1	“But knowing and seeing thus, do you wield the many kinds of psychic power? …” 
sn12.70:20.2	“No, sir.” 
sn12.70:21.1	“Well, knowing and seeing thus do you, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far?” 
sn12.70:21.2	“No, sir.” 
sn12.70:22.1	“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with your mind? …” 
sn12.70:22.4	“No, sir.” 
sn12.70:23.1	“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you recollect many kinds of past lives, with features and details?” 
sn12.70:23.2	“No, sir.” 
sn12.70:24.1	“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, see sentient beings passing away and being reborn … according to their deeds?” 
sn12.70:24.2	“No, sir.” 
sn12.70:25.1	“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you have direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless, transcending form?” 
sn12.70:25.2	“No, sir.” 
sn12.70:26.1	“Well now, Susīma, how could there be such a declaration when these things are not attained?” 
sn12.70:27.1	Then Venerable Susīma bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet and said, 
sn12.70:27.2	“I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to go forth as a thief in such a well-explained teaching and training. 
sn12.70:27.3	Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.” 
sn12.70:28.1	“Indeed, Susīma, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to go forth as a thief in such a well-explained teaching and training. 
sn12.70:28.2	Suppose they were to arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to the king, saying: 
sn12.70:28.3	‘Your Majesty, this is a bandit, a criminal. Punish him as you will.’ 
sn12.70:28.4	The king would say: 
sn12.70:28.5	‘Go, my men, and tie this man’s arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope. Shave his head and march him from street to street and from square to square to the beating of a harsh drum. Then take him out the south gate and there, to the south of the city, chop off his head.’ 
sn12.70:28.6	The king’s men would do as they were told. 
sn12.70:28.7	What do you think, Susīma? 
sn12.70:28.8	Wouldn’t that man experience pain and distress because of that?” 
sn12.70:28.9	“Yes, sir.” 
sn12.70:29.1	“Although that man would experience pain and distress because of that, 
sn12.70:29.2	going forth as a thief in such a well-explained teaching and training has a more painful and bitter result. And it even leads to the underworld. 
sn12.70:29.3	But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it. 
sn12.70:29.4	For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.”

sn14.16:10.1	So too, a person who lives well 
sn14.16:10.2	sinks by relying on a lazy person.

sn14.31:1.3	‘What’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to the earth element … 
sn14.31:1.4	the water element … 
sn14.31:1.5	the fire element … 
sn14.31:1.6	and the air element?’

sn14.31:2.2	‘The pleasure and happiness that arise from the earth element: this is its gratification. 
sn14.31:2.3	That the earth element is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback.

sn14.31:3.1	As long as I didn’t truly understand these four elements’ gratification, drawback, and escape in this way for what they are, I didn’t announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.

sn15.13:1.9	The Buddha said this: 
sn15.13:2.1	“Mendicants, transmigration has no known beginning. 
sn15.13:2.2	No first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving. 
sn15.13:2.3	What do you think? Which is more: the flow of blood you’ve shed when your head was chopped off while roaming and transmigrating for such a very long time, or the water in the four oceans?” 
sn15.13:2.4	“As we understand the Buddha’s teaching, the flow of blood we’ve shed when our head was chopped off while roaming and transmigrating is more than the water in the four oceans.” 
sn15.13:3.1	“Good, good, mendicants! It’s good that you understand my teaching like this. 
sn15.13:3.2	The flow of blood you’ve shed when your head was chopped off while roaming and transmigrating is indeed more than the water in the four oceans. 
sn15.13:3.3	For a long time you’ve been cows, and the flow of blood you’ve shed when your head was chopped off as a cow is more than the water in the four oceans. 
sn15.13:3.4	For a long time you’ve been buffalo …

sn15.13:3.10	For a long time you’ve been bandits, arrested for raiding villages, 
sn15.13:3.11	highway robbery, 
sn15.13:3.12	or adultery. And the flow of blood you’ve shed when your head was chopped off as a bandit is more than the water in the four oceans. 
sn15.13:3.13	Why is that? 
sn15.13:3.14	Transmigration has no known beginning. … 
sn15.13:3.15	This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions.” 
sn15.13:4.1	That is what the Buddha said. 
sn15.13:4.2	Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. 
sn15.13:4.3	And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of the thirty mendicants from Pāvā were freed from defilements by not grasping.

sn15.20:2.2	No first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving. 
sn15.20:2.3	Once upon a time, mendicants, this Mount Vepulla was known as Pācīnavaṁsa. 
sn15.20:2.4	And at that time people were known as Tivaras. 
sn15.20:2.5	The lifespan of the Tivaras was 40,000 years. 
sn15.20:2.6	It took them four days to climb Mount Vepulla, and four days to descend. 
sn15.20:2.7	At that time Kakusandha, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world.

sn15.20:2.10	So impermanent are conditions,

sn15.20:2.12	so unreliable are conditions. 
sn15.20:2.13	This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions. 
sn15.20:3.1	Once upon a time this Mount Vepulla was known as Vaṅkaka.

sn15.20:3.3	The lifespan of the Rohitassas was 30,000 years. 
sn15.20:3.4	It took them three days to climb Mount Vepulla, and three days to descend. 
sn15.20:3.5	At that time Koṇāgamana, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world. 
sn15.20:3.6	Koṇāgamana had a fine pair of chief disciples named Bhiyyosa and Uttara.

sn15.20:4.1	Once upon a time this Mount Vepulla was known as Supassa.

sn15.20:4.3	The lifespan of the Suppiyas was 20,000 years. 
sn15.20:4.4	It took them two days to climb Mount Vepulla, and two days to descend. 
sn15.20:4.5	At that time Kassapa, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world. 
sn15.20:4.6	Kassapa had a fine pair of chief disciples named Tissa and Bhāradvāja.

sn15.20:5.1	These days this Mount Vepulla is known as Vepulla. 
sn15.20:5.2	And these people are known as Magadhans. 
sn15.20:5.3	The lifespan of the Magadhans is short, brief, and fleeting. 
sn15.20:5.4	A long life is a hundred years or a little more. 
sn15.20:5.5	It takes the Magadhans an hour to climb Mount Vepulla, and an hour to descend. 
sn15.20:5.6	And now I am the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha who has arisen in the world. 
sn15.20:5.7	I have a fine pair of chief disciples named Sāriputta and Moggallāna.

sn16.10:1.5	“You go, Reverend Ānanda. You have many duties and responsibilities.” 
sn16.10:1.6	And a second time … 
sn16.10:1.7	 
sn16.10:1.8	 
sn16.10:1.9	And a third time, Ānanda said, 
sn16.10:1.10	“Kassapa, come, sir. Let’s go to one of the nuns’ quarters.” 
sn16.10:2.1	Then Venerable Mahākassapa robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went with Venerable Ānanda as his second monk to one of the nuns’ quarters, where he sat on the seat spread out. 
sn16.10:2.2	And then several nuns went up to Mahākassapa, bowed, and sat down to one side. 
sn16.10:2.3	Mahākassapa educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired those nuns with a Dhamma talk, 
sn16.10:2.4	after which he got up from his seat and left. 
sn16.10:3.1	But the nun Thullatissā was upset and blurted out, 
sn16.10:3.2	“What is Master Mahākassapa thinking, that he’d teach Dhamma in front of Master Ānanda, the Videhan sage? 
sn16.10:3.3	He’s like a needle seller who thinks they can sell a needle to a needle maker!” 
sn16.10:3.4	 
sn16.10:4.1	Mahākassapa heard Thullatissā say these words, 
sn16.10:4.2	and he said to Ānanda, 
sn16.10:4.3	“Is that right, Reverend Ānanda? Am I the needle seller and you the needle maker? 
sn16.10:4.4	Or am I the needle maker and you the needle seller?” 
sn16.10:4.5	“Forgive her, sir. The woman’s a fool.” 
sn16.10:4.6	“Hold on, Reverend Ānanda! Don’t make the Saṅgha investigate you further! 
sn16.10:5.1	What do you think, Reverend Ānanda? 
sn16.10:5.2	Was it you who the Buddha brought up before the Saṅgha of mendicants, saying: 
sn16.10:5.3	‘Mendicants, whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
sn16.10:5.4	And so does Ānanda’?” 
sn16.10:5.5	“No, sir.” 
sn16.10:6.1	“I was the one the Buddha brought up before the Saṅgha of mendicants, saying: 
sn16.10:6.2	‘Mendicants, whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
sn16.10:6.3	And so does Kassapa. …’ 
sn16.10:6.4	(The nine progressive meditations and the five insights should be treated in full.) 
sn16.10:7.1	What do you think, Reverend Ānanda? 
sn16.10:7.2	Was it you who the Buddha brought up before the Saṅgha of mendicants, saying: 
sn16.10:7.3	‘I have realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And I live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements. 
sn16.10:7.4	And so does Ānanda’?” 
sn16.10:7.5	“No, sir.”

sn16.10:8.3	And so does Kassapa.’ 
sn16.10:9.1	Reverend, you might as well think to hide a bull elephant that’s three or three and a half meters tall behind a palm leaf as to hide my six insights.” 
sn16.10:10.1	But the nun Thullatissā fell from the spiritual life. 
sn16.11:0.1	Linked Discourses 16 
sn16.11:0.2	1. Kassapa 
sn16.11:0.3	11. Robes 
sn16.11:1.1	At one time Venerable Mahākassapa was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
sn16.11:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Ānanda was wandering in the Southern Hills together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. 
sn16.11:2.1	And at that time thirty of Ānanda’s mendicant pupils resigned the training and returned to a lesser life. Most of them were youths. 
sn16.11:2.2	When Venerable Ānanda had wandered in the Southern Hills as long as he wished, he set out for Rājagaha, to the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. He went up to Venerable Mahākassapa, bowed, and sat down to one side. Mahākassapa said to him: 
sn16.11:2.3	“Reverend Ānanda, for how many reasons did the Buddha lay down a rule against eating in groups of more than three among families?” 
sn16.11:3.1	“Sir, the Buddha laid down that rule for three reasons. 
sn16.11:3.2	For keeping difficult persons in check and for the comfort of good-hearted mendicants. To prevent those of wicked desires from taking sides and dividing the Saṅgha. And out of consideration for families. 
sn16.11:3.3	These are the three reasons why the Buddha laid down that rule.” 
sn16.11:4.1	“So what exactly are you doing, wandering together with these junior mendicants? They don’t guard their sense doors, they eat too much, and they’re not committed to wakefulness. 
sn16.11:4.2	It’s like you’re wandering about wrecking crops and ruining families! 
sn16.11:4.3	Your following is falling apart, Reverend Ānanda, 
sn16.11:4.4	and those just getting started are slipping away. 
sn16.11:4.5	Yet this boy knows no bounds!” 
sn16.11:5.1	“Though there are grey hairs on my head, 
sn16.11:5.2	I still can’t escape being called a boy by Venerable Mahākassapa.” 
sn16.11:5.3	“It’s because you wander with these junior mendicants. … 
sn16.11:5.4	Your following is falling apart, Reverend Ānanda, 
sn16.11:5.5	and those just getting started are slipping away. 
sn16.11:5.6	Yet this boy knows no bounds!” 
sn16.11:6.1	The nun Thullanandā heard a rumor that 
sn16.11:6.2	Master Mahākassapa had rebuked Master Ānanda the Videhan sage by calling him a boy. 
sn16.11:7.1	She was upset and blurted out, 
sn16.11:7.2	“How can Master Mahākassapa, who formerly followed another path, presume to rebuke Master Ānanda the Videhan sage by calling him a boy?” 
sn16.11:7.3	Mahākassapa heard Thullanandā say these words, 
sn16.11:8.1	and he said to Ānanda, 
sn16.11:8.2	“Indeed, Reverend Ānanda, the nun Thullanandā spoke rashly and without reflection. 
sn16.11:8.3	Since I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness, I don’t recall acknowledging any other teacher apart from the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. 
sn16.11:8.4	Formerly when I was still a layman, I thought: 
sn16.11:8.5	‘Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. 
sn16.11:8.6	It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. 
sn16.11:8.7	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ 
sn16.11:8.8	After some time I made an outer robe of patches and, in the name of the perfected ones in the world, I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
sn16.11:9.1	When I had gone forth, I traveled along the road between Rājagaha and Nālanda, where I saw the Buddha sitting at the Bahuputta Shrine. 
sn16.11:9.2	Seeing him, I thought: 
sn16.11:9.3	‘If I’m ever to see a Teacher, it would be this Blessed One! 
sn16.11:9.4	If I’m ever to see a Holy One, it would be this Blessed One! 
sn16.11:9.5	If I’m ever to see a fully awakened Buddha, it would be this Blessed One!’ 
sn16.11:9.6	 
sn16.11:9.7	Then I bowed with my head at the Buddha’s feet and said: 
sn16.11:9.8	‘Sir, the Buddha is my Teacher, I am his disciple! 
sn16.11:9.9	The Buddha is my Teacher, I am his disciple!’ 
sn16.11:9.10	The Buddha said to me, 
sn16.11:9.11	‘Kassapa, if anyone was to say to such a wholehearted disciple that they know when they don’t know, or that they see when they don’t see, their head would explode. 
sn16.11:9.12	But Kassapa, when I say that I know and see I really do know and see. 
sn16.11:10.1	So you should train like this: 
sn16.11:10.2	“I will set up a keen sense of conscience and prudence for seniors, juniors, and those in the middle.” 
sn16.11:10.3	That’s how you should train. 
sn16.11:11.1	And you should train like this: 
sn16.11:11.2	“Whenever I hear a teaching connected with what’s skillful, I will pay heed, pay attention, engage wholeheartedly, and lend an ear to that teaching.” 
sn16.11:11.3	That’s how you should train. 
sn16.11:12.1	And you should train like this: 
sn16.11:12.2	“I will never neglect mindfulness of the body that is full of pleasure.” 
sn16.11:12.3	That’s how you should train.’ 
sn16.11:13.1	And when the Buddha had given me this advice he got up from his seat and left. 
sn16.11:13.2	For seven days I ate the nation’s almsfood as a debtor. On the eighth day I was enlightened. 
sn16.11:14.1	And then the Buddha left the road and went to the root of a certain tree. 
sn16.11:14.2	So I spread out my outer robe of patches folded in four and said to him, 
sn16.11:14.3	‘Sir, sit here. That would be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’ 
sn16.11:14.4	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out 
sn16.11:14.5	and said to me, 
sn16.11:14.6	‘Kassapa, this outer robe of patches is soft.’ 
sn16.11:14.7	‘Sir, please accept my outer robe of patches out of compassion.’ 
sn16.11:14.8	‘In that case, Kassapa, will you wear my worn-out hempen rag robe?’ 
sn16.11:14.9	‘I will wear it, sir.’ 
sn16.11:14.10	And so I presented my outer robe of patches to the Buddha, 
sn16.11:14.11	and the Buddha presented me with his worn-out hempen rag robe. 
sn16.11:15.1	For if anyone should be rightly called 
sn16.11:15.2	the Buddha’s true-born child, born from his mouth, born of the teaching, created by the teaching, heir to the teaching, and receiver of his worn-out hempen rag robes, it’s me. 
sn16.11:15.3	 
sn16.11:16.1	Whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. … 
sn16.11:16.2	 
sn16.11:16.3	(The nine progressive meditations and the five insights should be treated in full.) 
sn16.11:17.1	I have realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And I live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements. 
sn16.11:17.2	Reverend, you might as well think to hide a bull elephant that’s three or three and a half meters tall behind a palm leaf as to hide my six insights.”

sn16.12:1.2	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Mahākassapa, and exchanged greetings with him. 
sn16.12:1.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Mahākassapa:

sn16.12:1.5	“Reverend, this has not been declared by the Buddha.” 
sn16.12:1.6

sn16.12:1.14	“This too has not been declared by the Buddha.” 
sn16.12:1.15	 
sn16.12:1.16	“And why has this not been declared by the Buddha?” 
sn16.12:1.17	“Because it’s not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. 
sn16.12:1.18	That’s why it has not been declared by the Buddha.” 
sn16.12:2.1	“So what now has been declared by the Buddha?” 
sn16.12:2.2	“‘This is suffering’ has been declared by the Buddha.

sn16.13:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
sn16.13:1.3	Then Venerable Mahākassapa went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
sn16.13:1.4	“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why there used to be fewer training rules but more enlightened mendicants? 
sn16.13:1.5	And what is the cause, what is the reason why these days there are more training rules and fewer enlightened mendicants?” 
sn16.13:1.6	“That’s how it is, Kassapa. When sentient beings are in decline and the true teaching is disappearing there are more training rules and fewer enlightened mendicants. 
sn16.13:1.7	The true teaching doesn’t disappear as long the counterfeit of the true teaching hasn’t appeared in the world. 
sn16.13:1.8	But when the counterfeit of the true teaching appears in the world then the true teaching disappears. 
sn16.13:2.1	It’s like true gold, which doesn’t disappear as long as counterfeit gold hasn’t appeared in the world. 
sn16.13:2.2	But when counterfeit gold appears in the world then real gold disappears. 
sn16.13:2.3	In the same way, the true teaching doesn’t disappear as long the counterfeit of the true teaching hasn’t appeared in the world. 
sn16.13:2.4	But when the counterfeit of the true teaching appears in the world then the true teaching disappears. 
sn16.13:3.1	It’s not the elements of earth, water, fire, or air that make the true teaching disappear. 
sn16.13:3.2	Rather, it’s the foolish people who appear right here that make the true teaching disappear. 
sn16.13:3.3	The true teaching doesn’t disappear like a ship that sinks all at once. 
sn16.13:3.4	 
sn16.13:4.1	There are five detrimental things that lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching. 
sn16.13:4.2	What five? 
sn16.13:4.3	It’s when the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen lack respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the training, and immersion. 
sn16.13:4.4	These five detrimental things lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching. 
sn16.13:5.1	There are five things that lead to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching. 
sn16.13:5.2	What five? 
sn16.13:5.3	It’s when the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen maintain respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the training, and immersion.

sn16.3:1.4	Suppose a person were to look down at an old well, a rugged cliff, or an inaccessible riverland.

sn19.1:0.3	1. A Skeleton 
sn19.1:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn19.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
sn19.1:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Lakkhaṇa and Venerable Mahāmoggallāna were staying on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. 
sn19.1:1.4	Then Mahāmoggallāna robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Lakkhaṇa and said to him, 
sn19.1:1.5	“Come, Reverend Lakkhaṇa, let’s enter Rājagaha for alms.” 
sn19.1:1.6	“Yes, reverend,” Lakkhaṇa replied. 
sn19.1:1.7	As Mahāmoggallāna was descending from Vulture’s Peak Mountain he smiled at a certain spot. 
sn19.1:1.8	So Lakkhaṇa said to Mahāmoggallāna, 
sn19.1:1.9	“What is the cause, Reverend Moggallāna, what is the reason you smiled?” 
sn19.1:1.10	“Reverend Lakkhaṇa, it’s the wrong time for this question. 
sn19.1:1.11	Ask me when we’re in the Buddha’s presence.” 
sn19.1:2.1	Then Lakkhaṇa and Mahāmoggallāna wandered for alms in Rājagaha. After the meal, on their return from almsround, they went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Lakkhaṇa said to Mahāmoggallāna: 
sn19.1:2.2	“Just now, as Mahāmoggallāna was descending from Vulture’s Peak Mountain he smiled at a certain spot. 
sn19.1:2.3	What is the cause, Reverend Moggallāna, what is the reason you smiled?” 
sn19.1:3.1	“Just now, reverend, as I was descending from Vulture’s Peak Mountain I saw a skeleton flying through the air. 
sn19.1:3.2	Vultures, crows, and hawks kept chasing it, pecking and clawing 
sn19.1:3.3	as it screeched in pain. 
sn19.1:3.4	It occurred to me: 
sn19.1:3.5	‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! 
sn19.1:3.6	That there can be such a sentient being, 
sn19.1:3.7	such an entity, 
sn19.1:3.8	such an incarnation!’” 
sn19.1:4.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants: 
sn19.1:4.2	“Mendicants, there are disciples who live full of vision and knowledge, 
sn19.1:4.3	since a disciple knows, sees, and witnesses such a thing. 
sn19.1:4.4	Formerly, I too saw that being, but I did not speak of it. 
sn19.1:4.5	For if I had spoken of it others would not have believed me, 
sn19.1:4.6	which would be for their lasting harm and suffering. 
sn19.1:4.7	That being used to be a cattle butcher right here in Rājagaha. 
sn19.1:4.8	As a result of that deed he burned in hell for many years, many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of years. Now he experiences the residual result of that deed in such an incarnation.”

sn2.10:1.1	At Sāvatthī. 
sn2.10:1.2	Now at that time the Sun God had been seized by Rāhu, lord of demons. 
sn2.10:1.3	Then the Sun God, recollecting the Buddha, at that time recited this verse: 
sn2.10:2.1	“Homage to you, Buddha, hero! 
sn2.10:2.2	You’re everywhere free. 
sn2.10:2.3	I’ve wandered into confinement:

sn2.10:4.1	“The Sun God has gone for refuge 
sn2.10:4.2	to the Realized One, the perfected one. 
sn2.10:4.3	The Buddhas have compassion for the world—
sn2.10:4.4	so Rāhu, release the Sun!

sn2.10:5.3	Rāhu, do not swallow him as he traverses the sky.

sn2.10:6.1	Then Rāhu, having released the Sun, rushed to see Vepacitti, lord of demons and stood to one side, shocked and awestruck.

sn2.10:7.1	“Why the rush?

sn2.25:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn2.25:1.2	At one time several mendicants were staying in the Kosalan lands, in a wilderness hut on the slopes of the Himalayas. They were restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties. 
sn2.25:2.1	Then on the fifteenth day sabbath the god Jantu went up to those mendicants and addressed them in verse: 
sn2.25:3.1	“The mendicants used to live happily, 
sn2.25:3.2	as disciples of Gotama. 
sn2.25:3.3	Desireless they sought alms; 
sn2.25:3.4	desireless they used their lodgings. 
sn2.25:3.5	Knowing that the world was impermanent 
sn2.25:3.6	they made an end of suffering. 
sn2.25:4.1	But now they’ve made themselves hard to look after, 
sn2.25:4.2	like chiefs in a village. 
sn2.25:4.3	They eat and eat and then lie down, 
sn2.25:4.4	unconscious in the homes of others. 
sn2.25:5.1	Having raised my joined palms to the Saṅgha, 
sn2.25:5.2	I speak here only about certain people. 
sn2.25:5.3	They’re rejects, with no protector, 
sn2.25:5.4	just like those who have passed away. 
sn2.25:6.1	I’m speaking about 
sn2.25:6.2	those who live negligently. 
sn2.25:6.3	To those who live diligently 
sn2.25:6.4	I pay homage.”

sn2.26:1.1	At Sāvatthī. 
sn2.26:1.2	Standing to one side, the god Rohitassa said to the Buddha: 
sn2.26:1.3	“Sir, is it possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn?” 
sn2.26:1.4	“Reverend, I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.” 
sn2.26:2.1	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing, 
sn2.26:2.2	how well said this was by Master Gotama. 
sn2.26:2.3	 
sn2.26:3.1	Once upon a time, I was a hermit called Rohitassa, son of Bhoja. I was a sky-walker with psychic power. 
sn2.26:3.2	I was as fast as a light arrow easily shot across the shadow of a palm tree by a well-trained expert archer with a strong bow. 
sn2.26:3.3	My stride was such that it could span from the eastern ocean to the western ocean. 
sn2.26:3.4	This wish came to me: 
sn2.26:3.5	‘I will reach the end of the world by traveling.’ 
sn2.26:3.6	Having such speed and stride, I traveled for my whole lifespan of a hundred years—pausing only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness—and I passed away along the way, never reaching the end of the world. 
sn2.26:4.1	It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing, 
sn2.26:4.2	how well said this was by Master Gotama: 
sn2.26:4.3	‘Reverend, I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.’” 
sn2.26:5.1	“But Reverend, I also say there’s no making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world. 
sn2.26:5.2	For it is in this fathom-long carcass with its perception and mind that I describe the world, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation. 
sn2.26:6.1	The end of the world can never 
sn2.26:6.2	be reached by traveling. 
sn2.26:6.3	But without reaching the end of the world, 
sn2.26:6.4	there’s no release from suffering. 
sn2.26:7.1	So a clever person, understanding the world, 
sn2.26:7.2	has completed the spiritual journey, and gone to the end of the world. 
sn2.26:7.3	A peaceful one, knowing the end of the world, 
sn2.26:7.4	does not long for this world or the next.”

sn2.29:1.3	“Ānanda, do you like Sāriputta?” 
sn2.29:2.1	“Sir, who on earth would not like Venerable Sāriputta unless they’re a fool, a hater, delusional, or mentally deranged? 
sn2.29:2.2	Venerable Sāriputta is astute, 
sn2.29:2.3	he has great wisdom,

sn2.29:2.5	laughing wisdom, 
sn2.29:2.6	swift wisdom,

sn2.29:2.16	he accuses 
sn2.29:2.17	and criticizes wickedness. 
sn2.29:2.18	Who on earth would not like Venerable Sāriputta unless they’re a fool, a hater, delusional, or mentally deranged?” 
sn2.29:3.1	“That’s so true, Ānanda! That’s so true! 
sn2.29:3.2	Who on earth would not like Venerable Sāriputta unless they’re a fool, a hater, delusional, or mentally deranged?”

sn2.29:5.2	Who on earth would not like Venerable Sāriputta unless they’re a fool, a hater, delusional, or mentally deranged?”

sn2.29:8.2	In the same way, the gods of Susīma’s assembly generated a rainbow of bright colors.

sn2.29:9.2	In the same way, the gods of Susīma’s assembly generated a rainbow of bright colors. 
sn2.29:10.1	Suppose that after the rainy season the sky was clear and cloudless. At the crack of dawn, the Morning Star shines and glows and radiates. 
sn2.29:10.2	In the same way, the gods of Susīma’s assembly generated a rainbow of bright colors. 
sn2.29:11.1	Suppose that after the rainy season the sky was clear and cloudless. As the sun rises, it would dispel all the darkness from the sky as it shines and glows and radiates. 
sn2.29:11.2	In the same way, the gods of Susīma’s assembly generated a rainbow of bright colors.

sn2.30:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
sn2.30:1.3	Then, late at night, several glorious gods lit up the entire Bamboo Grove. They were Asama, Sahalī, Niṅka, Ākoṭaka, Vetambarī, and Māṇavagāmiya, and all of them were disciples of various sectarian teachers. They went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. 
sn2.30:1.4	Standing to one side, the god Asama recited this verse about Pūraṇa Kassapa in the Buddha’s presence: 
sn2.30:2.1	“In injuring and killing here, 
sn2.30:2.2	in beating and extortion, 
sn2.30:2.3	Kassapa saw no evil, 
sn2.30:2.4	nor any merit for oneself. 
sn2.30:2.5	What he taught should truly be trusted, 
sn2.30:2.6	he’s worthy of esteem as Teacher.” 
sn2.30:3.1	Then the god Sahalī recited this verse about Makkhali Gosala in the Buddha’s presence: 
sn2.30:4.1	“Through mortification in disgust of sin he became well restrained. 
sn2.30:4.2	He gave up arguing with people. 
sn2.30:4.3	Refraining from false speech, he spoke the truth. 
sn2.30:4.4	Surely such a man does no wrong!” 
sn2.30:5.1	Then the god Niṅka recited this verse about Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta in the Buddha’s presence: 
sn2.30:6.1	“Disgusted at sin, an alert mendicant, 
sn2.30:6.2	well restrained in the four controls; 
sn2.30:6.3	explaining what is seen and heard: 
sn2.30:6.4	surely he can be no sinner!”

sn2.30:8.1	“Pakudhaka, Kātiyāna, and Nigaṇṭha, 
sn2.30:8.2	as well as this Makkhali and Pūraṇa: 
sn2.30:8.3	Teachers of communities, attained ascetics, 
sn2.30:8.4	surely they weren’t far from truly good men!” 
sn2.30:9.1	Then the god Vetambarī replied to the god Ākoṭaka in verse: 
sn2.30:10.1	“Though the wretched jackal howls along, 
sn2.30:10.2	it never equals the lion. 
sn2.30:10.3	A naked liar with suspicious conduct, 
sn2.30:10.4	though they teach a community, is not like the good.” 
sn2.30:11.1	Then Māra the Wicked took possession of the god Vetambarī and recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
sn2.30:12.1	“Those dedicated to mortification in disgust of sin, 
sn2.30:12.2	safeguarding their seclusion, 
sn2.30:12.3	attached to form,

sn2.30:12.5	Indeed, those mortals give correct instructions 
sn2.30:12.6	regarding the next world.”

sn2.30:14.2	and those of shining beauty in the sky,

sn2.8:2.1	“Strive and cut the stream! 
sn2.8:2.2	Dispel sensual pleasures, brahmin. 
sn2.8:2.3	A sage who doesn’t give up sensual pleasures

sn2.8:3.1	If one is to do what should be done,

sn2.9:1.2	Now at that time the Moon God had been seized by Rāhu, lord of demons. 
sn2.9:1.3	Then the Moon God, recollecting the Buddha, at that time recited this verse: 
sn2.9:2.1	“Homage to you, Buddha, hero! 
sn2.9:2.2	You’re free in every way. 
sn2.9:2.3	I’ve wandered into confinement: 
sn2.9:2.4	be my refuge!”

sn2.9:4.2	to the Realized One, the perfected one. 
sn2.9:4.3	The Buddhas have compassion for the world—
sn2.9:4.4	so Rāhu, release the Moon!”
sn2.9:5.1	Then Rāhu, having released the Moon, rushed to see Vepacitti, lord of demons and stood to one side, shocked and awestruck. 
sn2.9:5.2	Vepacitti addressed him in verse: 
sn2.9:6.1	“Why the rush? 
sn2.9:6.2	Rāhu, you released the Moon

sn20.10:1.2	Now at that time a certain junior mendicant socialized with families too often. 
sn20.10:1.3	The mendicants said to him, 
sn20.10:1.4	“Venerable, don’t socialize with families too often.” 
sn20.10:1.5	But that mendicant, when spoken to by the mendicants, did not stop. 
sn20.10:1.6	And then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said:

sn20.10:2.3	And then that little mouse came out to feed. 
sn20.10:2.4	The cat caught it and hastily swallowed it without chewing. 
sn20.10:2.5	But that little mouse ate its intestines and mesentery, 
sn20.10:2.6	resulting in death and deadly pain. 
sn20.10:3.1	In the same way, take a certain monk who robes up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, enters the village or town for alms without guarding body, speech, and mind, without establishing mindfulness, and without restraining the sense faculties. 
sn20.10:3.2	There he sees a female scantily clad, with revealing clothes. 
sn20.10:3.3	Lust infects his mind,

sn20.10:3.5	For it is death in the training of the Noble One to resign the training and return to a lesser life. 
sn20.10:3.6	And it is deadly pain to commit one of the corrupt offenses 
sn20.10:3.7	for which rehabilitation is possible.

sn21.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
sn21.1:1.3	There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants: 
sn21.1:1.4	“Reverends, mendicants!” 
sn21.1:1.5	“Reverend,” they replied. 
sn21.1:2.1	Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this: 
sn21.1:2.2	“Just now, reverends, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: 
sn21.1:2.3	‘They speak of this thing called “noble silence”. 
sn21.1:2.4	What then is this noble silence?’ 
sn21.1:2.5	It occurred to me: 
sn21.1:2.6	‘As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
sn21.1:2.7	This is called noble silence.’ 
sn21.1:2.8	And so, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I was entering and remaining in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
sn21.1:2.9	While I was in that meditation, perceptions and attentions accompanied by placing the mind beset me. 
sn21.1:3.1	Then the Buddha came up to me with his psychic power and said, 
sn21.1:3.2	‘Moggallāna, Moggallāna! Don’t neglect noble silence, brahmin! Settle your mind in noble silence; unify your mind and bring it to immersion in noble silence.’ 
sn21.1:3.3	And so, after some time, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption … 
sn21.1:3.4	So if anyone should be rightly called 
sn21.1:3.5	a disciple who attained to great direct knowledge with help from the Teacher, it’s me.”

sn21.2:1.3	“Reverends, mendicants!” 
sn21.2:1.4	“Reverend,” they replied. 
sn21.2:1.5	Sāriputta said this: 
sn21.2:2.1	“Just now, reverends, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: 
sn21.2:2.2	‘Is there anything in the world whose changing and perishing would give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in me?’ 
sn21.2:2.3	It occurred to me: 
sn21.2:2.4	‘There is nothing in the world whose changing and perishing would give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in me.’” 
sn21.2:3.1	When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to him, 
sn21.2:3.2	“Even if the Teacher were to decay and perish? Wouldn’t that give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in you?” 
sn21.2:3.3	“Even if the Teacher were to decay and perish, that wouldn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in me. Still, I would think: 
sn21.2:3.4	‘Alas, the illustrious Teacher, so mighty and powerful, has vanished! 
sn21.2:3.5	If the Buddha was to remain for a long time, that would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.’” 
sn21.2:3.6	“That must be because Venerable Sāriputta has long ago totally eradicated ego, possessiveness, and the underlying tendency to conceit. 
sn21.2:3.7	So even if the Teacher were to decay and perish, it wouldn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in him.”

sn21.3:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn21.3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
sn21.3:1.3	At that time Venerables Sāriputta and Moggallāna were staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
sn21.3:1.4	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Moggallāna, and exchanged greetings with him. 
sn21.3:1.5	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, Sāriputta sat down to one side, and said to Mahāmoggallāna: 
sn21.3:2.1	“Reverend Moggallāna, your faculties are so very clear, and your complexion is pure and bright. 
sn21.3:2.2	Have you spent the day in a peaceful meditation?” 
sn21.3:2.3	“Reverend, I’ve spent the day in a coarse meditation. 
sn21.3:2.4	But I have had some Dhamma talk.” 
sn21.3:2.5	“Who did you have a Dhamma talk with?” 
sn21.3:2.6	“With the Buddha.” 
sn21.3:2.7	“But Reverend, the Buddha is far away. He’s staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
sn21.3:2.8	Did you go to him with your psychic power, 
sn21.3:2.9	or did he come to you?” 
sn21.3:2.10	“No reverend, I didn’t go to him with my psychic power, 
sn21.3:2.11	nor did he come to me. 
sn21.3:2.12	Rather, the Buddha cleared his clairvoyance and clairaudience towards me, 
sn21.3:2.13	and I cleared my clairvoyance and clairaudience towards him.” 
sn21.3:2.14	“But what manner of Dhamma talk did you have together?” 
sn21.3:3.1	“Well, reverend, I said to the Buddha, 
sn21.3:3.2	‘Sir, they speak of one who is energetic. 
sn21.3:3.3	How is an energetic person defined?’ 
sn21.3:3.4	When I said this, the Buddha said, 
sn21.3:3.5	‘Moggallāna, it’s when a mendicant lives with energy roused up: 
sn21.3:3.6	“Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.” 
sn21.3:3.7	That’s how a person is energetic.’ 
sn21.3:3.8	That’s the Dhamma talk I had together with the Buddha.” 
sn21.3:4.1	“Reverend, next to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna I’m like a few pieces of gravel next to the Himalayas, the king of mountains. 
sn21.3:4.2	 
sn21.3:4.3	Venerable Mahāmoggallāna is so mighty and powerful he could, if he wished, live on for the eon.” 
sn21.3:5.1	“Reverend, next to Venerable Sāriputta I’m like a few grains of salt next to a mound of salt. 
sn21.3:5.2	 
sn21.3:5.3	Venerable Sāriputta has been commended, complimented, and praised by the Buddha: 
sn21.3:6.1	‘In wisdom, 
sn21.3:6.2	ethics, and peace, 
sn21.3:6.3	any mendicant who has crossed over 
sn21.3:6.4	can at best equal Sāriputta.’”

sn21.4:1.1	At Sāvatthī. 
sn21.4:1.2	Now at that time a certain junior monk, after his meal, on his return from almsround, entered his dwelling, where he adhered to passivity and silence. And he didn’t help the mendicants out when it was time to sew robes. 
sn21.4:1.3	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 
sn21.4:1.4	 
sn21.4:2.1	So the Buddha addressed a certain monk, 
sn21.4:2.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell that monk that the Teacher summons him.” 
sn21.4:2.3	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to that monk and said to him, 
sn21.4:2.4	“Reverend, the teacher summons you.” 
sn21.4:2.5	“Yes, reverend,” that monk replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 
sn21.4:2.6	“Is it really true, monk, that after your meal, on your return from almsround, you entered your dwelling, where you adhered to passivity and silence, and you didn’t help the mendicants out when it was time to sew robes?” 
sn21.4:2.7	“Sir, I am doing my own work.” 
sn21.4:3.1	Then the Buddha, knowing what that monk was thinking, addressed the mendicants: 
sn21.4:3.2	“Mendicants, don’t complain about this monk. 
sn21.4:3.3	This monk gets the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when he wants, without trouble or difficulty.

sn21.7:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Visākha, Pañcāli’s son, was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk. His words were polished, clear, articulate, expressing the meaning, comprehensive, and independent.

sn22.1:0.3	1. Nakula’s Father 
sn22.1:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn22.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood. 
sn22.1:1.3	Then the householder Nakula’s father went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha: 
sn22.1:2.1	“Sir, I’m an old man, elderly and senior. I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life. My body is ailing and I’m constantly unwell. 
sn22.1:2.2	I hardly ever get to see the esteemed mendicants. 
sn22.1:2.3	May the Buddha please advise me
sn22.1:2.4	and instruct me. 
sn22.1:2.5	It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.” 
sn22.1:3.1	“That’s so true, householder! That’s so true, householder! 
sn22.1:3.2	For this body is ailing, trapped in its shell. 
sn22.1:3.3	If anyone dragging around this body claimed to be healthy even for a minute, what’s that but foolishness? 
sn22.1:3.4	So you should train like this: 
sn22.1:3.5	‘Though my body is ailing, my mind will be healthy.’ 
sn22.1:3.6	That’s how you should train.” 
sn22.1:4.1	And then the householder Nakula’s father approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went up to Venerable Sāriputta, bowed, and sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to him: 
sn22.1:4.2	“Householder, your faculties are so very clear, 
sn22.1:4.3	and your complexion is pure and bright. 
sn22.1:4.4	Did you get to hear a Dhamma talk in the Buddha’s presence today?” 
sn22.1:5.1	“What else, sir, could it possibly be? 
sn22.1:5.2	Just now the Buddha anointed me with the deathless ambrosia of a Dhamma talk.” 
sn22.1:5.3	“But what kind of ambrosial Dhamma talk has the Buddha anointed you with?” 
sn22.1:5.4	So Nakula’s father told Sāriputta all that had happened, and said,

sn22.1:7.1	“But didn’t you feel the need to ask the Buddha the further question: 
sn22.1:7.2	‘Sir, how do you define someone ailing in body and ailing in mind, and someone ailing in body and healthy in mind’?” 
sn22.1:7.3	“Sir, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta. 
sn22.1:7.4	May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this.” 
sn22.1:8.1	“Well then, householder, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
sn22.1:8.2	“Yes, sir,” replied Nakula’s father. 
sn22.1:8.3	Sāriputta said this: 
sn22.1:9.1	“And how is a person ailing in body and ailing in mind? 
sn22.1:9.2	It’s when an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the qualities of a noble one. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the qualities of a good person. 
sn22.1:9.3	They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. 
sn22.1:9.4	They’re obsessed with the thought: ‘I am form, form is mine!’ 
sn22.1:9.5	But that form of theirs decays and perishes, 
sn22.1:9.6	which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 
sn22.1:10.1	They regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in feeling. 
sn22.1:10.2	They’re obsessed with the thought: ‘I am feeling, feeling is mine!’ 
sn22.1:10.3	But that feeling of theirs decays and perishes, 
sn22.1:10.4	which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 
sn22.1:11.1	They regard perception as self, self as having perception, perception in self, or self in perception. 
sn22.1:11.2	They’re obsessed with the thought: ‘I am perception, perception is mine!’ 
sn22.1:11.3	But that perception of theirs decays and perishes, 
sn22.1:11.4	which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 
sn22.1:12.1	They regard choices as self, self as having choices, choices in self, or self in choices. 
sn22.1:12.2	They’re obsessed with the thought: ‘I am choices, choices are mine!’ 
sn22.1:12.3	But those choices of theirs decay and perish,

sn22.1:13.1	They regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. 
sn22.1:13.2	They’re obsessed with the thought: ‘I am consciousness, consciousness is mine!’ 
sn22.1:13.3	But that consciousness of theirs decays and perishes, 
sn22.1:13.4	which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 
sn22.1:13.5	That’s how a person is ailing in body and ailing in mind. 
sn22.1:14.1	And how is a person ailing in body and healthy in mind? 
sn22.1:14.2	It’s when an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons. 
sn22.1:14.3	They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. 
sn22.1:14.4	They’re not obsessed with the thought: ‘I am form, form is mine!’

sn22.1:17.4	it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 
sn22.1:18.1	They don’t regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. 
sn22.1:18.2	They’re not obsessed with the thought: ‘I am consciousness, consciousness is mine!’

sn22.2:0.2	1. Nakula’s Father 
sn22.2:0.3	2. At Devadaha 
sn22.2:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn22.2:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, where they have a town named Devadaha. 
sn22.2:1.3	Then several mendicants who were heading for the west went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
sn22.2:1.4	“Sir, we wish to go to a western land to take up residence there.” 
sn22.2:2.1	“But mendicants, have you consulted with Sāriputta?” 
sn22.2:2.2	“No, sir, we haven’t.” 
sn22.2:2.3	“You should consult with Sāriputta. 
sn22.2:2.4	He’s astute, and supports his spiritual companions, the mendicants.” 
sn22.2:2.5	“Yes, sir,” they replied. 
sn22.2:3.1	Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was meditating not far from the Buddha in a clump of golden shower trees. 
sn22.2:3.2	And then those mendicants approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him. 
sn22.2:3.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him, 
sn22.2:3.4	“Reverend Sāriputta, we wish to go to a western land to take up residence there. 
sn22.2:3.5	We have consulted with the Teacher.” 
sn22.2:4.1	“Reverends, there are those who question a mendicant who has gone abroad—
sn22.2:4.2	astute aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics—
sn22.2:4.3	for astute people are inquisitive: 
sn22.2:4.4	‘But what does the venerables’ Teacher teach? What does he explain?’ I trust the venerables have properly heard, learned, attended, and remembered the teachings, and penetrated them with wisdom. That way, when answering you will repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth. You will explain in line with the teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism. 
sn22.2:5.1	“Reverend, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta. 
sn22.2:5.2	May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this.” 
sn22.2:5.3	“Well then, reverends, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
sn22.2:5.4	“Yes, reverend,” they replied. 
sn22.2:5.5	Sāriputta said this:

sn22.2:10.1	If those who acquired and kept unskillful qualities were to live happily in the present life, free of anguish, distress, and fever; and if, when their body breaks up, after death, they could expect to go to a good place, the Buddha would not praise giving up unskillful qualities. 
sn22.2:10.2	But since those who acquire and keep unskillful qualities live unhappily in the present life, full of anguish, distress, and fever; and since, when their body breaks up, after death, they can expect to go to a bad place, the Buddha praises giving up unskillful qualities. 
sn22.2:11.1	If those who embraced and kept skillful qualities were to live unhappily in the present life, full of anguish, distress, and fever; and if, when their body breaks up, after death, they could expect to go to a bad place, the Buddha would not praise embracing skillful qualities.

sn22.59:6.6	“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:

sn22.59:11.1	Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.

sn22.60:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn22.60:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
sn22.60:1.3	Then Mahāli the Licchavi went up to the Buddha … and said to him: 
sn22.60:2.1	“Sir, Pūraṇa Kassapa says this: 
sn22.60:2.2	‘There is no cause or condition for the corruption of sentient beings. 
sn22.60:2.3	Sentient beings are corrupted without cause or reason. 
sn22.60:2.4	There’s no cause or condition for the purification of sentient beings. 
sn22.60:2.5	Sentient beings are purified without cause or reason.’ 
sn22.60:2.6	What does the Buddha say about this?” 
sn22.60:3.1	“Mahāli, there is a cause and condition for the corruption of sentient beings. 
sn22.60:3.2	Sentient beings are corrupted with cause and reason. 
sn22.60:3.3	There is a cause and condition for the purification of sentient beings. 
sn22.60:3.4	Sentient beings are purified with cause and reason.” 
sn22.60:4.1	“But sir, what is the cause and condition for the corruption of sentient beings? 
sn22.60:4.2	How are sentient beings corrupted with cause and reason?” 
sn22.60:5.1	“Mahāli, if form were exclusively painful—soaked and steeped in pain and not steeped in pleasure—sentient beings wouldn’t lust after it. 
sn22.60:5.2	But because form is pleasurable—soaked and steeped in pleasure and not steeped in pain—sentient beings do lust after it. 
sn22.60:5.3	Since they lust after it, they’re caught up in it, and so they become corrupted. 
sn22.60:5.4	This is a cause and condition for the corruption of sentient beings.

sn22.60:9.4	But because form is painful—soaked and steeped in pain and not steeped in pleasure—sentient beings do grow disillusioned with it. 
sn22.60:9.5	Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they are purified.

sn22.63:1.3	Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
sn22.63:1.4	“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.” 
sn22.63:1.5	“When you grasp, mendicant, you’re bound by Māra.

sn22.63:4.2	Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

sn22.78:1.2	“Mendicants, towards evening the lion, king of beasts, emerges from his den, yawns, looks all around the four directions, and roars his lion’s roar three times. Then he sets out on the hunt. 
sn22.78:1.3	And whatever animals hear the roar of the lion, king of beasts, are typically filled with fear, awe, and terror. They return to their lairs, be they in a hole, the water, or a wood; and the birds take to the air. 
sn22.78:1.4	Even the royal elephants, bound with strong harness in the villages, towns, and capital cities, break apart their bonds, and urinate and defecate in terror as they flee here and there. 
sn22.78:1.5	That’s how powerful is the lion, king of beasts, among animals, how illustrious and mighty. 
sn22.78:2.1	In the same way, when a Realized One arises in the world—perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed—he teaches the Dhamma: 
sn22.78:2.2	‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. 
sn22.78:2.3	Such is feeling … 
sn22.78:2.4	Such is perception … 
sn22.78:2.5	Such are choices … 
sn22.78:2.6	Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ 
sn22.78:2.7	Now, there are gods who are long-lived, beautiful, and very happy, living for ages in their divine palaces. When they hear this teaching by the Realized One, they’re typically filled with fear, awe, and terror. 
sn22.78:2.8	‘Oh no! It turns out we’re impermanent, though we thought we were permanent! 
sn22.78:2.9	It turns out we don’t last, though we thought we were everlasting! 
sn22.78:2.10	It turns out we’re short-lived, though we thought we were eternal! 
sn22.78:2.11	It turns out that we’re impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, and included within identity.’ 
sn22.78:2.12	That’s how powerful is the Realized One in the world with its gods, how illustrious and mighty.” 
sn22.78:2.13	That is what the Buddha said. 
sn22.78:2.14	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
sn22.78:3.1	“The Buddha, the teacher without a peer 
sn22.78:3.2	in all the world with its gods, 
sn22.78:3.3	rolls forth the Wheel of Dhamma

sn22.80:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. 
sn22.80:1.2	Then the Buddha, having dismissed the mendicant Saṅgha for some reason, robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kapilavatthu for alms. 
sn22.80:1.3	He wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Great Wood, 
sn22.80:1.4	plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a young wood apple tree for the day’s meditation. 
sn22.80:2.1	Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, 
sn22.80:2.2	“I’ve sent the mendicant Saṅgha away. 
sn22.80:2.3	But there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. 
sn22.80:2.4	Not seeing me they may change and fall apart.

sn22.80:2.8	In the same way, there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. 
sn22.80:2.9	Not seeing me they may change and fall apart. 
sn22.80:2.10	Why don’t I support the mendicant Saṅgha now as I did in the past?” 
sn22.80:3.1	Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. 
sn22.80:3.2	He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: 
sn22.80:3.3	“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! 
sn22.80:3.4	The Buddha has sent the mendicant Saṅgha away. 
sn22.80:3.5	But there are mendicants who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. …

sn22.80:3.12	May the Buddha welcome the mendicant Saṅgha! 
sn22.80:3.13	May the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past!” 
sn22.80:4.1	The Buddha consented in silence. 
sn22.80:4.2	Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing that the Buddha had consented, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there. 
sn22.80:5.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the Banyan Tree Monastery, where he sat on the seat spread out. 
sn22.80:5.2	Then he used his psychic power to will that the mendicants would come to him timidly, alone or in pairs. 
sn22.80:5.3	Those mendicants approached the Buddha timidly, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them: 
sn22.80:6.1	“Mendicants, this relying on alms is an extreme lifestyle. 
sn22.80:6.2	The world curses you: ‘You beggar, walking bowl in hand!’ 
sn22.80:6.3	Yet earnest gentlemen take it up for a good reason. 
sn22.80:6.4	Not because they’ve been forced to by kings or bandits, or because they’re in debt or threatened, or to earn a living. 
sn22.80:6.5	But because they’re swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They’re swamped by suffering, mired in suffering. 
sn22.80:6.6	And they think, ‘Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’ 
sn22.80:7.1	That’s how this gentleman has gone forth. 
sn22.80:7.2	Yet they covet sensual pleasures; they’re infatuated, full of ill will and malicious intent. They are unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying mind and undisciplined faculties. 
sn22.80:7.3	Suppose there was a firebrand for lighting a funeral pyre, burning at both ends, and smeared with dung in the middle. It couldn’t be used as timber either in the village or the wilderness. 
sn22.80:7.4	I say that person is just like this. They’ve missed out on the pleasures of the lay life, and haven’t fulfilled the goal of the ascetic life. 
sn22.80:8.1	There are these three unskillful thoughts. 
sn22.80:8.2	Sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts. 
sn22.80:8.3	And where do these three unskillful thoughts cease without anything left over? 
sn22.80:8.4	In those who meditate with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation; or who develop signless immersion. 
sn22.80:8.5	Just this much is quite enough motivation to develop signless immersion. 
sn22.80:8.6	When signless immersion is developed and cultivated it is very fruitful and beneficial. 
sn22.80:9.1	There are these two views. 
sn22.80:9.2	Views favoring continued existence and views favoring ending existence. 
sn22.80:9.3	A noble disciple reflects on this: 
sn22.80:9.4	‘Is there anything in the world that I could grasp without fault?’ 
sn22.80:9.5	They understand: 
sn22.80:9.6	‘There’s nothing in the world that I could grasp without fault. 
sn22.80:9.7	For in grasping I would grasp only at form, feeling, 
sn22.80:9.8	perception, 
sn22.80:9.9	choices, or consciousness. 
sn22.80:9.10	That grasping of mine would be a condition for continued existence. 
sn22.80:9.11	Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. 
sn22.80:9.12	Rebirth is a condition that gives rise to old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 
sn22.80:9.13	That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. 
sn22.80:10.1	What do you think, mendicants? 
sn22.80:10.2	Is form permanent or impermanent?” 
sn22.80:10.3	“Impermanent, sir.” 
sn22.80:10.4	“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” 
sn22.80:10.5	“Suffering, sir.” 
sn22.80:10.6	“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: 
sn22.80:10.7	‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 
sn22.80:10.8	“No, sir.” 
sn22.80:10.9	“Is feeling …

sn22.81:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. 
sn22.81:1.2	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kosambi for alms. 
sn22.81:1.3	After the meal, on his return from almsround, he set his lodgings in order himself. Taking his bowl and robe, without informing his attendants or taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha, he set out to go wandering alone, with no companion. 
sn22.81:2.1	Then, not long after the Buddha had left, one of the mendicants went to Venerable Ānanda and told him what had happened. 
sn22.81:2.2	 
sn22.81:2.3	Ānanda said, “Reverend, when the Buddha leaves like this it means he wants to stay alone. 
sn22.81:2.4	At this time no-one should follow him.” 
sn22.81:3.1	Then the Buddha, traveling stage by stage, arrived at Pārileyya, 
sn22.81:3.2	where he stayed at the root of a sacred sal tree. 
sn22.81:3.3	Then several mendicants went up to Venerable Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him. 
sn22.81:3.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him, 
sn22.81:3.5	“Reverend, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard a Dhamma talk from the Buddha. 
sn22.81:3.6	We wish to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.” 
sn22.81:4.1	Then Venerable Ānanda together with those mendicants went to Pārileyya to see the Buddha. They bowed and sat down to one side, 
sn22.81:4.2	and the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk. 
sn22.81:4.3	Now at that time one of the monks had the thought, 
sn22.81:4.4	“How do you know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life?” 
sn22.81:4.5	Then the Buddha, knowing what that monk was thinking, addressed the mendicants: 
sn22.81:4.6	“Mendicants, I’ve taught the Dhamma analytically. 
sn22.81:4.7	I’ve analytically taught the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, 
sn22.81:4.8	the four right efforts,

sn22.82:1.2	Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.

sn22.82:2.2	“Sir, I’d like to ask the Buddha about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.” 
sn22.82:2.3	“Well then, mendicant, take your own seat and ask what you wish.”

sn22.82:3.1	“Yes, they are,” replied the Buddha. 
sn22.82:3.2	 
sn22.82:3.3	Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question: 
sn22.82:4.1	“But sir, what is the root of these five grasping aggregates?” 
sn22.82:4.2	“These five grasping aggregates are rooted in desire.” … 
sn22.82:4.3	“But sir, is that grasping the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates? Or is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates another?” 
sn22.82:4.4	“Neither. Rather, the desire and greed for them is the grasping there.” 
sn22.82:4.5	Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question: 
sn22.82:5.1	“But sir, can there be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates?” 
sn22.82:5.2	“There can,” said the Buddha. 
sn22.82:5.3	“It’s when someone thinks: 
sn22.82:5.4	‘In the future, may I be of such form, such feeling, such perception, such choices, or such consciousness!’ 
sn22.82:5.5	That’s how there can be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates.” 
sn22.82:5.6	Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question: 
sn22.82:6.1	“Sir, what is the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates?” 
sn22.82:6.2	“Any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of form. 
sn22.82:6.3	Any kind of feeling at all … 
sn22.82:6.4	Any kind of perception at all … 
sn22.82:6.5	Any kind of choices at all … 
sn22.82:6.6	Any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of consciousness. 
sn22.82:6.7	That’s the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates.” 
sn22.82:6.8	Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question: 
sn22.82:7.1	“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why the aggregate of form is found? 
sn22.82:7.2	What is the cause, what is the reason why the aggregate of feeling … 
sn22.82:7.3	perception … 
sn22.82:7.4	choices … 
sn22.82:7.5	consciousness is found?” 
sn22.82:7.6	“The four primary elements are the reason why the aggregate of form is found. 
sn22.82:7.7	Contact is the reason why the aggregates of feeling, 
sn22.82:7.8	perception, 
sn22.82:7.9	and choices are found. 
sn22.82:7.10	Name and form are the reasons why the aggregate of consciousness is found.” 
sn22.82:7.11	Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question: 
sn22.82:8.1	“Sir, how does identity view come about?” 
sn22.82:8.2	“It’s because an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons. 
sn22.82:8.3	They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. 
sn22.82:8.4	They regard feeling … 
sn22.82:8.5	perception … 
sn22.82:8.6	choices … 
sn22.82:8.7	consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. 
sn22.82:8.8	That’s how identity view comes about.” 
sn22.82:8.9	Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant … asked another question: 
sn22.82:9.1	“But sir, how does identity view not come about?” 
sn22.82:9.2	It’s because an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons. 
sn22.82:9.3	They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. 
sn22.82:9.4	They don’t regard feeling … 
sn22.82:9.5	perception … 
sn22.82:9.6	choices … 
sn22.82:9.7	consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. 
sn22.82:9.8	That’s how identity view does not come about.” 
sn22.82:9.9	Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant … asked another question: 
sn22.82:10.1	“Sir, what’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to form, 
sn22.82:10.2	feeling, 
sn22.82:10.3	perception, 
sn22.82:10.4	choices, 
sn22.82:10.5	and consciousness?” 
sn22.82:10.6	“The pleasure and happiness that arise from form: this is its gratification. 
sn22.82:10.7	That form is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback. 
sn22.82:10.8	Removing and giving up desire and greed for form: this is its escape. 
sn22.82:10.9	The pleasure and happiness that arise from feeling … 
sn22.82:10.10	perception … 
sn22.82:10.11	choices … 
sn22.82:10.12	consciousness: this is its gratification. 
sn22.82:10.13	That consciousness is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback. 
sn22.82:10.14	Removing and giving up desire and greed for consciousness: this is its escape.” 
sn22.82:10.15	Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question: 
sn22.82:11.1	“Sir, how does one know and see so that there’s no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli?” 
sn22.82:11.2	“One truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ 
sn22.82:11.3	They truly see any kind of feeling … 
sn22.82:11.4	perception … 
sn22.82:11.5	choices … 
sn22.82:11.6	consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near, *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ 
sn22.82:11.7	That’s how to know and see so that there’s no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli.” 
sn22.82:12.1	Now at that time one of the mendicants had the thought: 
sn22.82:12.2	“So it seems, good sir, that form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self. 
sn22.82:12.3	Then what self will the deeds done by not-self affect?” 
sn22.82:12.4	Then the Buddha, knowing what that monk was thinking, addressed the mendicants: 
sn22.82:13.1	“It’s possible that some foolish person here—unknowing and ignorant, their mind dominated by craving—thinks they can overstep the teacher’s instructions. They think: 
sn22.82:13.2	‘So it seems, good sir, that form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self. 
sn22.82:13.3	Then what self will the deeds done by not-self affect?’ 
sn22.82:13.4	Now, mendicants, you have been educated by me in questioning with regards to all these things in all such cases. 
sn22.82:14.1	What do you think, mendicants? 
sn22.82:14.2	Is form permanent or impermanent?” 
sn22.82:14.3	“Impermanent, sir.” 
sn22.82:14.4	“Is feeling … 
sn22.82:14.5	perception … 
sn22.82:14.6	choices … 
sn22.82:14.7	consciousness permanent or impermanent?” 
sn22.82:14.8	“Impermanent, sir.” 
sn22.82:14.9	“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” 
sn22.82:14.10	“Suffering, sir.” 
sn22.82:14.11	“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: 
sn22.82:14.12	‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 
sn22.82:14.13	“No, sir.” 
sn22.82:14.14	“So you should truly see … 
sn22.82:14.15	Seeing this … 
sn22.82:14.16	They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’” 
sn22.82:15.1	“Two on the aggregates; exactly the same; and can there be; 
sn22.82:15.2	on the term; and on the cause; 
sn22.82:15.3	two questions on identity; 
sn22.82:15.4	gratification; and that with consciousness: 
sn22.82:15.5	these are the ten questions 
sn22.82:15.6	the mendicant came to ask.”

sn22.83:1.2	There Ānanda addressed the mendicants: 
sn22.83:1.3	“Reverends, mendicants!” 
sn22.83:1.4	“Reverend,” they replied. 
sn22.83:1.5	Ānanda said this: 
sn22.83:2.1	“Reverends, the venerable named Puṇṇa Mantāniputta was very helpful to me when I was just ordained. 
sn22.83:2.2	He gave me this advice: 
sn22.83:2.3	‘Reverend Ānanda, the notion “I am” occurs because of grasping, not by not grasping. 
sn22.83:2.4	Grasping what? 
sn22.83:2.5	The notion “I am” occurs because of grasping form, 
sn22.83:2.6	feeling, 
sn22.83:2.7	perception, 
sn22.83:2.8	choices, 
sn22.83:2.9	and consciousness, not by not grasping. 
sn22.83:3.1	Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water. They’d look because of grasping, not by not grasping. 
sn22.83:3.2	In the same way, the notion “I am” occurs because of grasping form, 
sn22.83:3.3	feeling, 
sn22.83:3.4	perception, 
sn22.83:3.5	choices, 
sn22.83:3.6	and consciousness, not by not grasping. 
sn22.83:4.1	What do you think, Reverend Ānanda? 
sn22.83:4.2	Is form permanent or impermanent?’ 
sn22.83:4.3	‘Impermanent, reverend.’ 
sn22.83:4.4	‘Is feeling …

sn22.83:4.12	Reverends, the venerable named Puṇṇa Mantāniputta was very helpful to me when I was just ordained. 
sn22.83:4.13	He gave me this advice. 
sn22.83:4.14	And now that I’ve heard this teaching from Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāniputta, I’ve comprehended the teaching.”

sn22.84:0.3	84. With Tissa 
sn22.84:1.1	At Sāvatthī. 
sn22.84:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Tissa, the Buddha’s paternal cousin, informed several mendicants: 
sn22.84:1.3	“Reverends, my body feels like it’s drugged. I’m disorientated, the teachings don’t inspire me, and dullness and drowsiness fill my mind. I lead the spiritual life dissatisfied, and have doubts about the teachings.”

sn22.84:1.6	 
sn22.84:1.7	 
sn22.84:1.8

sn22.84:3.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Tissa that the Teacher summons him.” 
sn22.84:3.3	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Tissa and said to him, 
sn22.84:3.4	“Reverend Tissa, the teacher summons you.” 
sn22.84:3.5	“Yes, reverend,” Tissa replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 
sn22.84:3.6	“Is it really true, Tissa, that you informed several mendicants that 
sn22.84:3.7	your body feels like it’s drugged … 
sn22.84:3.8	and you have doubts about the teachings?” 
sn22.84:3.9	“Yes, sir.” 
sn22.84:3.10	“What do you think, Tissa? 
sn22.84:3.11	If you’re not rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for form, when that form decays and perishes, will it give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?” 
sn22.84:3.12	“Yes, sir.” 
sn22.84:4.1	“Good, good, Tissa! 
sn22.84:4.2	That’s how it is, Tissa, 
sn22.84:4.3	when you’re not rid of greed for form.

sn22.84:6.2	That’s how it is, Tissa, 
sn22.84:6.3	when you’re not rid of greed for consciousness. 
sn22.84:6.4	What do you think, Tissa? 
sn22.84:6.5	If you are rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for form, when that form decays and perishes, will it give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?” 
sn22.84:6.6	“No, sir.”

sn22.84:8.14	They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
sn22.84:9.1	Suppose, Tissa, there were two people. 
sn22.84:9.2	One was not skilled in the path, the other was. 
sn22.84:9.3	The one not skilled in the path would question the one skilled in the path, 
sn22.84:9.4	who would reply: 
sn22.84:9.5	‘Come, good man, this is the path. 
sn22.84:9.6	Go down it a little, 
sn22.84:9.7	and you’ll see a fork in the road. Ignore the left, and take the right-hand path. 
sn22.84:9.8	Go a little further, 
sn22.84:9.9	and you’ll see a dark forest grove. 
sn22.84:9.10	Go a little further, 
sn22.84:9.11	and you’ll see an expanse of low-lying marshes. 
sn22.84:9.12	Go a little further, 
sn22.84:9.13	and you’ll see a large, steep cliff. 
sn22.84:9.14	Go a little further,

sn22.84:10.1	I’ve made up this simile to make a point. 
sn22.84:10.2	And this is what it means. 
sn22.84:10.3	‘A person who is not skilled in the path’ is a term for an ordinary uneducated person. 
sn22.84:10.4	‘A person who is skilled in the path’ is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. 
sn22.84:10.5	‘A fork in the road’ is a term for doubt. 
sn22.84:10.6	‘The left-hand path’ is a term for the wrong eightfold path, that is, 
sn22.84:10.7	wrong view … wrong immersion. 
sn22.84:10.8	‘The right-hand path’ is a term for the noble eightfold path, that is, 
sn22.84:10.9	right view … right immersion. 
sn22.84:10.10	‘A dark forest grove’ is a term for ignorance. 
sn22.84:10.11	‘An expanse of low-lying marshes’ is a term for sensual pleasures. 
sn22.84:10.12	‘A large, steep cliff’ is a term for anger and distress. 
sn22.84:10.13	‘Level, cleared parkland’ is a term for extinguishment. 
sn22.84:10.14	Rejoice, Tissa, rejoice! 
sn22.84:10.15	I’m here to advise you, to support you, and to teach you.” 
sn22.84:11.1	That is what the Buddha said. 
sn22.84:11.2	Satisfied, Venerable Tissa was happy with what the Buddha said. 
sn22.85:0.1	Linked Discourses 22 
sn22.85:0.2	9. Senior Mendicants 
sn22.85:0.3	85. With Yamaka 
sn22.85:1.1	At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
sn22.85:1.2	Now at that time a mendicant called Yamaka had the following harmful misconception: 
sn22.85:1.3	“As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death.” 
sn22.85:2.1	Several mendicants heard about this. 
sn22.85:2.2	 
sn22.85:2.3	They went to Yamaka and exchanged greetings with him. 
sn22.85:2.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him, 
sn22.85:3.1	“Is it really true, Reverend Yamaka, that you have such a harmful misconception: 
sn22.85:3.2	‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death.’” 
sn22.85:3.3	“Yes, reverends, that’s how I understand the Buddha’s teaching.” 
sn22.85:3.4	 
sn22.85:4.1	“Don’t say that, Yamaka! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that.” 
sn22.85:4.2	 
sn22.85:4.3	But even though admonished by those mendicants, Yamaka obstinately stuck to that misconception and insisted on stating it. 
sn22.85:4.4	 
sn22.85:5.1	When those mendicants were unable to dissuade Yamaka from that misconception, they got up from their seats and went to see Venerable Sāriputta. They told him what had happened, and said, 
sn22.85:5.2	 
sn22.85:5.3	 
sn22.85:5.4	“May Venerable Sāriputta please go to the mendicant Yamaka out of compassion.” 
sn22.85:5.5	Sāriputta consented in silence. 
sn22.85:5.6	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Yamaka and exchanged greetings with him. Seated to one side he said to Yamaka: 
sn22.85:6.1	“Is it really true, Reverend Yamaka, that you have such a harmful misconception: 
sn22.85:6.2	‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death.’” 
sn22.85:6.3	“Yes, reverend, that’s how I understand the Buddha’s teaching.” 
sn22.85:7.1	“What do you think, Yamaka? 
sn22.85:7.2	Is form permanent or impermanent?” 
sn22.85:7.3	“Impermanent, reverend.” 
sn22.85:7.4	“Is feeling … 
sn22.85:7.5	perception … 
sn22.85:7.6	choices …

sn22.85:7.8	“Impermanent, reverend.”

sn22.85:7.10	Seeing this … 
sn22.85:7.11	They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
sn22.85:8.1	What do you think, Reverend Yamaka? 
sn22.85:8.2	Do you regard the Realized One as form?” 
sn22.85:8.3	“No, reverend.” 
sn22.85:8.4	“Do you regard the Realized One as feeling …

sn22.85:9.3	“No, reverend.” 
sn22.85:9.4	“Or do you regard the Realized One as distinct from form?” 
sn22.85:9.5	“No, reverend.” 
sn22.85:9.6	“Do you regard the Realized One as in feeling … 
sn22.85:9.7	or distinct from feeling …

sn22.85:9.15	“No, reverend.” 
sn22.85:10.1	“What do you think, Yamaka? 
sn22.85:10.2	Do you regard the Realized One as possessing form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” 
sn22.85:10.3	“No, reverend.” 
sn22.85:11.1	“What do you think, Yamaka? 
sn22.85:11.2	Do you regard the Realized One as one who is without form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” 
sn22.85:11.3	“No, reverend.” 
sn22.85:11.4	“In that case, Reverend Yamaka, since you don’t acknowledge the Realized One as a genuine fact in the present life, is it appropriate to declare: 
sn22.85:11.5	‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death.’?” 
sn22.85:12.1	“Reverend Sāriputta, in my ignorance, I used to have that misconception. 
sn22.85:12.2	But now that I’ve heard the teaching from Venerable Sāriputta I’ve given up that misconception, and I’ve comprehended the teaching.” 
sn22.85:13.1	“Reverend Yamaka, suppose they were to ask you: 
sn22.85:13.2	‘When their body breaks up, after death, what happens to a perfected one, who has ended the defilements?’ 
sn22.85:13.3	How would you answer?” 
sn22.85:13.4	“Sir, if they were to ask this, 
sn22.85:13.5	 
sn22.85:13.6	I’d answer like this: 
sn22.85:13.7	‘Reverend, form is impermanent. 
sn22.85:13.8	What’s impermanent is suffering. 
sn22.85:13.9	What’s suffering has ceased and ended. 
sn22.85:13.10	Feeling … 
sn22.85:13.11	perception … 
sn22.85:13.12	choices … 
sn22.85:13.13	consciousness is impermanent. 
sn22.85:13.14	What’s impermanent is suffering. 
sn22.85:13.15	What’s suffering has ceased and ended.’ 
sn22.85:13.16	That’s how I’d answer such a question.” 
sn22.85:14.1	“Good, good, Reverend Yamaka! 
sn22.85:14.2	Well then, I shall give you a simile to make the meaning even clearer. 
sn22.85:14.3	Suppose there was a householder or householder’s son who was rich, with a lot of money and great wealth, 
sn22.85:14.4	and a bodyguard for protection. 
sn22.85:14.5	Then along comes a person who wants to harm, injure, and threaten him, and take his life. 
sn22.85:14.6	They’d think: 
sn22.85:14.7	‘This householder or householder’s son is rich, with a lot of money and great wealth, 
sn22.85:14.8	and a bodyguard for protection. 
sn22.85:14.9	It won’t be easy to take his life by force. 
sn22.85:14.10	Why don’t I get close to him, then take his life?’ 
sn22.85:14.11	So he goes up to that householder or householder’s son and says: 
sn22.85:14.12	‘Sir, I would serve you.’ 
sn22.85:14.13	Then they would serve that householder or householder’s son. 
sn22.85:14.14	They’d get up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely. 
sn22.85:14.15	The householder or householder’s son would consider them as a friend 
sn22.85:14.16	and companion, 
sn22.85:14.17	and come to trust them. 
sn22.85:14.18	But when that person realizes that 
sn22.85:14.19	they’ve gained the trust of the householder or householder’s son, then, when they know he’s alone, they’d take his life with a sharp knife. 
sn22.85:15.1	What do you think, Yamaka? 
sn22.85:15.2	When that person went to the householder or householder’s son and offered to 
sn22.85:15.3	serve him, weren’t they a killer then, 
sn22.85:15.4	though he didn’t know that 
sn22.85:15.5	this was his killer? 
sn22.85:15.6	And when they got up before him and went to bed after him, being obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely, weren’t they a killer then, 
sn22.85:15.7	though he didn’t know that 
sn22.85:15.8	this was his killer? 
sn22.85:15.9	And when, knowing he was alone, they took his life with a sharp knife, weren’t they a killer then, 
sn22.85:15.10	though he didn’t know that 
sn22.85:15.11	this was his killer?” 
sn22.85:15.12	“Yes, reverend.”

sn22.86:0.3	86. With Anurādha 
sn22.86:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
sn22.86:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Anurādha was staying not far from the Buddha in a wilderness hut. 
sn22.86:1.3	Then several wanderers who follow other paths went up to Venerable Anurādha and exchanged greetings with him. 
sn22.86:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him: 
sn22.86:1.5	“Reverend Anurādha, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them in these four ways: 
sn22.86:1.6	After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.” 
sn22.86:2.1	When they said this, Venerable Anurādha said to those wanderers: 
sn22.86:2.2	“Reverends, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them other than these four ways: 
sn22.86:2.3	After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.” 
sn22.86:2.4	When he said this, the wanderers said to him: 
sn22.86:2.5	“This mendicant must be junior, recently gone forth, or else a foolish, incompetent senior mendicant.” 
sn22.86:2.6	Then, after rebuking Venerable Anurādha by calling him “junior” and “foolish”, the wanderers got up from their seats and left. 
sn22.86:3.1	Soon after they had left, Anurādha thought: 
sn22.86:3.2	“If those wanderers were to inquire further, 
sn22.86:3.3	how should I answer them so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should I explain in line with his teaching, so that there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?” 
sn22.86:4.1	Then Venerable Anurādha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him all that had happened.

sn22.87:0.3	87. With Vakkali 
sn22.87:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
sn22.87:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Vakkali was staying in a potter’s shed, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill. 
sn22.87:1.3	Then he addressed his carers, 
sn22.87:1.4	“Please, reverends, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him: 
sn22.87:1.5	‘Sir, the mendicant Vakkali is sick, suffering, and gravely ill. He bows with his head to your feet.’ 
sn22.87:1.6	And then say: 
sn22.87:1.7	‘Sir, please go to the mendicant Vakkali out of compassion.’” 
sn22.87:1.8	“Yes, reverend,” those monks replied. They did as he asked. 
sn22.87:1.9	 
sn22.87:1.10	 
sn22.87:1.11	 
sn22.87:1.12	The Buddha consented in silence. 
sn22.87:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robes, went to Venerable Vakkali. 
sn22.87:2.2	Venerable Vakkali saw the Buddha coming off in the distance and tried to rise on his cot. 
sn22.87:2.3	But the Buddha said to him, 
sn22.87:2.4	“It’s all right, Vakkali, don’t get up. 
sn22.87:2.5	There are some seats spread out, I will sit there.” 
sn22.87:2.6	He sat on the seat spread out and said to Vakkali, 
sn22.87:2.7	“I hope you’re keeping well, Vakkali; I hope you’re alright. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.” 
sn22.87:2.8	“Sir, I’m not all right, I’m not getting by. My pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is apparent, not its fading.” 
sn22.87:2.9	“I hope you don’t have any remorse or regret?” 
sn22.87:2.10	“Indeed, sir, I have no little remorse and regret.” 
sn22.87:2.11	“I hope you have no reason to blame yourself when it comes to ethical conduct?” 
sn22.87:2.12	“No sir, I have no reason to blame myself when it comes to ethical conduct.” 
sn22.87:2.13	“In that case, Vakkali, why do you have remorse and regret?” 
sn22.87:2.14	“For a long time I’ve wanted to go and see the Buddha, but I was physically too weak.” 
sn22.87:3.1	“Enough, Vakkali! Why would you want to see this rotten body? 
sn22.87:3.2	One who sees the teaching sees me. 
sn22.87:3.3	One who sees me sees the teaching. 
sn22.87:3.4	Seeing the teaching, you see me. 
sn22.87:3.5	Seeing me, you see the teaching. 
sn22.87:4.1	What do you think, Vakkali? 
sn22.87:4.2	Is form permanent or impermanent?” 
sn22.87:4.3	“Impermanent, sir.” 
sn22.87:4.4	“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” 
sn22.87:4.5	“Suffering, sir.” 
sn22.87:4.6	“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:

sn22.87:4.18	They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’” 
sn22.87:5.1	And then, after giving Venerable Vakkali this advice, the Buddha got up from his seat and went to the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. 
sn22.87:5.2	Then Venerable Vakkali addressed his carers, 
sn22.87:5.3	“Come on, reverends, lift my cot and take me to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili. 
sn22.87:5.4	It’s unthinkable for one like me to die in an inhabited area!” 
sn22.87:5.5	“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants, and did as he asked. 
sn22.87:5.6	Meanwhile, the Buddha spent the rest of that night and day on Vulture’s Peak Mountain. 
sn22.87:5.7	Then, late at night, two glorious deities, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. 
sn22.87:5.8	One deity said to him, 
sn22.87:5.9	“Sir, the mendicant Vakkali is intent on liberation!” 
sn22.87:5.10	And another deity said to him, 
sn22.87:5.11	“He’ll definitely be well-freed!” 
sn22.87:5.12	This is what those deities said. 
sn22.87:5.13	Then they bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right side, before vanishing right there. 
sn22.87:6.1	Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
sn22.87:6.2	“Come, mendicants, go to the mendicant Vakkali and tell him: 
sn22.87:7.1	‘Vakkali, hear the word of the Buddha and two deities.

sn22.87:7.9	do not fear! 
sn22.87:7.10	Your death will not be a bad one; your passing will not be a bad one.”’” 
sn22.87:7.11	“Yes, sir,” those monks replied. They went to Vakkali and said to him: 
sn22.87:7.12	“Vakkali, hear the word of the Buddha and two deities.” 
sn22.87:8.1	Then Vakkali addressed his carers, 
sn22.87:8.2	“Please, reverends, help me off my cot. 
sn22.87:8.3	It’s unthinkable for one like me to listen to the Buddha’s instructions sitting on a high seat.” 
sn22.87:8.4	“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants, and helped him off his cot. 
sn22.87:8.5	They repeated what the Buddha had said.

sn22.87:8.35	“Yes, reverend,” those monks replied, and left.

sn22.87:11.1	Now at that time a cloud of black smoke was moving east, west, north, south, above, below, and in-between. 
sn22.87:11.2	The Buddha said to the mendicants,

sn22.87:11.4	“Yes, sir.” 
sn22.87:11.5	“That’s Māra the Wicked searching for Vakkali’s consciousness, wondering: 
sn22.87:11.6	‘Where is Vakkali’s consciousness established?’

sn22.88:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
sn22.88:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Assaji was staying in a monastery built by a Kassapa, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill. 
sn22.88:1.3	Then he addressed his carers: 
sn22.88:1.4	“Please, reverends, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him: 
sn22.88:1.5	‘Sir, the mendicant Assaji is sick, suffering, gravely ill. 
sn22.88:1.6	He bows with his head to your feet.’ 
sn22.88:1.7	And then say: 
sn22.88:1.8	‘Sir, please go to the mendicant Assaji out of compassion.’” 
sn22.88:1.9	“Yes, reverend,” those monks replied. They did as he asked. 
sn22.88:1.10	 
sn22.88:1.11	 
sn22.88:1.12	The Buddha consented in silence. 
sn22.88:2.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to Venerable Assaji. 
sn22.88:2.2	Venerable Assaji saw the Buddha coming off in the distance, 
sn22.88:2.3	and tried to rise on his cot. 
sn22.88:2.4	But the Buddha said to him, 
sn22.88:2.5	“It’s all right, Assaji, don’t get up. 
sn22.88:2.6	There are some seats spread out by others, I will sit there.” 
sn22.88:2.7	He sat on the seat spread out and said, 
sn22.88:2.8	“I hope you’re keeping well, Assaji; I hope you’re alright. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.” 
sn22.88:3.1	“Sir, I’m not all right, I’m not getting by. My pain is terrible and growing, not fading, its growing is evident, not its fading.” 
sn22.88:3.2	“I hope you don’t have any remorse or regret?” 
sn22.88:3.3	“Indeed, sir, I have no little remorse and regret.” 
sn22.88:3.4	“I hope you have no reason to blame yourself when it comes to ethical conduct?” 
sn22.88:3.5	“No sir, I have no reason to blame myself when it comes to ethical conduct.” 
sn22.88:3.6	“In that case, Assaji, why do you have remorse and regret?” 
sn22.88:3.7	“Sir, before my time of illness I meditated having completely stilled the physical process. But now I can’t get immersion. 
sn22.88:3.8	Since I can’t get immersion, I think: 
sn22.88:3.9	‘May I not decline!’” 
sn22.88:3.10	“Assaji, there are ascetics and brahmins for whom samādhi is the essence, equating immersion with the ascetic life. They think: 
sn22.88:3.11	‘May we not decline!’ 
sn22.88:4.1	What do you think, Assaji? 
sn22.88:4.2	Is form permanent or impermanent?” 
sn22.88:4.3	“Impermanent, sir.” … 
sn22.88:4.4	“Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?” … 
sn22.88:4.5	“So you should truly see … 
sn22.88:4.6	Seeing this … 
sn22.88:4.7	They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
sn22.88:4.8	If they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t relish it. 
sn22.88:4.9	If they feel a painful feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t relish it. 
sn22.88:4.10	If they feel a neutral feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t relish it.

sn22.88:4.13	If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached. 
sn22.88:4.14	Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’ 
sn22.88:4.15	They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life is over, everything that’s felt, being no longer relished, will become cool right here.’ 
sn22.88:5.1	Suppose an oil lamp depended on oil and a wick to burn. 
sn22.88:5.2	As the oil and the wick are used up, it would be extinguished due to lack of fuel. 
sn22.88:5.3	In the same way, feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’

sn22.89:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Khemaka was staying in the Jujube Tree Monastery, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill. 
sn22.89:1.3	In the late afternoon those senior mendicants came out of retreat and addressed Venerable Dāsaka,

sn22.89:9.1	Then Venerable Khemaka, leaning on a staff, went to those senior mendicants and exchanged greetings with them. 
sn22.89:9.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. They said to him:

sn22.89:9.15	For when it comes to the five grasping aggregates I’m not rid of the conceit ‘I am’. But I don’t regard anything as ‘I am this’. 
sn22.89:10.1	It’s like the scent of a blue water lily, or a pink or white lotus. 
sn22.89:10.2	Would it be right to say that the scent belongs to the petals or the stalk or the pistil?” 
sn22.89:10.3	“No, reverend.” 
sn22.89:10.4	“Then, reverends, how should it be said?” 
sn22.89:10.5	“It would be right to say that the scent belongs to the flower.” 
sn22.89:10.6	“In the same way, reverends, I don’t say ‘I am’ with reference to form, or apart from form. 
sn22.89:10.7	I don’t say ‘I am’ with reference to feeling …

sn22.89:11.1	Although a noble disciple has given up the five lower fetters, they still have a lingering residue of the conceit ‘I am’, the desire ‘I am’, and the underlying tendency ‘I am’ which has not been eradicated. 
sn22.89:11.2	After some time they meditate observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates. 
sn22.89:11.3	‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.

sn22.89:11.6	Such are choices … 
sn22.89:11.7	Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ 
sn22.89:11.8	As they do so, that lingering residue is eradicated. 
sn22.89:12.1	Suppose there was a cloth that was dirty and soiled, so the owners give it to a launderer. 
sn22.89:12.2	The launderer kneads it thoroughly with salt, lye, and cow dung, and rinses it in clear water. 
sn22.89:12.3	Although that cloth is clean and bright, it still has a lingering scent of salt, lye, or cow dung that had not been eradicated. 
sn22.89:12.4	The launderer returns it to its owners, who store it in a chest permeated with scent. 
sn22.89:12.5	And that lingering scent would be eradicated. 
sn22.89:12.6	In the same way, although a noble disciple has given up the five lower fetters, they still have a lingering residue of the conceit ‘I am’, the desire ‘I am’, and the underlying tendency ‘I am’ which has not been eradicated. 
sn22.89:12.7	After some time they meditate observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates. 
sn22.89:12.8	‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. 
sn22.89:12.9	Such is feeling … 
sn22.89:12.10	Such is perception … 
sn22.89:12.11	Such are choices … 
sn22.89:12.12	Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ 
sn22.89:12.13	As they do so, that lingering residue is eradicated.” 
sn22.89:13.1	When he said this, the senior mendicants said to Venerable Khemaka, 
sn22.89:13.2	“We didn’t want to trouble Venerable Khemaka with our questions. But you’re capable of explaining, teaching, asserting, establishing, clarifying, analyzing, and revealing the Buddha’s instructions in detail. 
sn22.89:13.3	And that’s just what you’ve done.” 
sn22.89:14.1	That’s what Venerable Khemaka said. 
sn22.89:14.2	Satisfied, the senior mendicants were happy with what Venerable Khemaka said. 
sn22.89:14.3	And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of sixty senior mendicants and of Venerable Khemaka were freed from defilements by not grasping.

sn22.90:8.5	“It seems I’m capable of understanding the teaching!” 
sn22.90:9.1	“Reverend Channa, I heard and learned in the presence of the Buddha his advice to the mendicant Kaccānagotta: 
sn22.90:9.2	‘Kaccāna, this world mostly relies on the dual notions of existence and non-existence. 
sn22.90:9.3	But when you truly see the origin of the world with right understanding, you won’t have the notion of non-existence regarding the world. 
sn22.90:9.4	And when you truly see the cessation of the world with right understanding, you won’t have the notion of existence regarding the world. 
sn22.90:9.5	The world is for the most part shackled by attraction, grasping, and insisting. 
sn22.90:9.6	But if—when it comes to this attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendency—you don’t get attracted, grasp, and commit to the notion “my self”, 
sn22.90:9.7	you’ll have no doubt or uncertainty that what arises is just suffering arising, and what ceases is just suffering ceasing. 
sn22.90:9.8	Your knowledge about this is independent of others. 
sn22.90:9.9	This is how right view is defined. 
sn22.90:9.10	“All exists”: this is one extreme. 
sn22.90:9.11	“All doesn’t exist”: this is the second extreme. 
sn22.90:9.12	Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way: 
sn22.90:9.13	“Ignorance is a condition for choices. 
sn22.90:9.14	Choices are a condition for consciousness. … 
sn22.90:9.15	That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. 
sn22.90:9.16	When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. … 
sn22.90:9.17	That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.”’” 
sn22.90:10.1	“Reverend Ānanda, this is how it is when you have such venerables as spiritual companions to advise and instruct you out of kindness and compassion. 
sn22.90:10.2	And now that I’ve heard this teaching from Venerable Ānanda, I’ve comprehended the teaching.”

sn22.93:1.3	In the same way, an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons.

sn22.95:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Ayojjhā on the bank of the Ganges river. 
sn22.95:1.2	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
sn22.95:2.1	“Mendicants, suppose this Ganges river was carrying along a big lump of foam. And a person with good eyesight would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully. And it would appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in a lump of foam? 
sn22.95:2.2	In the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; near or far—examining it carefully. And it appears to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in form?

For what substance could there be in a water bubble? 
sn22.95:3.2	In the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of feeling at all … examining it carefully. And it appears to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in feeling? 
sn22.95:4.1	Suppose that in the last month of summer, at noon, a shimmering mirage appears. And a person with good eyesight would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully. And it would appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in a mirage? 
sn22.95:4.2	In the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of perception at all … examining it carefully. And it appears to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in perception? 
sn22.95:5.1	Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. Wandering in search of heartwood, they’d take a sharp axe and enter a forest. There they’d see a big banana tree, straight and young and grown free of defects. They’d cut it down at the base, cut off the top, and unroll the coiled sheaths. But they wouldn’t even find sapwood, much less heartwood. And a person with good eyesight would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully. And it would appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in a banana tree? 
sn22.95:5.2	In the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of choices at all … examining them carefully. And they appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in choices? 
sn22.95:6.1	Suppose a magician or their apprentice was to perform a magic trick at the crossroads. And a person with good eyesight would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully. And it would appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in a magic trick? 
sn22.95:6.2	In the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; near or far—examining it carefully.

sn22.95:7.1	Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. 
sn22.95:7.2	Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. 
sn22.95:7.3	They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’” 
sn22.95:8.1	That is what the Buddha said. 
sn22.95:8.2	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
sn22.95:9.1	“Form is like a lump of foam;

sn24.8:0.3	8. The Extensive View 
sn24.8:1.1	At Sāvatthī. 
sn24.8:1.2	“Mendicants, when what exists, because of grasping what and insisting on what, does the view arise: 
sn24.8:1.3	‘There are these seven substances that are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. 
sn24.8:1.4	They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or neutral feeling to each other. 
sn24.8:1.5	What seven? 
sn24.8:1.6	The substances of earth, water, fire, air; pleasure, pain, and the soul is the seventh. 
sn24.8:1.7	These seven substances are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. 
sn24.8:1.8	They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or neutral feeling to each other. 
sn24.8:1.9	If you chop off someone’s head with a sharp sword, you don’t take anyone’s life. 
sn24.8:1.10	The sword simply passes through the gap between the seven substances. 
sn24.8:1.11	There are 1.4 million main wombs, and 6,000, and 600. There are 500 deeds, and five, and three. There are deeds and half-deeds. There are 62 paths, 62 sub-eons, six classes of rebirth, and eight stages in a person’s life. There are 4,900 Ājīvaka ascetics, 4,900 wanderers, and 4,900 naked ascetics. There are 2,000 faculties, 3,000 hells, and 36 realms of dust. There are seven percipient embryos, seven non-percipient embryos, and seven embryos without attachments. There are seven gods, seven humans, and seven goblins. There are seven lakes, seven winds, seven cliffs, and 700 cliffs. There are seven dreams and 700 dreams. There are 8.4 million great eons through which the foolish and the astute transmigrate before making an end of suffering. 
sn24.8:1.12	And here there is no such thing as this: “By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life I shall force unripened deeds to bear their fruit, or eliminate old deeds by experiencing their results little by little”—for that cannot be. 
sn24.8:1.13	Pleasure and pain are allotted. Transmigration lasts only for a limited period, so there’s no increase or decrease, no getting better or worse. 
sn24.8:1.14	It’s like how, when you toss a ball of string, it rolls away unraveling.

sn3.11:1.2	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and sat outside the gate. 
sn3.11:1.3	Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. 
sn3.11:2.1	Now at that time seven matted-hair ascetics, seven Jain ascetics, seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloth ascetics, and seven wanderers passed by not far from the Buddha. Their armpits and bodies were hairy, and their nails were long; and they carried their stuff with shoulder-poles. 
sn3.11:2.2	Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward those various ascetics, and pronounced his name three times: 
sn3.11:2.3	“Sirs, I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala! … 
sn3.11:2.4	I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!” 
sn3.11:3.1	Then, soon after those ascetics had left, King Pasenadi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
sn3.11:3.2	“Sir, are they among those in the world who are perfected ones or who are on the path to perfection?” 
sn3.11:4.1	“Great king, as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures, living at home with your children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, perfumes, and makeup, and accepting gold and money, it’s hard for you to know who is perfected or on the path to perfection. 
sn3.11:5.1	You can get to know a person’s ethics by living with them. But only after a long time, not casually; only when paying attention, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless. 
sn3.11:5.2	You can get to know a person’s purity by dealing with them. … 
sn3.11:5.3	You can get to know a person’s resilience in times of trouble. … 
sn3.11:5.4	You can get to know a person’s wisdom by discussion. But only after a long time, not casually; only when paying attention, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless.”

sn3.11:8.1	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha recited these verses: 
sn3.11:9.1	“It’s not easy to know a man by his appearance. 
sn3.11:9.2	You shouldn’t trust them at first sight. 
sn3.11:9.3	For undisciplined men live in this world

sn3.12:1.2	Now at that time five kings headed by Pasenadi were amusing themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, and this discussion came up among them: 
sn3.12:1.3	“What’s the best of sensual pleasures?” 
sn3.12:1.4	Some of them said, 
sn3.12:1.5	“Sights are the best of sensual pleasures!” 
sn3.12:1.6	Others said, 
sn3.12:1.7	“Sounds are best!” 
sn3.12:1.8	Others said, 
sn3.12:1.9	“Smells are best!” 
sn3.12:1.10	Others said, 
sn3.12:1.11	“Tastes are best!” 
sn3.12:1.12	Others said, 
sn3.12:1.13	“Touches are best!” 
sn3.12:1.14	Since those kings were unable to persuade each other, 
sn3.12:2.1	King Pasenadi said to them, 
sn3.12:2.2	“Come, good sirs, let’s go to the Buddha and ask him about this. 
sn3.12:2.3	As he answers, so we’ll remember it.” 
sn3.12:2.4	“Yes, dear sir,” replied those kings.

sn3.12:4.2	The very same sights that are agreeable to some are disagreeable to others. 
sn3.12:4.3	When you’re happy with certain sights, as you’ve got all you wished for, you don’t want any other sight that’s better or finer.

sn3.12:9.1	Now at that time the lay follower Candanaṅgalika was sitting in that assembly. 
sn3.12:9.2	Then he got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said, 
sn3.12:9.3	“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” 
sn3.12:9.4	“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. 
sn3.12:10.1	Then the lay follower Candanaṅgalika extolled the Buddha in his presence with an appropriate verse:

sn3.13:1.2	Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala used to eat rice by the bucket. 
sn3.13:1.3	Then after eating King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, huffing and puffing. He bowed and sat down to one side. 
sn3.13:2.1	Then, knowing that King Pasenadi was huffing and puffing after eating, on that occasion the Buddha recited this verse: 
sn3.13:3.1	“When a man is always mindful, 
sn3.13:3.2	knowing moderation in eating, 
sn3.13:3.3	his discomfort fades, 
sn3.13:3.4	and he ages slowly, taking care of his life.” 
sn3.13:4.1	Now at that time the brahmin student Sudassana was standing behind the king. 
sn3.13:4.2	Then King Pasenadi addressed him, 
sn3.13:4.3	“Please, dear Sudassana, memorize this verse in the Buddha’s presence and recite it to me whenever I am presented with a meal. 
sn3.13:4.4	I’ll set up a regular daily allowance of a hundred dollars for you.” 
sn3.13:4.5	“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Sudassana. He memorized that verse in the Buddha’s presence, and then whenever the king was presented with a meal he would repeat it: 
sn3.13:5.1	“When a man is always mindful, 
sn3.13:5.2	knowing moderation in eating, 
sn3.13:5.3	his discomfort fades, 
sn3.13:5.4	and he ages slowly, taking care of his life.” 
sn3.13:6.1	Then the king gradually got used to having no more than a pint of rice. 
sn3.13:6.2	After some time King Pasenadi’s body slimmed right down. Stroking his limbs with his hands, at that time he expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
sn3.13:6.3	“In both ways the Buddha has compassion for me: 
sn3.13:6.4	in the good of the present life and the good of the next.”

sn3.18:1.4	‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha. But it’s for someone with good friends, companions, and associates, not for someone with bad friends, companions, and associates.’” 
sn3.18:2.1	“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true!” said the Buddha. And he repeated the king’s statement, adding: 
sn3.18:2.2	 
sn3.18:3.1	“Great king, this one time I was staying in the land of the Sakyans where they have a town named Townsville. 
sn3.18:3.2	Then the mendicant Ānanda came to me, bowed, sat down to one side, and said:

sn3.18:4.3	Good friends, companions, and associates are the whole of the spiritual life. 
sn3.18:4.4	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path. 
sn3.18:5.1	And how does a mendicant with good friends develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path? 
sn3.18:5.2	It’s when a mendicant develops right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. 
sn3.18:5.3	That’s how a mendicant with good friends develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path. 
sn3.18:5.4	And here’s another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life. 
sn3.18:6.1	For, by relying on me as a good friend, sentient beings who are liable to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are freed from all these things.

sn3.20:2.4	And yet that financier ate meals of 
sn3.20:2.5	rough gruel with pickles. 
sn3.20:2.6	He wore clothes consisting of 
sn3.20:2.7	three pieces of sunn hemp. 
sn3.20:2.8	He traveled around in a vehicle that was

sn3.20:3.1	“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true! 
sn3.20:3.2	Once upon a time, great king, that financier householder provided almsfood on behalf of a Buddha awakened for himself named Tagarasikhī. 
sn3.20:3.3	He instructed: ‘Give alms to that ascetic,’ before getting up from his seat and leaving. 
sn3.20:3.4	But after giving he regretted it: 
sn3.20:3.5	‘It would have been better to feed the bondservants or workers with that almsfood.’ 
sn3.20:3.6	What’s more, he murdered his brother’s only child for the sake of his fortune. 
sn3.20:4.1	Because that financier provided Tagarasikhī with almsfood, as a result of that deed he was reborn seven times in a good place, a heavenly realm. 
sn3.20:4.2	And as a residual result of that same deed he held the position of financier seven times right here in Sāvatthī. 
sn3.20:4.3	But because that financier regretted giving alms, 
sn3.20:4.4	as a result of that deed his mind didn’t tend to enjoy nice food, clothes, vehicles, or the five refined kinds of sensual stimulation. 
sn3.20:4.5	And because that financier murdered his brother’s only child for the sake of his fortune, as a result of that deed he burned in hell for many years, for many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of years. 
sn3.20:4.6	And as a residual result of that same deed, he is childless for the seventh time, his fortune ending up in the royal treasury. 
sn3.20:4.7	Now the old merit of that financier has been used up, and he hasn’t accumulated new merit. 
sn3.20:4.8	Today, great king, that financier burns in the Great Hell of Screams.”

sn35.103:1.5	‘This for sure is the knowledge master! This for sure is the conqueror of all! This for sure is the boil’s root dug out, never dug out before!’

sn35.103:3.3	That’s how a mendicant is a conqueror of all. 
sn35.103:4.1	And how has a mendicant dug out the boil’s root, which was never dug out before? 
sn35.103:4.2	‘Boil’ is a term for this body made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction. 
sn35.103:4.3	‘Boil’s root’ is a term for craving. 
sn35.103:4.4	It’s when a mendicant has given up craving, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future. 
sn35.103:4.5	That’s how a mendicant has dug out the boil’s root, which was never dug out before.

sn35.117:7.1	“Then listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
sn35.117:7.2	“Yes, reverend,” they replied. 
sn35.117:7.3	Ānanda said this: 
sn35.117:8.1	“Reverends, the Buddha gave this brief summary, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail: 
sn35.117:8.2	‘So you should understand that dimension where the eye ceases and perception of sights fades away. You should understand that dimension where the ear … nose … tongue … body … 
sn35.117:8.3	mind ceases and perception of thoughts fades away.’ 
sn35.117:8.4	And this is how I understand the detailed meaning of this summary. 
sn35.117:8.5	The Buddha was referring to the cessation of the six sense fields when he said:

sn35.120:1.1	At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
sn35.120:1.2	Then a certain mendicant went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him. 
sn35.120:1.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and said to him, 
sn35.120:1.4	“Reverend Sāriputta, a mendicant pupil of mine has resigned the training and returned to a lesser life.” 
sn35.120:2.1	“That’s how it is, reverend, when someone doesn’t guard the sense doors, eats too much, and is not committed to wakefulness. 
sn35.120:2.2	It’s not possible for such a mendicant to maintain the full and pure spiritual life for the rest of their life. 
sn35.120:2.3	But it is possible for a mendicant to maintain the full and pure spiritual life for the rest of their life if they guard the sense doors, eat in moderation, and are committed to wakefulness. 
sn35.120:3.1	And how does someone guard the sense doors? 
sn35.120:3.2	When a mendicant sees a sight with the eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. 
sn35.120:3.3	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint. 
sn35.120:3.4	When they hear a sound with their ears … 
sn35.120:3.5	When they smell an odor with their nose … 
sn35.120:3.6	When they taste a flavor with their tongue … 
sn35.120:3.7	When they feel a touch with their body … 
sn35.120:3.8	When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. 
sn35.120:3.9	If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint. 
sn35.120:3.10	That’s how someone guards the sense doors. 
sn35.120:4.1	And how does someone eat in moderation? 
sn35.120:4.2	It’s when a mendicant reflects properly on the food that they eat: 
sn35.120:4.3	‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’ 
sn35.120:4.4	That’s how someone eats in moderation. 
sn35.120:5.1	And how is someone committed to wakefulness? 
sn35.120:5.2	It’s when a mendicant practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind from obstacles. 
sn35.120:5.3	In the evening, they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation. 
sn35.120:5.4	In the middle of the night, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. 
sn35.120:5.5	In the last part of the night, they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying their mind from obstacles. 
sn35.120:5.6	That’s how someone is committed to wakefulness. 
sn35.120:5.7	So you should train like this: 
sn35.120:5.8	‘We will guard the sense doors, eat in moderation, and be committed to wakefulness.’ 
sn35.120:5.9	That’s how you should train.”

sn35.121:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
sn35.121:1.2	Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, 
sn35.121:1.3	“The qualities that ripen in freedom have ripened in Rāhula. 
sn35.121:1.4	Why don’t I lead him further to the ending of defilements?” 
sn35.121:1.5	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. 
sn35.121:1.6	After the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Rāhula, 
sn35.121:1.7	“Rāhula, get your sitting cloth. 
sn35.121:1.8	Let’s go to the Dark Forest for the day’s meditation.” 
sn35.121:1.9	“Yes, sir,” replied Rāhula. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha. 
sn35.121:2.1	Now at that time many thousands of deities followed the Buddha, thinking, 
sn35.121:2.2	“Today the Buddha will lead Rāhula further to the ending of defilements!” 
sn35.121:2.3	Then the Buddha plunged deep into the Dark Forest and sat at the root of a tree on the seat spread out. 
sn35.121:2.4	Rāhula bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. 
sn35.121:2.5	The Buddha said to him: 
sn35.121:3.1	“What do you think, Rāhula? 
sn35.121:3.2	Is the eye permanent or impermanent?” 
sn35.121:4.1	“Impermanent, sir.”

sn35.121:51.2	They grow disillusioned with the ear … nose … tongue … body … 
sn35.121:52.1	They grow disillusioned with the mind, thoughts, mind consciousness, and mind contact. And they grow disillusioned with anything included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that arises conditioned by mind contact.

sn35.121:52.3	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”

sn35.127:1.1	At one time Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. 
sn35.127:1.2	Then King Udena went up to Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja and exchanged greetings with him. 
sn35.127:1.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and said to him: 
sn35.127:1.4	“Master Bhāradvāja, there are these young monks who are youthful, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life; and they’ve never played around with sensual pleasures. What is the cause, what is the reason why they practice the full and pure spiritual life as long as they live, maintaining it for a long time?” 
sn35.127:1.5	“Great king, this has been stated by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha: 
sn35.127:1.6	‘Please, monks, think of women your mother’s age as your mother. Think of women your sister’s age as your sister. And think of women your daughter’s age as your daughter.’ 
sn35.127:1.7	This is a cause, great king, this is a reason why these young monks practice the full and pure spiritual life as long as they live, maintaining it for a long time.” 
sn35.127:2.1	“But Master Bhāradvāja, the mind is wanton. 
sn35.127:2.2	Sometimes thoughts of desire come up even for women your mother’s age, your sister’s age, or your daughter’s age. 
sn35.127:2.3	Is there another cause, another reason why these young monks live the full and pure spiritual life for their entire life?” 
sn35.127:3.1	“Great king, this has been stated by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha: 
sn35.127:3.2	‘Please, monks, examine your own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth. 
sn35.127:3.3	In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’ 
sn35.127:3.4	This is also a cause, great king, this is a reason why these young monks live the full and pure spiritual life for their entire life, maintaining it for a long time.” 
sn35.127:3.5	“This is easy to do for those mendicants who have developed their physical endurance, ethics, mind, and wisdom. 
sn35.127:3.6	But it’s hard to do for those mendicants who have not developed their physical endurance, ethics, mind, and wisdom. 
sn35.127:3.7	Sometimes I plan to focus on something as ugly, but only its beauty comes to mind. 
sn35.127:3.8	Is there another cause, another reason why these young monks live the full and pure spiritual life for their entire life?” 
sn35.127:4.1	“Great king, this has been stated by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha: 
sn35.127:4.2	‘Please, monks, live with sense doors guarded. 
sn35.127:4.3	When you see a sight with your eyes, don’t get caught up in the features and details. 
sn35.127:4.4	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, practice restraint, protect the faculty of sight, and achieve its restraint. 
sn35.127:4.5	When you hear a sound with your ears … 
sn35.127:4.6	When you smell an odor with your nose … 
sn35.127:4.7	When you taste a flavor with your tongue … 
sn35.127:4.8	When you feel a touch with your body … 
sn35.127:4.9	When you know a thought with your mind, don’t get caught up in the features and details. 
sn35.127:4.10	If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, practice restraint, protect the faculty of mind, and achieve its restraint.’ 
sn35.127:4.11	This is also a cause, great king, this is a reason why these young monks practice the full and pure spiritual life as long as they live, maintaining it for a long time.” 
sn35.127:5.1	“It’s incredible, Master Bhāradvāja, it’s amazing! 
sn35.127:5.2	How well this was said by the Buddha! 
sn35.127:5.3	This is the real cause, this is the reason why these young monks practice the full and pure spiritual life as long as they live, maintaining it for a long time. 
sn35.127:5.4	For sometimes I too enter the harem with unprotected body, speech, mind, mindfulness, and sense faculties. At those times powerful thoughts of desire get the better of me. 
sn35.127:5.5	But sometimes I enter the harem with protected body, speech, mind, mindfulness, and sense faculties. At those times such thoughts of desire don’t get the better of me. 
sn35.127:5.6	Excellent, Master Bhāradvāja! Excellent! 
sn35.127:5.7	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Bhāradvāja has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
sn35.127:5.8	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
sn35.127:5.9	From this day forth, may Master Bhāradvāja remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

sn35.132:1.1	At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying in the land of the Avantis in a wilderness hut near Makkarakaṭa. 
sn35.132:1.2	Then several youths, students of the brahmin Lohicca, approached Mahākaccāna’s wilderness hut while collecting firewood. They walked and wandered all around the hut, making a dreadful racket and all kinds of jeers: 
sn35.132:1.3	“These shavelings, fake ascetics, riffraff, black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman, the Lord! They’re honored, respected, esteemed, revered, and venerated by those who pretend to inherit Vedic culture.” 
sn35.132:1.4	And then Mahākaccāna left his dwelling and said to those brahmin students, 
sn35.132:1.5	“Students, stop being so noisy. 
sn35.132:1.6	I will speak to you on the teaching.” 
sn35.132:1.7	When this was said, the students fell silent. 
sn35.132:1.8	Then Mahākaccāna recited these verses for them. 
sn35.132:2.1	“The brahmins of old championed ethics, 
sn35.132:2.2	and remembered the ancient traditions. 
sn35.132:2.3	Their sense doors were guarded, well protected, 
sn35.132:2.4	and they had mastered anger. 
sn35.132:3.1	Those brahmins who remembered the ancient traditions 
sn35.132:3.2	enjoyed virtue and absorption. 
sn35.132:4.1	But these have lost their way. Claiming to recite, 
sn35.132:4.2	they live out of balance, judging everyone by their clan. 
sn35.132:4.3	Mastered by anger, they take up many arms, 
sn35.132:4.4	attacking both the strong and the weak. 
sn35.132:5.1	All is vain for someone who doesn’t guard the sense doors,

sn35.132:6.5	These emblems of the brahmins

sn35.132:8.1	Then those students, offended and upset, went to the brahmin Lohicca and said to him, 
sn35.132:8.2	“Please, master, you should know this. The ascetic Mahākaccāna condemns and rejects outright the hymns of the brahmins!” 
sn35.132:8.3	When they said this, Lohicca was offended and upset. 
sn35.132:8.4	Then he thought, 
sn35.132:8.5	“But it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to abuse or insult the ascetic Mahākaccāna solely because of what I’ve heard from these students. 
sn35.132:8.6	Why don’t I go and ask him about it?” 
sn35.132:9.1	Then the brahmin Lohicca together with those students went to Venerable Mahākaccāna and exchanged greetings with him.

sn35.132:12.3	“Brahmin, take someone who sees a sight with their eyes. If it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and their heart restricted. 
sn35.132:12.4	And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.

sn35.134:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near the Sakyan town named Devadaha. 
sn35.134:1.2	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
sn35.134:1.3	“When it comes to the six fields of contact, mendicants, I don’t say that all mendicants have work to do with diligence, nor do I say that none of them have work to do with diligence. 
sn35.134:1.4	I say that, when it comes to the six fields of contact, mendicants don’t have work to do with diligence if they are perfected, with defilements ended, having completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and become rightly freed through enlightenment. 
sn35.134:1.5	Why is that? 
sn35.134:1.6	They’ve done their work with diligence, and are incapable of negligence. 
sn35.134:1.7	I say that, when it comes to the six fields of contact, mendicants do have work to do with diligence if they are trainees, who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary. 
sn35.134:1.8	Why is that? 
sn35.134:1.9	There are sights known by the eye that are pleasant and also those that are unpleasant. 
sn35.134:1.10	Though experiencing them again and again they don’t occupy the mind. 
sn35.134:1.11	Their energy is roused up and unflagging, their mindfulness is established and lucid, their body is tranquil and undisturbed, and their mind is immersed in samādhi.

sn35.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
sn35.1:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
sn35.1:1.4	“Mendicants!”

sn35.239:1.2	What three? 
sn35.239:1.3	They guard the sense doors, eat in moderation, and are committed to wakefulness. 
sn35.239:2.1	And how does a mendicant guard the sense doors?

sn35.239:2.11	In the same way, a mendicant trains to protect, control, tame, and pacify these six senses.

sn35.239:3.4	It’s like a person who puts ointment on a wound only so that it can heal; or who oils an axle only so that it can carry a load. 
sn35.239:3.5	In the same way, a mendicant reflects properly on the food that they eat: 
sn35.239:3.6	‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’ 
sn35.239:3.7	That’s how a mendicant eats in moderation. 
sn35.239:4.1	And how is a mendicant committed to wakefulness? 
sn35.239:4.2	It’s when a mendicant practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind from obstacles. 
sn35.239:4.3	In the evening, they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation. 
sn35.239:4.4	In the middle of the night, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. 
sn35.239:4.5	In the last part of the night, they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying their mind from obstacles. 
sn35.239:4.6	This is how a mendicant is committed to wakefulness.

sn35.243:2.8	“The night is getting late, Gotamas. 
sn35.243:2.9	Please go at your convenience.” 
sn35.243:2.10	“Yes, sir,” replied the Sakyans. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving. 
sn35.243:3.1	And then, soon after the Sakyans had left, the Buddha addressed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, 
sn35.243:3.2	“Moggallāna, the Saṅgha of mendicants is rid of dullness and drowsiness. 
sn35.243:3.3	Give them some Dhamma talk as you feel inspired. 
sn35.243:3.4	My back is sore, 
sn35.243:3.5	I’ll stretch it.” 
sn35.243:3.6	“Yes, sir,” Mahāmoggallāna replied. 
sn35.243:3.7	And then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. 
sn35.243:3.8	There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants: 
sn35.243:3.9	“Reverends, mendicants!” 
sn35.243:3.10	“Reverend,” they replied. 
sn35.243:3.11	Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this: 
sn35.243:3.12	“I will teach you the explanation of the corrupt and the uncorrupted. 
sn35.243:3.13	Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
sn35.243:3.14	“Yes, reverend,” they replied. 
sn35.243:3.15	Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this: 
sn35.243:4.1	“And how is someone corrupt? 
sn35.243:4.2	Take a mendicant who sees a sight with the eye. If it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and their heart restricted. 
sn35.243:4.3	And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. 
sn35.243:4.4	They hear a sound … smell an odor … taste a flavor … feel a touch … 
sn35.243:4.5	know a thought with the mind. If it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and a limited heart. 
sn35.243:4.6	And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. 
sn35.243:4.7	This is called a mendicant who is corrupt when it comes to sights known by the eye, 
sn35.243:4.8	sounds … smells … tastes … touches … 
sn35.243:4.9	thoughts known by the mind. 
sn35.243:4.10	When a mendicant lives like this, if Māra comes at them through the eye he finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them. 
sn35.243:4.11	If Māra comes at them through the ear … nose … tongue … body … 
sn35.243:4.12	mind he finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them. 
sn35.243:5.1	Suppose there was a house made of reeds or straw that was dried up, withered, and decrepit. 
sn35.243:5.2	If a person came to it with a burning grass torch from the east,

sn35.243:5.7	above, 
sn35.243:5.8	or from anywhere, the fire would find a vulnerability, it would get a foothold. 
sn35.243:5.9	In the same way, when a mendicant lives like this, if Māra comes at them through the eye he finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them. 
sn35.243:5.10	If Māra comes at them through the ear … nose … tongue … body … 
sn35.243:5.11	mind he finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them.

sn35.243:5.15	tastes, 
sn35.243:5.16	touches, 
sn35.243:5.17	and thoughts, they don’t master these things. 
sn35.243:5.18	This is called a mendicant who has been mastered by sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts. They’re mastered, not a master. Bad, unskillful qualities have mastered them, which are defiled, leading to future lives, hurtful, and resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death. 
sn35.243:5.19	That’s how someone is corrupt. 
sn35.243:6.1	And how is someone uncorrupted? 
sn35.243:6.2	Take a mendicant who sees a sight with the eye. If it’s pleasant they don’t hold on to it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart. 
sn35.243:6.3	And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. 
sn35.243:6.4	They hear a sound … smell an odor … taste a flavor … feel a touch … 
sn35.243:6.5	know a thought with the mind. If it’s pleasant they don’t hold on to it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart. 
sn35.243:6.6	And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. 
sn35.243:6.7	This is called a mendicant who is uncorrupted when it comes to sights known by the eye, 
sn35.243:6.8	sounds … smells … tastes … touches … thoughts known by the mind. 
sn35.243:6.9	When a mendicant lives like this, if Māra comes at them through the eye he doesn’t find a vulnerability or get hold of them. 
sn35.243:6.10	If Māra comes at them through the ear … nose … tongue … body … 
sn35.243:6.11	mind he doesn’t find a vulnerability or get hold of them. 
sn35.243:7.1	Suppose there was a bungalow or hall made of thick clay with its plaster still wet. 
sn35.243:7.2	If a person came to it with a burning grass torch from the east,

sn35.243:7.18	That’s how someone is uncorrupted.” 
sn35.243:8.1	Then the Buddha got up and said to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna: 
sn35.243:8.2	“Good, good, Moggallāna! 
sn35.243:8.3	It’s good that you’ve taught this explanation of the corrupt and the uncorrupted.” 
sn35.243:9.1	This is what Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said, 
sn35.243:9.2	and the teacher approved. 
sn35.243:9.3	Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what Mahāmoggallāna said.

sn35.244:1.1	“Mendicants, when a mendicant truly understands the origin and ending of all things that entail suffering, 
sn35.244:1.2	then they’ve seen sensual pleasures in such a way that they have no underlying tendency for desire, affection, infatuation, and passion for sensual pleasures. 
sn35.244:1.3	And they’ve awakened to a way of conduct and a way of living such that, when they live in that way, bad, unskillful qualities of desire and grief don’t overwhelm them. 
sn35.244:2.1	And how does a mendicant truly understand the origin and ending of all things that entail suffering? 
sn35.244:2.2	‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. 
sn35.244:2.3	Such is feeling … 
sn35.244:2.4	perception … 
sn35.244:2.5	choices … 
sn35.244:2.6	consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ 
sn35.244:2.7	That’s how a mendicant truly understands the origin and ending of all things that entail suffering. 
sn35.244:3.1	And how has a mendicant seen sensual pleasures in such a way that they have no underlying tendency for desire, affection, infatuation, and passion for sensual pleasures? 
sn35.244:3.2	Suppose there was a pit of glowing coals deeper than a man’s height, filled with glowing coals that neither flamed nor smoked. Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain. Then two strong men grab would grab each arm and drag them towards the pit of glowing coals. They’d writhe and struggle to and fro. 
sn35.244:3.3	Why is that? 
sn35.244:3.4	For that person knows, ‘If I fall in that pit of glowing coals, that will result in my death or deadly pain.’ 
sn35.244:3.5	In the same way, when a mendicant has seen sensual pleasures as like a pit of glowing coals, they have no underlying tendency for desire, affection, infatuation, and passion for sensual pleasures. 
sn35.244:4.1	And how has a mendicant awakened to a way of conduct and a way of living such that, when they live in that way, bad, unskillful qualities of desire and grief don’t overwhelm them? 
sn35.244:4.2	Suppose a person was to enter a thicket full of thorns. They’d have thorns in front and behind, to the left and right, below and above. So they’d go forward mindfully and come back mindfully, thinking, ‘May I not get any thorns!’ 
sn35.244:4.3	In the same way, whatever in the world seems nice and pleasant is called a thorn in the training of the Noble One. 
sn35.244:4.4	When they understand what a thorn is, they should understand restraint and lack of restraint. 
sn35.244:5.1	And how is someone unrestrained? 
sn35.244:5.2	Take a mendicant who sees a sight with the eye. If it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and their heart restricted. 
sn35.244:5.3	And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. 
sn35.244:5.4	They hear a sound … smell an odor … taste a flavor … feel a touch … 
sn35.244:5.5	know a thought with the mind. If it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and a limited heart. 
sn35.244:5.6	And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. 
sn35.244:5.7	This is how someone is unrestrained. 
sn35.244:6.1	And how is someone restrained? 
sn35.244:6.2	Take a mendicant who sees a sight with the eye. If it’s pleasant they don’t hold on to it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart. 
sn35.244:6.3	And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. 
sn35.244:6.4	They hear a sound … smell an odor … taste a flavor … feel a touch …

sn35.244:6.6	And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. 
sn35.244:6.7	This is how someone is restrained. 
sn35.244:7.1	Though that mendicant conducts themselves and lives in this way, every so often they might lose mindfulness, and bad, unskillful memories and thoughts prone to fetters arise. If this happens, their mindfulness is slow to come up, but they quickly give them up, get rid of, eliminate, and obliterate those thoughts. 
sn35.244:8.1	Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day, and a person let two or three drops of water fall onto it. The drops would be slow to fall, but they’d quickly dry up and evaporate. 
sn35.244:8.2	In the same way, though that mendicant conducts themselves and lives in this way, every so often they might lose mindfulness, and bad, unskillful memories and thoughts prone to fetters arise. If this happens, their mindfulness is slow to come up, but they quickly give them up, get rid of, eliminate, and obliterate those thoughts. 
sn35.244:8.3	This is how a mendicant has awakened to a way of conduct and a way of living such that, when they live in that way, bad, unskillful qualities of desire and grief don’t overwhelm them. 
sn35.244:8.4	While that mendicant conducts themselves in this way and lives in this way, it may be that rulers or their ministers, friends or colleagues, relatives or family would invite them to accept wealth, saying, 
sn35.244:8.5	‘Please, mister, why let these ocher robes torment you? 
sn35.244:8.6	Why follow the practice of shaving your head and carrying an alms bowl?
sn35.244:8.7	Come, return to a lesser life, enjoy wealth, and make merit!’ 
sn35.244:8.8	But it’s simply impossible for a mendicant who conducts themselves in this way and lives in this way to resign the training and return to a lesser life. 
sn35.244:9.1	Suppose that, although the Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east, a large crowd were to come along with a spade and basket, saying: ‘We’ll make this Ganges river slant, slope, and incline to the west!’ 
sn35.244:9.2	What do you think, mendicants? 
sn35.244:9.3	Would they still succeed?” 
sn35.244:9.4	“No, sir. 
sn35.244:9.5	Why is that? 
sn35.244:9.6	The Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east. 
sn35.244:9.7	It’s not easy to make it slant, slope, and incline to the west. 
sn35.244:9.8	That large crowd will eventually get weary and frustrated.” 
sn35.244:9.9	“In the same way, while that mendicant conducts themselves in this way and lives in this way, it may be that rulers or their ministers, friends or colleagues, relatives or family should invite them to accept wealth, saying,

sn35.244:9.14	Why is that? 
sn35.244:9.15	Because for a long time that mendicant’s mind has slanted, sloped, and inclined to seclusion. So it’s impossible for them to return to a lesser life.”

sn35.246:4.5	They’d say to him, 
sn35.246:4.6	‘That, sir, is an arched harp.’ 
sn35.246:4.7	He’d say, 
sn35.246:4.8	‘Go, my man, fetch me that arched harp.’ 
sn35.246:4.9	So they’d fetch it 
sn35.246:4.10	and say, 
sn35.246:4.11	‘This, sir, is that arched harp.’ 
sn35.246:4.12	He’d say, 
sn35.246:4.13	‘I’ve had enough of that arched harp! Just fetch me the sound.’ 
sn35.246:4.14	They’d say, 
sn35.246:4.15	‘Sir, this arched harp is made of many components assembled together, 
sn35.246:4.16	which make a sound when they’re played. That is, 
sn35.246:4.17	it depends on the body, the skin, the neck, the head, the strings, the plectrum, and a person to play it properly. That’s how an arched harp is made of many components assembled together, 
sn35.246:4.18	which make a sound when they’re played.’ 
sn35.246:4.19	But he’d split that harp into ten pieces or a hundred pieces, then splinter it up. 
sn35.246:4.20	He’d burn the splinters with fire, and reduce them to ashes. 
sn35.246:4.21	Then he’d sweep away the ashes in a strong wind, or float them away down a swift stream. 
sn35.246:4.22	Then he’d say, 
sn35.246:4.23	‘It seems that there’s nothing to this thing called an arched harp or whatever’s called an arched harp! But people waste their time with it, negligent and heedless!’ 
sn35.246:4.24	In the same way, a mendicant searches for form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness anywhere they might be reborn. 
sn35.246:4.25	As they search in this way, 
sn35.246:4.26	 
sn35.246:4.27

sn35.247:0.3	247. The Simile of Six Animals 
sn35.247:1.1	“Mendicants, suppose a person with wounded and festering limbs was to enter a thicket of thorny reeds. 
sn35.247:1.2	The kusa thorns would pierce their feet, and the reed leaves would scratch their limbs. 
sn35.247:1.3	And that would cause that person to experience even more pain and distress. 
sn35.247:1.4	In the same way, some mendicant goes to a village or a wilderness and gets scolded, 
sn35.247:1.5	‘This venerable, acting like this, behaving like this, is a filthy village thorn.’ 
sn35.247:1.6	Understanding that they’re a thorn, they should understand restraint and lack of restraint. 
sn35.247:2.1	And how is someone unrestrained? 
sn35.247:2.2	Take a mendicant who sees a sight with their eyes. If it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and their heart restricted. 
sn35.247:2.3	And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. 
sn35.247:2.4	When they hear a sound with their ears … 
sn35.247:2.5	When they smell an odor with their nose … 
sn35.247:2.6	When they taste a flavor with their tongue … 
sn35.247:2.7	When they feel a touch with their body … 
sn35.247:2.8	When they know a thought with their mind, if it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and a limited heart. 
sn35.247:2.9	And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. 
sn35.247:3.1	Suppose a person was to catch six animals, with diverse territories and feeding grounds, and tie them up with a strong rope. 
sn35.247:3.2	They’d catch a snake, 
sn35.247:3.3	a crocodile, 
sn35.247:3.4	a bird, 
sn35.247:3.5	a dog, 
sn35.247:3.6	a jackal, 
sn35.247:3.7	and a monkey, 
sn35.247:3.8	tie each up with a strong rope, then tie a knot in the middle and let them loose. 
sn35.247:3.9	Then those six animals with diverse domains and territories would each pull towards their own domain and territory. 
sn35.247:3.10	The snake would pull one way, thinking ‘I’m going into an anthill!’ The crocodile would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the water!’ The bird would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m flying into the sky!’ The dog would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the village!’ The jackal would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the charnel ground!’ The monkey would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the jungle!’ 
sn35.247:3.11	When those six animals became exhausted and worn out, the strongest of them would get their way, and they’d all have to submit to their control. 
sn35.247:3.12	In the same way, when a mendicant has not developed or cultivated mindfulness of the body, their eye pulls towards pleasant sights, but is put off by unpleasant sights. Their ear … nose … tongue … body … 
sn35.247:3.13	mind pulls towards pleasant thoughts, but is put off by unpleasant thoughts. 
sn35.247:3.14	This is how someone is unrestrained. 
sn35.247:4.1	And how is someone restrained? 
sn35.247:4.2	Take a mendicant who sees a sight with their eyes. If it’s pleasant they don’t hold on to it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart. 
sn35.247:4.3	And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. 
sn35.247:4.4	They hear a sound … smell an odor … taste a flavor … feel a touch … 
sn35.247:4.5	know a thought with their mind. If it’s pleasant they don’t hold on to it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart. 
sn35.247:4.6	And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. 
sn35.247:5.1	Suppose a person was to catch six animals, with diverse territories and feeding grounds, and tie them up with a strong rope. 
sn35.247:5.2	They’d catch a snake, 
sn35.247:5.3	a crocodile, 
sn35.247:5.4	a bird, 
sn35.247:5.5	a dog, 
sn35.247:5.6	a jackal, 
sn35.247:5.7	and a monkey, 
sn35.247:5.8	tie each up with a strong rope, then tether them to a strong post or pillar. 
sn35.247:5.9	Then those six animals with diverse domains and territories would each pull towards their own domain and territory. 
sn35.247:5.10	The snake would pull one way, thinking ‘I’m going into an anthill!’ The crocodile would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the water!’ The bird would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m flying into the sky!’ The dog would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the village!’ The jackal would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the charnel ground!’ The monkey would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the jungle!’ 
sn35.247:5.11	When those six animals became exhausted and worn out, they’d stand or sit or lie down right by that post or pillar. 
sn35.247:5.12	In the same way, when a mendicant has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body, their eye doesn’t pull towards pleasant sights, and isn’t put off by unpleasant sights. Their ear … nose … tongue … body … 
sn35.247:5.13	mind doesn’t pull towards pleasant thoughts, and isn’t put off by unpleasant thoughts. 
sn35.247:5.14	This is how someone is restrained. 
sn35.247:6.1	‘A strong post or pillar’ is a term for mindfulness of the body. 
sn35.247:6.2	So you should train like this: 
sn35.247:6.3	‘We will develop mindfulness of the body. We’ll cultivate it, make it our vehicle and our basis, keep it up, consolidate it, and properly implement it.’

sn35.248:1.1	“Mendicants, suppose a sheaf of barley was placed at a crossroads. 
sn35.248:1.2	Then six people would come along carrying flails, 
sn35.248:1.3	and started threshing the sheaf of barley. 
sn35.248:1.4	So that sheaf of barley would be thoroughly threshed by those six flails. 
sn35.248:1.5	Then a seventh person would come along carrying a flail, 
sn35.248:1.6	and they’d give the sheaf of barley a seventh threshing. 
sn35.248:1.7	So that sheaf of barley would be even more thoroughly threshed by that seventh flail. 
sn35.248:1.8	In the same way, an uneducated ordinary person is struck in the eye by both pleasant and unpleasant sights. 
sn35.248:1.9	They’re struck in the ear … nose … tongue … body … 
sn35.248:1.10	mind by both pleasant and unpleasant thoughts. 
sn35.248:1.11	And if that uneducated ordinary person has intentions regarding rebirth into a new state of existence in the future, that foolish person is even more thoroughly struck, like that sheaf of barley threshed by the seventh person. 
sn35.248:2.1	Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons. 
sn35.248:2.2	Then Vepacitti, lord of demons, addressed the demons, 
sn35.248:2.3	‘My good sirs, if the demons defeat the gods in this battle, bind Sakka, the lord of gods, by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the castle of demons.’ 
sn35.248:2.4	Meanwhile, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three, 
sn35.248:2.5	‘My good sirs, if the gods defeat the demons in this battle, bind Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the Sudhamma hall of the gods.’ 
sn35.248:2.6	In that battle the gods won and the demons lost. 
sn35.248:2.7	So the gods of the Thirty-Three bound Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and brought him to Sakka’s presence in the Sudhamma hall of the gods. 
sn35.248:2.8	And there Vepacitti remained bound by his limbs and neck. 
sn35.248:2.9	That is, until he thought, 
sn35.248:2.10	‘It’s the gods who are principled, while the demons are unprincipled. Now I belong right here in the castle of the gods.’ 
sn35.248:2.11	Then he found himself freed from the bonds on his limbs and neck. He entertained himself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation. 
sn35.248:2.12	But when he thought, 
sn35.248:2.13	‘It’s the demons who are principled, while the gods are unprincipled. Now I will go over there to the castle of the demons,’ 
sn35.248:2.14	he found himself bound by his limbs and neck, and the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation disappeared. 
sn35.248:2.15	That’s how subtly Vepacitti was bound. 
sn35.248:2.16	But the bonds of Māra are even more subtle than that. 
sn35.248:2.17	When you identify, you’re bound by Māra. Not identifying, you’re free from the Wicked One. 
sn35.248:3.1	These are all forms of identifying: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’ 
sn35.248:3.2	Conceit is a disease, a boil, a dart. 
sn35.248:3.3	So mendicants, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We will live with a heart that does not identify.’ 
sn35.248:3.4	 
sn35.248:4.1	These are all disturbances: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’ 
sn35.248:4.2	Disturbances are a disease, a boil, a dart.

sn35.248:5.2	Trembling is a disease, a boil, a dart.

sn35.87:1.6	“Yes, reverend,” replied Mahācunda.

sn35.87:7.1	“Reverend Channa, do you regard the eye, eye consciousness, and things knowable by eye consciousness in this way: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’? 
sn35.87:7.2	Do you regard the ear … nose … tongue … body …

sn35.87:11.3	‘For the dependent there is agitation. For the independent there’s no agitation. 
sn35.87:11.4	When there’s no agitation there is tranquility. 
sn35.87:11.5	When there’s tranquility there’s no inclination.

sn35.87:12.2	Not long after those venerables had left, Venerable Channa slit his wrists.

sn35.87:13.3	Where has he been reborn in his next life?” 
sn35.87:13.4	“Sāriputta, didn’t the mendicant Channa declare his blamelessness to you personally?” 
sn35.87:13.5	“Sir, there is a Vajjian village named Pubbavijjhana 
sn35.87:13.6	where Channa had families with whom he was friendly, intimate, and familiar.” 
sn35.87:13.7	“The mendicant Channa did indeed have such families, Sāriputta. 
sn35.87:13.8	But this is not enough for me to call someone ‘blameworthy’. 
sn35.87:13.9	When someone lays down this body and takes up another body, I call them ‘blameworthy’. 
sn35.87:13.10	But the mendicant Channa did no such thing.

sn35.89:16.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”

sn36.23:2.2	pleasant, painful, and neutral. 
sn36.23:2.3	These are called feeling. 
sn36.23:2.4	Feeling originates from contact. 
sn36.23:2.5	Craving is the practice that leads to the origin of feeling. 
sn36.23:2.6	When contact ceases, feeling ceases. 
sn36.23:2.7	The practice that leads to the cessation of feelings is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: 
sn36.23:2.8	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 
sn36.23:2.9	The pleasure and happiness that arise from feeling: this is its gratification. 
sn36.23:2.10	That feeling is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback. 
sn36.23:2.11	Removing and giving up desire and greed for feeling: this is its escape.”

sn36.3:1.1	“Mendicants, there are these three feelings. 
sn36.3:1.2	What three? 
sn36.3:1.3	Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling. 
sn36.3:1.4	The underlying tendency to greed should be given up when it comes to pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency to repulsion should be given up when it comes to painful feeling. The underlying tendency to ignorance should be given up when it comes to neutral feeling. 
sn36.3:1.5	When a mendicant has given up these underlying tendencies, they’re called a mendicant without underlying tendencies, who sees rightly, has cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of suffering. 
sn36.3:2.1	When you feel pleasure 
sn36.3:2.2	without understanding feeling, 
sn36.3:2.3	the underlying tendency to greed is there, 
sn36.3:2.4	if you don’t see the escape. 
sn36.3:3.1	When you feel pain 
sn36.3:3.2	without understanding feeling, 
sn36.3:3.3	the underlying tendency to repulsion is there,

sn36.3:4.3	that if you relish it, 
sn36.3:4.4	you’re still not released from suffering.

sn36.3:5.2	not neglecting situational awareness,

sn36.4:1.3	they’re speaking of something that doesn’t exist. 
sn36.4:1.4

sn36.6:1.6	They experience two feelings: 
sn36.6:1.7	physical and mental. 
sn36.6:1.8	It’s like a person who is struck with an arrow, 
sn36.6:1.9	only to be struck with a second arrow.

sn36.6:1.11	In the same way, when an uneducated ordinary person experiences painful physical feelings they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. 
sn36.6:1.12	They experience two feelings: 
sn36.6:1.13	physical and mental. 
sn36.6:1.14	When they’re touched by painful feeling, they resist it. 
sn36.6:1.15	The underlying tendency for repulsion towards painful feeling underlies that. 
sn36.6:1.16	When touched by painful feeling they look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures. 
sn36.6:1.17	Why is that? 
sn36.6:1.18	Because an uneducated ordinary person doesn’t understand any escape from painful feeling apart from sensual pleasures. 
sn36.6:1.19	Since they look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures, the underlying tendency to greed for pleasant feeling underlies that. 
sn36.6:1.20	They don’t truly understand feelings’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape. 
sn36.6:1.21	The underlying tendency to ignorance about neutral feeling underlies that. 
sn36.6:1.22	If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it attached. 
sn36.6:1.23	If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it attached. 
sn36.6:1.24	If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it attached. 
sn36.6:1.25	They’re called an uneducated ordinary person who is attached to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress, I say. 
sn36.6:2.1	When an educated noble disciple experiences painful physical feelings they don’t sorrow or wail or lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. 
sn36.6:2.2	They experience one feeling: 
sn36.6:2.3	physical, not mental. 
sn36.6:3.1	It’s like a person who is struck with an arrow, 
sn36.6:3.2	but was not struck with a second arrow. 
sn36.6:3.3	That person would experience the feeling of one arrow. 
sn36.6:3.4	In the same way, when an educated noble disciple experiences painful physical feelings they don’t sorrow or wail or lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. 
sn36.6:3.5	They experience one feeling: 
sn36.6:3.6	physical, not mental. 
sn36.6:3.7	When they’re touched by painful feeling, they don’t resist it. 
sn36.6:3.8	There’s no underlying tendency for repulsion towards painful feeling underlying that. 
sn36.6:3.9	When touched by painful feeling they don’t look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures. 
sn36.6:3.10	Why is that? 
sn36.6:3.11	Because an educated noble disciple understands an escape from painful feeling apart from sensual pleasures. 
sn36.6:3.12	Since they don’t look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures, there’s no underlying tendency to greed for pleasant feeling underlying that. 
sn36.6:3.13	They truly understand feelings’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape. 
sn36.6:3.14	There’s no underlying tendency to ignorance about neutral feeling underlying that. 
sn36.6:3.15	If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it detached. 
sn36.6:3.16	If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it detached. 
sn36.6:3.17	If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached. 
sn36.6:3.18	They’re called an educated noble disciple who is detached from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress, I say. 
sn36.6:3.19	This is the difference between an educated noble disciple and an uneducated ordinary person. 
sn36.6:4.1	A wise and learned person isn’t affected 
sn36.6:4.2	by feelings of pleasure and pain. 
sn36.6:4.3	This is the great difference in skill

sn36.7:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.

sn36.7:3.6	That’s how a mendicant is mindful. 
sn36.7:4.1	And how is a mendicant aware? 
sn36.7:4.2	It’s when a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent. 
sn36.7:4.3	That’s how a mendicant acts with situational awareness. 
sn36.7:4.4	A mendicant should await their time mindful and aware. 
sn36.7:4.5	This is my instruction to you.

sn36.7:5.8	They meditate observing impermanence, vanishing, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in the body and pleasant feeling. 
sn36.7:5.9	As they do so, they give up the underlying tendency for greed for the body and pleasant feeling.

sn36.7:7.9	As they do so, they give up the underlying tendency for ignorance towards the body and neutral feeling. 
sn36.7:8.1	If they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it.

sn39.1-15:2.2	What is extinguishment?” 
sn39.1-15:2.3	“Reverend, the ending of greed, hate, and delusion

sn4.10:1.3	There the Buddha … said: 
sn4.10:2.1	“Mendicants, the life span of humans is short. 
sn4.10:2.2	You must go to the next life. So you should do what is skillful, you should practice the spiritual life. 
sn4.10:2.3	No-one born is immortal.

sn4.13:1.4	The Buddha was stricken by harrowing pains; physical feelings that were painful, sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, and disagreeable. 
sn4.13:1.5	But he endured unperturbed, with mindfulness and situational awareness. 
sn4.13:1.6	And then he spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware. 
sn4.13:1.7	Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse:

sn4.16:1.3	And those mendicants were paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear.

sn4.21:1.7	Don’t give up what is visible in the present to chase after what takes effect over time.” 
sn4.21:1.8	“Brahmin, that’s not what we’re doing. 
sn4.21:1.9	We’re giving up what takes effect over time to chase after what is visible in the present. 
sn4.21:1.10	For the Buddha says that sensual pleasures take effect over time; they give much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks. 
sn4.21:1.11	But this teaching is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.” 
sn4.21:1.12	When they had spoken, Māra the Wicked shook his head, waggled his tongue, raised his eyebrows until his brow puckered in three furrows, and departed leaning on his staff. 
sn4.21:2.1	Then those senior mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said,

sn4.21:3.1	“Mendicants, that was no brahmin. 
sn4.21:3.2	That was Māra the Wicked who came to pull the wool over your eyes!” 
sn4.21:3.3	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha recited this verse: 
sn4.21:4.1	“When a person has seen where suffering comes from 
sn4.21:4.2	how could they incline towards sensual pleasures? 
sn4.21:4.3	Realizing that attachment is a snare in the world, 
sn4.21:4.4	a person would train to remove it.”

sn4.22:0.3	22. With Samiddhi 
sn4.22:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Silāvatī. 
sn4.22:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Samiddhi was meditating not far from the Buddha, diligent, keen, and resolute. 
sn4.22:1.3	Then as Venerable Samiddhi was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, 
sn4.22:1.4	“I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate, 
sn4.22:1.5	to have a teacher who is a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha! 
sn4.22:1.6	I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate, 
sn4.22:1.7	to have gone forth in a teaching and training so well explained! 
sn4.22:1.8	I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate, 
sn4.22:1.9	to have spiritual companions who are ethical and of good character.” 
sn4.22:1.10	And then Māra the Wicked, knowing what Samiddhi was thinking, went up to him and made a terrifyingly loud noise close by him. It seemed as if the earth was shattering. 
sn4.22:2.1	Then Samiddhi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said, 
sn4.22:2.2	 
sn4.22:2.3	 
sn4.22:2.4	 
sn4.22:2.5	 
sn4.22:2.6

sn4.22:3.1	“Samiddhi, that’s not the earth shattering. 
sn4.22:3.2	That’s Māra the Wicked come to pull the wool over your eyes! 
sn4.22:3.3	Go back to that same place, Samiddhi, and meditate, diligent, keen, and resolute.” 
sn4.22:3.4	“Yes, sir,” replied Samiddhi. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 
sn4.22:3.5	And for a second time Samiddhi was meditating in that same place, diligent, ardent, and resolute. 
sn4.22:3.6	And for a second time he had the same thought … 
sn4.22:3.7	and Māra made an earth-shattering noise. 
sn4.22:3.8	 
sn4.22:3.9	Then Samiddhi addressed Māra the Wicked One in verse: 
sn4.22:4.1	“I went forth out of faith 
sn4.22:4.2	from the lay life to homelessness. 
sn4.22:4.3	My mindfulness and wisdom are mature, 
sn4.22:4.4	my mind is serene in immersion. 
sn4.22:4.5	Make whatever illusions you want, 
sn4.22:4.6	it won’t bother me.” 
sn4.22:5.1	Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The mendicant Samiddhi knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there.

sn4.23:0.3	23. With Godhika 
sn4.23:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn4.23:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
sn4.23:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Godhika was staying on the slopes of Isigili at the Black Rock. 
sn4.23:1.4	Then Venerable Godhika, meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, experienced temporary freedom of heart. 
sn4.23:1.5	But then he fell away from that temporary freedom of heart. 
sn4.23:1.6	For a second … 
sn4.23:1.7	 
sn4.23:1.8	third … 
sn4.23:1.9

sn4.23:1.13	 
sn4.23:1.14	sixth time Godhika experienced temporary freedom of heart. 
sn4.23:1.15	But for a sixth time he fell away from it. 
sn4.23:1.16	For a seventh time Godhika, meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, experienced temporary freedom of heart. 
sn4.23:2.1	Then he thought, 
sn4.23:2.2	“I’ve fallen away from this temporary freedom of heart no less than six times. 
sn4.23:2.3	Why don’t I slit my wrists?” 
sn4.23:2.4	And then Māra the Wicked, knowing what Godhika was thinking, went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
sn4.23:3.1	“O great hero, O greatly wise! 
sn4.23:3.2	Shining with power and glory. 
sn4.23:3.3	You’ve gone beyond all threats and perils, 
sn4.23:3.4	I bow to your feet, O seer! 
sn4.23:4.1	Great hero, master of death, 
sn4.23:4.2	your disciple longs for death, 
sn4.23:4.3	he’s planning for it. 
sn4.23:4.4	Stop him, O light-bringer! 
sn4.23:5.1	For how, Blessed One, can a disciple of yours, 
sn4.23:5.2	one who loves your teaching, 
sn4.23:5.3	a trainee who hasn’t achieved their heart’s desire, 
sn4.23:5.4	take his own life, O renowned one?” 
sn4.23:6.1	Now at that time Venerable Godhika had already slit his wrists. 
sn4.23:6.2	Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, addressed him in verse: 
sn4.23:7.1	“This is how the wise act, 
sn4.23:7.2	for they don’t long for life. 
sn4.23:7.3	Having plucked out craving, root and all, 
sn4.23:7.4	Godhika is extinguished.” 
sn4.23:8.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, 
sn4.23:8.2	“Come, mendicants, let’s go to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili where Godhika, who came from a good family, slit his wrists.” 
sn4.23:8.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied. 
sn4.23:9.1	Then the Buddha together with several mendicants went to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili. 
sn4.23:9.2	The Buddha saw Godhika off in the distance lying on his cot, having cast off the aggregates. 
sn4.23:9.3	Now at that time a cloud of black smoke was moving east, west, north, south, above, below, and in-between. 
sn4.23:10.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, 
sn4.23:10.2	“Mendicants, do you see that cloud of black smoke moving east, west, north, south, above, below, and in-between?” 
sn4.23:10.3	“Yes, sir.” 
sn4.23:10.4	“That’s Māra the Wicked searching for Godhika’s consciousness, wondering: 
sn4.23:10.5	‘Where is Godhika’s consciousness established?’ 
sn4.23:10.6	But since his consciousness is not established, Godhika is extinguished.” 
sn4.23:10.7	Then Māra, carrying his harp of yellow wood apple, went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
sn4.23:11.1	“Above, below, all round, 
sn4.23:11.2	in the four quarters and in-between, 
sn4.23:11.3	I’ve been searching without success: 
sn4.23:11.4	where has that Godhika got to?” 
sn4.23:12.1	“He was a wise and steadfast sage, 
sn4.23:12.2	a meditator who loved absorption. 
sn4.23:12.3	By day and by night he applied himself, 
sn4.23:12.4	without concern for his life. 
sn4.23:13.1	He defeated the army of death, 
sn4.23:13.2	and won’t return for any future life. 
sn4.23:13.3	Having plucked out craving, root and all 
sn4.23:13.4	Godhika is extinguished.” 
sn4.23:14.1	So stricken with sorrow
sn4.23:14.2	that his harp dropped from his armpit, 
sn4.23:14.3	that spirit, downcast, 
sn4.23:14.4	vanished right there.

sn4.24:0.2	3. Māra 
sn4.24:0.3	24. Seven Years of Following 
sn4.24:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn4.24:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. 
sn4.24:1.3	Now at that time Māra the Wicked had been following the Buddha for seven years hoping to find a vulnerability without success. 
sn4.24:1.4	Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
sn4.24:2.1	“Are you swamped by sorrow that you meditate in the forest? 
sn4.24:2.2	Have you lost a fortune, or do you long for one? 
sn4.24:2.3	Or perhaps you’ve committed some crime in the village? 
sn4.24:2.4	Why don’t you get too close to people? 
sn4.24:2.5	And why does no-one get close to you?” 
sn4.24:3.1	“I’ve dug out the root of sorrow completely. 
sn4.24:3.2	I practice absorption free of guilt or sorrow. 
sn4.24:3.3	I’ve cut off all greed and prayer for future lives. 
sn4.24:3.4	Undefiled, I practice absorption, O kinsman of the negligent!” 
sn4.24:4.1	“The things they call ‘mine’, 
sn4.24:4.2	and those who say ‘it’s mine’: 
sn4.24:4.3	if your mind remains there, 
sn4.24:4.4	you won’t escape me, ascetic!” 
sn4.24:5.1	“The things they speak of aren’t mine; 
sn4.24:5.2	I’m not someone who speaks like that. 
sn4.24:5.3	So know this, Wicked One: 
sn4.24:5.4	you won’t even see the path I take.” 
sn4.24:6.1	“If you’ve discovered the path 
sn4.24:6.2	that’s safe, and leads to the deathless, 
sn4.24:6.3	go and walk that path alone—
sn4.24:6.4	why teach it to anyone else?” 
sn4.24:7.1	“Those crossing to the far shore 
sn4.24:7.2	ask what’s beyond the domain of Death. 
sn4.24:7.3	When I’m asked, I explain to them 
sn4.24:7.4	the truth without attachments.” 
sn4.24:8.1	“Sir, suppose there was a lotus pond not far from a town or village, 
sn4.24:8.2	and a crab lived there. 
sn4.24:8.3	Then several boys or girls would leave the town or village and go to the pond, where they’d pull out the crab and put it on dry land. 
sn4.24:8.4	Whenever that crab extended a claw, those boys or girls would snap, crack, and break it off with a stick or a stone. 
sn4.24:8.5	And when that crab’s claws had all been snapped, cracked, and broken off it wouldn’t be able to return down into that lotus pond. 
sn4.24:8.6	In the same way, sir, the Buddha has snapped, cracked, and broken off all my tricks, dodges, and evasions. 
sn4.24:8.7	Now I’m not able to approach the Buddha again in hopes of finding a vulnerability.” 
sn4.24:8.8	Then Māra the Wicked recited these verses of disappointment in the Buddha’s presence: 
sn4.24:9.1	“A crow once circled a stone 
sn4.24:9.2	that looked like a lump of fat. 
sn4.24:9.3	‘Perhaps I’ll find something tender,’ it thought, 
sn4.24:9.4	‘perhaps there’s something tasty.’ 
sn4.24:10.1	But finding nothing tasty, 
sn4.24:10.2	the crow left that place. 
sn4.24:10.3	Like the crow that pecked the stone, 
sn4.24:10.4	I leave Gotama disappointed.”

sn4.25:0.2	3. Māra 
sn4.25:0.3	25. Māra’s Daughters 
sn4.25:1.1	And then Māra the Wicked, after reciting these verses of disillusionment in the Buddha’s presence, left that place. He sat cross-legged on the ground not far from the Buddha, silent, embarrassed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say, scratching the ground with a stick. 
sn4.25:1.2	Then Māra’s daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to Māra the Wicked, and addressed him in verse: 
sn4.25:2.1	“Why so downhearted, dad? 
sn4.25:2.2	What man are you upset about? 
sn4.25:2.3	We’ll catch him with the snare of lust, 
sn4.25:2.4	like an elephant in the wild. 
sn4.25:2.5	We’ll tie him up and bring him back—
sn4.25:2.6	he’ll fall under your sway!” 
sn4.25:3.1	“In this world he is the perfected one, the Holy One. 
sn4.25:3.2	He’s not easily seduced by lust. 
sn4.25:3.3	He has slipped free of Māra’s sway; 
sn4.25:3.4	that’s why I’m so upset.” 
sn4.25:4.1	Then Māra’s daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to the Buddha, and said to him, 
sn4.25:4.2	“We serve at your feet, ascetic.” 
sn4.25:4.3	But the Buddha ignored them, since he was freed with the supreme ending of attachments. 
sn4.25:5.1	Then Craving, Delight, and Lust withdrew to one side to think up a plan. 
sn4.25:5.2	“Men have a diverse spectrum of tastes. 
sn4.25:5.3	Why don’t we each manifest in the form of a hundred young maidens?” 
sn4.25:5.4	So that’s what they did. Then they went up to the Buddha and said to him, 
sn4.25:5.5	“We serve at your feet, ascetic.” 
sn4.25:5.6	But the Buddha still ignored them, since he was freed with the supreme ending of attachments. 
sn4.25:6.1	Then Craving, Delight, and Lust withdrew to one side to think up a plan. 
sn4.25:6.2	“Men have a diverse spectrum of tastes. 
sn4.25:6.3	Why don’t we each manifest in the form of a hundred women who have never given birth?” 
sn4.25:6.4	So that’s what they did. Then they went up to the Buddha and said to him, 
sn4.25:6.5	“We serve at your feet, ascetic.” 
sn4.25:6.6	But the Buddha still ignored them, since he was freed with the supreme ending of attachments. 
sn4.25:7.1	Then Craving, Delight, and Lust … 
sn4.25:7.2	 
sn4.25:7.3	 
sn4.25:7.4	each manifested in the form of a hundred women who have given birth once …

sn4.25:9.5	But the Buddha still ignored them, since he was freed with the supreme ending of attachments. 
sn4.25:9.6	Then Craving, Delight, and Lust withdrew to one side and said, 
sn4.25:9.7	“What our father said is true: 
sn4.25:10.1	‘In this world he is the perfected one, the Holy One. 
sn4.25:10.2	He’s not easily seduced by lust. 
sn4.25:10.3	He has slipped free of Māra’s sway; 
sn4.25:10.4	that’s why I’m so upset.’ 
sn4.25:11.1	For if we had come on to any ascetic or brahmin like this who was not free of lust, his heart would explode, or he’d spew hot blood from his mouth, or he’d go mad and lose his mind. 
sn4.25:11.2	He’d dry up, wither away, and shrivel up like a green reed that was mowed down.” 
sn4.25:11.3	 
sn4.25:12.1	Then Māra’s daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to the Buddha, and stood to one side. 
sn4.25:12.2	Māra’s daughter Craving addressed the Buddha in verse: 
sn4.25:13.1	“Are you swamped by sorrow that you meditate in the forest? 
sn4.25:13.2	Have you lost a fortune, or do you long for one? 
sn4.25:13.3	Or perhaps you’ve committed some crime in the village? 
sn4.25:13.4	Why don’t you get too close to people? 
sn4.25:13.5	And why does no-one get close to you?” 
sn4.25:14.1	“I’ve reached the goal, peace of heart. 
sn4.25:14.2	Having conquered the army of the likable and pleasant, 
sn4.25:14.3	alone, practicing absorption, I awakened to bliss. 
sn4.25:14.4	That’s why I don’t get too close to people, 
sn4.25:14.5	and no-one gets too close to me.” 
sn4.25:15.1	Then Māra’s daughter Delight addressed the Buddha in verse: 
sn4.25:16.1	“How does a mendicant who has crossed five floods 
sn4.25:16.2	usually meditate here while crossing the sixth? 
sn4.25:16.3	How do they usually practice absorption so that sensual perceptions 
sn4.25:16.4	are kept out and don’t get hold of them?” 
sn4.25:17.1	“With tranquil body and mind well freed, 
sn4.25:17.2	without making plans, mindful, homeless; 
sn4.25:17.3	understanding the teaching, they practice absorption without placing the mind; 
sn4.25:17.4	they’re not shaking or drifting or rigid. 
sn4.25:18.1	That’s how a mendicant who has crossed five floods 
sn4.25:18.2	usually meditates here while crossing the sixth. 
sn4.25:18.3	That’s how they usually practice absorption so that sensual perceptions 
sn4.25:18.4	are kept out and don’t get hold of them.” 
sn4.25:19.1	Then Māra’s daughter Lust addressed the Buddha in verse: 
sn4.25:20.1	“He lives with his community after cutting off craving, 
sn4.25:20.2	and many of the faithful will cross over for sure. 
sn4.25:20.3	Alas, this homeless one will snatch many men away, 
sn4.25:20.4	and lead them past the King of Death!” 
sn4.25:21.1	“The great heroes they lead

sn4.25:22.1	Then Māra’s daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to Māra the Wicked. 
sn4.25:22.2	Māra the Wicked saw them coming off in the distance, 
sn4.25:22.3	and addressed them in verse:

sn4.2:1.3	Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down. 
sn4.2:1.4	Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the Buddha feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, manifested in the form of a huge elephant king and approached him. 
sn4.2:1.5	Its head was like a huge block of soapstone. 
sn4.2:1.6	 
sn4.2:1.7	Its tusks were like pure silver.

sn4.4:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
sn4.4:1.4	“Mendicants!” 
sn4.4:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
sn4.4:1.6	The Buddha said this: 
sn4.4:2.1	“Mendicants, I have attained and realized supreme freedom through proper attention and proper effort. 
sn4.4:2.2	You too should attain and realize supreme freedom through proper attention and proper effort.” 
sn4.4:2.3	Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
sn4.4:3.1	“You’re bound by Māra’s snares, 
sn4.4:3.2	both human and divine. 
sn4.4:3.3	You’re bound by Māra’s bonds: 
sn4.4:3.4	you won’t escape me, ascetic!” 
sn4.4:4.1	“I’m freed from Māra’s snares, 
sn4.4:4.2	both human and divine. 
sn4.4:4.3	I’m freed from Māra’s bonds.

sn4.5:2.2	You are also freed from all snares, both human and divine. 
sn4.5:2.3	Wander forth, mendicants, for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. 
sn4.5:2.4	Let not two go by one road. 
sn4.5:2.5	Teach the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
sn4.5:2.6	There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching. 
sn4.5:2.7	There will be those who understand the teaching! 
sn4.5:2.8	I will travel to Uruvelā, the village of Senāni, in order to teach the Dhamma.” 
sn4.5:2.9	Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
sn4.5:3.1	“You’re bound by all snares, 
sn4.5:3.2	both human and divine. 
sn4.5:3.3	You’re bound by the great bond:

sn4.6:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn4.6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
sn4.6:1.3	Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down. 
sn4.6:2.1	Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the Buddha feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, manifested in the form of a huge serpent king and approached him. 
sn4.6:2.2	Its body was like a huge canoe carved from a single tree. 
sn4.6:2.3	 
sn4.6:2.4	Its hood was like a large brewer’s sieve. 
sn4.6:2.5	 
sn4.6:2.6	Its eyes were like those big bronze dishes from Kosala. 
sn4.6:2.7	 
sn4.6:2.8	Its tongue flickered from its mouth like lightning flashes in a thunderstorm. 
sn4.6:2.9	 
sn4.6:2.10	The sound of its breathing was like the puffing of a blacksmith’s bellows. 
sn4.6:2.11	 
sn4.6:3.1	Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse: 
sn4.6:4.1	“A self-controlled sage frequents 
sn4.6:4.2	empty buildings for lodging. 
sn4.6:4.3	It’s appropriate for such a person 
sn4.6:4.4	to live there after relinquishing. 
sn4.6:5.1	Though there are lots of creepy crawlies, 
sn4.6:5.2	and lots of flies and snakes, 
sn4.6:5.3	they wouldn’t stir a hair 
sn4.6:5.4	of a great sage in that empty hut. 
sn4.6:6.1	Though the sky may split and the earth may quake, 
sn4.6:6.2	and all creatures be stricken with fear; 
sn4.6:6.3	and even if an arrow’s aimed at their breast, 
sn4.6:6.4	the Buddhas take no shelter in attachments.” 
sn4.6:7.1	Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, “The Buddha knows me! The Holy One knows me!” miserable and sad, vanished right there.

sn4.7:1.2	He spent most of the night walking mindfully in the open. At the crack of dawn he washed his feet and entered his dwelling. 
sn4.7:1.3	He laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. 
sn4.7:1.4	Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
sn4.7:2.1	“What, you’re asleep? Really, you’re asleep? 
sn4.7:2.2	You sleep like a loser—what’s up with that? 
sn4.7:2.3	You sleep, thinking that the hut is empty. 
sn4.7:2.4	You sleep when the sun has come up—what’s up with that?” 
sn4.7:3.1	“For them there is no craving—
sn4.7:3.2	the weaver, the clinger—to track them anywhere. 
sn4.7:3.3	With the ending of all attachments the awakened Buddha sleeps.

sn4.9:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.

sn4.9:2.3	No-one born is immortal.

sn40.1:0.3	1. A Question About the First Absorption 
sn40.1:1.1	At one time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
sn40.1:1.2	There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants: 
sn40.1:1.3	“Reverends, mendicants!” 
sn40.1:1.4	“Reverend,” they replied. 
sn40.1:1.5	Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this: 
sn40.1:2.1	“Just now, reverends, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: 
sn40.1:2.2	‘They speak of this thing called the “first absorption”. 
sn40.1:2.3	What is the first absorption?’ 
sn40.1:2.4	It occurred to me: 
sn40.1:2.5	‘It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
sn40.1:2.6	This is called the first absorption.’

sn41.10:1.1	Now at that time the householder Citta was sick, suffering, gravely ill. 
sn41.10:1.2	Then several deities of the parks, forests, trees, and those who haunt the herbs, grass, and big trees came together and said to Citta, 
sn41.10:1.3	“Householder, make a wish to become a wheel-turning monarch in the future!”

sn41.10:2.20	‘Householder, make a wish to become a wheel-turning monarch in the future!’ 
sn41.10:2.21	So I said to them:

sn41.10:3.1	“Then, master, advise us!” 
sn41.10:3.2	“So you should train like this:

sn41.10:3.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
sn41.10:3.5	We will have experiential confidence in the teaching: 
sn41.10:3.6	‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’

This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’

sn41.1:1.1	At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove. 
sn41.1:1.2	Now at that time, after the meal, on return from almsround, several senior mendicants sat together in the pavilion and this discussion came up among them: 
sn41.1:1.3	“Reverends, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’: do these things differ in both meaning and phrasing? Or do they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing?” 
sn41.1:1.4	Some senior mendicants answered like this: 
sn41.1:1.5	“Reverends, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’: these things differ in both meaning and phrasing.” 
sn41.1:1.6	But some senior mendicants answered like this: 
sn41.1:1.7	“Reverends, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’ mean the same thing; they differ only in the phrasing.” 
sn41.1:2.1	Now at that time the householder Citta had arrived at Migapathaka on some business.

sn41.1:4.2	Well then, sirs, I shall give you a simile. 
sn41.1:4.3	For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said. 
sn41.1:4.4	Suppose there was a black ox and a white ox yoked by a single harness or yoke. 
sn41.1:4.5	Would it be right to say that 
sn41.1:4.6	the black ox is the yoke of the white ox, or the white ox is the yoke of the black ox?” 
sn41.1:4.7	“No, householder. 
sn41.1:4.8	The black ox is not the yoke of the white ox, nor is the white ox the yoke of the black ox. 
sn41.1:4.9	The yoke there is the single harness or yoke that they’re yoked by.” 
sn41.1:4.10	“In the same way, the eye is not the fetter of sights, nor are sights the fetter of the eye. 
sn41.1:4.11	The fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them. 
sn41.1:4.12	The ear … nose … tongue … body …

sn41.2:1.1	At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove. 
sn41.2:1.2	Then Citta the householder went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to them, 
sn41.2:1.3	“Sirs, may the senior mendicants please accept my offering of tomorrow’s meal.” 
sn41.2:1.4	They consented in silence. 
sn41.2:1.5	Knowing that the senior mendicants had consented, Citta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled them, keeping them on his right, before leaving. 
sn41.2:1.6	Then when the night had passed, the senior mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, went to Citta’s home, and sat down on the seats spread out. 
sn41.2:2.1	Then Citta went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and asked the senior venerable,

sn41.2:2.11	In what way did the Buddha speak of the diversity of elements?” 
sn41.2:2.12	And a second time and a third time the senior venerable kept silent. 
sn41.2:3.1	Now at that time Venerable Isidatta was the most junior mendicant in that Saṅgha. 
sn41.2:3.2	He said to the senior venerable, 
sn41.2:3.3	“Sir, may I answer Citta’s question?” 
sn41.2:3.4	“Answer it, Reverend Isidatta.” 
sn41.2:3.5	“Householder, is this your question:

sn41.2:3.11	The mind element, the thought element, the mind consciousness element. 
sn41.2:3.12	This is how the Buddha spoke of the diversity of elements.” 
sn41.2:4.1	Then Citta, having approved and agreed with what Isidatta said, served and satisfied the senior mendicants with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods. 
sn41.2:4.2	When the senior mendicants had eaten and washed their hands and bowls, they got up from their seats and left. 
sn41.2:4.3	Then the senior venerable said to Venerable Isidatta, 
sn41.2:4.4	“Isidatta, it’s good that you felt inspired to answer that question, because I didn’t.

sn41.3:4.11	the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist. 
sn41.3:4.12	And also the sixty-two misconceptions spoken of in the Prime Net Discourse. 
sn41.3:4.13	These views come to be when identity view exists. When identity view does not exist they do not come to be.” 
sn41.3:5.1	“But sir, how does identity view come about?” 
sn41.3:5.2	“It’s when an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons. 
sn41.3:5.3	They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. 
sn41.3:5.4	They regard feeling … 
sn41.3:5.5	perception … 
sn41.3:5.6	choices … 
sn41.3:5.7	consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. 
sn41.3:5.8	That’s how identity view comes about.” 
sn41.3:6.1	“But sir, how does identity view not come about?” 
sn41.3:6.2	“It’s when an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons. 
sn41.3:6.3	They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. 
sn41.3:6.4	They don’t regard feeling … 
sn41.3:6.5	perception … 
sn41.3:6.6	choices … 
sn41.3:6.7	consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. 
sn41.3:6.8	That’s how identity view does not come about.” 
sn41.3:7.1	“Sir, where has Venerable Isidatta come from?” 
sn41.3:7.2	“I come from Avanti, householder.” 
sn41.3:7.3	“Sir, there’s a friend of mine called Isidatta who I’ve never met. He’s gone forth from a good family in Avanti. 
sn41.3:7.4	Have you met him?” 
sn41.3:7.5	“Yes, householder.” 
sn41.3:7.6	“Sir, where is that venerable now staying?” 
sn41.3:7.7	When he said this, Isidatta kept silent. 
sn41.3:7.8	“Sir, are you that Isidatta?” 
sn41.3:7.9	“Yes, householder.” 
sn41.3:7.10	“Sir, I hope Venerable Isidatta is happy here in Macchikāsaṇḍa, 
sn41.3:7.11	for the Wild Mango Grove is lovely. 
sn41.3:7.12	I’ll make sure that Venerable Isidatta is provided with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.” 
sn41.3:7.13	“That’s nice of you to say, householder.” 
sn41.3:8.1	Then Citta, having approved and agreed with what Isidatta said, served and satisfied the senior mendicants with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods. 
sn41.3:8.2	When the senior mendicants had eaten and washed their hands and bowls, they got up from their seats and left. 
sn41.3:8.3	Then the senior venerable said to Venerable Isidatta, 
sn41.3:8.4	“Isidatta, it’s good that you felt inspired to answer that question, because I didn’t. 
sn41.3:8.5	 
sn41.3:8.6	So when a similar question comes up, you should also answer it as you feel inspired.” 
sn41.3:8.7	But Isidatta set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, left Macchikasaṇḍa, 
sn41.3:8.8	never to return.

sn41.4:0.3	4. Mahaka’s Demonstration 
sn41.4:1.1	At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove. 
sn41.4:1.2	Then Citta the householder went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to them, 
sn41.4:1.3	“Sirs, may the senior mendicants please accept my offering of tomorrow’s meal in my barn.” 
sn41.4:1.4	They consented in silence. 
sn41.4:1.5	Then, knowing that the senior mendicants had consented, Citta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled them, keeping them on his right, before leaving. 
sn41.4:1.6	Then when the night had passed, the senior mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, went to Citta’s barn, and sat down on the seats spread out. 
sn41.4:2.1	Then Citta served and satisfied the senior mendicants with his own hands with delicious milk-rice made with ghee. 
sn41.4:2.2	When the senior mendicants had eaten and washed their hands and bowls, they got up from their seats and left. 
sn41.4:2.3	Citta instructed that the remainder of the food be distributed, then followed behind the senior mendicants. 
sn41.4:2.4	Now at that time the heat was sweltering. 
sn41.4:2.5	And those senior mendicants walked along as if their bodies were melting, as happens after a meal. 
sn41.4:3.1	Now at that time Venerable Mahaka was the most junior mendicant in that Saṅgha. 
sn41.4:3.2	Then Venerable Mahaka said to the senior venerable, 
sn41.4:3.3	“Wouldn’t it be nice, sir, if a cool wind blew, a cloud canopy formed, and a gentle rain drizzled down?” 
sn41.4:4.1	“It would indeed be nice, Reverend Mahaka.” 
sn41.4:4.2	Then Mahaka used his psychic power to will that a cool wind would blow, a cloud canopy would form, and a gentle rain would drizzle down. 
sn41.4:4.3	Then Citta thought, 
sn41.4:4.4	“The most junior mendicant in this Saṅgha has such psychic power!” 
sn41.4:4.5	When they reached the monastery, Mahaka said to the senior venerable, 
sn41.4:4.6	“Sir, is that sufficient?” 
sn41.4:4.7	“That’s sufficient, Reverend Mahaka, 
sn41.4:4.8	you’ve done enough 
sn41.4:4.9	and offered enough.” 
sn41.4:4.10	Then the senior mendicants entered their dwellings, 
sn41.4:4.11	and Mahaka entered his own dwelling. 
sn41.4:5.1	Then Citta went up to Mahaka, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
sn41.4:5.2	“Sir, please show me a superhuman demonstration of psychic power.” 
sn41.4:5.3	“Well, then, householder, place your upper robe on the porch and spread a handful of grass on it.” 
sn41.4:5.4	“Yes, sir,” replied Citta, and did as he was asked. 
sn41.4:5.5	Mahaka entered his dwelling and latched the door. Then he used his psychic power to will that a flame shoot out through the keyhole and the chink in the door, and it burned up the grass but not the upper robe. 
sn41.4:5.6	Then Citta shook out his upper robe and stood to one side, shocked and awestruck. 
sn41.4:5.7	Mahaka left his dwelling and said to Citta, 
sn41.4:5.8	“Is that sufficient, householder?” 
sn41.4:6.1	“That’s sufficient, sir, 
sn41.4:6.2	you’ve done enough 
sn41.4:6.3	and offered enough. 
sn41.4:6.4	I hope Venerable Mahaka is happy here in Macchikāsaṇḍa,

sn41.4:6.7	“That’s nice of you to say, householder.”

sn41.5:1.2	Then Citta the householder went up to Venerable Kāmabhū, bowed, and sat down to one side. Kāmabhū said to him, 
sn41.5:2.1	“Householder, there is this saying: 
sn41.5:3.1	‘With flawless wheel and white canopy, 
sn41.5:3.2	the one-spoke chariot rolls on. 
sn41.5:3.3	See it come, untroubled, 
sn41.5:3.4	with stream cut, unbound.’ 
sn41.5:4.1	How should we see the detailed meaning of this brief statement?” 
sn41.5:4.2	“Sir, was this spoken by the Buddha?” 
sn41.5:4.3	“Yes, householder.” 
sn41.5:4.4	“Well then, sir, please wait a moment while I consider the meaning of this.” 
sn41.5:4.5	Then after a short silence Citta said to Kāmabhū: 
sn41.5:5.1	“Sir, ‘flawless wheel’ is a term for ethics. 
sn41.5:5.2	‘White canopy’ is a term for freedom. 
sn41.5:5.3	‘One spoke’ is a term for mindfulness. 
sn41.5:5.4	‘Rolls on’ is a term for going forward and coming back. 
sn41.5:5.5	‘Chariot’ is a term for this body made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction. 
sn41.5:5.6	Greed, hate, and delusion are troubles. 
sn41.5:5.7	A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they are unable to arise in the future. 
sn41.5:5.8	That’s why a mendicant who has ended the defilements is called ‘untroubled’. 
sn41.5:5.9	‘The one who comes’ is a term for the perfected one. 
sn41.5:5.10	‘Stream’ is a term for craving. 
sn41.5:5.11	A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given this up, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, and obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future. 
sn41.5:5.12	That’s why a mendicant who has ended the defilements is said to have ‘cut the stream’. 
sn41.5:5.13	Greed, hate, and delusion are bonds. 
sn41.5:5.14	A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they are unable to arise in the future. 
sn41.5:5.15	That’s why a mendicant who has ended the defilements is called ‘unbound’. 
sn41.5:5.16	So, sir, that’s how I understand the detailed meaning of what the Buddha said in brief: 
sn41.5:6.1	‘With flawless wheel and white canopy,

sn41.6:1.1	At one time Venerable Kāmabhū was staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove. 
sn41.6:1.2	Then Citta the householder went up to Venerable Kāmabhū, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
sn41.6:1.3	“Sir, how many processes are there?” 
sn41.6:1.4	“Householder, there are three processes. 
sn41.6:1.5	Physical, verbal, and mental processes.” 
sn41.6:1.6	Saying “Good, sir,” Citta approved and agreed with what Kāmabhū said. Then he asked another question: 
sn41.6:1.7	“But sir, what is the physical process? What’s the verbal process? What’s the mental process?” 
sn41.6:1.8	“Breathing is a physical process. Placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes. Perception and feeling are mental processes.” 
sn41.6:2.1	Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: 
sn41.6:2.2	“But sir, why is breathing a physical process? Why are placing the mind and keeping it connected verbal processes? Why are perception and feeling mental processes?” 
sn41.6:2.3	“Breathing is physical. It’s tied up with the body, that’s why breathing is a physical process. 
sn41.6:2.4	First you place the mind and keep it connected, then you break into speech. That’s why placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes. 
sn41.6:2.5	Perception and feeling are mental. They’re tied up with the mind, that’s why perception and feeling are mental processes.” 
sn41.6:3.1	Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: 
sn41.6:3.2	“But sir, how does someone attain the cessation of perception and feeling?” 
sn41.6:3.3	“A mendicant who is entering such an attainment does not think: 
sn41.6:3.4	‘I will enter the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I am entering the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I have entered the cessation of perception and feeling.’ 
sn41.6:3.5	Rather, their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state.” 
sn41.6:4.1	Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: 
sn41.6:4.2	“But sir, which cease first for a mendicant who is entering the cessation of perception and feeling: physical, verbal, or mental processes?” 
sn41.6:4.3	“Verbal processes cease first, then physical, then mental.” 
sn41.6:5.1	Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: 
sn41.6:5.2	“What’s the difference between someone who has passed away and a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling?” 
sn41.6:5.3	“When someone dies, their physical, verbal, and mental processes have ceased and stilled; their vitality is spent; their warmth is dissipated; and their faculties have disintegrated. 
sn41.6:5.4	When a mendicant has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, their physical, verbal, and mental processes have ceased and stilled. But their vitality is not spent; their warmth is not dissipated; and their faculties are very clear. 
sn41.6:5.5	That’s the difference between someone who has passed away and a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling.” 
sn41.6:6.1	Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: 
sn41.6:6.2	“But sir, how does someone emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling?” 
sn41.6:6.3	“A mendicant who is emerging from such an attainment does not think: 
sn41.6:6.4	‘I will emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I am emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I have emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling.’ 
sn41.6:6.5	Rather, their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state.” 
sn41.6:7.1	Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: 
sn41.6:7.2	“But sir, which arise first for a mendicant who is emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling: physical, verbal, or mental processes?” 
sn41.6:7.3	“Mental processes arise first, then physical, then verbal.” 
sn41.6:8.1	Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: 
sn41.6:8.2	“But sir, when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, how many kinds of contact do they experience?” 
sn41.6:8.3	“They experience three kinds of contact: 
sn41.6:8.4	emptiness, signless, and undirected contacts.” 
sn41.6:9.1	Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: 
sn41.6:9.2	“But sir, when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, what does their mind slant, slope, and incline to?” 
sn41.6:9.3	“Their mind slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion.” 
sn41.6:10.1	Saying “Good, sir,” Citta approved and agreed with what Kāmabhū said. Then he asked another question: 
sn41.6:10.2	“But sir, how many things are helpful for attaining the cessation of perception and feeling?” 
sn41.6:10.3	“Well, householder, you’ve finally asked what you should have asked first! 
sn41.6:10.4	Nevertheless, I will answer you. 
sn41.6:10.5	Two things are helpful for attaining the cessation of perception and feeling:

sn41.7:1.3	“Householder, the limitless release of the heart, and the release of the heart through nothingness, and the release of the heart through emptiness, and the signless release of the heart: do these things differ in both meaning and phrasing? Or do they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing?”

sn41.7:1.5	But there’s also a way in which they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing. 
sn41.7:2.1	And what’s the way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing? 
sn41.7:2.2	It’s when a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. 
sn41.7:2.3	They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion … 
sn41.7:2.4	They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing … 
sn41.7:2.5	They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. 
sn41.7:2.6	This is called the limitless release of the heart. 
sn41.7:3.1	And what is the release of the heart through nothingness? 
sn41.7:3.2	It’s when a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness. 
sn41.7:3.3	This is called the release of the heart through nothingness. 
sn41.7:4.1	And what is the release of the heart through emptiness? 
sn41.7:4.2	It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this: 
sn41.7:4.3	‘This is empty of a self or what belongs to a self.’ 
sn41.7:4.4	This is called the release of the heart through emptiness. 
sn41.7:5.1	And what is the signless heart’s release? 
sn41.7:5.2	It’s when a mendicant, not focusing on any signs, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart. 
sn41.7:5.3	This is called the signless release of the heart. 
sn41.7:5.4	This is the way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing.

sn41.8:1.2	Citta the householder heard that they had arrived.

sn41.8:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said to him,

sn41.8:1.6	there is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected; that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connected?” 
sn41.8:2.1	“Sir, in this case I don’t rely on faith in the Buddha’s claim that 
sn41.8:2.2	there is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected; that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connected.” 
sn41.8:2.3	When he said this, Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta looked up at his assembly and said, 
sn41.8:2.4	“See, good sirs, how straightforward this householder Citta is! He’s not devious or deceitful at all. To imagine that you can stop placing the mind and keeping it connected would be like imagining that you can catch the wind in a net, or dam the Ganges river with your own hand.” 
sn41.8:3.1	“What do you think, sir? 
sn41.8:3.2	Which is better—knowledge or faith?” 
sn41.8:3.3	“Knowledge is definitely better than faith, householder.” 
sn41.8:3.4	“Well sir, whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
sn41.8:3.5	And whenever I want, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled … I enter and remain in the second absorption. 
sn41.8:3.6	And whenever I want, with the fading away of rapture … I enter and remain in the third absorption. 
sn41.8:3.7	And whenever I want, giving up pleasure and pain … I enter and remain in the fourth absorption. 
sn41.8:3.8	And so, sir, since I know and see like this, why should I rely on faith in another ascetic or brahmin who claims that 
sn41.8:3.9	there is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected; that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connected?” 
sn41.8:4.1	When he said this, Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta looked askance at his own assembly and said, 
sn41.8:4.2	“See, good sirs, how crooked this householder Citta is! He’s so devious and deceitful!” 
sn41.8:5.1	“Sir, just now I understood you to say: 
sn41.8:5.2	‘See, good sirs, how straightforward this householder Citta is! He’s not devious or deceitful at all.’ 
sn41.8:5.3	But then I understood you to say: 
sn41.8:5.4	‘See, good sirs, how crooked this householder Citta is! He’s so devious and deceitful!’ 
sn41.8:5.5	If your first statement is true, the second is wrong. 
sn41.8:5.6	If your first statement is wrong, the second is true. 
sn41.8:5.7	And also, sir, these ten legitimate questions are relevant. 
sn41.8:5.8	When you understand what they mean, then, together with your assembly of Jain ascetics, you can rebut me. 
sn41.8:5.9	‘One thing: question, summary, and answer. Two … three … four … five … six … seven … eight … nine … ten things: question, summary, and answer.’”

sn41.9:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the naked ascetic Kassapa, 
sn41.9:1.5	“Sir, Kassapa, how long has it been since you went forth?” 
sn41.9:1.6	“It’s been thirty years, householder.” 
sn41.9:1.7	“But sir, in these thirty years have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease?” 
sn41.9:1.8	“I have no such achievement, householder, only nakedness, baldness, and pokes in the buttocks.” 
sn41.9:1.9	Citta said to him, 
sn41.9:1.10	“It’s incredible, it’s amazing, 
sn41.9:1.11	how well explained the teaching is. For in thirty years you have achieved no superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, no meditation at ease, only nakedness, baldness, and pokes in the buttocks.” 
sn41.9:2.1	“But householder, how long have you been a lay follower?” 
sn41.9:2.2	“It’s been thirty years, sir.” 
sn41.9:2.3	“But householder, in these thirty years have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease?” 
sn41.9:2.4	“How, sir, could I not? 
sn41.9:2.5	For whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
sn41.9:2.6	And whenever I want, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled … I enter and remain in the second absorption. 
sn41.9:2.7	And whenever I want, with the fading away of rapture … I enter and remain in the third absorption. 
sn41.9:2.8	And whenever I want, giving up pleasure and pain … I enter and remain in the fourth absorption. 
sn41.9:2.9	If I pass away before the Buddha, it wouldn’t be surprising if the Buddha declares of me: 
sn41.9:2.10	‘The householder Citta is bound by no fetter that might return him to this world.’” 
sn41.9:2.11	When this was said, Kassapa said to Citta, 
sn41.9:2.12	“It’s incredible, it’s amazing, 
sn41.9:2.13	how well explained the teaching is. For a white-clothed layperson can achieve such a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease. 
sn41.9:2.14	Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” 
sn41.9:3.1	Then Citta the householder took the naked ascetic Kassapa to see the senior mendicants, and said to them: 
sn41.9:3.2	“Sirs, this is the naked ascetic Kassapa, who in lay life was an old friend of mine. 
sn41.9:3.3	May the senior monks give him the going forth, the ordination. 
sn41.9:3.4	I’ll make sure that he’s provided with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.” 
sn41.9:3.5	And the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training. 
sn41.9:3.6	Not long after his ordination, Venerable Kassapa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
sn41.9:3.7	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” 
sn41.9:3.8	And Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfected.

sn42.10:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
sn42.10:1.2	Now at that time while the king’s retinue was sitting together in the royal compound this discussion came up among them, 
sn42.10:1.3	“Gold and money are proper for Sakyan ascetics. They accept and receive gold and money.” 
sn42.10:2.1	Now at that time the chief Maṇicūḷaka was sitting in that assembly. 
sn42.10:2.2	He said to that retinue, 
sn42.10:2.3	“Good sirs, don’t say that. 
sn42.10:2.4	Gold and money are not proper for Sakyan ascetics. They neither accept nor receive gold and money. They have set aside gems and gold, and rejected gold and money.” 
sn42.10:2.5	He was able to persuade that assembly. 
sn42.10:2.6	Then Maṇicūḷaka went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. He then said,

sn42.10:3.1	“Indeed, in answering this way you repeat what I’ve said, and don’t misrepresent me with an untruth. Your explanation is in line with the teaching, and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism. 
sn42.10:3.2	Gold and money are not proper for Sakyan ascetics. They neither accept nor receive gold and money. They have set aside gems and gold, and rejected gold and money. 
sn42.10:3.3	If gold and money were proper for them, then the five kinds of sensual stimulation would also be proper. 
sn42.10:3.4	And if the five kinds of sensual stimulation are proper for them, you should definitely regard them as not having the qualities of an ascetic or a follower of the Sakyan. 
sn42.10:3.5	Rather, chief, I say this: 
sn42.10:3.6	Straw may be looked for by one needing straw; wood may be looked for by one needing wood; a cart may be looked for by one needing a cart; a workman may be looked for by one needing a workman. 
sn42.10:3.7	But I say that there is no way they can accept or look for gold and money.”

sn42.11:0.3	11. With Bhadraka 
sn42.11:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Mallas, near the Mallian town called Uruvelakappa. 
sn42.11:1.2	Then Bhadraka the village chief went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
sn42.11:1.3	“Please, sir, teach me the origin and cessation of suffering.” 
sn42.11:1.4	“Chief, if I were to teach you about the origin and ending of suffering in the past, saying 
sn42.11:1.5	‘this is how it was in the past,’ you might have doubts or uncertainties about that. 
sn42.11:1.6	If I were to teach you about the origin and ending of suffering in the future, saying 
sn42.11:1.7	‘this is how it will be in the future,’ you might have doubts or uncertainties about that. 
sn42.11:1.8	Rather, chief, I will teach you about the origin and ending of suffering as I am sitting right here and you are sitting right there. 
sn42.11:1.9	Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
sn42.11:1.10	“Yes, sir,” Bhadraka replied. 
sn42.11:1.11	The Buddha said this: 
sn42.11:2.1	“What do you think, chief? 
sn42.11:2.2	Are there any people here in Uruvelakappa who, if they were executed, imprisoned, fined, or condemned, it would cause you sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?” 
sn42.11:2.3	“There are, sir.” 
sn42.11:2.4	“But are there any people here in Uruvelakappa who, if they were executed, imprisoned, fined, or condemned, it would not cause you sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?” 
sn42.11:2.5	“There are, sir.” 
sn42.11:2.6	“What’s the cause, chief, what’s the reason why, if this was to happen to some people it could cause you sorrow, while if it happens to others it does not?” 
sn42.11:2.7	“The people regarding whom this would give rise to sorrow are those I desire and love. 
sn42.11:2.8	The people regarding whom this would not give rise to sorrow are those I don’t desire and love.” 
sn42.11:2.9	“With this present phenomenon that is seen, known, immediate, attained, and fathomed, you may infer to the past and future: 
sn42.11:2.10	‘All the suffering that arose in the past was rooted and sourced in desire. 
sn42.11:2.11	For desire is the root of suffering. 
sn42.11:2.12	All the suffering that will arise in the future will be rooted and sourced in desire. 
sn42.11:2.13	For desire is the root of suffering.’” 
sn42.11:2.14	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! 
sn42.11:2.15	How well said this was by the Buddha! 
sn42.11:2.16	‘All the suffering that arises is rooted and sourced in desire. 
sn42.11:2.17	For desire is the root of suffering.’ 
sn42.11:2.18	I have a boy called Ciravāsi, who resides in a house away from here. 
sn42.11:2.19	I rise early and send someone, saying: 
sn42.11:2.20	‘Go, my man, and check on my boy Ciravāsi.’ 
sn42.11:2.21	Until they get back I worry: 
sn42.11:2.22	‘I hope nothing’s wrong with Ciravāsi!’” 
sn42.11:3.1	“What do you think, chief? 
sn42.11:3.2	If Ciravāsi was executed, imprisoned, fined, or condemned, would it cause you sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?” 
sn42.11:3.3	“How could it not, sir?” 
sn42.11:3.4	“This too is a way to understand: 
sn42.11:3.5	‘All the suffering that arises is rooted and sourced in desire. 
sn42.11:3.6	For desire is the root of suffering.’ 
sn42.11:4.1	What do you think, chief? 
sn42.11:4.2	Before you’d seen or heard of Ciravāsi’s mother, did you have any desire or love or fondness for her?” 
sn42.11:4.3	“No, sir.” 
sn42.11:4.4	“Then was it because you saw or heard of her that you had 
sn42.11:4.5	desire or love or fondness for her?” 
sn42.11:4.6	“Yes, sir.” 
sn42.11:5.1	“What do you think, chief?

sn42.12:1.1	Then Rāsiya the chief went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
sn42.12:1.2	“Sir, I have heard this: ‘The ascetic Gotama criticizes all forms of mortification. He categorically condemns and denounces those self-mortifiers who live rough.’ 
sn42.12:1.3	Do those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?” 
sn42.12:1.4	“Chief, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false, hollow, and untrue. 
sn42.12:2.1	These two extremes should not be cultivated by one who has gone forth. 
sn42.12:2.2	Indulgence in sensual pleasures, which is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And indulgence in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless. 
sn42.12:2.3	Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One woke up by understanding the middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment. 
sn42.12:2.4	And what is that middle way of practice? 
sn42.12:2.5	It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: 
sn42.12:2.6	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.

sn42.12:17.2	‘Hopefully I will achieve a skillful quality! Hopefully I will realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones!’

sn42.12:20.3	What are the two grounds for criticism? 
sn42.12:20.4	They mortify and torment themselves. This is the first ground for criticism. 
sn42.12:20.5	They don’t realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. This is the second ground for criticism. 
sn42.12:20.6	What is the one ground for praise? 
sn42.12:20.7	They achieve a skillful quality. This is the one ground for praise. 
sn42.12:20.8	This self-mortifier may be criticized on these two grounds, and praised on one. 
sn42.12:21.1	In this case, the third self-mortifier may be criticized on one ground, and praised on two. 
sn42.12:21.2	What is the one ground for criticism? 
sn42.12:21.3	They mortify and torment themselves. This is the one ground for criticism. 
sn42.12:21.4	What are the two grounds for praise? 
sn42.12:21.5	They achieve a skillful quality. This is the first ground for praise. 
sn42.12:21.6	They realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. This is the second ground for praise. 
sn42.12:21.7	This self-mortifier may be criticized on this one ground, and praised on two. 
sn42.12:22.1	There are these three kinds of wearing away that are visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know them for themselves. 
sn42.12:22.2	What three? 
sn42.12:22.3	A greedy person, because of greed, intends to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. 
sn42.12:22.4	When they’ve given up greed they don’t have such intentions. 
sn42.12:22.5	This wearing away is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves. 
sn42.12:22.6	A hateful person, because of hate, intends to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. 
sn42.12:22.7	When they’ve given up hate they don’t have such intentions. 
sn42.12:22.8	This wearing away is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves. 
sn42.12:22.9	A deluded person, because of delusion, intends to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. 
sn42.12:22.10	When they’ve given up delusion they don’t have such intentions. 
sn42.12:22.11	This wearing away is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves. 
sn42.12:22.12	These are the three kinds of wearing away that are visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know them for themselves.” 
sn42.12:23.1	When he said this, Rāsiya the chief said to the Buddha, 
sn42.12:23.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent! … 
sn42.12:23.3	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

sn42.13:0.3	13. With Pāṭaliya 
sn42.13:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where they have a town called Uttara. 
sn42.13:1.2	Then Pāṭaliya the chief went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
sn42.13:1.3	“Sir, I have heard this: 
sn42.13:1.4	‘The ascetic Gotama knows magic.’ 
sn42.13:2.1	Do those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism? 
sn42.13:2.2	For we don’t want to misrepresent the Blessed One.” 
sn42.13:2.3	“Chief, those who say this repeat what I have said, and don’t misrepresent me with an untruth. Their explanation is in line with the teaching, and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism.” 
sn42.13:2.4	“Sir, we didn’t believe that what those ascetics and brahmins said was really true. 
sn42.13:2.5	But it seems the ascetic Gotama is a magician!” 
sn42.13:2.6	“Chief, does someone who says ‘I know magic’ also say ‘I am a magician’?” 
sn42.13:2.7	“That’s right, Blessed One! That’s right, Holy One!” 
sn42.13:2.8	“Well then, brahmin, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. 
sn42.13:3.1	What do you think, chief? 
sn42.13:3.2	Do you know the Koliyan officers with drooping headdresses?” 
sn42.13:3.3	“I know them, sir.” 
sn42.13:3.4	“And what’s their job?” 
sn42.13:3.5	“To put a stop to bandits and to deliver messages for the Koliyans.” 
sn42.13:3.6	“What do you think, chief? 
sn42.13:3.7	Are the Koliyan officers with drooping headdresses moral or immoral?” 
sn42.13:3.8	“I know that they’re immoral, of bad character, sir. They are among those in the world who are immoral and of bad character.” 
sn42.13:3.9	“Would it be right to say that 
sn42.13:3.10	Pāṭaliya knows the Kolyian officers with drooping headdresses who are immoral, of bad character, so he too must be immoral and of bad character.” 
sn42.13:3.11	“No, sir. 
sn42.13:3.12	I’m quite different from the Koliyan officers with drooping headdresses, we have quite different characters.” 
sn42.13:3.13	“So if you can know those officers of bad character while you are not of bad character, why can’t the Realized One know magic, without being a magician? 
sn42.13:3.14	I understand magic and its result. And I understand how magicians practice so that when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. 
sn42.13:4.1	I understand killing living creatures and its result. And I understand how those who kill living creatures practice so that when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. 
sn42.13:4.2	I understand stealing … 
sn42.13:4.3	sexual misconduct … 
sn42.13:4.4	lying … 
sn42.13:4.5	divisive speech … 
sn42.13:4.6	harsh speech … 
sn42.13:4.7	talking nonsense … 
sn42.13:4.8	covetousness … 
sn42.13:4.9	ill will … 
sn42.13:4.10	wrong view and its result. And I understand how those who have wrong view practice so that when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. 
sn42.13:5.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: 
sn42.13:5.2	‘Everyone who kills living creatures experiences pain and sadness in the present life. 
sn42.13:5.3	Everyone who steals … 
sn42.13:5.4	commits sexual misconduct … 
sn42.13:5.5	lies experiences pain and sadness in the present life.’ 
sn42.13:6.1	But you can see someone, garlanded and adorned, nicely bathed and anointed, hair and beard dressed, taking his pleasure with women as if he were a king. 
sn42.13:6.2	You might ask someone: 
sn42.13:6.3	‘Mister, what did that man do?’ 
sn42.13:6.4	And they’d reply: 
sn42.13:6.5	‘Mister, that man attacked the king’s enemy and killed them. 
sn42.13:6.6	The king was delighted and gave him this reward. 
sn42.13:6.7	That’s why he’s garlanded and adorned, nicely bathed and anointed, hair and beard dressed, taking his pleasure with women as if he were a king.’ 
sn42.13:7.1	And you can see someone else, his arms tied tightly behind his back with a strong rope. His head is shaven and he’s marched from street to street and from square to square to the beating of a harsh drum. Then he’s taken out the south gate and there, to the south of the city, they chop off his head. 
sn42.13:7.2	You might ask someone: 
sn42.13:7.3	‘Mister, what did that man do?’ 
sn42.13:7.4	And they’d reply: 
sn42.13:7.5	‘Mister, that man is an enemy of the king who has murdered a man or a woman. 
sn42.13:7.6	That’s why the rulers arrested him and inflicted such punishment.’ 
sn42.13:8.1	What do you think, chief? 
sn42.13:8.2	Have you seen or heard of such a thing?” 
sn42.13:8.3	“Sir, we have seen it and heard of it, and we will hear of it again.” 
sn42.13:8.4	“Since this is so, the ascetics and brahmins whose view is that 
sn42.13:8.5	everyone who kills living creatures experiences pain and sadness in the present life: are they right or wrong?” 
sn42.13:8.6	“They’re wrong, sir.” 
sn42.13:8.7	“But those who speak hollow, false nonsense: are they moral or immoral?” 
sn42.13:8.8	“Immoral, sir.” 
sn42.13:8.9	“And are those who are immoral, of bad character practicing wrongly or rightly?” 
sn42.13:8.10	“They’re practicing wrongly, sir.” 
sn42.13:8.11	“And do those who are practicing wrongly have wrong view or right view?” 
sn42.13:8.12	“They have wrong view, sir.” 
sn42.13:8.13	“But is it appropriate to have confidence in those of wrong view?” 
sn42.13:8.14	“No, sir.” 
sn42.13:9.1	“You can see someone, garlanded and adorned …

sn42.13:10.10	everyone who steals experiences pain and sadness in the present life: are they right or wrong? … 
sn42.13:10.11	Is it appropriate to have confidence in them?”

sn42.13:14.20	“No, sir. 
sn42.13:15.1	It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! 
sn42.13:15.2	I have a guest house, 
sn42.13:15.3	where there are cots, seats, water pots, and oil lamps. 
sn42.13:15.4	Whenever an ascetic or brahmin comes to stay, I share what I have as best I can. 
sn42.13:15.5	Once it so happened, sir, that four teachers of different views and opinions came to stay at my guest house. 
sn42.13:16.1	One teacher had this doctrine and view: 
sn42.13:16.2	‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There are no duties to mother and father. No beings are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’ 
sn42.13:17.1	One teacher had this doctrine and view: 
sn42.13:17.2	‘There is meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There are duties to mother and father. There are beings reborn spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are well attained and practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’ 
sn42.13:18.1	One teacher had this doctrine and view: 
sn42.13:18.2	‘Nothing bad is done by the doer when they punish, mutilate, torture, aggrieve, oppress, intimidate, or when they encourage others to do the same. Nothing bad is done when they kill, steal, break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, commit adultery, and lie. 
sn42.13:18.3	If you were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razor-edged chakram, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil. 
sn42.13:18.4	If you were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing, mutilating, and torturing, and encouraging others to do the same, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil. 
sn42.13:18.5	If you were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and sacrificing and encouraging others to do the same, no merit comes of that, and no outcome of merit. 
sn42.13:18.6	In giving, self-control, restraint, and truthfulness there is no merit or outcome of merit.’ 
sn42.13:19.1	One teacher had this doctrine and view: 
sn42.13:19.2	‘A bad deed is done by the doer when they punish, mutilate, torture, aggrieve, oppress, intimidate, or when they encourage others to do the same. A bad deed is done when they kill, steal, break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, commit adultery, and lie. 
sn42.13:19.3	If you were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razor-edged chakram, evil comes of that, and an outcome of evil. 
sn42.13:19.4	If you were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing, mutilating, and torturing, and encouraging others to do the same, evil comes of that, and an outcome of evil. 
sn42.13:19.5	If you were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and sacrificing and encouraging others to do the same, merit comes of that, and an outcome of merit. 
sn42.13:19.6	In giving, self-control, restraint, and truthfulness there is merit and outcome of merit.’ 
sn42.13:20.1	I had doubt and uncertainty about that: 
sn42.13:20.2	‘I wonder who of these respected ascetics and brahmins speaks the truth, and who speaks falsehood?’” 
sn42.13:21.1	“Chief, no wonder you’re doubting and uncertain. 
sn42.13:21.2	Doubt has come up in you about an uncertain matter.” 
sn42.13:21.3	“I am quite confident that the Buddha is capable of teaching me so that I can give up this state of uncertainty.” 
sn42.13:22.1	“Chief, there is immersion based on understanding of principle. 
sn42.13:22.2	If you gain such mental immersion, you can give up that cause of uncertainty. 
sn42.13:22.3	And what is immersion based on understanding of principle? 
sn42.13:22.4	It’s when a noble disciple has given up killing living creatures, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, talking nonsense, covetousness, ill will, and wrong view. 
sn42.13:23.1	Then that noble disciple is rid of desire, rid of ill will, unconfused, aware, and mindful. They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. 
sn42.13:23.2	They reflect thus: 
sn42.13:23.3	‘That teacher who had this doctrine and view: 
sn42.13:23.4	“There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There are no duties to mother and father. No beings are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.” 
sn42.13:23.5	If what this good teacher says is true, it’s a safe bet for me to not hurt any creature firm or frail. 
sn42.13:23.6	I win on both counts, since I’m restrained in body, speech, and mind, and when my body breaks up, after death, I’ll be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ 
sn42.13:23.7	Joy springs up in them. 
sn42.13:23.8	Being joyful, rapture springs up. 
sn42.13:23.9	When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. 
sn42.13:23.10	When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. 
sn42.13:23.11	And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. 
sn42.13:23.12	This is that immersion based on understanding of principle. 
sn42.13:23.13	If you gain such mental immersion, you can give up that state of uncertainty. 
sn42.13:24.1	Then that noble disciple is rid of desire, rid of ill will, unconfused, aware, and mindful.

sn42.13:26.10	I win on both counts, since I’m restrained in body, speech, and mind, and when my body breaks up, after death, I’ll be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ 
sn42.13:26.11	Joy springs up in them. 
sn42.13:26.12	Being joyful, rapture springs up. 
sn42.13:26.13	When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil.

sn42.13:26.15	And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. 
sn42.13:26.16	This is that immersion based on understanding of principle. 
sn42.13:26.17	If you gain such mental immersion, you can give up that state of uncertainty. 
sn42.13:27.1	Then that noble disciple is rid of desire, rid of ill will, unconfused, aware, and mindful. They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion …

sn42.1:1.2	Then the chief named Fury went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
sn42.1:1.3	“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why some people are regarded as furious, 
sn42.1:1.4	while others are regarded as sweet-natured?” 
sn42.1:1.5	“Take someone who hasn’t given up greed. 
sn42.1:1.6	So they get annoyed by others, and they show it. 
sn42.1:1.7	They’re regarded as furious. 
sn42.1:1.8	They haven’t given up hate. 
sn42.1:1.9	So they get annoyed by others, and they show it. 
sn42.1:1.10	They’re regarded as furious. 
sn42.1:1.11	They haven’t given up delusion.

sn42.1:1.13	They’re regarded as furious. 
sn42.1:1.14	This is the cause, this is the reason why some people are regarded as furious. 
sn42.1:2.1	But take someone who has given up greed. 
sn42.1:2.2	So they don’t get annoyed by others, and don’t show it. 
sn42.1:2.3	They’re regarded as sweet-natured. 
sn42.1:2.4	They’ve given up hate. 
sn42.1:2.5	So they don’t get annoyed by others, and don’t show it. 
sn42.1:2.6	They’re regarded as sweet-natured.

sn42.1:3.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
sn42.1:3.4	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.

sn42.2:0.3	2. With Tāḷapuṭa 
sn42.2:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
sn42.2:1.2	Then Tāḷapuṭa the dancing master came up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha: 
sn42.2:1.3	“Sir, I have heard that the dancers of the past who were teachers of teachers said: 
sn42.2:1.4	‘Suppose a dancer entertains and amuses people on a stage or at a festival with truth and lies. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of laughing gods.’ 
sn42.2:1.5	What does the Buddha say about this?” 
sn42.2:1.6	“Enough, chief, let it be. Don’t ask me that.” 
sn42.2:1.7	For a second time … 
sn42.2:1.8	 
sn42.2:1.9	 
sn42.2:1.10	 
sn42.2:1.11	 
sn42.2:1.12	And for a third time Tāḷapuṭa said to the Buddha: 
sn42.2:1.13	“Sir, I have heard that the dancers of the past who were teachers of teachers said: 
sn42.2:1.14	‘Suppose a dancer entertains and amuses people on a stage or at a festival with truth and lies. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of laughing gods.’ 
sn42.2:1.15	What does the Buddha say about this?” 
sn42.2:2.1	“Clearly, chief, I’m not getting through to you when I say: 
sn42.2:2.2	‘Enough, chief, let it be. 
sn42.2:2.3	Don’t ask me that.’ 
sn42.2:2.4	Nevertheless, I will answer you. 
sn42.2:2.5	When sentient beings are still not free of greed, and are still bound by greed, 
sn42.2:2.6	a dancer in a stage or festival presents them with even more arousing things. 
sn42.2:2.7	When sentient beings are still not free of hate, and are still bound by hate, 
sn42.2:2.8	a dancer in a stage or festival presents them with even more hateful things. 
sn42.2:2.9	When sentient beings are still not free of delusion, and are still bound by delusion, 
sn42.2:2.10	a dancer in a stage or festival presents them with even more delusory things. 
sn42.2:2.11	And so, being heedless and negligent themselves, they’ve encouraged others to be heedless and negligent. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the hell called ‘Laughter’. 
sn42.2:2.12	But if you have such a view: 
sn42.2:2.13	‘Suppose a dancer entertains and amuses people on a stage or at a festival with truth and lies. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of laughing gods.’ This is your wrong view. 
sn42.2:2.14	An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: 
sn42.2:2.15	hell or the animal realm.” 
sn42.2:3.1	When he said this, Tāḷapuṭa cried and burst out in tears. 
sn42.2:3.2	“This is what I didn’t get through to you when I said: 
sn42.2:3.3	‘Enough, chief, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’” 
sn42.2:3.4	“Sir, I’m not crying because of what the Buddha said. 
sn42.2:3.5	But sir, for a long time I’ve been cheated, tricked, and deceived by the dancers of the past who were teachers of teachers, who said: 
sn42.2:3.6	‘Suppose a dancer entertains and amuses people on a stage or at a festival with truth and lies. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of laughing gods.’ 
sn42.2:3.7	Excellent, sir! Excellent! 
sn42.2:3.8	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
sn42.2:3.9	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
sn42.2:3.10	Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” 
sn42.2:3.11	And the dancing master Tāḷapuṭa received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. 
sn42.2:3.12	Not long after his ordination, Venerable Tāḷapuṭa 
sn42.2:3.13	became one of the perfected.

sn42.3:1.1	Then Dustin the warrior chief went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
sn42.3:1.2	“Sir, I have heard that the warriors of the past who were teachers of teachers said: 
sn42.3:1.3	‘Suppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he’s reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.’

sn42.3:2.2	‘Enough, chief, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’ 
sn42.3:2.3	Nevertheless, I will answer you. 
sn42.3:2.4	When a warrior strives and struggles in battle, their mind is already low, degraded, and misdirected as they think: 
sn42.3:2.5	‘May these sentient beings be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!’ 
sn42.3:2.6	His foes kill him and finish him off, and 
sn42.3:2.7	when his body breaks up, after death, he’s reborn in the hell called ‘The Fallen’. 
sn42.3:2.8	But if you have such a view: 
sn42.3:2.9	‘Suppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he’s reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.’ This is your wrong view.

sn42.6:1.2	Then Asibandhaka’s son the chief went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
sn42.6:2.1	“Sir, there are western brahmins draped with moss who carry pitchers, immerse themselves in water, and serve the sacred flame. 
sn42.6:2.2	When someone has passed away, they truly lift them up, raise them up, and guide them along to heaven. 
sn42.6:2.3	But what about the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha: is he able to ensure that the whole world will be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm when their body breaks up, after death?” 
sn42.6:3.1	“Well then, chief, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. 
sn42.6:4.1	What do you think, chief? 
sn42.6:4.2	Take a person who kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, and have wrong view. 
sn42.6:4.3	And a large crowd comes together to offer up prayers and praise, circumambulating them with joined palms and saying: 
sn42.6:4.4	‘When this person’s body breaks up, after death, may they be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm!’ 
sn42.6:4.5	What do you think, chief? 
sn42.6:4.6	Would that person be reborn in heaven because of their prayers?” 
sn42.6:4.7	“No, sir.” 
sn42.6:5.1	“Chief, suppose a person were to throw a broad rock into a deep lake.

sn42.6:5.3	‘Rise, good rock! Float, good rock! Float to shore, good rock!’

sn42.6:5.6	“No, sir.” 
sn42.6:5.7	“In the same way, take a person who kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, and have wrong view. 
sn42.6:5.8	Even though a large crowd comes together to offer up prayers and praise …

sn42.7:1.5	“Well, sir, why exactly do you teach some people thoroughly and others less thoroughly?” 
sn42.7:1.6	“Well then, chief, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. 
sn42.7:1.7	What do you think? Suppose a farmer has three fields: one’s good, one’s average, and one’s poor—bad ground of sand and salt. 
sn42.7:1.8	What do you think? When that farmer wants to plant seeds, where would he plant them first: the good field, the average one, or the poor one?” 
sn42.7:1.9	“Sir, he’d plant them first in the good field, then the average, then he may or may not plant seed in the poor field. 
sn42.7:1.10	Why is that? 
sn42.7:1.11	Because at least it can be fodder for the cattle.” 
sn42.7:2.1	“To me, the monks and nuns are like the good field. 
sn42.7:2.2	I teach them the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And I reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
sn42.7:2.3	Why is that? 
sn42.7:2.4	Because they live with me as their island, protection, shelter, and refuge. 
sn42.7:2.5	To me, the laymen and laywomen are like the average field. 
sn42.7:2.6	I also teach them the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And I reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.

sn42.7:2.10	I also teach them the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And I reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
sn42.7:2.11	Why is that? 
sn42.7:2.12	Hopefully they might understand even a single sentence, which would be for their lasting welfare and happiness. 
sn42.7:3.1	Suppose a person had three water jars: one that’s uncracked and nonporous; one that’s uncracked but porous; and one that’s cracked and porous. 
sn42.7:3.2	What do you think? When that person wants to store water, where would they store it first: in the jar that’s uncracked and nonporous, the one that’s uncracked but porous, or the one that’s cracked and porous?” 
sn42.7:3.3	“Sir, they’d store water first in the jar that’s uncracked and nonporous, then the one that’s uncracked but porous, then they may or may not store water in the one that’s cracked and porous. 
sn42.7:3.4	Why is that?

sn42.8:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Nālandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove. 
sn42.8:1.2	Then Asibandhaka’s son the chief, who was a disciple of the Jains, went up to the Buddha, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, 
sn42.8:1.3	“Chief, how does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta teach his disciples?” 
sn42.8:1.4	“Sir, this is how Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta teaches his disciples: 
sn42.8:1.5	‘Everyone who kills a living creature, steal, commits sexual misconduct, or lies goes to a place of loss, to hell. 
sn42.8:1.6	You’re led on by what you usually live by.’ 
sn42.8:1.7	This is how Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta teaches his disciples.” 
sn42.8:1.8	“‘You’re led on by what you usually live by’: if this were true, then, according to what Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta says, no-one would go to a place of loss, to hell. 
sn42.8:2.1	What do you think, chief? 
sn42.8:2.2	Take a person who kills living creatures. If we compare periods of time during the day and night, which is more frequent: the occasions when they’re killing or when they’re not killing?” 
sn42.8:2.3	“The occasions when they’re killing are less frequent, while the occasions when they’re not killing are more frequent.” 
sn42.8:2.4	“‘You’re led on by what you usually live by’: if this were true, then, according to what Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta says, no-one would go to a place of loss, to hell. 
sn42.8:3.1	What do you think, chief? 
sn42.8:3.2	Take a person who steals … 
sn42.8:3.3	 
sn42.8:3.4	 
sn42.8:4.1	Take a person who commits sexual misconduct … 
sn42.8:4.2	 
sn42.8:4.3	 
sn42.8:5.1	Take a person who lies. If we compare periods of time during the day and night, which is more frequent: the occasions when they’re lying or when they’re not lying?” 
sn42.8:5.2	“The occasions when they’re lying are less frequent, while the occasions when they’re not lying are more frequent.” 
sn42.8:5.3	“‘You’re led on by what you usually live by’: if this were true, then, according to what Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta says, no-one would go to a place of loss, to hell. 
sn42.8:6.1	Take some teacher who has this doctrine and view: 
sn42.8:6.2	‘Everyone who kills a living creature, steals, commits sexual misconduct, or lies goes to a place of loss, to hell.’ 
sn42.8:6.3	And there’s a disciple who is devoted to that teacher. 
sn42.8:6.4	They think: 
sn42.8:6.5	‘My teacher has this doctrine and view: 
sn42.8:6.6	‘Everyone who kills a living creature, steals, commits sexual misconduct, or lies goes to a place of loss, to hell.’ 
sn42.8:6.7	But I’ve killed living creatures … 
sn42.8:6.8	 
sn42.8:6.9	 
sn42.8:6.10	 
sn42.8:6.11	stolen … 
sn42.8:6.12	 
sn42.8:6.13	 
sn42.8:6.14	 
sn42.8:6.15	committed sexual misconduct …

sn42.8:6.17	 
sn42.8:6.18	 
sn42.8:6.19	 
sn42.8:6.20	or lied. 
sn42.8:6.21	They get the view: ‘I too am going to a place of loss, to hell.’ 
sn42.8:6.22	Unless they give up that speech and thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell. 
sn42.8:7.1	But consider when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. 
sn42.8:7.2	In many ways he criticizes and denounces killing living creatures, saying: ‘Stop killing living creatures!’ 
sn42.8:7.3	He criticizes and denounces stealing … 
sn42.8:7.4	sexual misconduct … 
sn42.8:7.5	lying, saying: ‘Stop lying!’ 
sn42.8:7.6	And there’s a disciple who is devoted to that teacher. 
sn42.8:7.7	Then they reflect: 
sn42.8:7.8	‘In many ways the Buddha criticizes and denounces killing living creatures, saying: “Stop killing living creatures!” 
sn42.8:7.9	But I have killed living creatures to a certain extent. 
sn42.8:7.10	That’s not right, it’s not good, 
sn42.8:7.11	and I feel remorseful because of it. 
sn42.8:7.12	But I can’t undo what I have done.’ 
sn42.8:7.13	Reflecting like this, they give up killing living creatures, 
sn42.8:7.14	and in future they don’t kill living creatures. 
sn42.8:7.15	That’s how to give up this bad deed 
sn42.8:7.16	and get past it.

sn42.8:10.4	Reflecting like this, they give up lying, and in future they refrain from lying. 
sn42.8:10.5	That’s how to give up this bad deed and get past it. 
sn42.8:11.1	They give up killing living creatures. 
sn42.8:11.2	They give up stealing.

sn42.8:11.10	They give up wrong view and have right view. 
sn42.8:12.1	That noble disciple is rid of desire, rid of ill will, unconfused, aware, and mindful. They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. 
sn42.8:12.2	Suppose there was a powerful horn blower. They’d easily make themselves heard in the four directions. 
sn42.8:12.3	In the same way, when the heart’s release by love has been developed and cultivated like this, any limited deeds they’ve done don’t remain or persist there. 
sn42.8:13.1	Then that noble disciple is rid of desire, rid of ill will, unconfused, aware, and mindful. They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion … 
sn42.8:13.2	They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing … 
sn42.8:13.3	They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth.

sn42.9:0.2	1. Chiefs 
sn42.9:0.3	9. Families 
sn42.9:1.1	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at Nāḷandā. 
sn42.9:1.2	There he stayed near Nālandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove. 
sn42.9:2.1	Now that was a time of famine and scarcity in Nāḷandā, with blighted crops turned to straw. 
sn42.9:2.2	At that time Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta was residing at Nāḷandā together with a large assembly of Jain ascetics. 
sn42.9:2.3	Then Asibandhaka’s son the chief, who was a disciple of the Jains, went up to Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, bowed, and sat down to one side. Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta said to him: 
sn42.9:2.4	“Come, chief, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine. 
sn42.9:2.5	Then you will get a good reputation: 
sn42.9:2.6	‘Asibandhaka’s son the chief refuted the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama, so mighty and powerful!’” 
sn42.9:3.1	“But sir, how am I to do this?” 
sn42.9:3.2	“Here, brahmin, go to the ascetic Gotama and say to him: 
sn42.9:3.3	‘Sir, don’t you in many ways praise kindness, protection, and compassion for families?’ 
sn42.9:3.4	When he’s asked this, if he answers: 
sn42.9:3.5	‘Indeed I do, chief,’ say this to him: 
sn42.9:3.6	‘So what exactly are you doing, wandering together with this large Saṅgha of mendicants during a time of famine and scarcity, with blighted crops turned to straw? 
sn42.9:3.7	The Buddha is practicing to annihilate, collapse, and ruin families!’ 
sn42.9:3.8	When you put this dilemma to him, the Buddha won’t be able to either spit it out or swallow it down.” 
sn42.9:3.9	“Yes, sir,” replied Asibandhaka’s son. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
sn42.9:4.1	“Sir, don’t you in many ways praise kindness, protection, and compassion for families?” 
sn42.9:4.2	“Indeed I do, chief.” 
sn42.9:4.3	“So what exactly are you doing, wandering together with this large Saṅgha of mendicants during a time of famine and scarcity, with blighted crops turned to straw? 
sn42.9:4.4	The Buddha is practicing to annihilate, collapse, and ruin families!” 
sn42.9:4.5	“Well, chief, I recollect ninety eons back but I’m not aware of any family that’s been ruined merely by offering some cooked almsfood. 
sn42.9:4.6	Rather, rich, affluent, and wealthy families—with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain—all acquired their wealth because of generosity, truth, and restraint. 
sn42.9:4.7	Chief, there are eight causes and conditions for the ruin of families. 
sn42.9:4.8	Their ruin stems from rulers, bandits, fire, or flood. Or their savings vanish. Or their business fails due to not applying themselves to work. Or a wastrel is born into the family who squanders and fritters away their wealth. And impermanence is the eighth. 
sn42.9:4.9	These are the eight causes and conditions for the ruin of families. 
sn42.9:4.10	Given that these eight reasons are found, suppose someone says this: 
sn42.9:4.11	‘The Buddha is practicing to annihilate, collapse, and ruin families!’ 
sn42.9:4.12	Unless they give up that speech and thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.”

sn44.10:1.1	Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. 
sn44.10:1.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: 
sn44.10:1.3	“Master Gotama, does the self exist absolutely?” 
sn44.10:1.4	But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent. 
sn44.10:1.5	“Then does the self not exist absolutely?” 
sn44.10:1.6	But for a second time the Buddha kept silent. 
sn44.10:1.7	Then the wanderer Vacchagotta got up from his seat and left. 
sn44.10:2.1	And then, not long after Vacchagotta had left, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha: 
sn44.10:2.2	“Sir, why didn’t you answer Vacchagotta’s question?” 
sn44.10:2.3	“Ānanda, when Vacchagotta asked me whether the self exists absolutely, if I had answered that ‘the self exists absolutely’ I would have been siding with the ascetics and brahmins who are eternalists. 
sn44.10:2.4	When Vacchagotta asked me whether the self does not exist absolutely, if I had answered that ‘the self does not exist absolutely’ I would have been siding with the ascetics and brahmins who are annihilationists. 
sn44.10:2.5	When Vacchagotta asked me whether the self exists absolutely, if I had answered that ‘the self exists absolutely’ would that have helped give rise to the knowledge that 
sn44.10:2.6	all things are not-self?” 
sn44.10:2.7	“No, sir.” 
sn44.10:2.8	“When Vacchagotta asked me whether the self does not exist absolutely, if I had answered that ‘the self does not exist absolutely’, Vacchagotta—who is already confused—would have got even more confused, thinking:

sn44.11:1.2	Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went up to him, and exchanged greetings with him. 
sn44.11:1.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and said to Sabhiya Kaccāna:

sn44.11:1.5	“Vaccha, this has not been declared by the Buddha.”

sn44.1:0.2	1. The Undeclared Points 
sn44.1:0.3	1. With Khemā 
sn44.1:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
sn44.1:1.2	Now at that time the nun Khemā was wandering in the land of the Kosalans between Sāvatthī and Sāketa when she took up residence in Toraṇavatthu. 
sn44.1:1.3	Then King Pasenadi was traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī, and he too stayed in Toraṇavatthu for a single night. 
sn44.1:1.4	Then King Pasenadi addressed a man, 
sn44.1:1.5	“Please, mister, check if there’s a suitable ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu to whom I can pay homage.” 
sn44.1:2.1	“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied that man. He searched all over Toraṇavatthu, but he couldn’t see a suitable ascetic or brahmin for the king to pay homage to. 
sn44.1:2.2	But he saw that the nun Khemā was staying there, 
sn44.1:2.3	so he went to the king and said to him, 
sn44.1:3.1	“Your Majesty, there’s no ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu for the king to pay homage to. 
sn44.1:3.2	But there is the nun Khemā, who’s a disciple of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. 
sn44.1:3.3	She has a good reputation as being 
sn44.1:3.4	astute, competent, clever, learned, a brilliant speaker, and eloquent. 
sn44.1:3.5	Your Majesty may pay homage to her.” 
sn44.1:4.1	Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the nun Khemā, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to her: 
sn44.1:4.2	“Ma’am, does a Realized One exist after death?” 
sn44.1:4.3	“Great king, this has not been declared by the Buddha.” 
sn44.1:4.4

sn44.1:6.1	“Well then, great king, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. 
sn44.1:6.2	What do you think, great king? 
sn44.1:6.3	Is there any accountant or finger-tallier or reckoner who can count the grains of sand in the Ganges, that is, 
sn44.1:6.4	how many grains of sand there are, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of grains of sand?” 
sn44.1:6.5	“No, ma’am.” 
sn44.1:6.6	“Is there any accountant or finger-tallier or reckoner who can count the water in the ocean, that is, 
sn44.1:6.7	how many gallons of water there are, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of gallons of water?” 
sn44.1:6.8	“No, ma’am. 
sn44.1:6.9	Why is that? 
sn44.1:6.10	Because the ocean is deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom.” 
sn44.1:6.11	“In the same way, great king, any form by which a Realized One might be described has been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. 
sn44.1:6.12	A Realized One is freed from reckoning in terms of form. They’re deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom, 
sn44.1:6.13	like the ocean. 
sn44.1:6.14	To say that after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist: none of these apply.

sn44.1:9.4	To say that after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist: none of these apply.” 
sn44.1:9.5	Then King Pasenadi approved and agreed with what the nun Khemā said. Then he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled her, keeping her on his right, before leaving. 
sn44.1:10.1	Then on a later occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. He asked the Buddha exactly the same questions he had asked the nun Khemā, and received the same answers.

sn44.2:0.2	1. The Undeclared Points 
sn44.2:0.3	2. With Anurādha 
sn44.2:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
sn44.2:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Anurādha was staying not far from the Buddha in a wilderness hut. 
sn44.2:1.3	Then several wanderers who follow other paths went up to Venerable Anurādha and exchanged greetings with him. 
sn44.2:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him: 
sn44.2:1.5	“Reverend Anurādha, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them in these four ways: 
sn44.2:1.6	After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.” 
sn44.2:1.7	“Reverends, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them other than these four ways: 
sn44.2:1.8	After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.” 
sn44.2:1.9	When he said this, the wanderers said to him, 
sn44.2:1.10	“This mendicant must be junior, recently gone forth, or else a foolish, incompetent senior mendicant.” 
sn44.2:1.11	Then, after rebuking Venerable Anurādha by calling him “junior” and “foolish”, the wanderers got up from their seat and left. 
sn44.2:2.1	Soon after they had left, Anurādha thought, 
sn44.2:2.2	“If those wanderers were to inquire further, 
sn44.2:2.3	how should I answer them so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should I explain in line with his teaching, so that there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?” 
sn44.2:2.4	Then Venerable Anurādha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.

sn44.9:1.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha: 
sn44.9:2.1	“Master Gotama, a few days ago several ascetics, brahmins, and wanderers who follow various other paths were sitting together in the debating hall, and this discussion came up among them: 
sn44.9:2.2	‘This Pūraṇa Kassapa leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. 
sn44.9:2.3	When a disciple passes away, he declares that 
sn44.9:2.4	this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there. 
sn44.9:2.5	And as for a disciple who is a supreme person, highest of people, having reached the highest point, when they pass away he also declares that 
sn44.9:2.6	this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there. 
sn44.9:3.1	This Makkhali Gosāla … 
sn44.9:3.2	Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta … 
sn44.9:3.3	Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta …

sn44.9:3.5	Ajita Kesakambala leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. 
sn44.9:3.6	When a disciple passes away, he declares that 
sn44.9:3.7	this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there. 
sn44.9:3.8	And as for a disciple who is a supreme person, highest of people, having reached the highest point, when they pass away he also declares that 
sn44.9:3.9	this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there. 
sn44.9:4.1	This ascetic Gotama leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. 
sn44.9:4.2	When a disciple passes away, he declares that 
sn44.9:4.3	this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there. 
sn44.9:4.4	But as for a disciple who is a supreme person, highest of people, having reached the highest point, when they pass away he doesn’t declare that 
sn44.9:4.5	this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there. 
sn44.9:4.6	Rather, he declares that they have 
sn44.9:4.7	cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit have made an end of suffering. 
sn44.9:4.8	I had doubt and uncertainty about that: 
sn44.9:4.9	‘How on earth can I understand the ascetic Gotama’s teaching?’” 
sn44.9:5.1	“Vaccha, no wonder you’re doubting and uncertain. 
sn44.9:5.2	Doubt has come up in you about an uncertain matter. 
sn44.9:5.3	I describe rebirth for someone who grasps fuel, not for someone who doesn’t grasp fuel. 
sn44.9:5.4	It’s like a fire which only burns with fuel, not without fuel. 
sn44.9:5.5	In the same way I describe rebirth for someone who grasps fuel, not for someone who doesn’t grasp fuel.” 
sn44.9:6.1	“But when a flame is blown away by the wind, what do you say is its fuel then?” 
sn44.9:6.2	“At such a time, I say that it’s fueled by wind. 
sn44.9:6.3	For the wind is its fuel then.” 
sn44.9:6.4	“But when someone who is attached has laid down this body and has not been reborn in one of the realms, what does Master Gotama say is their fuel then?” 
sn44.9:6.5	“When someone who is attached has laid down this body, Vaccha, and has not been reborn in one of the realms, I say they’re fueled by craving. 
sn44.9:6.6	For craving is their fuel then.”

sn45.8:10.4	And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’

sn46.30:0.3	30. With Udāyī 
sn46.30:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sumbhas, near the town of the Sumbhas called Sedaka. 
sn46.30:1.2	Then Venerable Udāyī went up to the Buddha … and said to him: 
sn46.30:2.1	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! 
sn46.30:2.2	How helpful my love and respect for the Buddha have been, and my sense of conscience and prudence. 
sn46.30:2.3	For when I was still a layman, I wasn’t helped much by the teaching or the Saṅgha. 
sn46.30:2.4	But when I considered my love and respect for the Buddha, and my sense of conscience and prudence, I went forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
sn46.30:2.5	The Buddha taught me the Dhamma: 
sn46.30:2.6	‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. 
sn46.30:2.7	Such is feeling … 
sn46.30:2.8	Such is perception … 
sn46.30:2.9	Such are choices … 
sn46.30:2.10	Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ 
sn46.30:3.1	Then, while staying in an empty hut, I followed the churning of the five grasping aggregates. I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. 
sn46.30:3.2	I comprehended the teaching; I acquired the path. 
sn46.30:3.3	When developed and cultivated as I’m living in such a way, it will bring me to such a state that I will understand: 
sn46.30:3.4	‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
sn46.30:4.1	I acquired the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. 
sn46.30:4.2	 
sn46.30:4.3	When developed and cultivated as I’m living in such a way, they will bring me to such a state that I will understand: 
sn46.30:4.4	‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ 
sn46.30:4.5	This is the path that I acquired. When developed and cultivated as I’m living in such a way, it will bring me to such a state that I will understand: 
sn46.30:4.6	‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”

sn46.54:0.3	54. Full of Love 
sn46.54:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where they have a town called Haliddavasana. 
sn46.54:1.2	Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Haliddavasana for alms. 
sn46.54:1.3	Then it occurred to him, 
sn46.54:1.4	“It’s too early to wander for alms in Haliddavasana. 
sn46.54:1.5	Why don’t we go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths?” 
sn46.54:2.1	Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. 
sn46.54:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them: 
sn46.54:3.1	“Reverends, the ascetic Gotama teaches his disciples like this: 
sn46.54:3.2	‘Come, mendicants, give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom, and meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. 
sn46.54:3.3	Meditate spreading a heart full of compassion to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of compassion to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. 
sn46.54:3.4	Meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of rejoicing to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. 
sn46.54:3.5	Meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.’

sn46.54:4.7	What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?” 
sn46.54:5.1	Those mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers who follow other paths. 
sn46.54:5.2	They got up from their seat, thinking: 
sn46.54:5.3	“We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.” 
sn46.54:5.4	Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.

sn46.54:11.6	Questioned like this, the wanderers who follow other paths would be stumped, and, in addition, would get frustrated. 
sn46.54:11.7	Why is that? 
sn46.54:11.8	Because they’re out of their element.

sn47.10:7.5	That mendicant should direct their mind towards an inspiring foundation. 
sn47.10:7.6	As they do so, joy springs up. 
sn47.10:7.7	Being joyful, rapture springs up. 
sn47.10:7.8	When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. 
sn47.10:7.9	When the body is tranquil, one feels bliss. 
sn47.10:7.10	And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. 
sn47.10:7.11	Then they reflect: 
sn47.10:7.12	‘I have accomplished the goal for which I directed my mind. 
sn47.10:7.13	Let me now pull back.’ 
sn47.10:7.14	They pull back, and neither place the mind nor keep it connected. 
sn47.10:7.15	They understand: ‘I’m neither placing the mind nor keeping it connected. Mindful within myself, I’m happy.’ 
sn47.10:7.16	That’s how there is directed development. 
sn47.10:8.1	And how is there undirected development? 
sn47.10:8.2	Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’ 
sn47.10:8.3	And they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’ 
sn47.10:8.4	And they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’ 
sn47.10:8.5	Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’

sn47.10:8.14	That’s how there is undirected development. 
sn47.10:9.1	So, Ānanda, I’ve taught you directed development and undirected development. 
sn47.10:9.2	Out of compassion, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples. 
sn47.10:9.3	Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, mendicants! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.”

sn47.12:1.4	I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.” 
sn47.12:1.5	“That’s a grand and dramatic statement, Sāriputta. You’ve roared a definitive, categorical lion’s roar, saying: 
sn47.12:1.6	‘I have such confidence in the Buddha that 
sn47.12:1.7	I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.’

sn47.12:2.2	those Buddhas had such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?” 
sn47.12:2.3	“No, sir.” 
sn47.12:3.1	“And what about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future? Have you comprehended their minds to know that 
sn47.12:3.2	those Buddhas will have such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?”

sn47.12:6.2	still I understand this by inference from the teaching. 
sn47.12:6.3	Suppose there was a king’s frontier citadel with fortified embankments, ramparts, and arches, and a single gate. 
sn47.12:6.4	And it has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and intelligent. He keeps strangers out and lets known people in. 
sn47.12:6.5	As he walks around the patrol path, he doesn’t see a hole or cleft in the wall, not even one big enough for a cat to slip out. 
sn47.12:6.6	He thinks, 
sn47.12:6.7	‘Whatever sizable creatures enter or leave the citadel, all of them do so via this gate.’ 
sn47.12:6.8	In the same way, I understand this by inference from the teaching: 
sn47.12:6.9	‘All the perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas—whether past, future, or present—give up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Their mind is firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They correctly develop the seven awakening factors. And they wake up to the supreme perfect awakening.’”

sn47.13:4.5	Since I heard this, my body feels like it’s drugged. I’m disorientated, and the teachings don’t spring to mind.”

sn47.13:6.1	“Ānanda, did I not prepare for this when I explained that 
sn47.13:6.2	we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved? 
sn47.13:6.3	How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to fall apart should not fall apart?

sn47.43:1.3	“Mendicants, at one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. 
sn47.43:1.4	As I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: 
sn47.43:1.5	‘The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.
sn47.43:2.1	What four?

sn47.43:3.1	And then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what I was thinking, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of me. 
sn47.43:3.2	He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: 
sn47.43:3.3	‘That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!

sn47.9:0.2	1. In Ambapālī’s Wood 
sn47.9:0.3	9. Sick 
sn47.9:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn47.9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the little village of Beluva. 
sn47.9:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
sn47.9:1.4	“Mendicants, please enter the rainy season residence with whatever friends or acquaintances you have around Vesālī. 
sn47.9:1.5	I’ll commence the rainy season residence right here in the little village of Beluva.” 
sn47.9:1.6	“Yes, sir,” those mendicants replied. They did as the Buddha said, 
sn47.9:1.7	while the Buddha commenced the rainy season residence right there in the little village of Beluva. 
sn47.9:2.1	After the Buddha had commenced the rainy season residence, he fell severely ill, struck by dreadful pains, close to death. 
sn47.9:2.2	But he endured unperturbed, with mindfulness and situational awareness. 
sn47.9:2.3	Then it occurred to the Buddha: 
sn47.9:2.4	“It would not be appropriate for me to become fully extinguished before informing my attendants and taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha. 
sn47.9:2.5	Why don’t I forcefully suppress this illness, stabilize the life force, and live on?” 
sn47.9:2.6	So that is what he did. 
sn47.9:2.7	Then the Buddha’s illness died down. 
sn47.9:3.1	Soon after the Buddha had recovered from that sickness, he left his dwelling and sat in the shade of the porch on the seat spread out. 
sn47.9:3.2	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
sn47.9:3.3	“Sir, it’s fantastic that the Buddha is comfortable, 
sn47.9:3.4	that he’s well, 
sn47.9:3.5	and that he’s alright. 
sn47.9:3.6	Because when the Buddha was sick, my body felt like it was drugged. I was disorientated, and the teachings didn’t spring to mind. 
sn47.9:3.7	Still, at least I was consoled by the thought that 
sn47.9:3.8	the Buddha won’t become fully extinguished without making some statement regarding the Saṅgha of mendicants.” 
sn47.9:4.1	“But what could the mendicant Saṅgha expect from me now, Ānanda? 
sn47.9:4.2	I’ve taught the Dhamma without making any distinction between secret and public teachings. 
sn47.9:4.3	The Realized One doesn’t have the closed fist of a teacher when it comes to the teachings. 
sn47.9:4.4	If there’s anyone who thinks: 
sn47.9:4.5	‘I’ll take charge of the Saṅgha of mendicants,’ or ‘the Saṅgha of mendicants is meant for me,’ let them make a statement regarding the Saṅgha. 
sn47.9:4.6	But the Realized One doesn’t think like this, 
sn47.9:4.7	 
sn47.9:4.8	so why should he make some statement regarding the Saṅgha? 
sn47.9:4.9	Now I am old, elderly and senior. I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life. 
sn47.9:4.10	I’m currently eighty years old. 
sn47.9:4.11	Just as a decrepit cart keeps going by relying on straps, 
sn47.9:4.12	in the same way, the Realized One’s body keeps going by relying on straps, or so you’d think. 
sn47.9:5.1	Sometimes the Realized One, not focusing on any signs, and with the cessation of certain feelings, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart. Only then does the Realized One’s body become more comfortable. 
sn47.9:5.2	So Ānanda, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge. 
sn47.9:6.1	And how does a mendicant do this? 
sn47.9:6.2	It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 
sn47.9:6.3	They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … 
sn47.9:6.4	mind … 
sn47.9:6.5	principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 
sn47.9:6.6	That’s how a mendicant lives as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how the teaching is their island and their refuge, with no other refuge. 
sn47.9:6.7	Whether now or after I have passed, any who shall live as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the teaching as their island and their refuge, with no other refuge—those mendicants of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the best.”

sn48.10:1.1	“Mendicants, there are these five faculties. 
sn48.10:1.2	What five? 
sn48.10:1.3	The faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. 
sn48.10:1.4	And what is the faculty of faith? 
sn48.10:1.5	It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening: 
sn48.10:1.6	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
sn48.10:1.7	This is called the faculty of faith. 
sn48.10:2.1	And what is the faculty of energy? 
sn48.10:2.2	It’s when a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. 
sn48.10:2.3	They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise. 
sn48.10:2.4	They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up. 
sn48.10:2.5	They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities arise. 
sn48.10:2.6	They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are completed by development. 
sn48.10:2.7	This is called the faculty of energy. 
sn48.10:3.1	And what is the faculty of mindfulness? 
sn48.10:3.2	It’s when a noble disciple is mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago. 
sn48.10:3.3	They meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 
sn48.10:3.4	They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … 
sn48.10:3.5	mind … 
sn48.10:3.6	principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 
sn48.10:3.7	This is called the faculty of mindfulness. 
sn48.10:4.1	And what is the faculty of immersion? 
sn48.10:4.2	It’s when a noble disciple, relying on letting go, gains immersion, gains unification of mind. 
sn48.10:4.3	Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
sn48.10:4.4	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
sn48.10:4.5	And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ 
sn48.10:4.6	Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. 
sn48.10:4.7	This is called the faculty of immersion. 
sn48.10:5.1	And what is the faculty of wisdom? 
sn48.10:5.2	It’s when a noble disciple is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. 
sn48.10:5.3	They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. 
sn48.10:5.4	This is called the faculty of wisdom.

sn48.41:2.1	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and while massaging the Buddha’s limbs he said: 
sn48.41:2.2	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing,

sn48.42:1.1	At Sāvatthī. 
sn48.42:1.2	Then Uṇṇābha the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
sn48.42:1.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: 
sn48.42:2.1	“Master Gotama, these five faculties have different scopes and different ranges, and don’t experience each others’ scope and range. 
sn48.42:2.2	What five? 
sn48.42:2.3	The faculties of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body.

sn48.42:4.1	“But Master Gotama, what does the mind have recourse to?” 
sn48.42:4.2	“The mind has recourse to mindfulness.” 
sn48.42:4.3	“But what does mindfulness have recourse to?” 
sn48.42:4.4	“Mindfulness has recourse to freedom.” 
sn48.42:4.5	“But what does freedom have recourse to?” 
sn48.42:4.6	“Freedom has recourse to extinguishment.” 
sn48.42:4.7	“But what does extinguishment have recourse to?” 
sn48.42:4.8	“This question goes too far, brahmin! You weren’t able to grasp the limit of questioning. 
sn48.42:4.9	For extinguishment is the culmination, destination, and end of the spiritual life.” 
sn48.42:5.1	And then the brahmin Uṇṇābha approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 
sn48.42:6.1	Then, not long after he had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
sn48.42:6.2	“Suppose there was a bungalow or a hall with a peaked roof, with windows on the eastern side. When the sun rises and a ray of light enters through a window, where would it land?” 
sn48.42:6.3	“On the western wall, sir.” 
sn48.42:6.4	“In the same way, the brahmin Uṇṇābha’s faith in the Realized One is settled, rooted, and planted deep. It’s strong and can’t be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.

sn48.53:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn48.53:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. 
sn48.53:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
sn48.53:1.4	“Mendicants, is there a way that a mendicant who is a trainee, standing at the level of a trainee, can understand that they are a trainee? And that a mendicant who is an adept, standing at the level of an adept, can understand that they are an adept?” 
sn48.53:2.1	“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. …” 
sn48.53:2.2	“There is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee, standing at the level of a trainee, can understand that they are a trainee, and that a mendicant who is an adept, standing at the level of an adept, can understand that they are an adept. 
sn48.53:3.1	And what is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee? 
sn48.53:3.2	It’s when a mendicant who is a trainee truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. 
sn48.53:3.3	This is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee. 
sn48.53:4.1	Furthermore, a mendicant who is a trainee reflects: 
sn48.53:4.2	‘Is there any other ascetic or brahmin elsewhere whose teaching is as true, as real, as accurate as that of the Buddha?’ 
sn48.53:4.3	They understand: 
sn48.53:4.4	‘There is no other ascetic or brahmin elsewhere whose teaching is as true, as real, as accurate as that of the Buddha.’ 
sn48.53:4.5	This too is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee. 
sn48.53:5.1	Furthermore, a mendicant who is a trainee understands the five faculties: 
sn48.53:5.2	faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. 
sn48.53:5.3	And although they don’t have direct meditative experience of their destination, apex, fruit, and culmination, 
sn48.53:5.4	they do see them with penetrating wisdom. 
sn48.53:5.5	This too is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee. 
sn48.53:6.1	And what is the way that a mendicant who is an adept can understand that they are an adept? 
sn48.53:6.2	It’s when a mendicant who is an adept understands the five faculties:

sn48.53:6.5	and they see them with penetrating wisdom. 
sn48.53:6.6	This is a way that a mendicant who is an adept can understand that they are an adept. 
sn48.53:7.1	Furthermore, a mendicant who is an adept understands the six faculties: 
sn48.53:7.2	eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. 
sn48.53:7.3	They understand: ‘These six faculties will totally and utterly cease without anything left over. And no other six faculties will arise anywhere anyhow.’ 
sn48.53:7.4	This too is a way that a mendicant who is an adept can understand that they are an adept.”

sn48.57:1.1	At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. 
sn48.57:1.2	Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, 
sn48.57:1.3	“When these five faculties are developed and cultivated they culminate, finish, and end in the deathless.

sn48.57:2.1	Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. 
sn48.57:2.2	He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:

sn5.3:2.2	as if your children have died? 
sn5.3:2.3	You’ve come to the woods all alone—
sn5.3:2.4	you must be looking for a man!”

sn5.3:3.3	Then she thought,

sn5.3:5.2	and I’m finished with men. 
sn5.3:5.3	I don’t grieve or lament,

sn5.3:6.1	Relishing is destroyed in every respect,

sn5.5:1.4	Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the nun Uppalavaṇṇā feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make her fall away from immersion, went up to her and addressed her in verse:

sn5.5:2.3	Your beauty is second to none;

sn5.5:4.2	were to come here, 
sn5.5:4.3	I’d stir not a hair nor panic. 
sn5.5:4.4	I’m not scared of you, Māra, even alone. 
sn5.5:5.1	I’ll vanish,

sn51.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
sn51.10:1.3	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms. 
sn51.10:1.4	Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Ānanda:

sn51.10:1.6	Let’s go to the Cāpāla shrine for the day’s meditation.” 
sn51.10:1.7	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha. 
sn51.10:2.1	Then the Buddha went up to the Cāpāla shrine, and sat down on the seat spread out. 
sn51.10:2.2	Ānanda bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. 
sn51.10:2.3	The Buddha said to him: 
sn51.10:3.1	“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla shrines are all lovely. 
sn51.10:3.2	Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon. 
sn51.10:3.3	The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.” 
sn51.10:4.1	But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. 
sn51.10:4.2	He didn’t beg the Buddha, 
sn51.10:4.3	“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra. 
sn51.10:5.1	For a second time … 
sn51.10:5.2	and for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda: 
sn51.10:5.3	“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla shrines are all lovely. 
sn51.10:5.4	Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon. 
sn51.10:5.5	The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.” 
sn51.10:6.1	But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. 
sn51.10:6.2	He didn’t beg the Buddha, 
sn51.10:6.3	“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra. 
sn51.10:7.1	Then the Buddha said to him, 
sn51.10:7.2	“Go now, Ānanda, 
sn51.10:7.3	at your convenience.” 
sn51.10:7.4	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He rose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before sitting at the root of a tree close by. 
sn51.10:8.1	And then, not long after Ānanda had left, Māra the Wicked went up to the the Buddha and said to him: 
sn51.10:9.1	“Sir, may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. 
sn51.10:9.2	Sir, you once made this statement: 
sn51.10:9.3	‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and practice in line with the teachings. Not until they practice properly, living in line with the teaching. Not until they’ve learned their teacher’s doctrine, and explain, teach, assert, establish, disclose, analyze, and make it clear. Not until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis.’ 
sn51.10:10.1	Today you do have such monk disciples. 
sn51.10:10.2	May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. 
sn51.10:11.1	Sir, you once made this statement: 
sn51.10:11.2	‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have nun disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ … 
sn51.10:12.1	Today you do have such nun disciples. 
sn51.10:12.2	May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. 
sn51.10:13.1	Sir, you once made this statement: 
sn51.10:13.2	‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have layman disciples … 
sn51.10:13.3	and laywoman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ … 
sn51.10:14.1	Today you do have such layman 
sn51.10:14.2	and laywoman disciples. 
sn51.10:14.3	May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. 
sn51.10:15.1	Sir, you once made this statement: 
sn51.10:15.2	‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until my spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.’ 
sn51.10:15.3	Today your spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans. 
sn51.10:15.4	May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.” 
sn51.10:16.1	When this was said, the Buddha said to Māra, 
sn51.10:16.2	“Relax, Wicked One. The final extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon. 
sn51.10:16.3	Three months from now the Realized One will finally be extinguished.” 
sn51.10:17.1	So at the Cāpāla tree shrine the Buddha, mindful and aware, surrendered the life force. 
sn51.10:17.2	When he did so there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky. 
sn51.10:17.3	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
sn51.10:18.1	“Weighing up the incomparable against an extension of life, 
sn51.10:18.2	the sage surrendered the life force. 
sn51.10:18.3	Happy inside, serene,

sn51.11:1.2	“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought: 
sn51.11:1.3	‘What’s the cause, what’s the reason for the development of the bases of psychic power?’ 
sn51.11:1.4	Then it occurred to me: 
sn51.11:1.5	‘It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort.

sn51.11:4.7	And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance.’ 
sn51.11:5.1	When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm. 
sn51.11:6.1	When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far. 
sn51.11:7.1	When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind.
sn51.11:7.2	They understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’,

sn51.11:7.17	They understand unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’.
sn51.11:8.1	When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. 
sn51.11:9.1	When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. 
sn51.11:10.1	When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.”

sn51.14:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn51.14:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. 
sn51.14:1.3	Now at that time several mendicants were staying beneath the longhouse. They were restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties. 
sn51.14:2.1	Then the Buddha addressed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, 
sn51.14:2.2	“These spiritual companions of yours staying beneath the longhouse are restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with wandering mind and undisciplined faculties. 
sn51.14:2.3	Go, Moggallāna, and strike awe in those mendicants!” 
sn51.14:3.1	“Yes, sir,” replied Mahāmoggallāna. Then he used his psychic power to make the longhouse shake and rock and tremble with his toe. 
sn51.14:3.2	Then those mendicants stood to one side, shocked and awestruck. 
sn51.14:3.3	“It’s incredible, it’s amazing! 
sn51.14:3.4	There’s no wind at all; and this stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother has deep foundations. It’s firmly embedded, imperturbable and unshakable. And yet it shakes and rocks and trembles!” 
sn51.14:4.1	Then the Buddha went up to those mendicants and said: 
sn51.14:4.2	“Why do you, mendicants, stand to one side, shocked and awestruck?” 
sn51.14:4.3	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!

sn51.15:4.16	“Yes, sir.” 
sn51.15:5.1	“In the same way, take a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment.

sn51.15:6.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Ānanda has made the teaching clear in many ways.

sn52.8:1.1	At one time Venerable Anuruddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the frankincense-tree hut. 
sn52.8:1.2	There Venerable Anuruddha addressed the mendicants: 
sn52.8:1.3	“Reverends, suppose that, although the Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east, 
sn52.8:1.4	a large crowd were to come along with a spade and basket, saying: 
sn52.8:1.5	‘We’ll make this Ganges river slant, slope, and incline to the west!’ 
sn52.8:1.6	What do you think, reverends? Would they succeed?” 
sn52.8:1.7	“No, reverend. 
sn52.8:1.8	Why is that? 
sn52.8:1.9	The Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east. 
sn52.8:1.10	It’s not easy to make it slant, slope, and incline to the west. 
sn52.8:1.11	That large crowd will eventually get weary and frustrated.” 
sn52.8:2.1	“In the same way, while a mendicant develops and cultivates the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, if rulers or their ministers, friends or colleagues, relatives or family should invite them to accept wealth, saying: 
sn52.8:2.2	‘Please, mister, why let these ocher robes torment you? 
sn52.8:2.3	Why follow the practice of shaving your head and carrying an alms bowl? 
sn52.8:2.4	Come, return to a lesser life, enjoy wealth, and make merit!’ 
sn52.8:3.1	It’s simply impossible for a mendicant who is developing and cultivating the four kinds of mindfulness meditation to resign the training and return to a lesser life. 
sn52.8:3.2	Why is that? 
sn52.8:3.3	Because for a long time that mendicant’s mind has slanted, sloped, and inclined to seclusion. So it’s impossible for them to return to a lesser life. 
sn52.8:3.4	And how does a mendicant develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation? 
sn52.8:3.5	It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body …

sn52.8:3.7	mind … 
sn52.8:3.8	principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.

sn52.9:1.2	Then in the late afternoon, Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Anuruddha, and said to him:

sn52.9:2.2	What kind of meditation are you usually practicing these days?” 
sn52.9:2.3	“These days, reverend, I usually meditate with my mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.

sn53.1-12:1.6	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. 
sn53.1-12:1.7	And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’

sn54.10:0.3	10. With Kimbila 
sn54.10:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn54.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kimbilā in the Freshwater Mangrove Wood. 
sn54.10:1.3	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Kimbila, 
sn54.10:1.4	“Kimbila, how is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is very fruitful and beneficial?” 
sn54.10:2.1	When he said this, Kimbila kept silent. 
sn54.10:2.2	For a second time … 
sn54.10:2.3	And for a third time, the Buddha said to him, 
sn54.10:2.4	“How is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is very fruitful and beneficial?” 
sn54.10:2.5	And a second time and a third time Kimbila kept silent. 
sn54.10:3.1	When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, 
sn54.10:3.2	“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! 
sn54.10:3.3	Let the Buddha speak on immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” 
sn54.10:4.1	“Well then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
sn54.10:4.2	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. 
sn54.10:4.3	The Buddha said this: 
sn54.10:4.4	“Ānanda, how is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is very fruitful and beneficial? 
sn54.10:4.5	It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establishes mindfulness right there. 
sn54.10:4.6	Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. … 
sn54.10:4.7	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ 
sn54.10:4.8	That’s how immersion due to mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated, is very fruitful and beneficial. 
sn54.10:5.1	When a mendicant is breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ 
sn54.10:5.2	When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’ 
sn54.10:5.3	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the whole body.’ 
sn54.10:5.4	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the physical process.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the physical process.’ 
sn54.10:5.5	At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 
sn54.10:5.6	Why is that? 
sn54.10:5.7	Because the breath is a certain aspect of the body, I say. 
sn54.10:5.8	Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 
sn54.10:6.1	There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing rapture.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing rapture.’ 
sn54.10:6.2	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing bliss.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing bliss.’ 
sn54.10:6.3	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the mental processes.’ 
sn54.10:6.4	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the mental processes.’ 
sn54.10:6.5	At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 
sn54.10:6.6	Why is that? 
sn54.10:6.7	Because close focus on the breath is a certain aspect of feelings, I say. 
sn54.10:6.8	Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 
sn54.10:7.1	There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the mind.’ 
sn54.10:7.2	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in gladdening the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out gladdening the mind.’ 
sn54.10:7.3	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in immersing the mind in samādhi.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out immersing the mind in samādhi.’ 
sn54.10:7.4	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in freeing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out freeing the mind.’ 
sn54.10:7.5	At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 
sn54.10:7.6	Why is that? 
sn54.10:7.7	Because there is no development of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing for someone who is unmindful and lacks awareness, I say. 
sn54.10:7.8	Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 
sn54.10:8.1	There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing impermanence.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing impermanence.’ 
sn54.10:8.2	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing fading away.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing fading away.’ 
sn54.10:8.3	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing cessation.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing cessation.’ 
sn54.10:8.4	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ 
sn54.10:8.5	At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 
sn54.10:8.6	Having seen with wisdom the giving up of desire and aversion, they watch closely over with equanimity. 
sn54.10:8.7	Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 
sn54.10:9.1	Suppose there was a large heap of sand at the crossroads. 
sn54.10:9.2	And a cart or chariot were to come by from the east, 
sn54.10:9.3	west, 
sn54.10:9.4	north, 
sn54.10:9.5	or south and destroy that heap of sand. 
sn54.10:9.6	In the same way, when a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body, 
sn54.10:9.7	feelings, 
sn54.10:9.8	mind, 
sn54.10:9.9	or principles, they destroy bad, unskillful qualities.”

sn54.11:0.3	11. Icchānaṅgala 
sn54.11:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. 
sn54.11:1.2	There he addressed the mendicants, 
sn54.11:1.3	“Mendicants, I wish to go on retreat for three months. 
sn54.11:1.4	No-one should approach me, except for the one who brings my almsfood.” 
sn54.11:1.5	“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. And no-one approached him, except for the one who brought the almsfood. 
sn54.11:2.1	Then after three months had passed, the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants: 
sn54.11:2.2	“Mendicants, if wanderers who follow another path were to ask you: 
sn54.11:2.3	‘Reverends, what was the ascetic Gotama’s usual meditation during the rainy season residence?’ You should answer them like this. 
sn54.11:2.4	‘Reverends, the ascetic Gotama’s usual meditation during the rainy season residence was immersion due to mindfulness of breathing.’ 
sn54.11:2.5	In this regard: mindful, I breathe in. Mindful, I breathe out. 
sn54.11:2.6	When breathing in heavily I know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily I know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ 
sn54.11:2.7	When breathing in lightly I know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly I know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’ 
sn54.11:2.8	I know: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ … 
sn54.11:2.9	I know: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ I know: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ 
sn54.11:3.1	For if anything should be rightly called 
sn54.11:3.2	‘the meditation of a noble one’, or else ‘the meditation of a Brahmā’, or else ‘the meditation of a realized one’, 
sn54.11:3.3	it’s immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 
sn54.11:3.4	 
sn54.11:3.5	For those mendicants who are trainees—who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary—the development and cultivation of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing leads to the ending of defilements. 
sn54.11:3.6	For those mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment—the development and cultivation of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing leads to blissful meditation in the present life, and to mindfulness and awareness.

sn54.12:0.3	12. In Doubt 
sn54.12:1.1	At one time Venerable Lomasavaṅgīsa was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. 
sn54.12:1.2	Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to Venerable Lomasavaṅgīsa, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
sn54.12:1.3	“Sir, is the meditation of a trainee just the same as the meditation of a Realized One? Or is the meditation of a trainee different from the meditation of a Realized One?” 
sn54.12:2.1	“Reverend Mahānāma, the meditation of a trainee and a realized one are not the same; 
sn54.12:2.2	they are different. 
sn54.12:2.3	Those mendicants who are trainees haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring for the supreme sanctuary. They meditate after giving up the five hindrances. 
sn54.12:2.4	What five? 
sn54.12:2.5	The hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, 
sn54.12:2.6	dullness and drowsiness,

sn54.12:4.2	What five? 
sn54.12:4.3	The hindrances of sensual desire, 
sn54.12:4.4	ill will,

sn54.6:2.3	listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
sn54.6:2.4	“Yes, sir,” Ariṭṭha replied.

sn54.6:3.2	It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut. They sit down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there.

sn54.9:0.2	1. One Thing 
sn54.9:0.3	9. At Vesālī 
sn54.9:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn54.9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 
sn54.9:1.3	Now at that time the Buddha spoke in many ways to the mendicants about the meditation on ugliness. He praised the meditation on ugliness and its development. 
sn54.9:2.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, 
sn54.9:2.2	“Mendicants, I wish to go on retreat for a fortnight. 
sn54.9:2.3	No-one should approach me, except for the one who brings my almsfood.” 
sn54.9:2.4	“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. And no-one approached him, except for the one who brought the almsfood. 
sn54.9:3.1	Then those mendicants thought, 
sn54.9:3.2	“The Buddha spoke in many ways about the meditation on ugliness. He praised the meditation on ugliness and its development.” They committed themselves to developing the many different facets of the meditation on ugliness. 
sn54.9:3.3	Becoming horrified, repelled, and disgusted with this body, they looked for someone to slit their wrists. 
sn54.9:3.4	Each day ten, twenty, or thirty mendicants slit their wrists. 
sn54.9:4.1	Then after a fortnight had passed, the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed Ānanda, 
sn54.9:4.2	“Ānanda, why does the mendicant Saṅgha seem so diminished?” 
sn54.9:4.3	Ānanda told the Buddha all that had happened, and said, 
sn54.9:4.4	 
sn54.9:4.5	 
sn54.9:4.6	“Sir, please explain another way for the mendicant Saṅgha to get enlightened.” 
sn54.9:5.1	“Well then, Ānanda, gather all the mendicants staying in the vicinity of Vesālī together in the assembly hall.” 
sn54.9:5.2	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He did what the Buddha asked, went up to him, and said, 
sn54.9:5.3	“Sir, the mendicant Saṅgha has assembled. 
sn54.9:5.4	Please, sir, come at your convenience.” 
sn54.9:6.1	Then the Buddha went to the assembly hall, sat down on the seat spread out, 
sn54.9:6.2	and addressed the mendicants: 
sn54.9:6.3	“Mendicants, when this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s peaceful and sublime, a deliciously pleasant meditation. And it disperses and settles unskillful qualities on the spot whenever they arise. 
sn54.9:7.1	In the last month of summer, when the dust and dirt is stirred up, a large sudden storm disperses and settles it on the spot. 
sn54.9:7.2	In the same way, when this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s peaceful and sublime, a deliciously pleasant meditation. And it disperses and settles unskillful qualities on the spot whenever they arise. 
sn54.9:7.3	And how is it so developed and cultivated? 
sn54.9:8.1	It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and focuses their mindfulness right there. 
sn54.9:8.2	Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. … 
sn54.9:8.3	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ 
sn54.9:8.4	That’s how this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated so that it’s peaceful and sublime, a deliciously pleasant meditation. And it disperses and settles unskillful qualities on the spot whenever they arise.”

sn55.10:3.2	More than ninety laymen in Nādika have passed away having ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. They’re once-returners, who will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. 
sn55.10:3.3	In excess of five hundred laymen in Nādika have passed away having ended three fetters. They’re stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. 
sn55.10:4.1	It’s hardly surprising that a human being should pass away.

sn55.10:4.4	‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’

sn55.1:1.1	At Sāvatthī. 
sn55.1:1.2	There the Buddha … said: 
sn55.1:1.3	“Mendicants, suppose a wheel-turning monarch were to rule as sovereign lord over these four continents. And when his body breaks up, after death, he’s reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three. There he entertains himself in the Garden of Delight, escorted by a band of nymphs, and supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation. Still, as he’s lacking four things, he’s not exempt from hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm. He’s not exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld. 
sn55.1:1.4	Now suppose a noble disciple wears rags and feeds on scraps of almsfood. Still, as they have four things, they’re exempt from hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld. 
sn55.1:2.1	What four? 
sn55.1:2.2	It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha: 
sn55.1:2.3	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
sn55.1:2.4	They have experiential confidence in the teaching: 
sn55.1:2.5	‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ 
sn55.1:2.6	They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: 
sn55.1:2.7	‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ 
sn55.1:2.8	Furthermore, a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. 
sn55.1:2.9	These are the four factors of stream-entry that they have. 
sn55.1:2.10	And, mendicants, gaining these four continents is not worth a sixteenth part of gaining these four things.”

sn55.26:4.2	“I hope you’re keeping well, householder; I hope you’re alright. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”

sn55.28:4.2	A noble disciple properly attends to dependent origination itself: 
sn55.28:4.3	‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. 
sn55.28:4.4	When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases.' That is: 
sn55.28:4.5	Ignorance is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are a condition for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition that gives rise to old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 
sn55.28:4.6	That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. 
sn55.28:4.7	When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. 
sn55.28:4.8	That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases. 
sn55.28:4.9	This is the noble cycle that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom.

sn55.5:2.3	“Sir, the stream is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: 
sn55.5:2.4	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.”

sn55.6:0.3	6. The Chamberlains 
sn55.6:1.1	At Sāvatthī 
sn55.6:1.2	At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that 
sn55.6:1.3	when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering. 
sn55.6:1.4	Now at that time the chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa were residing in Sādhuka on some business. 
sn55.6:1.5	They heard about this. 
sn55.6:1.6	 
sn55.6:1.7	 
sn55.6:2.1	So they posted someone on the road, saying: 
sn55.6:2.2	“My good man, let us know when you see the Blessed One coming, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.” 
sn55.6:2.3	And that person stood there for two or three days before they saw the Buddha coming off in the distance. 
sn55.6:2.4	When they saw him, they went to the chamberlains and said: 
sn55.6:2.5	“Sirs, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is coming. 
sn55.6:2.6	Please come at your convenience.” 
sn55.6:3.1	Then the chamberlains went up to the Buddha, bowed, and followed behind him. 
sn55.6:3.2	And then the Buddha left the road, went to the root of a certain tree, and sat down on the seat spread out. 
sn55.6:3.3	The chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa bowed, sat down to one side, 
sn55.6:3.4	and said to the Buddha: 
sn55.6:4.1	“Sir, when we hear that

sn55.6:14.4	“What is that?” 
sn55.6:15.1	“Sir, it’s when King Pasenadi of Kosala wants to go and visit a park. We have to harness and prepare his royal elephants. Then we have to seat his dear and beloved wives on the elephants, one in front of us, and one behind.

sn55.7:0.2	1. At Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:0.3	7. The People of Bamboo Gate 
sn55.7:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn55.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Bamboo Gate. 
sn55.7:1.3	The brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate heard: 
sn55.7:1.4	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Bamboo Gate, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. 
sn55.7:1.5	He has this good reputation: 
sn55.7:1.6	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
sn55.7:1.7	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. 
sn55.7:1.8	He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
sn55.7:1.9	It’s good to see such perfected ones.” 
sn55.7:2.1	Then the brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Seated to one side they said to the Buddha: 
sn55.7:2.2	“Master Gotama, these are our wishes, desires, and hopes. 
sn55.7:2.3	We wish to live at home with our children; to use sandalwood imported from Kāsi; to wear garlands, perfumes, and makeup; and to accept gold and money. And when our body breaks up, after death, we wish to be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. 
sn55.7:2.4	Given that we have such wishes, may the Buddha teach us the Dhamma so that we may achieve them.” 
sn55.7:3.1	“Householders, I will teach you an explanation of the Dhamma that applies to oneself. 
sn55.7:3.2	Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
sn55.7:3.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied. 
sn55.7:3.4	The Buddha said this: 
sn55.7:4.1	“And what is the explanation of the Dhamma that applies to oneself? 
sn55.7:4.2	It’s when a noble disciple reflects: 
sn55.7:4.3	‘I want to live and don’t want to die; I want to be happy and recoil from pain. 
sn55.7:4.4	Since this is so, if someone were to take my life, I wouldn’t like that. 
sn55.7:4.5	But others also want to live and don’t want to die; they want to be happy and recoil from pain. So if I were to take the life of someone else, they wouldn’t like that either. 
sn55.7:4.6	The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others. 
sn55.7:4.7	Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on someone else?’ 
sn55.7:4.8	Reflecting in this way, they give up killing living creatures themselves. And they encourage others to give up killing living creatures, praising the giving up of killing living creatures. 
sn55.7:4.9	So their bodily behavior is purified in three points. 
sn55.7:5.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: 
sn55.7:5.2	‘If someone were to steal from me, I wouldn’t like that. 
sn55.7:5.3	But if I were to steal from someone else, they wouldn’t like that either. 
sn55.7:5.4	The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others. 
sn55.7:5.5	Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on someone else?’ 
sn55.7:5.6	Reflecting in this way, they give up stealing themselves. And they encourage others to give up stealing, praising the giving up of stealing. 
sn55.7:5.7	So their bodily behavior is purified in three points. 
sn55.7:6.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: 
sn55.7:6.2	‘If someone were to have sexual relations with my wives, I wouldn’t like it. 
sn55.7:6.3	But if I were to have sexual relations with someone else’s wives, he wouldn’t like that either. 
sn55.7:6.4	The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others. 
sn55.7:6.5	Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on others?’ 
sn55.7:6.6	Reflecting in this way, they give up sexual misconduct themselves. And they encourage others to give up sexual misconduct, praising the giving up of sexual misconduct. 
sn55.7:6.7	So their bodily behavior is purified in three points. 
sn55.7:7.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: 
sn55.7:7.2	‘If someone were to distort my meaning by lying, I wouldn’t like it. 
sn55.7:7.3	But if I were to distort someone else’s meaning by lying, they wouldn’t like it either. 
sn55.7:7.4	The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by someone else. 
sn55.7:7.5	Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on others?’ 
sn55.7:7.6	Reflecting in this way, they give up lying themselves. And they encourage others to give up lying, praising the giving up of lying. 
sn55.7:7.7	So their verbal behavior is purified in three points. 
sn55.7:8.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: 
sn55.7:8.2	‘If someone were to break me up from my friends by divisive speech, I wouldn’t like it. 
sn55.7:8.3	But if I were to break someone else from their friends by divisive speech, they wouldn’t like it either. …’ 
sn55.7:8.4	So their verbal behavior is purified in three points. 
sn55.7:9.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: 
sn55.7:9.2	‘If someone were to attack me with harsh speech, I wouldn’t like it. 
sn55.7:9.3	But if I were to attack someone else with harsh speech, they wouldn’t like it either. …’ 
sn55.7:9.4	 
sn55.7:9.5	So their verbal behavior is purified in three points. 
sn55.7:10.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: 
sn55.7:10.2	‘If someone were to annoy me by talking silliness and nonsense, I wouldn’t like it. 
sn55.7:10.3	But if I were to annoy someone else by talking silliness and nonsense, they wouldn’t like it either.’ 
sn55.7:10.4	The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by another. 
sn55.7:10.5	Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on another?’ 
sn55.7:10.6	Reflecting in this way, they give up talking nonsense themselves. And they encourage others to give up talking nonsense, praising the giving up of talking nonsense. 
sn55.7:10.7	So their verbal behavior is purified in three points. 
sn55.7:11.1	And they have experiential confidence in the Buddha … 
sn55.7:11.2	 
sn55.7:11.3	the teaching … 
sn55.7:11.4	the Saṅgha … 
sn55.7:11.5	And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion. 
sn55.7:11.6	When a noble disciple has these seven good qualities and these four desirable states they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: 
sn55.7:11.7	‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’” 
sn55.7:12.1	When he had spoken, the brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate said to the Buddha, 
sn55.7:12.2	“Excellent, Master Gotama! … 
sn55.7:12.3	We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
sn55.7:12.4	From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” 
sn55.8:0.1	Linked Discourses 55 
sn55.8:0.2	1. At Bamboo Gate 
sn55.8:0.3	8. In the Brick Hall (1st) 
sn55.8:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn55.8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house. 
sn55.8:1.3	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
sn55.8:2.1	“Sir, the monk named Sāḷha has passed away. 
sn55.8:2.2	Where has he been reborn in his next life? 
sn55.8:2.3	The nun named Nandā, 
sn55.8:2.4	 
sn55.8:2.5	the layman named Sudatta, 
sn55.8:2.6	 
sn55.8:2.7	and the laywoman named Sujātā have passed away. 
sn55.8:2.8	Where have they been reborn in the next life?” 
sn55.8:3.1	“Ānanda, the monk Sāḷha passed away having realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements. 
sn55.8:3.2	The nun Nandā passed away having ended the five lower fetters. She’s been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. 
sn55.8:3.3	The layman Sudatta passed away having ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. He’s a once-returner; he will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. 
sn55.8:3.4	The laywoman Sujātā passed away having ended three fetters. She’s a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. 
sn55.8:4.1	It’s hardly surprising that a human being should pass away. 
sn55.8:4.2	But if you should come and ask me about it each and every time someone dies that would be a bother for me. 
sn55.8:4.3	So Ānanda, I will teach you the explanation of the Dhamma called ‘the mirror of the teaching’. A noble disciple who has this may declare of themselves: 
sn55.8:4.4	‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’ 
sn55.8:5.1	And what is that mirror of the teaching? 
sn55.8:5.2	 
sn55.8:6.1	It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha … 
sn55.8:6.2	the teaching … 
sn55.8:6.3	the Saṅgha … 
sn55.8:6.4	And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.

sn56.11:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana. 
sn56.11:1.2	There the Buddha addressed the group of five mendicants: 
sn56.11:2.1	“Mendicants, these two extremes should not be cultivated by one who has gone forth. 
sn56.11:2.2	What two? 
sn56.11:2.3	Indulgence in sensual pleasures, which is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And indulgence in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless. 
sn56.11:2.4	Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One woke up by understanding the middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment. 
sn56.11:3.1	And what is that middle way of practice? 
sn56.11:3.2	It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: 
sn56.11:3.3	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 
sn56.11:3.4	This is that middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment. 
sn56.11:4.1	Now this is the noble truth of suffering. 
sn56.11:4.2	Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; illness is suffering; death is suffering; association with the disliked is suffering; separation from the liked is suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering. 
sn56.11:4.3	Now this is the noble truth of the origin of suffering. 
sn56.11:4.4	It’s the craving that leads to future rebirth, mixed up with relishing and greed, taking pleasure in various different realms. That is, 
sn56.11:4.5	craving for sensual pleasures, craving to continue existence, and craving to end existence. 
sn56.11:4.6	Now this is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering. 
sn56.11:4.7	It’s the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not adhering to it. 
sn56.11:4.8	Now this is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. 
sn56.11:4.9	It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: 
sn56.11:4.10	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 
sn56.11:5.1	‘This is the noble truth of suffering.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another. 
sn56.11:5.2	‘This noble truth of suffering should be completely understood.’ Such was the vision that arose in me …

sn56.11:6.1	‘This is the noble truth of the origin of suffering.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 
sn56.11:6.2	‘This noble truth of the origin of suffering should be given up.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 
sn56.11:6.3	‘This noble truth of the origin of suffering has been given up.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 
sn56.11:7.1	‘This is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 
sn56.11:7.2	‘This noble truth of the cessation of suffering should be realized.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 
sn56.11:7.3	‘This noble truth of the cessation of suffering has been realized.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 
sn56.11:8.1	‘This is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 
sn56.11:8.2	‘This noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering should be developed.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 
sn56.11:8.3	‘This noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering has been developed.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another. 
sn56.11:9.1	As long as my true knowledge and vision about these four noble truths was not fully purified in these three perspectives and twelve aspects, I didn’t announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. 
sn56.11:10.1	But when my true knowledge and vision about these four noble truths was fully purified in these three perspectives and twelve aspects, I announced my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. 
sn56.11:10.2	Knowledge and vision arose in me: 
sn56.11:10.3	‘My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.’” 
sn56.11:10.4	That is what the Buddha said. 
sn56.11:10.5	Satisfied, the group of five mendicants was happy with what the Buddha said. 
sn56.11:11.1	And while this discourse was being spoken, the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in Venerable Koṇḍañña: 
sn56.11:11.2	“Everything that has a beginning has an end.” 
sn56.11:12.1	And when the Buddha rolled forth the Wheel of Dhamma, the earth gods raised the cry: 
sn56.11:12.2	“Near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.” 
sn56.11:12.3	Hearing the cry of the Earth Gods, the Gods of the Four Great Kings … 
sn56.11:12.4	 
sn56.11:12.5	the Gods of the Thirty-Three … 
sn56.11:12.6	the Gods of Yama … 
sn56.11:12.7	the Joyful Gods … 
sn56.11:12.8	the Gods Who Love to Create … 
sn56.11:12.9	the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others … 
sn56.11:12.10	the Gods of Brahmā’s Host raised the cry: 
sn56.11:12.11	“Near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.” 
sn56.11:13.1	And so at that moment, in that instant, the cry soared up to the Brahmā realm. 
sn56.11:13.2	And this galaxy shook and rocked and trembled. And an immeasurable, magnificent light appeared in the world, surpassing the glory of the gods. 
sn56.11:14.1	Then the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 
sn56.11:14.2	“Koṇḍañña has really understood! Koṇḍañña has really understood!” 
sn56.11:14.3	And that’s how Venerable Koṇḍañña came to be known as “Koṇḍañña Who Understood”.

sn56.41:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
sn56.41:1.2	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 
sn56.41:1.3	“Once upon a time, mendicants, a certain person left Rājagaha, thinking ‘I’ll speculate about the world.’ They went to the Sumāgadhā lotus pond and sat down on the bank speculating about the world. 
sn56.41:1.4	Then that person saw an army of four divisions enter a lotus stalk. 
sn56.41:1.5	When he saw this he thought, 
sn56.41:1.6	‘I’ve gone mad, really, I’ve lost my mind! 
sn56.41:1.7	I’m seeing things that don’t exist in the world.’ 
sn56.41:2.1	Then that person entered the city and informed a large crowd, 
sn56.41:2.2	‘I’ve gone mad, really, I’ve lost my mind! 
sn56.41:2.3	I’m seeing things that don’t exist in the world.’ 
sn56.41:2.4	‘But how is it that you’re mad? How have you lost your mind? 
sn56.41:2.5	And what have you seen that doesn’t exist in the world?’ 
sn56.41:2.6	‘Sirs, I left Rājagaha, thinking “I’ll speculate about the world.” I went to the Sumāgadhā lotus pond and sat down on the bank speculating about the world. 
sn56.41:2.7	Then I saw an army of four divisions enter a lotus stalk. 
sn56.41:2.8	That’s why I’m mad, that’s why I’ve lost my mind. 
sn56.41:2.9	And that’s what I’ve seen that doesn’t exist in the world.’ 
sn56.41:2.10	‘Well, mister, you’re definitely mad, you’ve definitely lost your mind. 
sn56.41:2.11	And you’re seeing things that don’t exist in the world.’ 
sn56.41:3.1	But what that person saw was in fact real, not unreal. 
sn56.41:3.2	Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons. 
sn56.41:3.3	In that battle the gods won and the demons lost. 
sn56.41:3.4	The defeated and terrified demons entered the demon city through the lotus stalk only to confuse the gods. 
sn56.41:4.1	So mendicants, don’t speculate about the world. 
sn56.41:4.2	For example: the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist. 
sn56.41:4.3	Why is that? 
sn56.41:4.4	Because those thoughts aren’t beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. 
sn56.41:5.1	When you think something up, you should think: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.

sn6.10:0.3	10. With Kokālika 
sn6.10:1.1	At Sāvatthī. 
sn6.10:1.2	Then the mendicant Kokālika went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
sn6.10:1.3	“Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.” 
sn6.10:1.4	When this was said, the Buddha said to Kokālika, 
sn6.10:1.5	“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! 
sn6.10:1.6	Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.” 
sn6.10:1.7	For a second time Kokālika said to the Buddha, 
sn6.10:1.8	“Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.” 
sn6.10:1.9	For a second time, the Buddha said to Kokālika, 
sn6.10:1.10	“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! 
sn6.10:1.11	Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.” 
sn6.10:1.12	For a third time Kokālika said to the Buddha, 
sn6.10:1.13	“Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.” 
sn6.10:1.14	For a third time, the Buddha said to Kokālika, 
sn6.10:1.15	“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! 
sn6.10:1.16	Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.” 
sn6.10:2.1	Then Kokālika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 
sn6.10:2.2	Not long after he left his body erupted with boils the size of mustard seeds. 
sn6.10:2.3	The boils grew to the size of mung beans, then chickpeas, then jujube seeds, then jujubes, then myrobalans, then unripe wood apples, then ripe wood apples. Finally they burst open, and pus and blood oozed out. 
sn6.10:2.4	Then the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness. 
sn6.10:2.5	He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna. 
sn6.10:3.1	Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, 
sn6.10:3.2	“Sir, the mendicant Kokālika has passed away. 
sn6.10:3.3	He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” 
sn6.10:3.4	That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said. 
sn6.10:3.5	Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there. 
sn6.10:4.1	Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened. 
sn6.10:4.2	 
sn6.10:4.3	 
sn6.10:4.4	 
sn6.10:4.5	 
sn6.10:5.1	When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha, 
sn6.10:5.2	“Sir, how long is the life span in the Pink Lotus hell?” 
sn6.10:5.3	“It’s long, mendicant. 
sn6.10:5.4	It’s not easy to calculate 
sn6.10:5.5	how many years, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts.” 
sn6.10:5.6	“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?” 
sn6.10:5.7	“It’s possible,” said the Buddha. 
sn6.10:6.1	“Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed. And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it. 
sn6.10:6.2	By this means the Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell. 
sn6.10:6.3	Now, twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Nirabbuda hell. 
sn6.10:6.4	Twenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Ababa hell. 
sn6.10:6.5	Twenty lifetimes in the Ababa hell equal one lifetime in the Aṭaṭa hell. 
sn6.10:6.6	Twenty lifetimes in the Aṭaṭa hell equal one lifetime in the Ahaha hell. 
sn6.10:6.7	Twenty lifetimes in the Ahaha hell equal one lifetime in the Yellow Lotus hell. 
sn6.10:6.8	Twenty lifetimes in the Yellow Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Sweet-Smelling hell. 
sn6.10:6.9	Twenty lifetimes in the Sweet-Smelling hell equal one lifetime in the Blue Water Lily hell. 
sn6.10:6.10	Twenty lifetimes in the Blue Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the White Lotus hell. 
sn6.10:6.11	Twenty lifetimes in the White Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Pink Lotus hell. 
sn6.10:6.12	The mendicant Kokālika has been reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” 
sn6.10:6.13	That is what the Buddha said. 
sn6.10:6.14	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
sn6.10:7.1	“A man is born 
sn6.10:7.2	with an axe in his mouth. 
sn6.10:7.3	A fool cuts themselves with it 
sn6.10:7.4	when they say bad words. 
sn6.10:8.1	When you praise someone worthy of criticism, 
sn6.10:8.2	or criticize someone worthy of praise, 
sn6.10:8.3	you choose bad luck with your own mouth: 
sn6.10:8.4	you’ll never find happiness that way. 
sn6.10:9.1	Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing, 
sn6.10:9.2	if all you lose is your money 
sn6.10:9.3	and all you own, even yourself. 
sn6.10:9.4	What’s really terrible luck 
sn6.10:9.5	is to hate the holy ones. 
sn6.10:10.1	For more than two quinquadecillion years, 
sn6.10:10.2	and another five quattuordecillion years,

sn6.11:1.4	and recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: 
sn6.11:2.1	“The aristocrat is first among people  
sn6.11:2.2	who take clan as the standard. 
sn6.11:2.3	But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct

sn6.11:3.1	That’s what Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra said,

sn6.14:0.3	14. About Aruṇavatī 
sn6.14:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn6.14:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī. 
sn6.14:1.3	There he addressed the mendicants, 
sn6.14:1.4	“Mendicants!” 
sn6.14:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
sn6.14:1.6	The Buddha said this: 
sn6.14:2.1	“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a king named Aruṇavā. 
sn6.14:2.2	He had a capital named Aruṇavatī. 
sn6.14:2.3	Sikhī the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha lived supported by Aruṇavatī. 
sn6.14:2.4	Sikhī had a fine pair of chief disciples named Abhibhū and Sambhava. 
sn6.14:2.5	Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū, 
sn6.14:2.6	‘Come, brahmin, let’s go to one of the brahmā realms until it’s time for our meal.’ 
sn6.14:2.7	‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. 
sn6.14:2.8	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from Aruṇavatī and appeared in that Brahmā realm. 
sn6.14:3.1	Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū, 
sn6.14:3.2	‘Brahmin, teach the Dhamma as you feel inspired for that Brahmā, his assembly, and the members of his retinue.’ 
sn6.14:3.3	‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Then he educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk. 
sn6.14:3.4	But the Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue complained, grumbled, and objected, 
sn6.14:3.5	‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! How on earth can a disciple teach Dhamma in the presence of the Teacher?’ 
sn6.14:4.1	Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū, 
sn6.14:4.2	‘Brahmin, Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue are complaining 
sn6.14:4.3	that a disciple teaches Dhamma in the presence of the Teacher. 
sn6.14:4.4	Well then, brahmin, stir them up even more!’ 
sn6.14:4.5	‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Then he taught Dhamma with his body visible; with his body invisible; with the lower half visible and the upper half invisible; and with the upper half visible and the lower half invisible. 
sn6.14:4.6	And the Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought, 
sn6.14:4.7	‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! The ascetic has such psychic power and might!’ 
sn6.14:5.1	Then Abhibhū said to the Buddha Sikhī, 
sn6.14:5.2	‘Sir, I recall having said this in the middle of the Saṅgha: 
sn6.14:5.3	“Standing in the Brahmā realm, I can make my voice heard throughout the galaxy.”’ 
sn6.14:5.4	‘Now is the time, brahmin! Now is the time, brahmin! 
sn6.14:5.5	Standing in the Brahmā realm, make your voice heard throughout the galaxy.’ 
sn6.14:5.6	‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Standing in the Brahmā realm, he recited this verse: 
sn6.14:6.1	‘Rouse yourselves! Try harder! 
sn6.14:6.2	Devote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha! 
sn6.14:6.3	Crush the army of Death, 
sn6.14:6.4	as an elephant a hut of reeds. 
sn6.14:7.1	Whoever will live diligently 
sn6.14:7.2	in this teaching and training, 
sn6.14:7.3	giving up transmigration through rebirths, 
sn6.14:7.4	will make an end of suffering.’ 
sn6.14:8.1	Having inspired that Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue with a sense of awe, 
sn6.14:8.2	as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, Sikhī and Abhibhū vanished from that Brahmā realm and appeared in Aruṇavatī. 
sn6.14:8.3	Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicants, 
sn6.14:8.4	‘Mendicants, did you hear the mendicant Abhibhū speaking a verse while standing in a Brahmā realm?’ 
sn6.14:8.5	‘We did, sir.’ 
sn6.14:8.6	‘But what exactly did you hear?’ 
sn6.14:8.7	‘This is what we heard, sir:

sn6.14:11.3	It’s good that you heard the mendicant Abhibhū speaking this verse while standing in a Brahmā realm.’” 
sn6.14:12.1	That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.

sn6.15:0.3	15. Final Extinguishment 
sn6.15:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying between a pair of sal trees in the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā at the time of his final extinguishment. 
sn6.15:1.2	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants: 
sn6.15:1.3	“Come now, mendicants, I say to you all: 
sn6.15:1.4	‘Conditions fall apart. Persist with diligence.’” 
sn6.15:1.5	These were the Realized One’s last words. 
sn6.15:2.1	Then the Buddha entered the first absorption. Emerging from that, he entered the second absorption. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the third absorption, the fourth absorption, the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Then he entered the cessation of perception and feeling. 
sn6.15:3.1	Then he emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling and entered the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the dimension of nothingness, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of infinite space, the fourth absorption, the third absorption, the second absorption, and the first absorption. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the second absorption and the third absorption. Then he entered the fourth absorption. Emerging from that the Buddha immediately became fully extinguished. 
sn6.15:3.2	When the Buddha became fully extinguished, along with the full extinguishment, Brahmā Sahampati recited this verse: 
sn6.15:4.1	“All creatures in this world 
sn6.15:4.2	must lay down this bag of bones. 
sn6.15:4.3	For even a Teacher such as this, 
sn6.15:4.4	unrivaled in the world, 
sn6.15:4.5	the Realized One, attained to power, 
sn6.15:4.6	the Buddha became fully extinguished.” 
sn6.15:5.1	When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Sakka, lord of gods, recited this verse: 
sn6.15:6.1	“Oh! Conditions are impermanent, 
sn6.15:6.2	their nature is to rise and fall; 
sn6.15:6.3	having arisen, they cease; 
sn6.15:6.4	their stilling is true bliss.” 
sn6.15:7.1	When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Venerable Ānanda recited this verse: 
sn6.15:8.1	“Then there was terror! 
sn6.15:8.2	Then they had goosebumps! 
sn6.15:8.3	When the Buddha, endowed with all fine qualities, 
sn6.15:8.4	became fully extinguished.” 
sn6.15:9.1	When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Venerable Anuruddha recited this verse: 
sn6.15:10.1	“There was no more breathing 
sn6.15:10.2	for the poised one of steady heart. 
sn6.15:10.3	Imperturbable, committed to peace, 
sn6.15:10.4	the seer became fully extinguished. 
sn6.15:11.1	He put up with painful feelings 
sn6.15:11.2	without flinching. 
sn6.15:11.3	The liberation of his heart 
sn6.15:11.4	was like the extinguishing of a lamp.”

sn6.1:0.2	1. The Appeal 
sn6.1:0.3	1. The Appeal of Brahmā 
sn6.1:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn6.1:1.2	At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. 
sn6.1:1.3	Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, 
sn6.1:1.4	“This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute. 
sn6.1:1.5	But people like attachment, they love it and enjoy it. 
sn6.1:1.6	It’s hard for them to see this thing; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination. 
sn6.1:1.7	It’s also hard for them to see this thing; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment. 
sn6.1:1.8	And if I were to teach this principle, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.” 
sn6.1:1.9	And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to the Buddha: 
sn6.1:2.1	“I’ve struggled hard to realize this, 
sn6.1:2.2	enough with trying to explain it! 
sn6.1:2.3	This principle is not easily understood 
sn6.1:2.4	by those mired in greed and hate. 
sn6.1:3.1	Those besotted by greed can’t see 
sn6.1:3.2	what’s subtle, going against the stream, 
sn6.1:3.3	deep, hard to see, and very fine, 
sn6.1:3.4	for they’re shrouded in a mass of darkness.” 
sn6.1:4.1	And as the Buddha reflected like this, his mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma. 
sn6.1:5.1	Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what the Buddha was thinking, thought, 
sn6.1:5.2	“Oh my goodness! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.” 
sn6.1:5.3	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. 
sn6.1:5.4	He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: 
sn6.1:5.5	“Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma! 
sn6.1:5.6	There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching. 
sn6.1:5.7	There will be those who understand the teaching!” 
sn6.1:5.8	This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he went on to say: 
sn6.1:6.1	“Among the Magadhans there appeared in the past 
sn6.1:6.2	an impure teaching thought up by those still stained. 
sn6.1:6.3	Fling open the door to the deathless! 
sn6.1:6.4	Let them hear the teaching the immaculate one discovered. 
sn6.1:7.1	Standing high on a rocky mountain, 
sn6.1:7.2	you can see the people all around. 
sn6.1:7.3	In just the same way, all-seer, wise one, 
sn6.1:7.4	having ascended the Temple of Truth, 
sn6.1:7.5	rid of sorrow, look upon the people 
sn6.1:7.6	swamped with sorrow, oppressed by rebirth and old age. 
sn6.1:8.1	Rise, hero! Victor in battle, leader of the caravan, 
sn6.1:8.2	wander the world without obligation. 
sn6.1:8.3	Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! 
sn6.1:8.4	There will be those who understand!” 
sn6.1:9.1	Then the Buddha, understanding Brahmā’s invitation, surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, because of his compassion for sentient beings. 
sn6.1:9.2	And the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not. 
sn6.1:9.3	It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them. 
sn6.1:9.4	In the same way, the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not. 
sn6.1:9.5	When he had seen this he replied in verse to Brahmā Sahampati: 
sn6.1:10.1	“Flung open are the doors to the deathless! 
sn6.1:10.2	Let those with ears to hear commit to faith. 
sn6.1:10.3	Thinking it would be troublesome, Brahmā, I did not teach 
sn6.1:10.4	the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among humans.” 
sn6.1:11.1	Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing that his request for the Buddha to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.

sn6.2:0.2	1. The Appeal 
sn6.2:0.3	2. Respect 
sn6.2:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn6.2:1.2	At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. 
sn6.2:1.3	Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, 
sn6.2:1.4	“It’s unpleasant to live without respect and reverence. What ascetic or brahmin should I honor and respect and rely on?” 
sn6.2:2.1	Then it occurred to him: 
sn6.2:2.2	“I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of ethics, if it were incomplete. 
sn6.2:2.3	But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in ethics, who I should honor and respect and rely on. 
sn6.2:3.1	I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of immersion, if it were incomplete. 
sn6.2:3.2	But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in immersion … 
sn6.2:4.1	I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of wisdom, if it were incomplete. 
sn6.2:4.2	But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in wisdom … 
sn6.2:5.1	I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of freedom, if it were incomplete. 
sn6.2:5.2	But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in freedom … 
sn6.2:6.1	I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of the knowledge and vision of freedom, if it were incomplete. 
sn6.2:6.2	But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in the knowledge and vision of freedom, who I should honor and respect and rely on. 
sn6.2:6.3	Why don’t I honor and respect and rely on the same Dhamma to which I was awakened?” 
sn6.2:7.1	Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. 
sn6.2:7.2	He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: 
sn6.2:7.3	“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! 
sn6.2:7.4	All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past honored and respected and relied on this same teaching. 
sn6.2:7.5	All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future will honor and respect and rely on this same teaching. 
sn6.2:7.6	May the Blessed One, who is the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present, also honor and respect and rely on this same teaching.” 
sn6.2:7.7	This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he went on to say: 
sn6.2:8.1	“All Buddhas in the past, 
sn6.2:8.2	the Buddhas of the future, 
sn6.2:8.3	and the Buddha at present—
sn6.2:8.4	destroyer of the sorrows of many—
sn6.2:9.1	respecting the true teaching 
sn6.2:9.2	they did live, they do live, 
sn6.2:9.3	and they also will live. 
sn6.2:9.4	This is the nature of the Buddhas. 
sn6.2:10.1	Therefore someone who cares for their own welfare, 
sn6.2:10.2	and wants to become the very best they can be,
sn6.2:10.3	should respect the true teaching, 
sn6.2:10.4	remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.”
sn6.3:0.1	Linked Discourses 6 
sn6.3:0.2	1. The Appeal 
sn6.3:0.3	3. With Brahmadeva 
sn6.3:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn6.3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
sn6.3:1.3	Now at that time a certain brahmin lady had a son called Brahmadeva, who had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the Buddha. 
sn6.3:2.1	Then Venerable Brahmadeva, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
sn6.3:2.2	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” 
sn6.3:2.3	And Venerable Brahmadeva became one of the perfected. 
sn6.3:3.1	Then Brahmadeva robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
sn6.3:3.2	Wandering indiscriminately for almsfood in Sāvatthī, he approached his own mother’s home. 
sn6.3:3.3	Now at that time Brahmadeva’s mother, the brahmin lady, was offering up a regular oblation to Brahmā. 
sn6.3:3.4	Then Brahmā Sahampati thought, 
sn6.3:3.5	“This Venerable Brahmadeva’s mother, the brahmin lady, offers up a regular oblation to Brahmā. 
sn6.3:3.6	Why don’t I go and stir up a sense of urgency in her?” 
sn6.3:3.7	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in the home of Brahmadeva’s mother. 
sn6.3:3.8	Then Brahmā Sahampati, while standing in the air, addressed Brahmadeva’s mother in verse: 
sn6.3:4.1	“Far from here is the Brahmā realm, madam, 
sn6.3:4.2	to which you offer a regular oblation. 
sn6.3:4.3	But Brahmā doesn’t eat that kind of food. 
sn6.3:4.4	Why pray, when you don’t know the path to Brahmā? 
sn6.3:5.1	This Brahmadeva, madam, 
sn6.3:5.2	free of attachments, has surpassed the gods. 
sn6.3:5.3	Owning nothing, providing for no other, a mendicant 
sn6.3:5.4	has entered your house for alms. 
sn6.3:6.1	He’s worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, a knowledge master, evolved. 
sn6.3:6.2	He’s worthy of a religious donation from gods and men. 
sn6.3:6.3	Having banished all evils, he’s unsullied. 
sn6.3:6.4	Cool at heart, he wanders searching for food. 
sn6.3:7.1	He has no before and after, 
sn6.3:7.2	peaceful, unclouded, untroubled, with no need for hope, 
sn6.3:7.3	he has laid down the rod for all creatures firm and frail. 
sn6.3:7.4	So let him enjoy your offering of choice alms. 
sn6.3:8.1	With peaceful mind, he has left the crowd, 
sn6.3:8.2	he wanders like a tamed elephant, unperturbed. 
sn6.3:8.3	He’s a mendicant fair in ethics, with heart well freed. 
sn6.3:8.4	So let him enjoy your offering of choice alms. 
sn6.3:9.1	With unwavering confidence in him, 
sn6.3:9.2	present your religious donation to one who is worthy of it. 
sn6.3:9.3	Now that you’ve seen the sage who has crossed over, madam, 
sn6.3:9.4	make merit for the sake of future happiness!” 
sn6.3:10.1	With unwavering confidence in him, 
sn6.3:10.2	she presented her religious donation to one who is worthy of it. 
sn6.3:10.3	After seeing the sage who had crossed over, the brahmin lady 
sn6.3:10.4	made merit for the sake of future happiness.
sn6.4:0.1	Linked Discourses 6 
sn6.4:0.2	1. The Appeal 
sn6.4:0.3	4. With Baka the Brahmā 
sn6.4:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn6.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
sn6.4:1.3	Now at that time Baka the Brahmā had the following harmful misconception: 
sn6.4:1.4	“This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is whole, this is imperishable. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.” 
sn6.4:2.1	Then the Buddha knew what Baka the Brahmā was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm. 
sn6.4:2.2	Baka the Brahmā saw the Buddha coming off in the distance 
sn6.4:2.3	and said to him, 
sn6.4:2.4	“Come, good sir! Welcome, good sir! 
sn6.4:2.5	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here. 
sn6.4:2.6	For this is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is complete, this is imperishable. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.” 
sn6.4:3.1	When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him, 
sn6.4:3.2	“Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance! Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance! 
sn6.4:3.3	Because what is actually impermanent, not lasting, transient, incomplete, and perishable, he says is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable. 
sn6.4:3.4	And where there is being born, growing old, dying, passing away, and being reborn, he says that 
sn6.4:3.5	there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. 
sn6.4:3.6	And although there is another escape beyond this, he says that there’s no other escape beyond this.” 
sn6.4:4.1	“Gotama, we seventy-two merit-makers are now wielders of power, 
sn6.4:4.2	having passed beyond rebirth and old age. 
sn6.4:4.3	This is our last rebirth as Brahmā, knowledge master. 
sn6.4:4.4	And now many people pray to us.” 
sn6.4:5.1	“But, Baka, the life span here is short, not long, 
sn6.4:5.2	though you think it’s long. 
sn6.4:5.3	I know that your life span 
sn6.4:5.4	is two quinquadecillion years, Brahmā.” 
sn6.4:6.1	“Blessed One, I am the one of infinite vision, 
sn6.4:6.2	who has gone beyond rebirth and old age and sorrow. 
sn6.4:6.3	What precepts and observances did I practice in the past? 
sn6.4:6.4	Explain to me so that I may understand.” 
sn6.4:7.1	“You gave drink to many people 
sn6.4:7.2	who were oppressed by thirst and heat. 
sn6.4:7.3	They’re the precepts and observances you practiced in the past. 
sn6.4:7.4	I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep. 
sn6.4:8.1	When people at Deer River Bank were seized, 
sn6.4:8.2	you released the captives as they were led away. 
sn6.4:8.3	That’s the precepts and observances you practiced in the past. 
sn6.4:8.4	I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep. 
sn6.4:9.1	When a boat on the Ganges River was seized 
sn6.4:9.2	by a fierce dragon desiring human flesh, 
sn6.4:9.3	you freed it wielding mighty force. 
sn6.4:9.4	That’s the precepts and observances you practiced in the past. 
sn6.4:9.5	I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep. 
sn6.4:10.1	I used to be your servant named Kappa. 
sn6.4:10.2	You thought he was intelligent and loyal. 
sn6.4:10.3	That’s the precepts and observances you practiced in the past. 
sn6.4:10.4	I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep.” 
sn6.4:11.1	“You certainly understand this life span of mine. 
sn6.4:11.2	And others, too, you know; that’s why you’re the Buddha. 
sn6.4:11.3	And that’s why your blazing glory 
sn6.4:11.4	lights up even the Brahmā realm.”

sn6.5:0.3	5. A Certain Brahmā 
sn6.5:1.1	At Sāvatthī. 
sn6.5:1.2	Now at that time a certain Brahmā had the following harmful misconception: 
sn6.5:1.3	“No ascetic or brahmin can come here!” 
sn6.5:1.4	Then the Buddha knew what that Brahmā was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm. 
sn6.5:1.5	Then the Buddha sat cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element. 
sn6.5:2.1	Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought, 
sn6.5:2.2	“Where is the Buddha staying at present?” 
sn6.5:2.3	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, he saw the Buddha seated cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element. 
sn6.5:2.4	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm. 
sn6.5:2.5	Then Mahāmoggallāna—positioning himself in the east, below the Buddha—sat cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element. 
sn6.5:3.1	Then Venerable Mahākassapa … 
sn6.5:3.2	 
sn6.5:3.3	 
sn6.5:3.4	 
sn6.5:3.5	positioned himself in the south …

sn6.5:4.2	 
sn6.5:4.3	 
sn6.5:4.4	 
sn6.5:4.5	 
sn6.5:4.6	positioned himself in the west …

sn6.5:5.2	 
sn6.5:5.3	 
sn6.5:5.4	 
sn6.5:5.5	positioned himself in the north, below the Buddha, sitting cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element. 
sn6.5:6.1	Then Mahāmoggallāna addressed that Brahmā in verse: 
sn6.5:7.1	“Sir, do you still have the same view 
sn6.5:7.2	that you had in the past? 
sn6.5:7.3	Or do you see the radiance 
sn6.5:7.4	transcending the Brahmā realm?” 
sn6.5:8.1	“Good sir, I don’t have that view 
sn6.5:8.2	that I had in the past. 
sn6.5:8.3	I see the radiance 
sn6.5:8.4	transcending the Brahmā realm. 
sn6.5:8.5	So how could I say today 
sn6.5:8.6	that I am permanent and eternal?” 
sn6.5:9.1	Having inspired a sense of awe in the Brahmā, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, the Buddha vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in Jeta’s Grove. 
sn6.5:9.2	Then that Brahmā addressed a member of his retinue, 
sn6.5:9.3	“Please, good sir, go up to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and say to him: 
sn6.5:9.4	‘Moggallāna my good sir, are there any other disciples of the Buddha who have power and might 
sn6.5:9.5	comparable to the masters Moggallāna, Kassapa, Kappina, and Anuruddha?’” 
sn6.5:9.6	“Yes, good sir,” replied that retinue member. He went to Moggallāna and asked as instructed. 
sn6.5:9.7	 
sn6.5:9.8	 
sn6.5:9.9	Then Mahāmoggallāna addressed that member of Brahmā’s retinue in verse:

sn6.5:10.2	who have the three knowledges, 
sn6.5:10.3	and have attained psychic power, expert in reading minds, 
sn6.5:10.4	they’re perfected ones with defilements ended.” 
sn6.5:11.1	Then that member of Brahmā’s retinue, having approved and agreed with what Mahāmoggallāna said, went to that Brahmā and said to him, 
sn6.5:11.2	“Good sir, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:

sn6.5:12.2	who have the three knowledges,

sn6.6:0.3	6. The Negligent Brahmā 
sn6.6:1.1	At Sāvatthī. 
sn6.6:1.2	Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day’s meditation. 
sn6.6:1.3	Then the independent brahmās Subrahmā and Suddhāvāsa went to the Buddha and stationed themselves one by each door-post. But Subrahmā said to Suddhāvāsa, 
sn6.6:1.4	“Good sir, it’s the wrong time to pay homage to the Buddha. 
sn6.6:1.5	He has gone into retreat for the day’s meditation. 
sn6.6:1.6	But such and such Brahmā realm is successful and prosperous, while the Brahmā living there is negligent. 
sn6.6:1.7	Come, let’s go to that Brahmā realm and inspire awe in that Brahmā!” 
sn6.6:1.8	“Yes, good sir,” replied Suddhāvāsa. 
sn6.6:2.1	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from in front of the Buddha and appeared in that Brahmā realm. 
sn6.6:2.2	That Brahmā saw those Brahmās coming off in the distance and said to them, 
sn6.6:2.3	“Well now, good sirs, where have you come from?” 
sn6.6:2.4	“Good sir, we’ve come from the presence of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. 
sn6.6:2.5	Shouldn’t you go to attend on that Blessed One?” 
sn6.6:3.1	When they had spoken, that Brahmā refused to accept their advice. He multiplied himself a thousand times and said to Subrahmā, 
sn6.6:3.2	“Good sir, can’t you see that I have such psychic power?” 
sn6.6:3.3	“I see that, good sir.” 
sn6.6:3.4	“Since I have such psychic power and might, what other ascetic or brahmin should I go to and attend upon?” 
sn6.6:4.1	Then Subrahmā multiplied himself two thousand times and said to that Brahmā, 
sn6.6:4.2	“Good sir, can’t you see that I have such psychic power?” 
sn6.6:4.3	“I see that, good sir.” 
sn6.6:4.4	“That Buddha has even more psychic power and might than you or me. 
sn6.6:4.5	Shouldn’t you go to attend on that Blessed One?” 
sn6.6:4.6	Then that Brahmā addressed Subrahmā in verse: 
sn6.6:5.1	“There are three hundreds of phoenixes, four of swans, and five of eagles. 
sn6.6:5.2	This palace belongs to him who practiced absorption. 
sn6.6:5.3	It shines, Brahmā, 
sn6.6:5.4	lighting up the northern quarter!” 
sn6.6:6.1	“So what if your palace shines, 
sn6.6:6.2	lighting up the northern quarter? 
sn6.6:6.3	A clever person who has seen the deficiency in form, 
sn6.6:6.4	its chronic trembling, takes no pleasure in it.” 
sn6.6:7.1	Then after inspiring awe in that Brahmā, the independent brahmās Subrahmā and Suddhāvāsa vanished right there. 
sn6.6:7.2	And after some time that Brahmā went to attend on the Buddha.

sn7.10:1.3	While looking for them he went to that forest, where he saw the Buddha sitting down cross-legged, with his body straight, and mindfulness established right there. 
sn7.10:1.4	He went up to the Buddha, and recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence:

sn7.10:16.1	When he had spoken, the brahmin said to the Buddha, 
sn7.10:16.2	“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! … 
sn7.10:16.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.

sn7.10:16.5	Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” 
sn7.10:17.1	And the brahmin received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. 
sn7.10:17.2	Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life.

sn7.11:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn7.11:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans in the Southern Hills near the brahmin village of Ekanāḷa. 
sn7.11:1.3	Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Farmer had harnessed around five hundred plows, it being the season for sowing. 
sn7.11:1.4	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to where Bhāradvāja the Farmer was working. 
sn7.11:2.1	Now at that time Bhāradvāja the Farmer was distributing food. 
sn7.11:2.2	Then the Buddha went to where the distribution was taking place and stood to one side. 
sn7.11:2.3	Bhāradvāja the Farmer saw him standing for alms 
sn7.11:2.4	and said to him, 
sn7.11:2.5	“I plough and sow, ascetic, and then I eat. 
sn7.11:2.6	You too should plough and sow, then you may eat.” 
sn7.11:2.7	“I too plough and sow, brahmin, and then I eat.” 
sn7.11:2.8	“I don’t see Master Gotama with a yoke or plow or plowshare or goad or oxen, yet he says: 
sn7.11:2.9	‘I too plough and sow, brahmin, and then I eat.’” 
sn7.11:2.10	Then Bhāradvāja the Farmer addressed the Buddha in verse: 
sn7.11:3.1	“You claim to be a farmer, 
sn7.11:3.2	but I don’t see your plough. 
sn7.11:3.3	If you’re a farmer, declare to me: 
sn7.11:3.4	how are we to understand your farming?” 
sn7.11:4.1	“Faith is my seed, austerity my rain,

sn7.11:6.1	Energy is my beast of burden, 
sn7.11:6.2	transporting me to a place of sanctuary. 
sn7.11:6.3	It goes without turning back 
sn7.11:6.4	to where there is no sorrow. 
sn7.11:7.1	That’s how to do the farming 
sn7.11:7.2	that has the Deathless as its fruit. 
sn7.11:7.3	When you finish this farming 
sn7.11:7.4	you’re released from all suffering.” 
sn7.11:8.1	“Eat, Master Gotama, 
sn7.11:8.2	you are truly a farmer. 
sn7.11:8.3	For Master Gotama does the farming that has the Deathless as its fruit.” 
sn7.11:9.1	“Food enchanted by a spell isn’t fit for me to eat. 
sn7.11:9.2	That’s not the principle of those who see, brahmin. 
sn7.11:9.3	The Buddhas reject things enchanted with spells. 
sn7.11:9.4	Since there is such a principle, brahmin, that’s how they live. 
sn7.11:10.1	Serve with other food and drink

sn7.14:13.6	So the Buddha accepted it out of compassion. 
sn7.14:13.7	Then the well-to-do brahmin said to the Buddha,

sn7.15:0.3	15. Stuck-Up 
sn7.15:1.1	At Sāvatthī. 
sn7.15:1.2	Now at that time a brahmin named Stuck-Up was residing in Sāvatthī. 
sn7.15:1.3	He didn’t bow to his mother or father, his teacher, or his oldest brother. 
sn7.15:1.4	Now, at that time the Buddha was teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly. 
sn7.15:1.5	Then Stuck-Up thought, 
sn7.15:1.6	“The ascetic Gotama is teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly. 
sn7.15:1.7	Why don’t I approach him? 
sn7.15:1.8	If he speaks to me, I’ll speak to him. 
sn7.15:1.9	But if he doesn’t speak, neither will I.” 
sn7.15:1.10	Then the brahmin Stuck-Up went up to the Buddha, and stood silently to one side. 
sn7.15:1.11	But the Buddha didn’t speak to him. 
sn7.15:1.12	Then Stuck-Up thought, 
sn7.15:1.13	“This ascetic Gotama knows nothing!” And he wanted to go back from there right away. 
sn7.15:1.14	Then the Buddha, knowing what Stuck-Up was thinking, addressed him in verse: 
sn7.15:2.1	“It’s not good to foster conceit 
sn7.15:2.2	if you want what’s good for you, brahmin. 
sn7.15:2.3	You should foster the goal 
sn7.15:2.4	which brought you here.” 
sn7.15:3.1	Then Stuck-Up thought,
sn7.15:3.2	“The ascetic Gotama knows my mind!” He bowed with his head to the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name:
sn7.15:3.3	“Master Gotama, I am Stuck-Up! I am Stuck-Up!” 
sn7.15:3.4	Then that assembly was stunned:
sn7.15:3.5	“It’s incredible, it’s amazing! 
sn7.15:3.6	This brahmin Stuck-Up doesn’t bow to his mother or father, his teacher, or his oldest brother. 
sn7.15:3.7	Yet he shows such utmost devotion to the ascetic Gotama!” 
sn7.15:3.8	Then the Buddha said to the brahmin Stuck-Up,
sn7.15:3.9	“Enough, brahmin. Get up, and take your own seat. 
sn7.15:3.10	For your mind has confidence in me.” 
sn7.15:3.11	Then Stuck-Up took his seat and said to the Buddha: 
sn7.15:4.1	“Regarding whom should you not be conceited? 
sn7.15:4.2	Who should you respect? 
sn7.15:4.3	Who should you esteem? 
sn7.15:4.4	Who is it good to venerate properly?” 
sn7.15:5.1	“Your mother and father, 
sn7.15:5.2	and also your oldest brother, 
sn7.15:5.3	with teacher as fourth. 
sn7.15:5.4	Regarding these you should not be conceited. 
sn7.15:5.5	They are who you should respect. 
sn7.15:5.6	They are who you should esteem. 
sn7.15:5.7	And they’re who it’s good to venerate properly. 
sn7.15:6.1	And when you’ve humbled conceit, and aren’t stuck-up, 
sn7.15:6.2	show supreme reverence for 
sn7.15:6.3	the perfected ones, cooled, 
sn7.15:6.4	their task complete, free of defilements.” 
sn7.15:7.1	When he had spoken, the brahmin Stuck-Up said to the Buddha, 
sn7.15:7.2	“Excellent, Master Gotama …

sn7.16:1.5	contradict everything he says?” 
sn7.16:1.6	At that time the Buddha was walking mindfully in the open air. 
sn7.16:1.7	Then the brahmin Contraphile went up to the Buddha, and said to him as he was walking, 
sn7.16:1.8	“Ascetic, preach the Dhamma.” 
sn7.16:2.1	“Fine words aren’t easy to understand

sn7.17:1.3	He saw the Buddha sitting down cross-legged at the root of a certain sal tree, with his body straight, and mindfulness established right there. 
sn7.17:1.4	Seeing this, it occurred to him,

sn7.17:1.6	I wonder what the ascetic Gotama enjoys doing?” 
sn7.17:1.7	Then Bhāradvāja the Builder went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
sn7.17:2.1	“What kind of work do you do 
sn7.17:2.2	as a mendicant in the sal jungle? 
sn7.17:2.3	How do you find enjoyment

sn7.18:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
sn7.18:1.2	Then several youths, students of one of the Bhāradvāja brahmins, approached a forest grove while collecting firewood. They saw the Buddha sitting down cross-legged at the root of a certain sal tree, with his body straight, and mindfulness established right there. Seeing this, they went up to Bhāradvāja and said to him, 
sn7.18:1.3	“Please sir, you should know this. 
sn7.18:1.4	In such and such a forest grove the ascetic Gotama is sitting down cross-legged, with his body straight, and mindfulness established right there.” 
sn7.18:1.5	Then Bhāradvāja together with those students went to that forest grove 
sn7.18:1.6	where he saw the Buddha sitting down cross-legged, with his body straight, and mindfulness established right there. 
sn7.18:1.7	He went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: 
sn7.18:2.1	“Deep in the jungle so full of terrors, 
sn7.18:2.2	you’ve plunged into the empty, desolate wilderness. 
sn7.18:2.3	Still, steady, and graceful: 
sn7.18:2.4	how beautifully you meditate, mendicant! 
sn7.18:3.1	Where there is no song or music, 
sn7.18:3.2	a lonely sage resorts to the wilderness. 
sn7.18:3.3	This strikes me as an amazing thing, 
sn7.18:3.4	that you dwell so joyfully alone in the jungle. 
sn7.18:4.1	I suppose you wish to be reborn in the company 
sn7.18:4.2	of the supreme sovereign of the heaven of the Three and Thirty. 
sn7.18:4.3	Is that why you resort to the desolate wilderness, 
sn7.18:4.4	to practice austerities for attaining Brahmā?” 
sn7.18:5.1	“Any wishes and hopes that are always attached 
sn7.18:5.2	to the many and various realms—
sn7.18:5.3	the yearnings sprung from the root of unknowing—
sn7.18:5.4	I’ve eliminated them all down to the root.

sn7.18:6.2	amongst all things, my vision is clear. 
sn7.18:6.3	I’ve attained the state of grace, the supreme awakening; 
sn7.18:6.4	I meditate alone, brahmin, and self-assured.” 
sn7.18:7.1	When he had spoken, Bhāradvāja said to the Buddha,

sn7.19:1.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, 
sn7.19:1.4	“Master Gotama, I seek alms by legitimate means, which I use to provide for my mother and father. 
sn7.19:1.5	In doing so, am I doing my duty?” 
sn7.19:1.6	“Indeed, brahmin, in so doing you are doing your duty.

sn7.1:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn7.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
sn7.1:1.3	Now at that time a certain brahmin lady of the Bhāradvāja clan named Dhanañjānī was devoted to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. 
sn7.1:1.4	Once, while she was bringing her husband his meal she tripped and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times: 
sn7.1:2.1	“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! 
sn7.1:3.1	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! 
sn7.1:4.1	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!” 
sn7.1:5.1	When she said this, the brahmin said to Dhanañjānī: 
sn7.1:5.2	“That’d be right. For the slightest thing this lowlife woman spouts out praise for that bald ascetic. 
sn7.1:5.3	Right now, lowlife woman, I’m going to refute your teacher’s doctrine!” 
sn7.1:5.4	“Brahmin, I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who can refute the doctrine of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. 
sn7.1:5.5	But anyway, you should go. When you’ve gone you’ll understand.” 
sn7.1:6.1	Then the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan, angry and upset, went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. 
sn7.1:6.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, 
sn7.1:6.3	and addressed the Buddha in verse: 
sn7.1:7.1	“When what is incinerated do you sleep at ease? 
sn7.1:7.2	When what is incinerated is there no sorrow? 
sn7.1:7.3	What is the one thing 
sn7.1:7.4	whose killing you approve?” 
sn7.1:8.1	“When anger’s incinerated you sleep at ease. 
sn7.1:8.2	When anger’s incinerated there is no sorrow. 
sn7.1:8.3	O brahmin, anger has a poisoned root 
sn7.1:8.4	and a honey tip. 
sn7.1:8.5	The noble ones praise its killing, 
sn7.1:8.6	for when it’s incinerated there is no sorrow.” 
sn7.1:9.1	When he said this, the brahmin said to the Buddha, 
sn7.1:9.2	“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! 
sn7.1:9.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
sn7.1:9.4	I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
sn7.1:9.5	Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” 
sn7.1:10.1	And the brahmin received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. 
sn7.1:10.2	Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
sn7.1:10.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”

sn7.2:2.2	“What do you think, brahmin? 
sn7.2:2.3	Do friends and colleagues, relatives and family members, and guests still come to visit you?” 
sn7.2:2.4	“Sometimes they do, Master Gotama.”

sn7.3:1.2	The brahmin Bharadvāja the Fiend heard a rumor to the effect that 
sn7.3:1.3	a brahmin of the Bharadvāja clan had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the ascetic Gotama. Angry and displeased he went to the Buddha and abused and insulted him with rude, harsh words. 
sn7.3:1.4	But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent. 
sn7.3:1.5	Then Bharadvāja the Fiend said to the Buddha, 
sn7.3:1.6	“You’re beaten, ascetic, you’re beaten!” 
sn7.3:2.1	“‘Ha! I won!’ thinks the fool, 
sn7.3:2.2	when speaking with harsh words. 
sn7.3:2.3	Patience is the true victory 
sn7.3:2.4	for those who understand. 
sn7.3:3.1	When you get angry at an angry person 
sn7.3:3.2	you just make things worse for yourself. 
sn7.3:3.3	When you don’t get angry at an angry person 
sn7.3:3.4	you win a battle hard to win. 
sn7.3:4.1	When you know that the other is angry, 
sn7.3:4.2	you act for the good of both 
sn7.3:4.3	yourself and the other 
sn7.3:4.4	if you’re mindful and stay calm. 
sn7.3:5.1	People unskilled in Dhamma 
sn7.3:5.2	consider one who heals both 
sn7.3:5.3	oneself and the other 
sn7.3:5.4	to be a fool.” 
sn7.3:6.1	When he had spoken, Bharadvāja the Fiend said to the Buddha, 
sn7.3:6.2	“Excellent, Master Gotama! …” …

sn7.4:1.3	a brahmin of the Bharadvāja clan had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the ascetic Gotama. Angry and displeased he went to the Buddha and stood silently to one side. 
sn7.4:1.4	Then the Buddha, knowing what Bhāradvāja the Bitter was thinking, addressed him in verse: 
sn7.4:2.1	“Whoever wrongs a man who has done no wrong, 
sn7.4:2.2	a pure man who has not a blemish, 
sn7.4:2.3	the evil backfires on the fool, 
sn7.4:2.4	like fine dust thrown upwind.” 
sn7.4:3.1	When he said this, the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Bitter said to the Buddha,

sn7.5:2.1	“If you were really like your name,

sn7.8:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
sn7.8:1.2	Now at that time ghee and milk-rice had been set out for the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper, who thought, 
sn7.8:1.3	“I will serve the sacred flame! I will perform the fire sacrifice!”

sn7.8:2.2	Wandering indiscriminately for almsfood in Rājagaha, he approached Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper’s home and stood to one side. 
sn7.8:2.3	Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper saw him standing for alms 
sn7.8:2.4	and addressed him in verse:

sn7.8:6.2	a brahmin is a master of the three knowledges.

sn7.9:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the Kosalan lands on the bank of the Sundarika river. 
sn7.9:1.2	Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarika was serving the sacred flame and performing the fire sacrifice on the bank of the river Sundarika. 
sn7.9:1.3	Then he looked all around the four directions, wondering, 
sn7.9:1.4	“Now who might eat the leftovers of this offering?” 
sn7.9:1.5	He saw the Buddha meditating at the root of a certain tree with his robe pulled over his head. 
sn7.9:1.6	Taking the leftovers of the offering in his left hand and a pitcher in the right he approached the Buddha. 
sn7.9:1.7	When he heard Sundarika’s footsteps the Buddha uncovered his head. 
sn7.9:1.8	Sundarika thought, “This man is shaven, he is shaven!” And he wanted to turn back. 
sn7.9:1.9	But he thought, 
sn7.9:1.10	“Even some brahmins are shaven. 
sn7.9:1.11	Why don’t I go to him and ask about his birth?” 
sn7.9:2.1	Then Sundarika the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and said to him, 
sn7.9:2.2	“Sir, in what caste were you born?” 
sn7.9:3.1	“Don’t ask about birth, ask about conduct;
sn7.9:3.2	for any wood can surely generate fire. 
sn7.9:3.3	A steadfast sage, even though from a low class family, 
sn7.9:3.4	is a thoroughbred checked by conscience. 
sn7.9:4.1	Tamed by truth, fulfilled by taming, 
sn7.9:4.2	a complete knowledge master who has completed the spiritual journey—
sn7.9:4.3	that’s who a sacrificer should introduce themselves to, 
sn7.9:4.4	and make a timely offering to one worthy of a religious donation.” 
sn7.9:5.1	“My sacrificial offering must have been well performed, 
sn7.9:5.2	since I have met such a knowledge master! 
sn7.9:5.3	It’s because I’d never met anyone like you 
sn7.9:5.4	that others ate the leftover offering. 
sn7.9:6.1	Eat, Master Gotama, 
sn7.9:6.2	you are truly a brahmin.” 
sn7.9:7.1	“Food enchanted by a spell isn’t fit for me to eat. 
sn7.9:7.2	That’s not the principle of those who see, brahmin. 
sn7.9:7.3	The Buddhas reject things enchanted with spells. 
sn7.9:7.4	Since there is such a principle, brahmin, that’s how they live. 
sn7.9:8.1	Serve with other food and drink 
sn7.9:8.2	the consummate one, the great hermit, 
sn7.9:8.3	with defilements ended and remorse stilled. 
sn7.9:8.4	For he is the field for the seeker of merit.” 
sn7.9:9.1	“Then, Master Gotama, to whom should I give the leftovers of this offering?” 
sn7.9:9.2	“Brahmin, I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who can properly digest these leftovers, except for the Realized One or one of his disciples. 
sn7.9:9.3	Well then, brahmin, throw out those leftovers where there is little that grows, or drop them into water that has no living creatures.” 
sn7.9:10.1	So Sundarika dropped the leftover offering in water that had no living creatures. 
sn7.9:10.2	And when those leftovers were placed in the water, they sizzled and hissed, steaming and fuming. 
sn7.9:10.3	Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day. If you placed it in the water, it would sizzle and hiss, steaming and fuming. 
sn7.9:10.4	In the same way, when those leftovers were placed in the water, they sizzled and hissed, steaming and fuming. 
sn7.9:11.1	Then Sundarika the brahmin, shocked and awestruck, went up to the Buddha, and stood to one side. 
sn7.9:11.2	The Buddha addressed him in verse: 
sn7.9:12.1	“When you’re kindling the wood, brahmin, 
sn7.9:12.2	don’t imagine this is purity, for it’s just an external. 
sn7.9:12.3	For experts say this is no way to purity,
sn7.9:12.4	when one seeks purity in externals.
sn7.9:13.1	I’ve given up kindling firewood, brahmin, 
sn7.9:13.2	now I just light the inner flame. 
sn7.9:13.3	Always blazing, always serene, 
sn7.9:13.4	I am a perfected one leading the spiritual life. 
sn7.9:14.1	Conceit, brahmin, is the burden of your possessions, 
sn7.9:14.2	anger your smoke, and lies your ashes. 
sn7.9:14.3	The tongue is the ladle and the heart the fire altar; 
sn7.9:14.4	a well-tamed self is a person’s light. 
sn7.9:15.1	The teaching is a lake with shores of ethics, brahmin, 
sn7.9:15.2	unclouded, praised by the fine to the good. 
sn7.9:15.3	There the knowledge masters go to bathe, 
sn7.9:15.4	and cross to the far shore without getting wet. 
sn7.9:16.1	Truth, principle, restraint, the spiritual life; 
sn7.9:16.2	the attainment of the supreme based on the middle, brahmin. 
sn7.9:16.3	Pay homage to the upright ones—
sn7.9:16.4	I declare that man to be one who follows the teaching.” 
sn7.9:17.1	When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarika said to the Buddha,

sn8.10:1.2	Thereupon, with his mind, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna checked to see whose mind was liberated and free of attachments. 
sn8.10:1.3	Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought,

sn8.1:1.3	Now at that time Vaṅgīsa was junior, recently gone forth. He had been left behind to look after the dwelling. 
sn8.1:1.4	Then several women dressed in all their finery went to the monastery at Aggāḷava in order to inspect the dwelling. 
sn8.1:1.5	When Vaṅgīsa saw them he became dissatisfied, with lust infecting his mind. 
sn8.1:1.6	Then he thought,

sn8.1:1.9	Why don’t I do it myself?” 
sn8.1:1.10	Then, on the occasion of dispelling his own discontent and giving rise to satisfaction, he recited these verses: 
sn8.1:2.1	“Now that I’ve renounced

sn8.1:2.3	I’m overrun

sn8.1:5.1	I heard this with my own ears

sn8.3:2.2	Completely abandon the different kinds of conceit! 
sn8.3:2.3	Besotted with the different kinds of conceit,

sn8.3:4.3	They enjoy happiness and a good reputation, 
sn8.3:4.4	and they rightly call him a ‘Seer of Truth’.

sn8.5:1.1	At Sāvatthī. 
sn8.5:1.2	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
sn8.5:1.3	“Mendicants!” 
sn8.5:1.4	“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
sn8.5:1.5	The Buddha said this: 
sn8.5:2.1	“Mendicants, speech that has four factors is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s blameless and is not criticized by sensible people. 
sn8.5:2.2	What four? 
sn8.5:2.3	It’s when a mendicant speaks well, not poorly; they speak on the teaching, not against the teaching; they speak pleasantly, not unpleasantly; and they speak truthfully, not falsely. 
sn8.5:2.4	Speech with these four factors is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s blameless and is not criticized by sensible people.” 
sn8.5:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
sn8.5:2.6	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
sn8.5:3.1	“Good people say that well-spoken words are foremost; 
sn8.5:3.2	second, speak on the teaching, not against it; 
sn8.5:3.3	third, speak pleasantly, not unpleasantly; 
sn8.5:3.4	and fourth, speak truthfully, not falsely.” 
sn8.5:4.1	Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said, 
sn8.5:4.2	“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” 
sn8.5:4.3	“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. 
sn8.5:4.4	Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses: 
sn8.5:5.1	“Speak only such words 
sn8.5:5.2	as do not hurt yourself

sn8.5:6.4	that bring nothing bad to others. 
sn8.5:7.1	Truth itself is the undying word: 
sn8.5:7.2	this is an ancient principle. 
sn8.5:7.3	Good people say that the teaching and its meaning 
sn8.5:7.4	are grounded in the truth. 
sn8.5:8.1	The words spoken by the Buddha

sn8.7:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred monks, all of whom were perfected ones. 
sn8.7:1.2	Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks for the invitation to admonish. 
sn8.7:1.3	Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were silent. He addressed them: 
sn8.7:1.4	“Come now, monks, I invite you all: 
sn8.7:1.5	Is there anything I’ve done by way of body or speech that you would criticize?” 
sn8.7:2.1	When he had spoken, Venerable Sāriputta got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: 
sn8.7:2.2	“There is nothing, sir, that you’ve done by way of body or speech that we would criticize. 
sn8.7:2.3	For the Blessed One is the one who gave rise to the unarisen path, who gave birth to the unborn path, who explained the unexplained path. He is the knower of the path, the discoverer of the path, the expert on the path. 
sn8.7:2.4	And now the disciples live following the path; they acquire it later. 
sn8.7:2.5	And sir, I invite the Blessed One. 
sn8.7:2.6	Is there anything I’ve done by way of body or speech that you would criticize?” 
sn8.7:3.1	“There is nothing, Sāriputta, that you’ve done by way of body or speech that I would criticize. 
sn8.7:3.2	Sāriputta, you are astute. You have great wisdom, widespread wisdom, laughing wisdom, swift wisdom, sharp wisdom, penetrating wisdom. 
sn8.7:3.3	A wheel-turning monarch’s oldest son rightly keeps wielding the power set in motion by his father. 
sn8.7:3.4	In the same way, Sāriputta rightly keeps rolling the supreme Wheel of Dhamma that was rolled forth by me.” 
sn8.7:4.1	“Since it seems I have done nothing worthy of the Blessed One’s criticism, 
sn8.7:4.2	is there anything these five hundred monks have done by way of body or speech that you would criticize?” 
sn8.7:4.3	“There is nothing, Sāriputta, that these five hundred monks have done by way of body or speech that I would criticize. 
sn8.7:4.4	For of these five hundred monks, sixty have the three knowledges, sixty have the six direct knowledges, sixty are freed both ways, and the rest are freed by wisdom.” 
sn8.7:5.1	Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said, 
sn8.7:5.2	“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” 
sn8.7:5.3	“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha.

sn9.14:1.3	The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that mendicant, and wanted what’s best for them. So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them up, and addressed them in verse: 
sn9.14:2.1	“This water flower has not been given. 
sn9.14:2.2	When you sniff it, 
sn9.14:2.3	this is one factor of theft. 
sn9.14:2.4	Good sir, you are a thief of scent!” 
sn9.14:3.1	“I do not take, nor do I break; 
sn9.14:3.2	I sniff the water flower from afar. 
sn9.14:3.3	So based on what evidence 
sn9.14:3.4	do you call me a thief of scent? 
sn9.14:4.1	Why don’t you accuse someone 
sn9.14:4.2	who does such vandalizing 
sn9.14:4.3	as digging up the roots, 
sn9.14:4.4	or breaking off the flowers?” 
sn9.14:5.1	“I have nothing to say 
sn9.14:5.2	to a person who is a crude vandal, 
sn9.14:5.3	soiled like a used nappy. 
sn9.14:5.4	You’re the one who deserves to be spoken to. 
sn9.14:6.1	To the man who has not a blemish 
sn9.14:6.2	who is always seeking purity, 
sn9.14:6.3	even a hair-tip of evil 
sn9.14:6.4	seems as big as a cloud.” 
sn9.14:7.1	“Indeed, O spirit, you understand me, 
sn9.14:7.2	and you empathize with me. 
sn9.14:7.3	Please speak to me again, 
sn9.14:7.4	whenever you see something like this.” 
sn9.14:8.1	“I’m no dependent of yours, 
sn9.14:8.2	nor am I your servant. 
sn9.14:8.3	You yourself should know, mendicant, 
sn9.14:8.4	the way that leads to a good place.”

sn9.1:1.1	So I have heard. 
sn9.1:1.2	At one time one of the mendicants was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
sn9.1:1.3	Now at that time that mendicant, during their day’s meditation, was thinking bad, unskillful thoughts to do with the lay life. 
sn9.1:1.4	The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that mendicant, and wanted what’s best for them. So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them up, and addressed them in verse: 
sn9.1:2.1	“You entered the woods desiring seclusion, 
sn9.1:2.2	yet your mind strays to outward things. 
sn9.1:2.3	As a person, you should dispel the desire for people. 
sn9.1:2.4	Then you’ll be happy, free of greed. 
sn9.1:3.1	Mindful, give up discontent; 
sn9.1:3.2	let us remind you of the way of the good. 
sn9.1:3.3	The dusty abyss is so hard to cross; 
sn9.1:3.4	don’t let sensual dust drag you down. 
sn9.1:4.1	Just as a bird strewn with dirt 
sn9.1:4.2	sheds that clingy dust with a shake; 
sn9.1:4.3	so too, an energetic, mindful mendicant 
sn9.1:4.4	sheds that clingy dust with a shake.”

sn9.2:1.1	At one time one of the mendicants was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
sn9.2:1.2	Now at that time that mendicant fell asleep during the day’s meditation. 
sn9.2:1.3	The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that mendicant, and wanted what’s best for them. So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them up, and addressed them in verse: 
sn9.2:2.1	“Get up, mendicant! Why lie down? 
sn9.2:2.2	What’s the point in sleeping? 
sn9.2:2.3	How can the afflicted slumber
sn9.2:2.4	when injured by an arrow strike? 
sn9.2:3.1	You should amplify the faith 
sn9.2:3.2	that led you to go forth 
sn9.2:3.3	from the home life to homelessness. 
sn9.2:3.4	Don’t fall under the sway of slumber.” 
sn9.2:4.1	“Sensual pleasures are impermanent and unstable, 
sn9.2:4.2	but idiots still fall for them. 
sn9.2:4.3	Among those who are bound, they’re free and unattached: 
sn9.2:4.4	why bother a renunciate? 
sn9.2:5.1	By removing desire and greed, 
sn9.2:5.2	by going beyond ignorance, 
sn9.2:5.3	that knowledge has been perfectly cleansed: 
sn9.2:5.4	why bother a renunciate? 
sn9.2:6.1	By breaking ignorance with knowledge, 
sn9.2:6.2	by the ending of defilements, 
sn9.2:6.3	they’re sorrowless, unstressed: 
sn9.2:6.4	why bother a renunciate? 
sn9.2:7.1	Energetic, resolute, 
sn9.2:7.2	always staunchly vigorous, 
sn9.2:7.3	aspiring to extinguishment:

sn9.3:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Kassapagotta, having withdrawn for his day’s meditation, tried to advise a tribal hunter. 
sn9.3:1.3	Then the deity haunting that forest approached Kassapagotta wanting to stir him up, and recited these verses: 
sn9.3:2.1	“A tribal hunter wandering the rugged hills 
sn9.3:2.2	is unintelligent, unthinking. 
sn9.3:2.3	It’s a waste of time to advise him; 
sn9.3:2.4	this mendicant seems to me like an idiot. 
sn9.3:3.1	The tribal hunter listens without understanding, 
sn9.3:3.2	he looks without seeing. 
sn9.3:3.3	Though the teaching is spoken, 
sn9.3:3.4	the fool doesn’t get it. 
sn9.3:4.1	Even if you lit ten lamps 
sn9.3:4.2	and brought them to him, Kassapa, 
sn9.3:4.3	he wouldn’t see anything,

sn9.4:1.1	At one time several mendicants were staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
sn9.4:1.2	Then after completing the three months of the rainy season residence, those mendicants set out wandering. 
sn9.4:1.3	Not seeing those mendicants, the deity haunting that forest cried. And on that occasion they recited this verse: 
sn9.4:2.1	“Seeing so many vacated seats today, 
sn9.4:2.2	it seems to me that they must have become dissatisfied. 
sn9.4:2.3	They were so learned, such brilliant speakers! 
sn9.4:2.4	Where have these disciples of Gotama gone?” 
sn9.4:3.1	When they had spoken, another deity replied with this verse: 
sn9.4:4.1	“They’ve gone to Magadha, they’ve gone to Kosala, 
sn9.4:4.2	and some are in the Vajjian lands. 
sn9.4:4.3	Like deer that wander free of ties,

sn9.5:1.2	Now at that time Ānanda was spending too much time informing the lay people. 
sn9.5:1.3	Then the deity haunting that forest had compassion for Ānanda, wanting what’s best for him. So they approached him wanting to stir him up, and recited these verses: 
sn9.5:2.1	“You’ve left for the jungle, the root of a tree, 
sn9.5:2.2	with quenching in your heart. 
sn9.5:2.3	Practice absorption, Gotama, don’t be negligent!

sn9.6:1.1	At one time Venerable Anuruddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
sn9.6:1.2	Then a certain deity of the company of the Thirty-Three named Penelope had been Anuruddha’s partner in a former life. She went up to Anuruddha, and recited these verses: 
sn9.6:2.1	“Set your heart there, 
sn9.6:2.2	where you used to live; 
sn9.6:2.3	among the gods of the Thirty-Three, 
sn9.6:2.4	whose every desire is granted! 
sn9.6:2.5	At the fore of a retinue 
sn9.6:2.6	of divine maidens, you’ll shine!” 
sn9.6:3.1	“Divine maidens are in a sorry state, 
sn9.6:3.2	stuck in self-identity. 
sn9.6:3.3	And those beings too are in a sorry state, 
sn9.6:3.4	who are attached to divine maidens.” 
sn9.6:4.1	“They don’t know pleasure

sn9.6:5.1	“Fool, don’t you understand 
sn9.6:5.2	the saying of the perfected ones: 
sn9.6:5.3	all conditions are impermanent, 
sn9.6:5.4	their nature is to rise and fall; 
sn9.6:5.5	having arisen, they cease; 
sn9.6:5.6	their stilling is true bliss. 
sn9.6:6.1	Penelope, weaver of the web, 
sn9.6:6.2	there’ll be no more lives in the hosts of gods. 
sn9.6:6.3	Transmigration through births is finished,

sn9.7:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Nāgadatta had been entering the village too early and returning late in the day. 
sn9.7:1.3	Then the deity haunting that forest had compassion for Nāgadatta, wanting what’s best for him. So they approached him wanting to stir him up, and recited these verses: 
sn9.7:2.1	“Entering too early, 
sn9.7:2.2	and returning after spending too much of the day, 
sn9.7:2.3	Nāgadatta socializes with lay people, 
sn9.7:2.4	sharing their joys and sorrows. 
sn9.7:3.1	I’m afraid for Nāgadatta; he’s so reckless 
sn9.7:3.2	in his attachment to families. 
sn9.7:3.3	May he not come under the King of Death’s power, 
sn9.7:3.4	under the sway of the terminator!”

sn9.8:1.1	At one time one of the monks was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. 
sn9.8:1.2	Now at that time that monk had become too closely involved in the affairs of a certain family. 
sn9.8:1.3	The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that monk, wanting what’s best for him. So, wanting to stir him up, they manifested in the appearance of the mistress of that family, approached the monk, and addressed him in verse: 
sn9.8:2.1	“On the banks of the rivers and in the guest houses, 
sn9.8:2.2	in meeting halls and highways, 
sn9.8:2.3	people come together and gossip: 
sn9.8:2.4	what’s going on between you and me?” 
sn9.8:3.1	“There are lots of annoying sounds 
sn9.8:3.2	that an austere ascetic must endure. 
sn9.8:3.3	But they mustn’t be dismayed by that, 
sn9.8:3.4	for that’s not what defiles you. 
sn9.8:4.1	If you’re startled by every little sound, 
sn9.8:4.2	like a wind-deer in the wood, 
sn9.8:4.3	they’ll call you ‘flighty minded’; 
sn9.8:4.4	and your practice won’t succeed.”

sn9.9:1.2	Now at that time the Vajjis were holding an all-night event in Vesālī. 
sn9.9:1.3	Then that mendicant, groaning at the noise of musical instruments being beaten and played, on that occasion recited this verse: 
sn9.9:2.1	“We dwell alone in the wilderness, 
sn9.9:2.2	like a cast-off log in the forest. 
sn9.9:2.3	On a night like this, 
sn9.9:2.4	who’s worse off than me?” 
sn9.9:3.1	The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that mendicant, and wanted what’s best for them. So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them up, and addressed them in verse: 
sn9.9:4.1	“You dwell alone in the wilderness, 
sn9.9:4.2	like a cast-off log in the forest. 
sn9.9:4.3	Lots of people are jealous of you, 
sn9.9:4.4	like beings in hell of those going to heaven.” 
sn9.9:5.1	Impelled by that deity, that mendicant was struck with a sense of urgency.
snp1.10:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp1.10:0.2	With Āḷavaka 
snp1.10:1.1	So I have heard. 
snp1.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Āḷavī in the haunt of the native spirit Āḷavaka. 
snp1.10:1.3	Then the native spirit Āḷavaka went up to the Buddha, and said to him: 
snp1.10:1.4	“Get out, ascetic!” 
snp1.10:1.5	Saying, “All right, sir,” the Buddha went out. 
snp1.10:1.6	“Get in, ascetic!” 
snp1.10:1.7	Saying, “All right, sir,” the Buddha went in. 
snp1.10:2.1	For a second time … 
snp1.10:2.2	And for a third time the native spirit Āḷavaka said to the Buddha, 
snp1.10:2.3	“Get out, ascetic!” 
snp1.10:2.4	Saying, “All right, sir,” the Buddha went out. 
snp1.10:2.5	“Get in, ascetic!” 
snp1.10:2.6	Saying, “All right, sir,” the Buddha went in. 
snp1.10:3.1	And for a fourth time the native spirit Āḷavaka said to the Buddha, 
snp1.10:3.2	“Get out, ascetic!” 
snp1.10:3.3	“No, sir, I won’t get out. 
snp1.10:3.4	Do what you must.” 
snp1.10:4.1	“I will ask you a question, ascetic. 
snp1.10:4.2	If you don’t answer me, I’ll drive you insane, or explode your heart, or grab you by the feet and throw you to the far shore of the Ganges!” 
snp1.10:5.1	“I don’t see anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans who could do that to me. 
snp1.10:5.2	But anyway, ask what you wish.” 
snp1.10:5.3	Then the native spirit Āḷavaka addressed the Buddha in verse: 
snp1.10:6.1	“What’s a person’s best wealth? 
snp1.10:6.2	What brings happiness when practiced well? 
snp1.10:6.3	What’s the sweetest taste of all? 
snp1.10:6.4	The one who they say has the best life: how do they live?” 
snp1.10:7.1	“Faith here is a person’s best wealth. 
snp1.10:7.2	the teaching brings happiness when practiced well.
snp1.10:7.3	Truth is the sweetest taste of all. 
snp1.10:7.4	The one who they say has the best life lives by wisdom.”
snp1.10:8.1	“How do you cross the flood? 
snp1.10:8.2	How do you cross the deluge? 
snp1.10:8.3	How do you get over suffering? 
snp1.10:8.4	How do you get purified?” 
snp1.10:9.1	“By faith you cross the flood, 
snp1.10:9.2	and by diligence the deluge. 
snp1.10:9.3	By energy you get past suffering, 
snp1.10:9.4	and you’re purified by wisdom.” 
snp1.10:10.1	“How do you get wisdom? 
snp1.10:10.2	How do you earn wealth? 
snp1.10:10.3	How do you get a good reputation? 
snp1.10:10.4	How do you hold on to friends? 
snp1.10:10.5	How do the departed not grieve 
snp1.10:10.6	when passing from this world to the next?” 
snp1.10:11.1	“One who is diligent and discerning 
snp1.10:11.2	gains wisdom by wanting to learn, 
snp1.10:11.3	having faith in the perfected ones, 
snp1.10:11.4	and the teaching for becoming extinguished. 
snp1.10:12.1	Being responsible, acting appropriately, 
snp1.10:12.2	and working hard you earn wealth. 
snp1.10:12.3	Truthfulness wins you a good reputation. 
snp1.10:12.4	You hold on to friends by giving. 
snp1.10:13.1	A faithful householder 
snp1.10:13.2	who has these four qualities 
snp1.10:13.3	does not grieve after passing away: 
snp1.10:13.4	truth, principle, steadfastness, and generosity. 
snp1.10:14.1	Go ahead, ask others as well, 
snp1.10:14.2	there are many ascetics and brahmins. 
snp1.10:14.3	See whether anything better is found 
snp1.10:14.4	than truth, self-control, generosity, and patience.” 
snp1.10:15.1	“Why now would I question 
snp1.10:15.2	the many ascetics and brahmins? 
snp1.10:15.3	Today I understand 
snp1.10:15.4	what’s good for the next life. 
snp1.10:16.1	It was truly for my benefit 
snp1.10:16.2	that the Buddha came to stay at Āḷavī. 
snp1.10:16.3	Today I understand 
snp1.10:16.4	where a gift is very fruitful. 
snp1.10:17.1	I myself will journey

snp1.11:1.1	Walking and standing, 
snp1.11:1.2	sitting and lying down,

snp1.11:1.4	these are the movements of the body.
snp1.11:2.1	Linked together by bones and sinews,
snp1.11:2.2	plastered over with flesh and hide,

snp1.11:5.3	There is muck from the eyes,

snp1.11:6.2	The mouth sometimes vomits

snp1.11:7.3	Governed by ignorance,

snp1.11:8.2	bloated and livid,
snp1.11:8.3	discarded in a charnel ground,
snp1.11:8.4	the relatives forget it.
snp1.11:9.1	It’s devoured by dogs,
snp1.11:9.2	by jackals, wolves, and worms.
snp1.11:9.3	It’s devoured by crows and vultures,
snp1.11:9.4	and any other creatures there.
snp1.11:10.1	A wise mendicant here,
snp1.11:10.2	having heard the Buddha’s words,
snp1.11:10.3	fully understands it,

snp1.11:11.1	“As this is, so is that,

snp1.12:4.4	need not strive, for they have reached the far shore. 
snp1.12:5.1	The champion, all-knower, so very intelligent, 
snp1.12:5.2	unsullied in the midst of all things,
snp1.12:5.3	has given up all, freed in the ending of craving:
snp1.12:5.4	that’s who the wise know as a sage.
snp1.12:6.1	Strong in wisdom, with precepts and observances intact, 
snp1.12:6.2	serene, loving absorption, mindful,
snp1.12:6.3	released from chains, kind, undefiled:
snp1.12:6.4	that’s who the wise know as a sage.
snp1.12:7.1	The diligent sage wandering alone,
snp1.12:7.2	is unaffected by praise and blame—
snp1.12:7.3	like a lion not startled by sounds,
snp1.12:7.4	like wind not caught in a net,
snp1.12:7.5	like water not sticking to a lotus.
snp1.12:7.6	Leader of others, not by others led:
snp1.12:7.7	that’s who the wise know as a sage.
snp1.12:8.1	Steady as a post in a bathing-place
snp1.12:8.2	when others speak endlessly against them,
snp1.12:8.3	freed of greed, with senses stilled:
snp1.12:8.4	that’s who the wise know as a sage.
snp1.12:9.1	Steadfast, straight as a shuttle,
snp1.12:9.2	horrified by wicked deeds,
snp1.12:9.3	discerning the just and the unjust:
snp1.12:9.4	that’s who the wise know as a sage.
snp1.12:10.1	Restrained, they do no evil,
snp1.12:10.2	young or middle-aged, the sage is self-controlled.
snp1.12:10.3	Irreproachable, he does not insult anyone:
snp1.12:10.4	that’s who the wise know as a sage.
snp1.12:11.1	When one who lives on charity receives alms,
snp1.12:11.2	from the top, the middle, or the leftovers,
snp1.12:11.3	they think it unworthy to praise or put down:
snp1.12:11.4	that’s who the wise know as a sage.
snp1.12:12.1	The sage lives refraining from sex,
snp1.12:12.2	even when young is not tied down,
snp1.12:12.3	refraining from indulgence and negligence, freed:
snp1.12:12.4	that’s who the wise know as a sage.
snp1.12:13.1	Understanding the world, the seer of the ultimate goal,
snp1.12:13.2	the poised one who has crossed the flood and the ocean,
snp1.12:13.3	has cut the ties, unattached and undefiled:
snp1.12:13.4	that’s who the wise know as a sage.
snp1.12:14.1	The two are not the same, far apart in lifestyle and conduct—
snp1.12:14.2	the householder providing for a wife, and the selfless one true to their vows.
snp1.12:14.3	The unrestrained householder kills other creatures,
snp1.12:14.4	while the restrained sage always protects living creatures.
snp1.12:15.1	As the crested blue-necked peacock flying through the sky
snp1.12:15.2	never approaches the speed of the swan,
snp1.12:15.3	so the householder cannot compete with the mendicant,
snp1.12:15.4	the sage meditating secluded in the woods.

snp1.2:0.2	With Dhaniya the Cowherd
snp1.2:1.1	“I’ve boiled my rice and drawn my milk,”
snp1.2:1.2	said Dhaniya the cowherd,
snp1.2:1.3	“I stay with my family along the bank of the Mahī.
snp1.2:1.4	My hut is roofed, my fire kindled:
snp1.2:1.5	so rain, sky, if you wish.”
snp1.2:2.1	“I boil not with anger and have drawn out hard-heartedness,”
snp1.2:2.2	said the Buddha,
snp1.2:2.3	“I stay for one night along the bank of the Mahī.
snp1.2:2.4	My hut is wide open, my fire is quenched:
snp1.2:2.5	so rain, sky, if you wish.”
snp1.2:3.1	“No gadflies or mosquitoes are found,”
snp1.2:3.2	said Dhaniya,
snp1.2:3.3	“cows graze on the lush meadow grass.
snp1.2:3.4	They get by even when the rain comes:
snp1.2:3.5	so rain, sky, if you wish.”
snp1.2:4.1	“I bound a raft and made it well,” 
snp1.2:4.2	said the Buddha,
snp1.2:4.3	“and with it I crossed over, went beyond, and dispelled the flood.
snp1.2:4.4	Now I have no need for a raft:
snp1.2:4.5	so rain, sky, if you wish.”
snp1.2:5.1	“My wife is obedient, not wanton,”
snp1.2:5.2	said Dhaniya,
snp1.2:5.3	“long have we lived together happily.
snp1.2:5.4	I hear nothing bad about her:
snp1.2:5.5	so rain, sky, if you wish.”
snp1.2:6.1	“My mind is obedient and freed,”
snp1.2:6.2	said the Buddha,
snp1.2:6.3	“long nurtured and well-tamed.
snp1.2:6.4	Nothing bad is found in me:
snp1.2:6.5	so rain, sky, if you wish.”
snp1.2:7.1	“I am self-employed,”
snp1.2:7.2	said Dhaniya,
snp1.2:7.3	“and my healthy children likewise.
snp1.2:7.4	I hear nothing bad about them:
snp1.2:7.5	so rain, sky, if you wish.”
snp1.2:8.1	“I am no-one’s lackey,”

snp1.2:8.4	I have no need for wages:

snp1.2:9.1	“I have heifers and sucklings,”
snp1.2:9.2	said Dhaniya,
snp1.2:9.3	“cows in calf and breeding cows.
snp1.2:9.4	I’ve also got a bull, leader of the herd here:

snp1.2:11.1	“The stakes are driven in, unshakable,”

snp1.2:11.3	“The grass halters are new and well-woven,
snp1.2:11.4	not even the sucklings can break them:
snp1.2:11.5	so rain, sky, if you wish.”
snp1.2:12.1	“Like a bull I broke the bonds,”
snp1.2:12.2	said the Buddha,
snp1.2:12.3	“like an elephant I snapped the vine.
snp1.2:12.4	I will never lie in a womb again:
snp1.2:12.5	so rain, sky, if you wish.”
snp1.2:13.1	Right then a thundercloud rained down,
snp1.2:13.2	soaking the uplands and valleys. 
snp1.2:13.3	Hearing the sky rain down,
snp1.2:13.4	Dhaniya said this:
snp1.2:14.1	“It is no small gain for us
snp1.2:14.2	that we have seen the Buddha.
snp1.2:14.3	We come to you for refuge, Seer.
snp1.2:14.4	O great sage, please be our Teacher.

snp1.2:15.2	shall lead the spiritual life under the Holy One

snp1.2:15.4	we shall make an end of suffering.”
snp1.2:16.1	“Your children bring you delight!”
snp1.2:16.2	said Māra the Wicked,
snp1.2:16.3	“Your cattle also bring you delight! 
snp1.2:16.4	For attachments are a man’s delight; 
snp1.2:16.5	without attachments there’s no delight.” 
snp1.2:17.1	“Your children bring you sorrow,”

snp1.3:0.2	The Rhinoceros Horn
snp1.3:1.1	When you've laid down arms toward all creatures,
snp1.3:1.2	not harming even a single one,
snp1.3:1.3	don’t wish for a child, let alone a companion:
snp1.3:1.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:2.1	Those with close relationships have affection,
snp1.3:2.2	following which this pain arises.
snp1.3:2.3	Seeing this danger born of affection,
snp1.3:2.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:3.1	When feelings for friends and loved ones
snp1.3:3.2	are tied up in selfish love, you miss out on the goal.
snp1.3:3.3	Seeing this peril in intimacy, 
snp1.3:3.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:4.1	As a spreading bamboo gets entangled,
snp1.3:4.2	so does concern for partners and children.
snp1.3:4.3	Like a bamboo shoot unimpeded,
snp1.3:4.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:5.1	As a wild deer loose in the forest
snp1.3:5.2	grazes wherever it wants,
snp1.3:5.3	a smart person looking for freedom would
snp1.3:5.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:6.1	When among friends, whether staying in place
snp1.3:6.2	or going on a journey, you’re always on call.
snp1.3:6.3	Looking for the uncoveted freedom,
snp1.3:6.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:7.1	Among friends you have fun and games,
snp1.3:7.2	and for children you are full of love.
snp1.3:7.3	Though loathe to depart from those you hold dear,
snp1.3:7.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:8.1	At ease in any quarter, unresisting,
snp1.3:8.2	content with whatever comes your way;
snp1.3:8.3	prevailing over adversities, dauntless,
snp1.3:8.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:9.1	Even some renunciates are hard to please,
snp1.3:9.2	as are some layfolk dwelling at home.
snp1.3:9.3	Don’t worry about others’ children,
snp1.3:9.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:10.1	Having shed the marks of the home life,
snp1.3:10.2	like the fallen leaves of the Shady Orchid Tree;
snp1.3:10.3	having cut the bonds of the home life, a hero would
snp1.3:10.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:11.1	If you find an alert companion, 
snp1.3:11.2	a wise and virtuous friend, 
snp1.3:11.3	then, overcoming all adversities, 
snp1.3:11.4	wander with them, joyful and mindful. 
snp1.3:12.1	If you find no alert companion, 
snp1.3:12.2	no wise and virtuous friend, 
snp1.3:12.3	then, like a king who flees his conquered realm, 
snp1.3:12.4	wander alone like a tusker in the wilds. 
snp1.3:13.1	Clearly we praise the blessing of a friend,
snp1.3:13.2	it’s good to be with friends your equal or better.
snp1.3:13.3	but failing to find them, eating blamelessly,
snp1.3:13.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:14.1	Though made of shining gold, well-finished by a smith,
snp1.3:14.2	when two bracelets share the same arm
snp1.3:14.3	they clash up against each other. Seeing this,
snp1.3:14.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:15.1	Thinking, “So too, if I had a partner, 
snp1.3:15.2	there’d be flattery or curses.”
snp1.3:15.3	Seeing this peril in the future, 
snp1.3:15.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:16.1	Sensual pleasures are diverse, sweet, delightful,
snp1.3:16.2	appearing in disguise they disturb the mind.
snp1.3:16.3	Seeing danger in the many kinds of sensual stimulation,
snp1.3:16.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:17.1	This is a calamity, a boil, a disaster,
snp1.3:17.2	an illness, a dart, and a danger for me.
snp1.3:17.3	Seeing this peril in sensuality, 
snp1.3:17.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:18.1	Heat and cold, hunger and thirst,
snp1.3:18.2	wind and sun, flies and snakes:
snp1.3:18.3	having put up with all these things,
snp1.3:18.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:19.1	As a full-grown elephant, lotus-eating, magnificent,
snp1.3:19.2	forsaking the herd,
snp1.3:19.3	stays where it wants in the forest, 
snp1.3:19.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:20.1	It’s impossible for one who delights in company
snp1.3:20.2	to experience even temporary freedom.
snp1.3:20.3	Heeding the speech of the Kinsman of the Sun,
snp1.3:20.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:21.1	Thinking, “I am one who has left warped views behind,
snp1.3:21.2	has reached the sure way, has gained the path,
snp1.3:21.3	has given rise to knowledge, and needs no-one to guide me”,
snp1.3:21.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:22.1	No greed, no guile, no thirst, no slur,
snp1.3:22.2	dross and delusion is smelted off;
snp1.3:22.3	free of hoping for anything in the world,
snp1.3:22.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:23.1	Avoid a wicked companion, 
snp1.3:23.2	blind to the good, habitually immoral.
snp1.3:23.3	One ought not befriend the heedless and hankering, but
snp1.3:23.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:24.1	Spend time with a learned expert who has memorized the teachings,
snp1.3:24.2	an eloquent and uplifting friend.
snp1.3:24.3	When you understand the meanings and have dispelled doubt,
snp1.3:24.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:25.1	When you realize that worldly fun and games
snp1.3:25.2	and pleasure are unsatisfying, disregarding them,
snp1.3:25.3	as one unadorned, a speaker of truth,
snp1.3:25.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:26.1	Children, partner, father, mother,
snp1.3:26.2	wealth and grain and relatives:
snp1.3:26.3	having given up sensual pleasures to this extent,
snp1.3:26.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:27.1	“This is a snare. Here there’s hardly any happiness,
snp1.3:27.2	little gratification, and it’s full of drawbacks. 
snp1.3:27.3	It’s a hook.” Knowing this, a thoughtful person would
snp1.3:27.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:28.1	Having burst apart the fetters,
snp1.3:28.2	like a fish that tears the net and swims free,
snp1.3:28.3	or a fire not returning to ground it has burned,
snp1.3:28.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:29.1	Eyes downcast, not footloose,
snp1.3:29.2	senses guarded, mind protected,
snp1.3:29.3	uncorrupted, not burning with desire,
snp1.3:29.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:30.1	Having shed the marks of the home life,
snp1.3:30.2	like the fallen leaves of the Shady Orchid Tree,
snp1.3:30.3	and gone forth in the ocher robe,
snp1.3:30.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:31.1	Not wanton, nor rousing greed for tastes,
snp1.3:31.2	providing for no other, wandering indiscriminately for alms,
snp1.3:31.3	not attached to this family or that,
snp1.3:31.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:32.1	When you’ve given up five mental obstacles,
snp1.3:32.2	and expelled all corruptions,
snp1.3:32.3	and cut off affection and hate, being independent,
snp1.3:32.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:33.1	When you’ve put pleasure and pain behind you,
snp1.3:33.2	and former happiness and sadness, 
snp1.3:33.3	and gained equanimity serene and pure,
snp1.3:33.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:34.1	With energy roused to reach the ultimate goal,
snp1.3:34.2	not sluggish in mind or lazy,
snp1.3:34.3	vigorous, strong and powerful,
snp1.3:34.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:35.1	Not neglecting retreat and absorption,
snp1.3:35.2	always living in line with the teachings,
snp1.3:35.3	comprehending the danger in rebirths,
snp1.3:35.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:36.1	One whose aim is the ending of craving—
snp1.3:36.2	diligent, clever, learned, mindful, resolute—
snp1.3:36.3	who has assessed the teaching and is bound for awakening, should
snp1.3:36.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:37.1	Like a lion not startled by sounds,
snp1.3:37.2	like wind not caught in a net,
snp1.3:37.3	like water not sticking to a lotus,
snp1.3:37.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:38.1	Like the fierce-fanged lion, king of beasts,
snp1.3:38.2	who wanders as victor and master,
snp1.3:38.3	you should frequent remote lodgings, and
snp1.3:38.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:39.1	In time, cultivate freedom through
snp1.3:39.2	love, compassion, rejoicing, and equanimity.
snp1.3:39.3	Not upset by anything in the world,
snp1.3:39.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:40.1	Having given up greed, hate, and delusion, 
snp1.3:40.2	having burst apart the fetters,
snp1.3:40.3	unafraid at the end of life,
snp1.3:40.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.
snp1.3:41.1	They befriend you and serve you for their own sake;
snp1.3:41.2	these days it’s hard to find friends lacking ulterior motive.
snp1.3:41.3	Impure folk cleverly profit themselves—
snp1.3:41.4	live alone like a rhino’s horn.

snp1.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans in the Southern Hills near the brahmin village of Ekanāḷa. 
snp1.4:1.3	Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Farmer had harnessed around five hundred plows, it being the season for sowing. 
snp1.4:1.4	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to where Bhāradvāja the Farmer was working. 
snp1.4:1.5	Now at that time Bhāradvāja the Farmer was distributing food. 
snp1.4:1.6	Then the Buddha went to where the distribution was taking place and stood to one side. 
snp1.4:2.1	Bhāradvāja the Farmer saw him standing for alms 
snp1.4:2.2	and said to him, 
snp1.4:2.3	“I plough and sow, ascetic, and then I eat. 
snp1.4:2.4	You too should plough and sow, then you may eat.” 
snp1.4:3.1	“I too plough and sow, brahmin, and then I eat.” 
snp1.4:3.2	“I don’t see Master Gotama with a yoke or plow or plowshare or goad or oxen, yet he says: 
snp1.4:3.4	“I too plough and sow, brahmin, and then I eat.” 
snp1.4:4.1	Then Bhāradvāja the Farmer addressed the Buddha in verse: 
snp1.4:5.1	“You claim to be a farmer, 
snp1.4:5.2	but I don’t see your plough. 
snp1.4:5.3	If you’re a farmer, declare to me: 
snp1.4:5.4	so that we can recognize a brahmin.” 
snp1.4:6.1	“Faith is my seed, austerity my rain, 
snp1.4:6.2	and wisdom is my yoke and plough. 
snp1.4:6.3	Conscience is my pole, mind my strap, 
snp1.4:6.4	mindfulness my plowshare and goad. 
snp1.4:7.1	Guarded in body and speech, 
snp1.4:7.2	I restrict my intake of food. 
snp1.4:7.3	I use truth as my scythe, 
snp1.4:7.4	and gentleness is my release. 
snp1.4:8.1	Energy is my beast of burden, 
snp1.4:8.2	transporting me to a place of sanctuary. 
snp1.4:8.3	It goes without turning back 
snp1.4:8.4	where there is no sorrow. 
snp1.4:9.1	That’s how to do the farming 
snp1.4:9.2	that has the Deathless as its fruit. 
snp1.4:9.3	When you finish this farming 
snp1.4:9.4	you’re released from all suffering.” 
snp1.4:10.1	Then Bhāradvāja the Farmer filled a large bronze dish with milk-rice and presented it to the Buddha:
snp1.4:10.2	“Eat the milk-rice, Master Gotama, 
snp1.4:10.3	you are truly a farmer. 
snp1.4:10.4	For Master Gotama does the farming that has the Deathless as its fruit.” 
snp1.4:11.1	“Food enchanted by a spell isn’t fit for me to eat. 
snp1.4:11.2	That’s not the principle of those who see, brahmin. 
snp1.4:11.3	The Buddhas reject things enchanted with spells. 
snp1.4:11.4	Since there is such a principle, brahmin, that’s how they live. 
snp1.4:12.1	Serve with other food and drink 
snp1.4:12.2	the consummate one, the great hermit, 
snp1.4:12.3	with defilements ended and remorse stilled. 
snp1.4:12.4	For he is the field for the seeker of merit.” 
snp1.4:13.1	“Then, Master Gotama, to whom should I give the milk-rice?” 
snp1.4:13.2	“Brahmin, I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who can properly digest this milk-rice, except for the Realized One or one of his disciples. 
snp1.4:13.3	Well then, brahmin, throw out the milk-rice where there is little that grows, or drop it into water that has no living creatures.” 
snp1.4:14.1	So Bhāradvāja the Farmer dropped the milk-rice in water that had no living creatures. 
snp1.4:14.2	And when the milk-rice was placed in the water, it sizzled and hissed, steaming and fuming. 
snp1.4:14.3	Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day. If you placed it in the water, it would sizzle and hiss, steaming and fuming. 
snp1.4:14.4	In the same way, when the milk-rice was placed in the water, it sizzled and hissed, steaming and fuming. 
snp1.4:15.1	Then Bhāradvāja the Farmer, shocked and awestruck,  went up to the Buddha, bowed down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said, 
snp1.4:15.2	“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! 
snp1.4:15.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
snp1.4:15.4	I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
snp1.4:15.5	Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” 
snp1.4:16.1	And Bhāradvāja the Farmer received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. 
snp1.4:16.2	Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
snp1.4:16.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” 
snp1.4:16.4	And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected.

snp1.5:0.2	With Cunda 
snp1.5:1.1	“I ask the sage abounding in wisdom,”
snp1.5:1.2	said Cunda the smith,
snp1.5:1.3	“the Buddha, master of the teaching, free of craving,
snp1.5:1.4	best of men, excellent charioteer, please tell me this:
snp1.5:1.5	how many ascetics are there in the world?”
snp1.5:2.1	“There are four ascetics, not a fifth.”
snp1.5:2.2	said the Buddha to Cunda,
snp1.5:2.3	“Being asked to bear witness, I will explain them to you:
snp1.5:2.4	the path-victor, the path-teacher,
snp1.5:2.5	the path-liver, and the path-wrecker.”
snp1.5:3.1	“Who is a path-victor according to the Buddhas?”
snp1.5:3.2	said Cunda the smith,
snp1.5:3.3	“and how is one an unequaled path-explainer?
snp1.5:3.4	Tell me when asked about one who lives the path,
snp1.5:3.5	then declare the path-wrecker.”
snp1.5:4.1	“Rid of doubt, free of thorns,
snp1.5:4.2	delighting in quenching, not fawning,
snp1.5:4.3	a guide for the world with its gods.
snp1.5:4.4	The Buddhas say one such is victor of the path.
snp1.5:5.1	Knowing the ultimate as ultimate,
snp1.5:5.2	they explain and analyze the teaching right here.
snp1.5:5.3	That sage unstirred, with doubt cut off,
snp1.5:5.4	is the second mendicant, I say, the path-teacher.
snp1.5:6.1	Living restrained and mindful on the path
snp1.5:6.2	of the well-taught passages of teaching,
snp1.5:6.3	cultivating blameless states,
snp1.5:6.4	is the third mendicant, I say, the path-liver.
snp1.5:7.1	Dressed like one true to their vows,
snp1.5:7.2	pushy, rude, a corrupter of families,
snp1.5:7.3	devious, unrestrained, chaff,
snp1.5:7.4	the path-wrecker’s life is a sham.
snp1.5:8.1	A layperson who gets this,
snp1.5:8.2	a learned, wise noble disciple,
snp1.5:8.3	knows that ‘They are not all like that one’.
snp1.5:8.4	So when they see them they don’t lose their faith.
snp1.5:8.5	For how could one equate them—
snp1.5:8.6	the corrupt with the uncorrupt, the pure with the impure?”

snp1.6:0.2	Downfalls
snp1.6:1.1	So I have heard. 
snp1.6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
snp1.6:1.3	Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. 
snp1.6:1.4	Standing to one side, that deity addressed the Buddha in verse: 
snp1.6:2.1	“We ask Gotama
snp1.6:2.2	about a man’s downfall.
snp1.6:2.3	We have come to ask you sir:
snp1.6:2.4	what leads to downfall?”
snp1.6:3.1	“It’s easy to know success,
snp1.6:3.2	and downfall is just as easy.
snp1.6:3.3	One who loves the teaching succeeds,
snp1.6:3.4	but a hater of the teaching meets their downfall.”
snp1.6:4.1	“We get what you’re saying,
snp1.6:4.2	this is the first downfall. 
snp1.6:4.3	Tell us the second, Blessed One:
snp1.6:4.4	what leads to downfall?”
snp1.6:5.1	“The bad are dear to him,
snp1.6:5.2	he has no love for the good.
snp1.6:5.3	He believes the teaching of the bad;
snp1.6:5.4	and that leads to his downfall.”
snp1.6:6.1	“We get what you’re saying,
snp1.6:6.2	this is the second downfall. 
snp1.6:6.3	Tell us the third, Blessed One:
snp1.6:6.4	what leads to downfall?”
snp1.6:7.1	“Fond of sleep, fond of company,

snp1.6:7.3	he’s lazy, marked by anger,
snp1.6:7.4	and that leads to his downfall.”

snp1.6:10.1	“We get what you’re saying,

snp1.6:13.1	“A man with plenty of wealth—
snp1.6:13.2	gold and food—
snp1.6:13.3	eats delicacies alone,
snp1.6:13.4	and that leads to his downfall.”
snp1.6:14.1	“We get what you’re saying,
snp1.6:14.2	this is the sixth downfall. 
snp1.6:14.3	Tell us the seventh, Blessed One:
snp1.6:14.4	what leads to downfall?”
snp1.6:15.1	“Vain of caste, wealth,
snp1.6:15.2	and clan, a man
snp1.6:15.3	looks down on his own family,
snp1.6:15.4	and that leads to his downfall.”

snp1.6:16.3	Tell us the eighth, Blessed One:

snp1.7:0.2	The Lowlife
snp1.7:1.1	So I have heard. 
snp1.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
snp1.7:1.3	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. 
snp1.7:1.4	Now at that time in the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshipper’s home the sacred flame had been kindled and the oblation prepared.
snp1.7:1.5	Wandering indiscriminately for almsfood in Sāvatthī, the Buddha approached Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper’s house. 
snp1.7:2.1	Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper saw the Buddha coming off in the distance 
snp1.7:2.2	and said to him, 
snp1.7:2.3	“Stop right there, shaveling!
snp1.7:2.4	Right there, fake ascetic!
snp1.7:2.5	Right there, lowlife!”
snp1.7:3.1	When he said this, the Buddha said to him, 
snp1.7:3.2	“But brahmin, do you know what is a lowlife or what are the qualities that make you a lowlife?”
snp1.7:3.3	“No I do not, Master Gotama.
snp1.7:3.4	Please, Master Gotama, teach me this matter so I can understand what is a lowlife or what are the qualities that make you a lowlife.” 
snp1.7:3.5	“Well then, brahmin, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
snp1.7:3.6	“Yes sir,” Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper replied. 
snp1.7:3.7	The Buddha said this: 
snp1.7:4.1	“Irritable and hostile,
snp1.7:4.2	wicked and offensive,
snp1.7:4.3	a man deficient in view, deceitful:
snp1.7:4.4	know him as a lowlife.

snp1.7:23.2	when he really is no such thing.
snp1.7:23.3	In the world with its Brahmās,
snp1.7:23.4	that crook is truly the lowest lowlife.
snp1.7:23.5	These who are called lowlifes 
snp1.7:23.6	I have explained to you.
snp1.7:24.1	You’re not a lowlife by birth,
snp1.7:24.2	nor by birth are you a brahmin.
snp1.7:24.3	You’re a lowlife by your deeds, 
snp1.7:24.4	by deeds you’re a brahmin. 
snp1.7:25.1	And also you should know
snp1.7:25.2	according to this example.
snp1.7:25.3	Sopaka the outcaste’s son
snp1.7:25.4	became renowned as Mātaṅga.
snp1.7:26.1	Mātaṅga achieved the highest fame
snp1.7:26.2	so very hard to find.
snp1.7:26.3	Lots of aristocrats and brahmins
snp1.7:26.4	came to serve him.
snp1.7:27.1	He ascended the stainless highway
snp1.7:27.2	that leads to the heavens;
snp1.7:27.3	having discarded sensual desire, 
snp1.7:27.4	he was reborn in a Brahmā realm.
snp1.7:27.5	His birth did not prevent him
snp1.7:27.6	from rebirth in the Brahmā realm.
snp1.7:28.1	Those born in a brahmin family
snp1.7:28.2	who recite as kinsmen of the hymns,
snp1.7:28.3	are often discovered
snp1.7:28.4	in the midst of wicked deeds.
snp1.7:29.1	Blameworthy in the present life,
snp1.7:29.2	and in the next, a bad destination.
snp1.7:29.3	Their birth does not prevent them
snp1.7:29.4	from blame or bad destiny.
snp1.7:30.1	You’re not a lowlife by birth,
snp1.7:30.2	nor by birth are you a brahmin.
snp1.7:30.3	You’re a lowlife by your deeds, 
snp1.7:30.4	by deeds you’re a brahmin.”
snp1.7:31.1	When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper said to the Buddha, 
snp1.7:31.2	“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! … 
snp1.7:31.3	From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

snp1.8:6.2	nor look down on anyone anywhere.
snp1.8:6.3	Though provoked or aggrieved,
snp1.8:6.4	let them not wish pain on each other.
snp1.8:7.1	Even as a mother would protect with her life
snp1.8:7.2	her child, her only child,
snp1.8:7.3	so too for all creatures
snp1.8:7.4	unfold a boundless heart.
snp1.8:8.1	With love for the whole world,
snp1.8:8.2	unfold a boundless heart.
snp1.8:8.3	Above, below, all round,

snp1.8:9.1	When standing, walking, sitting,
snp1.8:9.2	or lying down while yet unweary,
snp1.8:9.3	keep this ever in mind;
snp1.8:9.4	for this, they say, is a holy abiding in this life.
snp1.8:10.1	Avoiding harmful views,
snp1.8:10.2	virtuous, accomplished in insight,
snp1.8:10.3	with sensual desire dispelled,
snp1.8:10.4	they never come back to a womb again.

snp1.9:0.2	With Hemavata
snp1.9:1.1	“Today is the fifteenth day sabbath,”
snp1.9:1.2	said Sātāgira, the native spirit of mount Sātā,
snp1.9:1.3	“a holy night is at hand.
snp1.9:1.4	Come now, let us see Gotama,
snp1.9:1.5	the Teacher of peerless name.”
snp1.9:2.1	“Isn’t his mind well-disposed,”
snp1.9:2.2	said Hemavata, the native spirit of the Himalayas,
snp1.9:2.3	“impartial towards all creatures?
snp1.9:2.4	And aren’t his thoughts under control
snp1.9:2.5	when it comes to likes and dislikes?”
snp1.9:3.1	“His mind is well-disposed,”
snp1.9:3.2	said Sātāgira,
snp1.9:3.3	“impartial towards all creatures.
snp1.9:3.4	His thoughts are under control
snp1.9:3.5	when it comes to his likes and dislikes.”
snp1.9:4.1	“Doesn’t he not steal?”
snp1.9:4.2	said Hemavata,
snp1.9:4.3	“And doesn’t he harm not a creature?
snp1.9:4.4	Isn’t he far from negligence?
snp1.9:4.5	And doesn’t he not neglect absorption?”
snp1.9:5.1	“He does not take what is not given,”
snp1.9:5.2	said Sātāgira,
snp1.9:5.3	“and he harms not a creature.
snp1.9:5.4	He is far from negligence—
snp1.9:5.5	the Buddha does not neglect absorption.”
snp1.9:6.1	“Doesn’t he avoid lying?”
snp1.9:6.2	said Hemavata,
snp1.9:6.3	“And doesn’t he not speak sharply?
snp1.9:6.4	Doesn’t he avoid divisive speech,
snp1.9:6.5	as well as speaking nonsense?”
snp1.9:7.1	“He does not lie,”
snp1.9:7.2	said Sātāgira,
snp1.9:7.3	“nor does he speak sharply.
snp1.9:7.4	He avoids divisive speech,
snp1.9:7.5	and speaks words of wise counsel.”
snp1.9:8.1	“Doesn’t he find sensual pleasures unattractive?”
snp1.9:8.2	said Hemavata,
snp1.9:8.3	“And isn’t his mind unclouded?
snp1.9:8.4	Hasn’t he escaped delusion?
snp1.9:8.5	And isn’t he seer of truths?”
snp1.9:9.1	“He does not find sensual pleasures attractive,”
snp1.9:9.2	said Sātāgira,
snp1.9:9.3	“and his mind is unclouded.
snp1.9:9.4	He has escaped all delusion—
snp1.9:9.5	the Buddha is seer of truths.”
snp1.9:10.1	“Isn’t he accomplished in knowledge?” 
snp1.9:10.2	said Hemavata,
snp1.9:10.3	“And doesn’t he live a pure life?
snp1.9:10.4	Aren’t his defilements all ended?
snp1.9:10.5	Doesn’t he have no future lives?”
snp1.9:11.1	“He is accomplished in knowledge,” 
snp1.9:11.2	said Sātāgira,
snp1.9:11.3	“and he does live a pure life.
snp1.9:11.4	His defilements are all ended,
snp1.9:11.5	there are no future lives for him.” 
snp1.9:12.1	“Accomplished is the sage’s mind
snp1.9:12.2	in action and in speech, 
snp1.9:12.3	and he’s accomplished in knowledge and conduct
snp1.9:12.4	as per the teaching you praise.”
snp1.9:13.1	“Accomplished is the sage’s mind
snp1.9:13.2	in action and in speech, 
snp1.9:13.3	and he’s accomplished in knowledge and conduct
snp1.9:13.4	as per the teaching you rejoice in.
snp1.9:14.1	Accomplished is the sage’s mind
snp1.9:14.2	in action and in speech, 
snp1.9:14.3	and he’s accomplished in knowledge and conduct:
snp1.9:14.4	come now, let us see Gotama.”
snp1.9:15.1	“The hero so lean, with antelope calves, 
snp1.9:15.2	not greedy, eating little, 
snp1.9:15.3	the sage meditating alone in the forest,
snp1.9:15.4	come now, let us see Gotama.
snp1.9:16.1	An elephant, wandering alone like a lion, 
snp1.9:16.2	unconcerned for sensual pleasures,
snp1.9:16.3	let’s approach him and ask about
snp1.9:16.4	release from the snare of death.”
snp1.9:17.1	“The communicator, the instructor,
snp1.9:17.2	who has gone beyond all things,
snp1.9:17.3	Awakened, beyond enmity and fear,
snp1.9:17.4	let us ask Gotama.”
snp1.9:18.1	“What has the world arisen in?”
snp1.9:18.2	said Hemavata,
snp1.9:18.3	What does it get close to? 
snp1.9:18.4	By grasping what 
snp1.9:18.5	is the world troubled in what?” 
snp1.9:19.1	“The world’s arisen in six,”
snp1.9:19.2	said the Buddha to Hemavata.
snp1.9:19.3	“It gets close to six. 
snp1.9:19.4	By grasping at these six, 
snp1.9:19.5	the world’s troubled in six.” 
snp1.9:20.1	“What is that grasping
snp1.9:20.2	by which the world is troubled? 
snp1.9:20.3	Tell us the exit when asked:
snp1.9:20.4	how is one released from all suffering?” 
snp1.9:21.1	“There are five kinds of sensual stimulation in the world, 
snp1.9:21.2	and the mind is said to be the sixth. 
snp1.9:21.3	When you’ve discarded desire for these, 
snp1.9:21.4	you’re released from all suffering. 
snp1.9:22.1	This is the exit from the world,
snp1.9:22.2	explained in accord with the truth.
snp1.9:22.3	The way I’ve explained it is how
snp1.9:22.4	you’re released from all suffering.”
snp1.9:23.1	“Who here crosses the flood, 
snp1.9:23.2	Who crosses the deluge? 
snp1.9:23.3	Who, not standing and unsupported, 
snp1.9:23.4	does not sink in the deep?” 
snp1.9:24.1	“Someone who is always endowed with ethics, 
snp1.9:24.2	wise and serene, 
snp1.9:24.3	inwardly reflective, mindful,
snp1.9:24.4	crosses the flood so hard to cross. 
snp1.9:25.1	Someone who desists from sensual perception, 
snp1.9:25.2	who has escaped all fetters,
snp1.9:25.3	and is finished with relishing of rebirth,
snp1.9:25.4	does not sink in the deep.”
snp1.9:26.1	“Behold him of wisdom deep who sees the subtle meaning,
snp1.9:26.2	who has nothing, unattached to sensual life,
snp1.9:26.3	everywhere free, 
snp1.9:26.4	the great hermit treading the holy road.
snp1.9:27.1	Behold him of peerless name who sees the subtle meaning,
snp1.9:27.2	giver of wisdom, unattached to the realm of sensuality: 
snp1.9:27.3	see him, the all-knower, so very intelligent, 
snp1.9:27.4	the great hermit treading the noble road.”
snp1.9:28.1	“It was a fine sight for us today,
snp1.9:28.2	a good dawn, a good rising,

snp2.11:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp2.11:0.2	With Rāhula 
snp2.11:1.1	“Does familiarity breed contempt,
snp2.11:1.2	even for the man of wisdom?
snp2.11:1.3	Do you honor he who holds aloft 
snp2.11:1.4	the torch for all humanity?”
snp2.11:2.1	“Familiarity breeds no contempt
snp2.11:2.2	for the man of wisdom.
snp2.11:2.3	I always honor he who holds aloft 
snp2.11:2.4	the torch for all humanity.”
snp2.11:3.1	“One who’s given up the five sensual stimulations,
snp2.11:3.2	so pleasing and delightful,
snp2.11:3.3	and who’s left the home life out of faith—
snp2.11:3.4	let them make an end to suffering!
snp2.11:4.1	Mix with spiritual friends,
snp2.11:4.2	stay in remote lodgings,
snp2.11:4.3	secluded and quiet,
snp2.11:4.4	and eat in moderation. 
snp2.11:5.1	Robes, almsfood,
snp2.11:5.2	requisites and lodgings:
snp2.11:5.3	don’t crave such things;
snp2.11:5.4	don’t come back to this world again.
snp2.11:6.1	Be restrained in the monastic code,
snp2.11:6.2	and the five sense faculties,
snp2.11:6.3	With mindfulness immersed in the body,
snp2.11:6.4	be full of disillusionment.
snp2.11:7.1	Turn away from the feature of things

snp2.11:7.4	meditate on the ugly aspects of the body.
snp2.11:8.1	Meditate on the signless,
snp2.11:8.2	give up the tendency to conceit;
snp2.11:8.3	and when you comprehend conceit,
snp2.11:8.4	you will live at peace.”
snp2.11:9.1	That is how the Buddha regularly advised Venerable Rāhula with these verses.
snp2.12:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp2.12:0.2	Vaṅgīsa and his Mentor Nigrodhakappa
snp2.12:1.1	So I have heard. 
snp2.12:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Āḷavī, at the Aggāḷava Tree-shrine. 
snp2.12:1.3	Now at that time it was not long after Venerable Vaṅgīsa’s mentor, the senior monk named Nigrodhakappa, had become extinguished. 
snp2.12:1.4	Then as Vaṅgīsa was in private retreat this thought came to his mind: 
snp2.12:1.5	“Has my mentor become extinguished or not?”
snp2.12:1.6	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Vaṅgīsa came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 
snp2.12:1.7	“Just now, sir, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind. 
snp2.12:1.8	‘Has my mentor become extinguished or not?’
snp2.12:1.9	Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and addressed him in verse: 
snp2.12:2.1	“I ask the teacher unrivaled in wisdom,
snp2.12:2.2	who has cut off all doubts in this very life—
snp2.12:2.3	has a monk died at Aggāḷava, who was
snp2.12:2.4	well-known, famous, and quenched?
snp2.12:3.1	Nigrodhakappa was his name;
snp2.12:3.2	it was given to that brahmin by you, Blessed One.
snp2.12:3.3	He wandered in your honor, yearning for freedom, 
snp2.12:3.4	energetic, a resolute Seer of Truth.
snp2.12:4.1	O Sakyan, all-seer,
snp2.12:4.2	all of us wish to know about that disciple.
snp2.12:4.3	Our ears are eager to hear,
snp2.12:4.4	for you are truly the most excellent teacher.
snp2.12:5.1	Cut off our doubt, declare this to us;
snp2.12:5.2	your wisdom is vast, tell us of his quenching!
snp2.12:5.3	All-seer, speak among us,
snp2.12:5.4	like the thousand-eyed Sakka in the midst of the gods!
snp2.12:6.1	Whatever ties there are, or paths to delusion,
snp2.12:6.2	or things on the side of unknowing, or that are bases of doubt
snp2.12:6.3	vanish on reaching a Realized One, 
snp2.12:6.4	for his eye is the best of all people’s.
snp2.12:7.1	For if no man were ever to disperse corruptions,
snp2.12:7.2	like the wind dispersing a mass of clouds,
snp2.12:7.3	darkness would shroud the whole world;
snp2.12:7.4	not even brilliant men would shine.
snp2.12:8.1	The wise are makers of light;
snp2.12:8.2	my hero, that is what I think of you.
snp2.12:8.3	We’ve come to you for your discernment and knowledge:
snp2.12:8.4	here in this assembly, declare to us about Kappāyana.
snp2.12:9.1	Swiftly send forth your graceful voice,
snp2.12:9.2	like a goose stretching its neck, gently honking,
snp2.12:9.3	smooth in sound, with a lovely tone:
snp2.12:9.4	alert, we are all listening to you.
snp2.12:10.1	You have entirely abandoned birth and death;
snp2.12:10.2	restrained and pure, I urge you to speak the Dhamma!
snp2.12:10.3	For ordinary people have no wish-maker,
snp2.12:10.4	but Realized Ones have a comprehensibility-maker.
snp2.12:11.1	Your answer is definitive, and we will adopt it,
snp2.12:11.2	for you have perfect understanding.
snp2.12:11.3	We raise our joined palms one last time,
snp2.12:11.4	one of unrivaled wisdom, don’t deliberately confuse us.
snp2.12:12.1	Knowing the noble teaching from top to bottom,
snp2.12:12.2	unrivaled hero, don’t deliberately confuse us.
snp2.12:12.3	As a man in the baking summer sun would long for water,
snp2.12:12.4	I long for your voice, so let the sound rain down.
snp2.12:13.1	Surely Kappāyana did not lead the spiritual life in vain?
snp2.12:13.2	Did he realize quenching,
snp2.12:13.3	or did he still have a remnant of defilement?
snp2.12:13.4	Let us hear what kind of liberation he had!”
snp2.12:14.1	“He cut off craving for mind and body in this very life,”
snp2.12:14.2	said the Buddha,
snp2.12:14.3	“The river of darkness that had long lain within him.
snp2.12:14.4	He has entirely crossed over birth and death.”
snp2.12:14.5	So declared the Blessed One, the leader of the five.
snp2.12:15.1	“Now that I have heard your words,
snp2.12:15.2	seventh of sages, I am confident.
snp2.12:15.3	My question, it seems, was not in vain,
snp2.12:15.4	the brahmin did not deceive me.
snp2.12:16.1	As he said, so he did—
snp2.12:16.2	he was a disciple of the Buddha.
snp2.12:16.3	He cut the net of death the deceiver,
snp2.12:16.4	so extended and strong.
snp2.12:17.1	Blessed One, Kappāyana saw
snp2.12:17.2	the starting point of grasping.
snp2.12:17.3	He has indeed gone far beyond
snp2.12:17.4	Death’s domain so hard to pass. 
snp2.13:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp2.13:0.2	The Right Way to Wander
snp2.13:1.1	“I ask the sage abounding in wisdom—
snp2.13:1.2	crossed-over, gone beyond, quenched, steadfast:
snp2.13:1.3	when a mendicant has left home, expelling sensuality,
snp2.13:1.4	what’s the right way to wander the world?”
snp2.13:2.1	“When they’ve eradicated superstitions,”
snp2.13:2.2	said the Buddha,
snp2.13:2.3	“about celestial portents, dreams, or bodily marks;
snp2.13:2.4	with the stain of superstitions left behind,
snp2.13:2.5	they’d rightly wander the world.
snp2.13:3.1	A mendicant ought dispel desire
snp2.13:3.2	for pleasures human or divine;
snp2.13:3.3	with rebirth transcended and truth comprehended,
snp2.13:3.4	they’d rightly wander the world.
snp2.13:4.1	Putting divisiveness behind them,
snp2.13:4.2	a mendicant gives up anger and stinginess;
snp2.13:4.3	with favoring and opposing left behind, 
snp2.13:4.4	they’d rightly wander the world.
snp2.13:5.1	When the loved and the unloved are both left behind,
snp2.13:5.2	not grasping or dependent on anything;
snp2.13:5.3	freed from all things that fetter,
snp2.13:5.4	they’d rightly wander the world.
snp2.13:6.1	Finding no substance in attachments,
snp2.13:6.2	rid of desire for things they’ve acquired,
snp2.13:6.3	independent, needing no-one to guide them,
snp2.13:6.4	they’d rightly wander the world.
snp2.13:7.1	Not hostile in speech, mind, or deed,
snp2.13:7.2	they’ve rightly understood the teaching.
snp2.13:7.3	Aspiring to the state of quenching,
snp2.13:7.4	they’d rightly wander the world.
snp2.13:8.1	Not pridefully thinking, ‘they bow to me’;
snp2.13:8.2	though reviled, they’d still stay in touch;
snp2.13:8.3	not besotted when getting food from others,
snp2.13:8.4	they’d rightly wander the world.
snp2.13:9.1	When greed and craving to live again are cast off, 
snp2.13:9.2	a mendicant refrains from violence and abduction;
snp2.13:9.3	rid of doubt, free of thorns,
snp2.13:9.4	they’d rightly wander the world.
snp2.13:10.1	Knowing what is suitable for themselves,
snp2.13:10.2	a mendicant would hurt no-one in the world;
snp2.13:10.3	understanding the teaching in accord with reality,
snp2.13:10.4	they’d rightly wander the world.
snp2.13:11.1	They have no underlying tendencies at all,
snp2.13:11.2	and are rid of unskillful roots;
snp2.13:11.3	free of hope, with no need for hope,
snp2.13:11.4	they’d rightly wander the world.
snp2.13:12.1	Defilements ended, conceit given up,
snp2.13:12.2	beyond all manner of desire;
snp2.13:12.3	tamed, quenched, and steadfast,
snp2.13:12.4	they’d rightly wander the world.
snp2.13:13.1	Faithful, learned, seer of the sure path,
snp2.13:13.2	the wise one takes no side among factions;
snp2.13:13.3	rid of greed, hate, and repulsion,
snp2.13:13.4	they’d rightly wander the world.
snp2.13:14.1	A purified victor with veil drawn back,
snp2.13:14.2	among worldly things master, transcendent, stilled;
snp2.13:14.3	expert in knowledge of conditions’ cessation,
snp2.13:14.4	they’d rightly wander the world.
snp2.13:15.1	They’re over speculating on the future or past,
snp2.13:15.2	and understand what it means to be pure;
snp2.13:15.3	freed from all the sense fields,
snp2.13:15.4	they’d rightly wander the world.
snp2.13:16.1	The state of peace is understood, the truth is comprehended,
snp2.13:16.2	they’ve openly seen defilements cast off;
snp2.13:16.3	and with the ending of all attachments, 
snp2.13:16.4	they’d rightly wander the world.”
snp2.13:17.1	“Clearly, Blessed One, it is just as you say. 
snp2.13:17.2	One who lives like this is a tamed mendicant,
snp2.13:17.3	beyond all fetters and yokes:
snp2.13:17.4	they’d rightly wander the world.”

snp2.14:0.2	With Dhammika 
snp2.14:1.1	So I have heard. 
snp2.14:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
snp2.14:1.3	Then the lay follower Dhammika, together with five hundred lay followers, went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and addressed him in verse: 
snp2.14:2.1	“I ask you, Gotama, whose wisdom is vast: 
snp2.14:2.2	what does one do to become a good disciple,
snp2.14:2.3	both one who has left the home,
snp2.14:2.4	and the lay followers staying at home?
snp2.14:3.1	For you understand the course and destiny
snp2.14:3.2	of the world with all its gods.

snp2.14:4.1	Having experienced all knowledge,
snp2.14:4.2	you explain the teaching out of compassion for beings.
snp2.14:4.3	All-seer, you have drawn back the veil,
snp2.14:4.4	and immaculate, you shine on the whole world.
snp2.14:5.1	The dragon king Erāvaṇa, hearing you called ‘Victor’,
snp2.14:5.2	came into your presence.
snp2.14:5.3	He consulted with you then, having heard your words,
snp2.14:5.4	left consoled, saying ‘Excellent!’
snp2.14:6.1	And King Vessavaṇa Kuvero, too,
snp2.14:6.2	approached to ask about the teaching.
snp2.14:6.3	You also answered him, O wise one,
snp2.14:6.4	and hearing you he too was consoled.
snp2.14:7.1	Those teachers of other paths given to debate,
snp2.14:7.2	whether Ājīvakas or Jains,
snp2.14:7.3	all fail to overtake you in wisdom,
snp2.14:7.4	like a standing man next to a sprinter.
snp2.14:8.1	Those brahmins given to debate,
snp2.14:8.2	some of whom are quite senior,
snp2.14:8.3	all end up beholden to you for the meaning,
snp2.14:8.4	and others too who think themselves debaters.
snp2.14:9.1	So subtle and pleasant is the teaching
snp2.14:9.2	that is well proclaimed by you, Blessed One.
snp2.14:9.3	It’s all we long to hear. So when asked,
snp2.14:9.4	O Best of Buddhas, tell us!
snp2.14:10.1	All these mendicants have gathered,
snp2.14:10.2	and the layfolk too are here to listen.
snp2.14:10.3	Let them hear the teaching the immaculate one discovered,
snp2.14:10.4	like gods listening to the fine words of Vāsava.”
snp2.14:11.1	“Listen to me, mendicants, I will educate you
snp2.14:11.2	in the cleansing teaching; all bear it in mind.
snp2.14:11.3	An intelligent person, seeing the meaning,
snp2.14:11.4	would adopt the deportment proper to a renunciate.
snp2.14:12.1	No way a mendicant would go out at the wrong time;
snp2.14:12.2	at the right time, they’d walk the village for alms.
snp2.14:12.3	For chains bind one who wanders outside the right time,
snp2.14:12.4	which is why the Buddhas avoid it.
snp2.14:13.1	Sights, sounds, tastes, smells, and touches,
snp2.14:13.2	which drive beings mad—
snp2.14:13.3	dispel desire for such things,
snp2.14:13.4	and enter for the morning meal at the right time.
snp2.14:14.1	After receiving alms for the day,
snp2.14:14.2	on returning a mendicant would sit in private alone.
snp2.14:14.3	Inwardly reflective, they’d curb their mind
snp2.14:14.4	from outside things, keeping themselves collected.
snp2.14:15.1	Should they converse with a disciple,
snp2.14:15.2	with anyone else, or with a mendicant,
snp2.14:15.3	they’d bring up only the sublime teaching,
snp2.14:15.4	not dividing or blaming.
snp2.14:16.1	For some contend in debate,
snp2.14:16.2	but we praise not those of little wisdom.
snp2.14:16.3	In place after place they are bound in chains,
snp2.14:16.4	for they send their mind over there far away.
snp2.14:17.1	Alms, a dwelling, a bed and seat,
snp2.14:17.2	and water for rinsing the dust from the cloak—
snp2.14:17.3	after hearing the teaching of the Holy One, 
snp2.14:17.4	a disciple of splendid wisdom would use these after appraisal.
snp2.14:18.1	That’s why, when it comes to alms and lodgings,
snp2.14:18.2	and water for rinsing the dust from the cloak,
snp2.14:18.3	a mendicant is unsullied in the midst of these things,
snp2.14:18.4	like a droplet on a lotus-leaf.
snp2.14:19.1	Now I shall tell you the householder’s duty,
snp2.14:19.2	doing which one becomes a good disciple.
snp2.14:19.3	For one burdened with possessions does not get to realize
snp2.14:19.4	the whole of the mendicant’s practice.
snp2.14:20.1	They’d not kill any creature, nor have them killed,
snp2.14:20.2	nor grant permission for others to kill.
snp2.14:20.3	They’ve laid aside violence towards all creatures
snp2.14:20.4	frail or firm that there are in the world.
snp2.14:21.1	Next, a disciple would avoid knowingly
snp2.14:21.2	taking anything not given at all,
snp2.14:21.3	they’d not get others to do it, nor grant them permission to steal;
snp2.14:21.4	they’d avoid *all* theft.
snp2.14:22.1	A sensible person would avoid the unchaste life,
snp2.14:22.2	like a burning pit of coals. 
snp2.14:22.3	But if unable to remain chaste,
snp2.14:22.4	they’d not transgress with another’s partner.
snp2.14:23.1	In a council or assembly, 
snp2.14:23.2	or one on one, they would not lie.
snp2.14:23.3	They’d not get others to lie, nor grant them permission to lie;
snp2.14:23.4	they’d avoid *all* untruths.
snp2.14:24.1	A householder espousing this teaching
snp2.14:24.2	would not consume liquor or drink.
snp2.14:24.3	They’d not get others to drink, nor grant them permission to drink;
snp2.14:24.4	knowing that ends in intoxication.
snp2.14:25.1	For drunken fools do bad things,
snp2.14:25.2	and encourage other heedless folk.
snp2.14:25.3	Reject this field of demerit,
snp2.14:25.4	the maddening, deluding frolic of fools.
snp2.14:26.1	You shouldn’t kill living creatures, or steal, 
snp2.14:26.2	or lie, or drink alcohol. 
snp2.14:26.3	Be celibate, refraining from sex, 
snp2.14:26.4	and don’t eat at night, the wrong time. 
snp2.14:27.1	Not wearing garlands or applying perfumes, 
snp2.14:27.2	you should sleep on a low bed, or a mat on the ground. 
snp2.14:27.3	This is the eight-factored sabbath, they say, 
snp2.14:27.4	explained by the Buddha, who has gone to suffering’s end. 
snp2.14:28.1	Then having observed the sabbath
snp2.14:28.2	complete in all its eight factors
snp2.14:28.3	on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight,
snp2.14:28.4	as well as on the fortnightly special displays,
snp2.14:29.1	on the morning after the sabbath
snp2.14:29.2	a clever person, rejoicing with confident heart, 
snp2.14:29.3	would distribute food and drink 
snp2.14:29.4	to the mendicant Saṅgha as is fitting.
snp2.14:30.1	One should rightfully support one’s parents,
snp2.14:30.2	and undertake a legitimate business.
snp2.14:30.3	A diligent layperson observing these duties
snp2.14:30.4	ascends to the gods called Self-luminous.”

snp2.1:3.2	no sublime gem in the heavens,
snp2.1:3.3	that equals the Realized One.
snp2.1:3.4	This sublime gem is in the Buddha:
snp2.1:3.5	by this truth, may you be well!
snp2.1:4.1	Ending, dispassion, the undying, the sublime,
snp2.1:4.2	attained by the Sakyan Sage immersed in samādhi;
snp2.1:4.3	there is nothing equal to that Dhamma.
snp2.1:4.4	This sublime gem is in the Dhamma:
snp2.1:4.5	by this truth, may you be well!

snp2.1:5.5	by this truth, may you be well!
snp2.1:6.1	The eight individuals praised by the good,

snp2.1:6.4	what’s given to them is very fruitful.
snp2.1:6.5	This sublime gem is in the Saṅgha:
snp2.1:6.6	by this truth, may you be well!
snp2.1:7.1	Dedicated to Gotama’s dispensation,

snp2.1:7.3	they’ve attained the goal, plunged into the deathless,
snp2.1:7.4	and enjoy the quenching they’ve freely gained.
snp2.1:7.5	This sublime gem is in the Saṅgha:
snp2.1:7.6	by this truth, may you be well!
snp2.1:8.1	As a well planted boundary-pillar

snp2.1:8.3	I say a good person is like this,
snp2.1:8.4	who sees the noble truths in experience.
snp2.1:8.5	This sublime gem is in the Saṅgha:
snp2.1:8.6	by this truth, may you be well!
snp2.1:9.1	Those who fathom the noble truths 
snp2.1:9.2	taught by the one of deep wisdom,
snp2.1:9.3	do not take an eighth life,
snp2.1:9.4	even if they are hugely negligent.
snp2.1:9.5	This sublime gem is in the Saṅgha:
snp2.1:9.6	by this truth, may you be well!
snp2.1:10.1	When they attain to vision
snp2.1:10.2	they give up three things:
snp2.1:10.3	identity view, doubt, and any
snp2.1:10.4	attachment to precepts and observances. 
snp2.1:11.1	They’re freed from the four places of loss,
snp2.1:11.2	and unable to perform the six grave crimes.
snp2.1:11.3	This sublime gem is in the Saṅgha:
snp2.1:11.4	by this truth, may you be well!
snp2.1:12.1	Even if they do a bad deed
snp2.1:12.2	by body, speech, or mind,
snp2.1:12.3	they are unable to conceal it;
snp2.1:12.4	they say this inability applies to one who has seen the truth.
snp2.1:12.5	This sublime gem is in the Saṅgha:
snp2.1:12.6	by this truth, may you be well!

snp2.1:15.2	their minds have no desire for future rebirth.
snp2.1:15.3	Withered are the seeds, there’s no desire for growth,
snp2.1:15.4	those wise ones are extinguished just like this lamp.
snp2.1:15.5	This sublime gem is in the Saṅgha:
snp2.1:15.6	by this truth, may you be well!
snp2.1:16.1	Whatever beings have gathered here,

snp2.2:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp2.2:0.2	Carrion
snp2.2:1.1	“The good eat properly obtained
snp2.2:1.2	millet, wild grains, broomcorn,
snp2.2:1.3	greens, tubers, and squashes.
snp2.2:1.4	They don’t lie to get what they want.
snp2.2:2.1	But what you eat is nicely cooked and prepared,
snp2.2:2.2	delicious food that others have given.
snp2.2:2.3	Enjoying a dish of fine rice,
snp2.2:2.4	Kassapa, you eat carrion.
snp2.2:3.1	‘Carrion is not appropriate for me’;
snp2.2:3.2	so you said, kinsman of Brahmā.
snp2.2:3.3	Yet here you are enjoying a dish of fine rice,
snp2.2:3.4	nicely cooked with the flesh of fowl.
snp2.2:3.5	I’m asking you this, Kassapa: 
snp2.2:3.6	what do you take to be carrion?”
snp2.2:4.1	“Killing living creatures, mutilation, murder, abduction;
snp2.2:4.2	stealing, lying, cheating and fraud,
snp2.2:4.3	learning crooked spells, adultery:
snp2.2:4.4	this is carrion, not eating meat.
snp2.2:5.1	People here with unbridled sensuality, 
snp2.2:5.2	greedy for tastes, mixed up in impurity,
snp2.2:5.3	nihilists, immoral, intractable:
snp2.2:5.4	this is carrion, not eating meat.
snp2.2:6.1	Brutal and rough backbiters,
snp2.2:6.2	pitiless and arrogant betrayers of friends,
snp2.2:6.3	misers who never give anything:
snp2.2:6.4	this is carrion, not eating meat.
snp2.2:7.1	Anger, vanity, obstinacy, contrariness,
snp2.2:7.2	deceit, jealousy, boastfulness,
snp2.2:7.3	haughtiness, wicked associates:
snp2.2:7.4	this is carrion, not eating meat.
snp2.2:8.1	The ill-behaved, debt-evaders, slanderers,
snp2.2:8.2	business cheats and con-artists,
snp2.2:8.3	vile men committing depravity:
snp2.2:8.4	this is carrion, not eating meat.
snp2.2:9.1	People here who can’t stop harming living creatures, 
snp2.2:9.2	taking from others, intent on hurting,
snp2.2:9.3	immoral, cruel, harsh, lacking regard for others:
snp2.2:9.4	this is carrion, not eating meat.
snp2.2:10.1	Greedy, hostile, aggressive to others,
snp2.2:10.2	and addicted to evil—those beings pass into darkness,
snp2.2:10.3	falling headlong into hell:
snp2.2:10.4	this is carrion, not eating meat.
snp2.2:11.1	Not fish or flesh or fasting,
snp2.2:11.2	being naked or shaven, or dreadlocks or dirt,
snp2.2:11.3	not rough hides or serving the sacred flame,
snp2.2:11.4	or the many austerities in the world aimed at immortality,
snp2.2:11.5	not hymns or oblations, sacrifices or seasonal observances,
snp2.2:11.6	will cleanse a mortal not free of doubt.
snp2.2:12.1	Guarding the streams of sense impressions, wander with faculties conquered,
snp2.2:12.2	standing on the teaching, delighting in sincerity and gentleness.
snp2.2:12.3	The wise have escaped their chains and given up all pain; 
snp2.2:12.4	they don’t cling to the seen and the heard.”
snp2.2:13.1	The Buddha explained this matter to him again and again,
snp2.2:13.2	until the master of hymns understood it.
snp2.2:13.3	It was illustrated with colorful verses
snp2.2:13.4	by the carrion-free sage, unattached, hard to trace.
snp2.2:14.1	Having heard the fine words of the Buddha,
snp2.2:14.2	that are carrion-free, getting rid of all suffering;
snp2.2:14.3	humbled, he bowed to the Realized One,
snp2.2:14.4	and right away begged to go forth.

snp2.3:1.2	saying “I’m on your side”,
snp2.3:1.3	but not following up in deeds,
snp2.3:1.4	you must know that they’re not on your side.
snp2.3:2.1	Some say nice things to their friends
snp2.3:2.2	without following it up.
snp2.3:2.3	The wise will recognize
snp2.3:2.4	one who talks without doing.
snp2.3:3.1	No true friend relentlessly
snp2.3:3.2	suspects betrayal, looking for fault.
snp2.3:3.3	A true friend is one on whom you can lie like a child at the breast,
snp2.3:3.4	who cannot be turned against you by others.
snp2.3:4.1	While carrying out their duty,
snp2.3:4.2	one hoping for fruit and profit
snp2.3:4.3	develops the basis for gladness,
snp2.3:4.4	the happiness that attracts praise.
snp2.3:5.1	Having drunk the nectar of seclusion

snp2.4:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp2.4:0.2	Blessings
snp2.4:1.1	So I have heard. 
snp2.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
snp2.4:1.3	Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. 
snp2.4:1.4	Standing to one side, that deity addressed the Buddha in verse: 
snp2.4:2.1	“Many gods and humans
snp2.4:2.2	have thought about blessings
snp2.4:2.3	desiring well-being:
snp2.4:2.4	declare the highest blessing.”
snp2.4:3.1	“Not to fraternize with fools,
snp2.4:3.2	but to fraternize with the wise,
snp2.4:3.3	and honoring those worthy of honor:
snp2.4:3.4	this is the highest blessing.
snp2.4:4.1	Living in a suitable region,
snp2.4:4.2	having made merit in the past,
snp2.4:4.3	being rightly resolved in oneself, 
snp2.4:4.4	this is the highest blessing.
snp2.4:5.1	Education and a craft,
snp2.4:5.2	discipline and training,
snp2.4:5.3	and well-spoken speech:
snp2.4:5.4	this is the highest blessing.
snp2.4:6.1	Caring for mother and father, 
snp2.4:6.2	kindness to children and partners,
snp2.4:6.3	and unstressful work:
snp2.4:6.4	this is the highest blessing.
snp2.4:7.1	Giving and righteous conduct, 
snp2.4:7.2	kindness to relatives,
snp2.4:7.3	blameless deeds:
snp2.4:7.4	this is the highest blessing.
snp2.4:8.1	Desisting and abstaining from evil,
snp2.4:8.2	avoiding alcoholic drinks,
snp2.4:8.3	diligence in good qualities:
snp2.4:8.4	this is the highest blessing.
snp2.4:9.1	Respect and humility,
snp2.4:9.2	contentment and gratitude,
snp2.4:9.3	and timely listening to the teaching:
snp2.4:9.4	this is the highest blessing.
snp2.4:10.1	Patience, being easy to admonish,
snp2.4:10.2	the sight of ascetics,
snp2.4:10.3	and timely discussion of the teaching:
snp2.4:10.4	this is the highest blessing.
snp2.4:11.1	Austerity and celibacy 
snp2.4:11.2	seeing the noble truths,
snp2.4:11.3	and realization of extinguishment:
snp2.4:11.4	this is the highest blessing.
snp2.4:12.1	Though touched by worldly things,
snp2.4:12.2	their mind does not tremble;
snp2.4:12.3	sorrowless, stainless, secure,
snp2.4:12.4	this is the highest blessing.
snp2.4:13.1	Having completed these things,
snp2.4:13.2	undefeated everywhere;
snp2.4:13.3	everywhere they go in safety:
snp2.4:13.4	this is their highest blessing.”
snp2.5:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp2.5:0.2	With Spiky 
snp2.5:1.1	So I have heard. 
snp2.5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Gayā on the cut-stone ledge in the haunt of Spiky the native spirit. 
snp2.5:1.3	Now at that time the native spirits Shaggy and Spiky were passing by not far from the Buddha. 
snp2.5:1.4	So Shaggy said to Spiky, 
snp2.5:1.5	“That’s an ascetic.” 
snp2.5:1.6	“That’s no ascetic, he’s a faker! 
snp2.5:1.7	I’ll soon find out whether he’s an ascetic or a faker.” 
snp2.5:2.1	Then Spiky went up to the Buddha and leaned up against his body, 
snp2.5:2.2	but the Buddha pulled away. 
snp2.5:2.3	Then Spiky said to the Buddha, 
snp2.5:2.4	“Are you afraid, ascetic?” 
snp2.5:2.5	“No, sir, I’m not afraid. 
snp2.5:2.6	But your touch is nasty.” 
snp2.5:3.1	“I will ask you a question, ascetic. 
snp2.5:3.2	If you don’t answer me, I’ll drive you insane, or explode your heart, or grab you by the feet and throw you to the far shore of the Ganges!” 
snp2.5:4.1	“I don’t see anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans who could do that to me. 
snp2.5:4.2	But anyway, ask what you wish.” 
snp2.5:4.3	Then Spiky said to the Buddha, 
snp2.5:5.1	“Where do greed and hate come from? 
snp2.5:5.2	From where do discontent, desire, and terror spring? 
snp2.5:5.3	Where do the mind’s thoughts originate, 
snp2.5:5.4	like a crow let loose by boys.” 
snp2.5:6.1	“Greed and hate come from here; 
snp2.5:6.2	from here spring discontent, desire, and terror; 
snp2.5:6.3	here’s where the mind’s thoughts originate, 
snp2.5:6.4	like a crow let loose by boys. 
snp2.5:7.1	Born of affection, originating in oneself, 
snp2.5:7.2	like the shoots from a banyan’s trunk; 
snp2.5:7.3	the many kinds of attachment to sensual pleasures 
snp2.5:7.4	are like camel’s foot creeper strung through the woods. 
snp2.5:8.1	Those who understand where they come from 
snp2.5:8.2	get rid of them—listen up, spirit! 
snp2.5:8.3	They cross this flood so hard to cross, 
snp2.5:8.4	not crossed before, so as to not be reborn.”

snp2.6:1.2	they call this the supreme treasure.
snp2.6:1.3	But if someone goes forth
snp2.6:1.4	from the lay life to homelessness
snp2.6:2.1	who is of scurrilous character,
snp2.6:2.2	a beast and a bully,
snp2.6:2.3	their life gets worse,
snp2.6:2.4	as poison grows inside them.
snp2.6:3.1	A mendicant who loves to argue,
snp2.6:3.2	wrapped in delusion,
snp2.6:3.3	doesn’t even know what’s been explained
snp2.6:3.4	in the Dhamma taught by the Buddha.
snp2.6:4.1	Harassing those who are evolved,
snp2.6:4.2	governed by ignorance, 
snp2.6:4.3	they don’t know that corruption
snp2.6:4.4	is the path that leads to hell.
snp2.6:5.1	Entering the underworld,
snp2.6:5.2	passing from womb to womb, from darkness to darkness,
snp2.6:5.3	such a mendicant 
snp2.6:5.4	falls into suffering after death.
snp2.6:6.1	One such as that is 
snp2.6:6.2	like a sewer
snp2.6:6.3	brimful with years of filth
snp2.6:6.4	for it’s hard to clean one full of grime.
snp2.6:7.1	Mendicants, knowing that someone is like this,
snp2.6:7.2	attached to the lay life, 
snp2.6:7.3	of wicked desires and wicked intent,
snp2.6:7.4	of bad behavior and alms-resort, 
snp2.6:8.1	then having gathered in harmony, 
snp2.6:8.2	you should expel them. 
snp2.6:8.3	Throw out the trash! 
snp2.6:8.4	Get rid of the rubbish! 
snp2.6:9.1	And sweep away the scraps—
snp2.6:9.2	they’re not ascetics, they just think they are. 
snp2.6:9.3	When you’ve thrown out those of wicked desires, 
snp2.6:9.4	of bad behavior and alms-resort, 
snp2.6:10.1	dwell in communion, ever mindful, 
snp2.6:10.2	the pure with the pure. 
snp2.6:10.3	Then in harmony, alert, 
snp2.6:10.4	you’ll make an end to suffering.” 
snp2.7:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp2.7:0.2	Brahmanical Traditions
snp2.7:1.1	So I have heard. 
snp2.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
snp2.7:1.3	Then several old and well-to-do brahmins of Kosala—elderly and senior, who were advanced in years and had reached the final stage of life—went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
snp2.7:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: 
snp2.7:1.5	“Master Gotama, are the ancient traditions of the brahmins seen these days among brahmins?”
snp2.7:1.6	“No brahmins, they are not.”
snp2.7:1.7	“If you wouldn’t mind, Master Gotama, please teach us the ancient traditions of the brahmins.” 
snp2.7:1.8	“Well then, brahmins, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 
snp2.7:1.9	“Yes, sir,” they replied. 
snp2.7:1.10	The Buddha said this: 
snp2.7:2.1	“The ancient hermits used to be
snp2.7:2.2	restrained and austere.
snp2.7:2.3	Having given up the five sensual titillations,
snp2.7:2.4	they lived for their own true good.
snp2.7:3.1	Brahmins used to own no cattle,
snp2.7:3.2	nor gold or grain.
snp2.7:3.3	Chanting was their wealth and grain,
snp2.7:3.4	which they guarded as a gift from god.
snp2.7:4.1	Food was prepared for them
snp2.7:4.2	and left beside their doors.
snp2.7:4.3	People believed that food prepared in faith
snp2.7:4.4	should be given to them.
snp2.7:5.1	With colorful clothes,
snp2.7:5.2	clothes and bedding, 
snp2.7:5.3	prosperous nations and countries
snp2.7:5.4	honored those brahmins.
snp2.7:6.1	Brahmins used to be inviolable and
snp2.7:6.2	invincible, protected by principle.
snp2.7:6.3	No-one ever turned them away
snp2.7:6.4	from the doors of families.
snp2.7:7.1	For forty-eight years
snp2.7:7.2	they lead the virginal spiritual life.
snp2.7:7.3	The brahmins of old pursued
snp2.7:7.4	their quest for knowledge and conduct.
snp2.7:8.1	The brahmins did not marry outside their caste,
snp2.7:8.2	nor did they purchase a wife.
snp2.7:8.3	They lived together in love,
snp2.7:8.4	joining together by mutual consent.
snp2.7:9.1	Brahmins never approached their wives for sex
snp2.7:9.2	during the time outside 
snp2.7:9.3	the fertile half of the month 
snp2.7:9.4	after menstruation. 
snp2.7:10.1	They praised celibacy and morality,
snp2.7:10.2	integrity, gentleness, and austerity,
snp2.7:10.3	gentleness and harmlessness,
snp2.7:10.4	and also patience.
snp2.7:11.1	He who was supreme among them,
snp2.7:11.2	godlike, staunchly vigorous, 
snp2.7:11.3	did not engage in sex
snp2.7:11.4	even in a dream.
snp2.7:12.1	Training in line with their duties,
snp2.7:12.2	many smart people here
snp2.7:12.3	praised celibacy and morality,
snp2.7:12.4	and also patience.
snp2.7:13.1	They begged for rice,
snp2.7:13.2	bedding, clothes, ghee, and oil.
snp2.7:13.3	Having collected them legitimately,
snp2.7:13.4	they arranged a sacrifice.
snp2.7:14.1	But they slew no cows
snp2.7:14.2	while serving at the sacrifice.
snp2.7:14.3	Like a mother, father, or brother,
snp2.7:14.4	or some other relative,
snp2.7:14.5	cows are our best friends,
snp2.7:14.6	the fonts of medicine.
snp2.7:15.1	They give food and health,
snp2.7:15.2	and beauty and happiness.
snp2.7:15.3	Knowing these benefits,
snp2.7:15.4	they slew no cows.
snp2.7:16.1	The brahmins were delicate and tall,
snp2.7:16.2	beautiful and glorious.
snp2.7:16.3	They were keen on all the duties
snp2.7:16.4	required by their own traditions.
snp2.7:16.5	So long as they continued in the world,
snp2.7:16.6	people flourished happily.
snp2.7:17.1	But perversion crept into them 
snp2.7:17.2	little by little when they saw
snp2.7:17.3	the splendor of the king
snp2.7:17.4	and the ladies in all their finery.
snp2.7:18.1	Their chariots were harnessed with thoroughbreds,
snp2.7:18.2	well-made with bright canopies,
snp2.7:18.3	and their homes and houses were
snp2.7:18.4	neatly laid out in measured rows. 
snp2.7:19.1	They were lavished with herds of cattle, 
snp2.7:19.2	and furnished with bevies of lovely ladies.
snp2.7:19.3	This extravagant human wealth
snp2.7:19.4	was coveted by the brahmins.
snp2.7:20.1	They compiled hymns to that end, 
snp2.7:20.2	approached King Okkāka and said,
snp2.7:20.3	‘You have plenty of wealth and grain.
snp2.7:20.4	Sacrifice! For you have much treasure.
snp2.7:20.5	Sacrifice! For you have much wealth.’
snp2.7:21.1	Persuaded by the brahmins,
snp2.7:21.2	the king, chief of charioteers, performed
snp2.7:21.3	horse sacrifice, human sacrifice, 
snp2.7:21.4	the sacrifices of the ‘stick-casting’, the ‘royal soma drinking’, and the ‘unbarred’. 
snp2.7:21.5	When he had carried out these sacrifices,
snp2.7:21.6	he gave riches to the brahmins.
snp2.7:22.1	There were cattle, bedding, and clothes,
snp2.7:22.2	and ladies in all their finery;
snp2.7:22.3	chariots harnessed with thoroughbreds,
snp2.7:22.4	well-made with bright canopies;
snp2.7:23.1	and lovely homes, all
snp2.7:23.2	neatly laid out in measured rows. 
snp2.7:23.3	Having furnished them with different grains,
snp2.7:23.4	he gave riches to the brahmins.
snp2.7:24.1	When they got hold of that wealth,
snp2.7:24.2	they arranged to store it up.
snp2.7:24.3	Falling under the sway of desire,
snp2.7:24.4	their craving grew and grew.
snp2.7:24.5	They compiled hymns to that end, 
snp2.7:24.6	approached King Okkāka once more and said,
snp2.7:25.1	‘Like water and earth, 
snp2.7:25.2	gold, riches, and grain,
snp2.7:25.3	are cows for humankind,
snp2.7:25.4	as they are essential for creatures.
snp2.7:25.5	Sacrifice! For you have much treasure.
snp2.7:25.6	Sacrifice! For you have much wealth.’
snp2.7:26.1	Persuaded by the brahmins,
snp2.7:26.2	the king, chief of charioteers, 
snp2.7:26.3	had many hundred thousand cows
snp2.7:26.4	slain at the sacrifice.
snp2.7:27.1	Neither with feet nor with horns
snp2.7:27.2	do cows harm anyone at all.
snp2.7:27.3	Cows meek as lambs,
snp2.7:27.4	supply buckets of milk.
snp2.7:27.5	But taking them by the horns,
snp2.7:27.6	the king slew them with a sword.
snp2.7:28.1	At that the gods and the ancestors,
snp2.7:28.2	with Indra, the titans and monsters,
snp2.7:28.3	roared out: ‘This is a crime against nature!’
snp2.7:28.4	as the sword fell on the cows.
snp2.7:29.1	There used to be three kinds of illness:
snp2.7:29.2	greed, starvation, and old age. 
snp2.7:29.3	But due to the slaughter of cows,
snp2.7:29.4	this grew to be ninety-eight.
snp2.7:30.1	This unnatural violence
snp2.7:30.2	has been passed down as an ancient custom.
snp2.7:30.3	Killing innocent creatures,
snp2.7:30.4	the sacrificers forsake righteousness.
snp2.7:31.1	And that is how this petty ancient thing
snp2.7:31.2	is criticized by sensible people
snp2.7:31.3	Wherever they see such a thing,
snp2.7:31.4	folk criticize the sacrificer.
snp2.7:32.1	With righteousness gone,
snp2.7:32.2	merchants and workers were split,
snp2.7:32.3	as were many aristocrats,
snp2.7:32.4	and wives looked down on their husbands.
snp2.7:33.1	Aristocrats and Brahmā’s kinsmen
snp2.7:33.2	and others protected by their clan,
snp2.7:33.3	rejecting the doctrine of caste,
snp2.7:33.4	fell under the sway of sensual pleasures.”
snp2.7:34.1	When he had spoken, those well-to-do brahmins said to the Buddha, 
snp2.7:34.2	“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! … 
snp2.7:34.3	From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” 
snp2.8:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp2.8:0.2	The Boat
snp2.8:1.1	Honor the person from whom you would learn the teaching,
snp2.8:1.2	as the gods honor Inda.
snp2.8:1.3	Then they will have confidence in you,
snp2.8:1.4	and being learned, they reveal the teaching.
snp2.8:2.1	Heeding well, a wise pupil
snp2.8:2.2	practicing in line with that teaching 
snp2.8:2.3	grows intelligent, discerning, and subtle
snp2.8:2.4	through diligently sticking close to such a person.
snp2.8:3.1	But associating with a petty fool
snp2.8:3.2	who falls short of the goal, jealous,
snp2.8:3.3	then unable to discern the teaching in this life,
snp2.8:3.4	one proceeds to death still plagued by doubts.
snp2.8:4.1	It’s like a man who has plunged into a river,
snp2.8:4.2	a rushing torrent in spate.
snp2.8:4.3	As they are swept away downstream,
snp2.8:4.4	how could they help others across?
snp2.8:5.1	Just so, one unable to discern the teaching,
snp2.8:5.2	who hasn’t studied the meaning under the learned,
snp2.8:5.3	not knowing it oneself, still plagued by doubts,
snp2.8:5.4	how could they help others to contemplate?
snp2.8:6.1	But one who has embarked on a strong boat
snp2.8:6.2	equipped with rudder and oar,
snp2.8:6.3	would bring many others across there
snp2.8:6.4	with skill, care, and intelligence.
snp2.8:7.1	So too one who understands—a knowledge master, 
snp2.8:7.2	evolved, learned, and unflappable—
snp2.8:7.3	can help others to contemplate,
snp2.8:7.4	so long as they are prepared to listen carefully.
snp2.8:8.1	That’s why you should spend time with a good person,
snp2.8:8.2	intelligent and learned.
snp2.8:8.3	Having understood the meaning, putting it into practice,
snp2.8:8.4	one who has realized the teaching may find happiness.
snp2.9:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp2.9:0.2	What Morality?
snp2.9:1.1	“With what morality, what conduct,
snp2.9:1.2	fostering what deeds,
snp2.9:1.3	would a person lay the foundations right,
snp2.9:1.4	and reach the highest goal?”
snp2.9:2.1	“Honoring elders without jealousy,
snp2.9:2.2	they’d know the time to visit their teachers.
snp2.9:2.3	Treasuring the chance for a Dhamma talk,
snp2.9:2.4	they’d listen carefully to the well-spoken words.
snp2.9:3.1	At the right time, they’d humbly enter
snp2.9:3.2	the teachers’ presence, leaving obstinacy behind.
snp2.9:3.3	They’d call to mind and put into practice
snp2.9:3.4	the meaning, the teaching, self-control, and the spiritual life.
snp2.9:4.1	Delighting in the teaching, enjoying the teaching,
snp2.9:4.2	standing on the teaching, investigating the teaching,
snp2.9:4.3	they’d never say anything that degraded the teaching,
snp2.9:4.4	but would be guided by genuine words well-spoken.
snp2.9:5.1	Giving up mirth, prayer, weeping, ill will,
snp2.9:5.2	deception, fraud, greed, conceit,
snp2.9:5.3	aggression, crudeness, stains, and indulgence,
snp2.9:5.4	they’d wander free of vanity, steadfast.
snp2.9:6.1	Understanding is the essence of well-spoken words,
snp2.9:6.2	stillness is the essence of learning and understanding.
snp2.9:6.3	Wisdom and learning do not flourish
snp2.9:6.4	in a hasty and negligent person.
snp2.9:7.1	Those happy with the teaching proclaimed by the Noble One
snp2.9:7.2	are supreme in speech, mind, and deed.
snp2.9:7.3	Settled in peace, gentleness, and stillness,
snp2.9:7.4	they’ve realized the essence of learning and wisdom.”
snp3.10:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp3.10:0.2	With Kokālika 
snp3.10:1.1	So I have heard. 
snp3.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
snp3.10:1.3	Then the mendicant Kokālika went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, 
snp3.10:1.4	“Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.” 
snp3.10:2.1	When this was said, the Buddha said to Kokālika, 
snp3.10:2.2	“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! 
snp3.10:2.3	Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, 
snp3.10:2.4	they’re good monks.” 
snp3.10:3.1	For a second time … 
snp3.10:3.2	For a third time Kokālika said to the Buddha, 
snp3.10:3.3	“Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.” 
snp3.10:3.4	For a third time, the Buddha said to Kokālika, 
snp3.10:3.5	“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! 
snp3.10:3.6	Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, 
snp3.10:3.7	they’re good monks.” 
snp3.10:4.1	Then Kokālika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 
snp3.10:4.2	Not long after he left his body erupted with boils the size of mustard seeds. 
snp3.10:4.3	The boils grew to the size of mung beans, then chickpeas, then jujube seeds, then jujubes, then myrobalans, then unripe wood apples, then ripe wood apples. Finally they burst open, and pus and blood oozed out. 
snp3.10:4.4	Then the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness. 
snp3.10:4.5	He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna. 
snp3.10:5.1	Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, 
snp3.10:5.2	“Sir, the mendicant Kokālika has passed away. 
snp3.10:5.3	He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” 
snp3.10:5.4	That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said. 
snp3.10:5.5	Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there. 
snp3.10:6.1	Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened. 
snp3.10:7.1	When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha, 
snp3.10:7.2	“Sir, how long is the life span in the Pink Lotus hell?” 
snp3.10:7.3	“It’s long, mendicant. 
snp3.10:7.4	It’s not easy to calculate how many years, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts.” 
snp3.10:7.5	“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?” 
snp3.10:7.6	“It’s possible,” said the Buddha. 
snp3.10:8.1	“Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed. And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it. 
snp3.10:8.2	By this means the Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell. 
snp3.10:8.3	Now, twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Nirabbuda hell. 
snp3.10:8.4	Twenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Ababa hell. 
snp3.10:8.5	Twenty lifetimes in the Ababa hell equal one lifetime in the Aṭaṭa hell. 
snp3.10:8.6	Twenty lifetimes in the Aṭaṭa hell equal one lifetime in the Ahaha hell. 
snp3.10:8.7	Twenty lifetimes in the Ahaha hell equal one lifetime in the Yellow Lotus hell. 
snp3.10:8.8	Twenty lifetimes in the Yellow Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Sweet-Smelling hell. 
snp3.10:8.9	Twenty lifetimes in the Sweet-Smelling hell equal one lifetime in the Blue Water Lily hell. 
snp3.10:8.10	Twenty lifetimes in the Blue Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the White Lotus hell. 
snp3.10:8.11	Twenty lifetimes in the White Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Pink Lotus hell. 
snp3.10:8.12	The mendicant Kokālika has been reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” 
snp3.10:8.13	That is what the Buddha said. 
snp3.10:8.14	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
snp3.10:9.1	“A person is born 
snp3.10:9.2	with an axe in their mouth. 
snp3.10:9.3	A fool cuts themselves with it 
snp3.10:9.4	when they say bad words. 
snp3.10:10.1	When you praise someone worthy of criticism, 
snp3.10:10.2	or criticize someone worthy of praise, 
snp3.10:10.3	you choose bad luck with your own mouth: 
snp3.10:10.4	you’ll never find happiness that way. 
snp3.10:11.1	Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing, 
snp3.10:11.2	if all you lose is your money 
snp3.10:11.3	and all you own, even yourself. 
snp3.10:11.4	What’s really terrible luck 
snp3.10:11.5	is to hate the holy ones. 
snp3.10:12.1	For more than two quinquadecillion years, 
snp3.10:12.2	and another five quattuordecillion years, 
snp3.10:12.3	a slanderer of noble ones goes to hell, 
snp3.10:12.4	having aimed bad words and thoughts at them.
snp3.10:13.1	A liar goes to hell, 
snp3.10:13.2	as does one who denies what they did.
snp3.10:13.3	Both are equal in the hereafter,
snp3.10:13.4	those men of base deeds.
snp3.10:14.1	Whoever wrongs a man who has done no wrong, 
snp3.10:14.2	a pure man who has not a blemish, 
snp3.10:14.3	the evil backfires on the fool, 
snp3.10:14.4	like fine dust thrown upwind.
snp3.10:15.1	One addicted to the way of greed,
snp3.10:15.2	abuses others with their speech,
snp3.10:15.3	faithless, miserly, uncharitable,
snp3.10:15.4	stingy, addicted to backbiting.
snp3.10:16.1	Foul-mouthed, divisive, ignoble,
snp3.10:16.2	a life-destroyer, wicked, wrongdoer,
snp3.10:16.3	worst of men, cursed, base-born—
snp3.10:16.4	quiet now, for you are bound for hell.
snp3.10:17.1	You stir up dust, causing harm,
snp3.10:17.2	when you, evildoer, malign the good.
snp3.10:17.3	Having done many bad deeds,
snp3.10:17.4	you’ll go to the pit for a long time.
snp3.10:18.1	For no-one’s deeds are ever lost,
snp3.10:18.2	they return to their owner.
snp3.10:18.3	In the next life that stupid evildoer 
snp3.10:18.4	sees suffering in themselves.
snp3.10:19.1	They approach the place of impalement,
snp3.10:19.2	with its iron spikes, sharp blades, and iron stakes.
snp3.10:19.3	Then there is the food, which appropriately,
snp3.10:19.4	is like a red-hot iron ball.
snp3.10:20.1	For the speakers speak not sweetly,
snp3.10:20.2	they don’t hurry there, or find shelter.
snp3.10:20.3	They lie upon a spread of coals,
snp3.10:20.4	they enter a blazing mass of fire.
snp3.10:21.1	Wrapping them in a net,
snp3.10:21.2	they strike them there with iron hammers.
snp3.10:21.3	They come to blinding darkness,
snp3.10:21.4	which spreads about them like a fog.
snp3.10:22.1	Next they enter a copper pot,
snp3.10:22.2	a blazing mass of fire.
snp3.10:22.3	There they roast for a long time,
snp3.10:22.4	writhing in the masses of fire.
snp3.10:23.1	Then the evildoer roasts there
snp3.10:23.2	in a mixture of pus and blood.
snp3.10:23.3	No matter where they settle,
snp3.10:23.4	everything they touch there hurts them.
snp3.10:24.1	The evildoer roasts in 
snp3.10:24.2	worm-infested water.
snp3.10:24.3	There’s not even a shore to go to,
snp3.10:24.4	for all around are the same kind of pots.
snp3.10:25.1	They enter the Wood of Sword-Leaves,
snp3.10:25.2	so sharp they cut their body to pieces.
snp3.10:25.3	Having grabbed the tongue with a hook,
snp3.10:25.4	they stab it, slashing back and forth.
snp3.10:26.1	Then they approach the impassable  Vetaraṇi River,
snp3.10:26.2	with its sharp blades, its razor blades.
snp3.10:26.3	Idiots fall into it,
snp3.10:26.4	the wicked who have done wicked deeds.
snp3.10:27.1	There dogs all brown and spotted,
snp3.10:27.2	and raven flocks, and greedy jackals
snp3.10:27.3	devour them as they wail,
snp3.10:27.4	while hawks and crows attack them.
snp3.10:28.1	Hard, alas, is the life here
snp3.10:28.2	that evildoers endure.
snp3.10:28.3	That’s why for the rest of this life
snp3.10:28.4	a person ought do their duty without fail.
snp3.10:29.1	Experts have counted the loads of sesame
snp3.10:29.2	as compared to the Pink Lotus Hell.
snp3.10:29.3	They amount to 50,000,000 times 10,000,
snp3.10:29.4	plus another 12,000,000,000.
snp3.10:30.1	As painful as life is said to be in hell,
snp3.10:30.2	that’s how long one must dwell there.
snp3.10:30.3	That’s why, for those who are pure, well-behaved, full of good qualities,
snp3.10:30.4	one should always guard one’s speech and mind.
snp3.11:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp3.11:0.2	About Nālaka
snp3.11:1.1	The hermit Asita in his daily meditation
snp3.11:1.2	saw the bright-clad gods of the Thirty-Three
snp3.11:1.3	and their lord Sakka joyfully celebrating,
snp3.11:1.4	waving streamers in exuberant exaltation. 
snp3.11:2.1	Seeing the gods rejoicing, elated,
snp3.11:2.2	he paid respects and said this there:
snp3.11:2.3	“Why is the community of gods in such excellent spirits?
snp3.11:2.4	Why take up streamers and whirl them about?
snp3.11:3.1	Even in the war with the demons,
snp3.11:3.2	when gods were victorious and demons defeated,
snp3.11:3.3	there was no such excitement.
snp3.11:3.4	What marvel have the celestials seen that they so rejoice?
snp3.11:4.1	Shouting and singing and playing music, 
snp3.11:4.2	they clap their hands and dance.
snp3.11:4.3	I ask you, dwellers on Mount Meru’s peak,
snp3.11:4.4	quickly dispel my doubt, good sirs!”
snp3.11:5.1	“The being intent on awakening, a peerless gem,
snp3.11:5.2	has been born in the human realm for the sake of welfare and happiness,
snp3.11:5.3	in Lumbinī, a village in the Sakyan land.
snp3.11:5.4	That’s why we’re so happy, in such excellent spirits.
snp3.11:6.1	He is supreme among all beings, the best of people,
snp3.11:6.2	a bull among men, supreme among all creatures.
snp3.11:6.3	He will roll forth the wheel in the grove of the hermits,
snp3.11:6.4	roaring like a mighty lion, lord of beasts.”
snp3.11:7.1	Hearing this, he swiftly descended
snp3.11:7.2	and right away approached Suddhodana’s home.
snp3.11:7.3	Seated there he said this to the Sakyans,
snp3.11:7.4	“Where is the boy? I too wish to see him!”
snp3.11:8.1	Then the Sakyans showed their son to the one named Asita—
snp3.11:8.2	the boy shone like burning gold 
snp3.11:8.3	well-wrought in the forge;
snp3.11:8.4	resplendent with glory, of peerless beauty.
snp3.11:9.1	The boy beamed like crested flame,
snp3.11:9.2	pure as the moon, lord of stars traversing the sky,
snp3.11:9.3	blazing like the sun freed from the clouds after the rains;
snp3.11:9.4	seeing him, he was joyful, brimming with happiness.
snp3.11:10.1	The celestials held up a parasol in the sky,
snp3.11:10.2	many-ribbed and thousand-circled;
snp3.11:10.3	and golden-handled chowries waved—
snp3.11:10.4	but none could see who held the chowries or the parasols.
snp3.11:11.1	When the dreadlocked hermit who they called “Dark Splendor”
snp3.11:11.2	had seen the boy like a gold nugget on a cream rug
snp3.11:11.3	with a white parasol held over his head,
snp3.11:11.4	he received him, elated and happy.
snp3.11:12.1	Having received the Sakyan bull,
snp3.11:12.2	the seeker, master of marks and hymns,
snp3.11:12.3	lifted up his voice with confident heart:
snp3.11:12.4	“He is supreme, the best of men!”
snp3.11:13.1	But then, remembering he would depart this world,
snp3.11:13.2	his spirits fell and his tears flowed.
snp3.11:13.3	Seeing the weeping hermit, the Sakyans said,
snp3.11:13.4	“Surely there will be no threat to the boy?”
snp3.11:14.1	Seeing the crestfallen Sakyans, the hermit said,
snp3.11:14.2	“I do not forsee harm befall the boy,
snp3.11:14.3	and there will be no threat to him,
snp3.11:14.4	not in the least; set your minds at ease.
snp3.11:15.1	This boy shall reach the highest awakening.
snp3.11:15.2	As one of perfectly purified vision, compassionate for the welfare of the many,
snp3.11:15.3	he shall roll forth the wheel of the teaching;
snp3.11:15.4	his spiritual path will become widespread.
snp3.11:16.1	But I have not long left in this life,
snp3.11:16.2	I shall die before then.
snp3.11:16.3	I will never hear the teaching of the one who bore the unequaled burden.
snp3.11:16.4	That’s why I’m so upset and distraught—it’s a disaster for me!”
snp3.11:17.1	Having brought abundant happiness to the Sakyans,
snp3.11:17.2	the spiritual seeker left the royal compound.
snp3.11:17.3	He had a nephew; and out of compassion
snp3.11:17.4	he encouraged him in the teaching of the one who bore the unequaled burden.
snp3.11:18.1	“When you hear the voice of another saying ‘Buddha’—
snp3.11:18.2	one who has attained awakening and who reveals the foremost teaching—
snp3.11:18.3	go there and ask about his breakthrough;
snp3.11:18.4	lead the spiritual life under that Blessed One.” 
snp3.11:19.1	Now, that Nālaka had a store of accumulated merit; 
snp3.11:19.2	so when instructed by one of such kindly intent,
snp3.11:19.3	with perfectly purified vision of the future,
snp3.11:19.4	he waited in hope for the Victor, guarding his senses.
snp3.11:20.1	When he heard of the Victor rolling forth the excellent wheel he went to him, 
snp3.11:20.2	and seeing the leading hermit, he became confident.
snp3.11:20.3	The time of Asita’s instruction had arrived;
snp3.11:20.4	so he asked the excellent sage about the highest sagacity.
snp3.11:20.5	The introductory verses are finished.
snp3.11:21.1	“I now know that Asita’s prediction
snp3.11:21.2	has turned out to be true.
snp3.11:21.3	I ask you this, Gotama,
snp3.11:21.4	who has gone beyond all things:
snp3.11:22.1	For one who has entered the homeless life, 
snp3.11:22.2	seeking food on alms round,
snp3.11:22.3	when questioned, O sage, please tell me
snp3.11:22.4	of sagacity, the ultimate state.”
snp3.11:23.1	“I shall school you in sagacity,”
snp3.11:23.2	said the Buddha,
snp3.11:23.3	“so difficult and challenging.
snp3.11:23.4	Come, I shall tell you all about it.
snp3.11:23.5	Brace yourself; stay strong!
snp3.11:24.1	In the village, keep the same attitude
snp3.11:24.2	no matter if reviled or praised.
snp3.11:24.3	Guard against ill-tempered thoughts,
snp3.11:24.4	wander peaceful, not frantic.
snp3.11:25.1	Many different things come up,
snp3.11:25.2	like tongues of fire in a forest.
snp3.11:25.3	Women try to seduce a sage—
snp3.11:25.4	let them not seduce you!
snp3.11:26.1	Refraining from sex, 
snp3.11:26.2	having left behind sensual pleasures high and low,
snp3.11:26.3	don’t be hostile or attached
snp3.11:26.4	to living creatures firm or frail.
snp3.11:27.1	‘As am I, so are they;
snp3.11:27.2	as are they, so am I’—
snp3.11:27.3	Treating others like oneself,
snp3.11:27.4	neither kill nor incite to kill.
snp3.11:28.1	Leaving behind desire and greed
snp3.11:28.2	for what ordinary people are attached to, 
snp3.11:28.3	a seer would set out to practice,
snp3.11:28.4	they’d cross over this abyss. 
snp3.11:29.1	With empty stomach, taking limited food,
snp3.11:29.2	few in wishes, not greedy;
snp3.11:29.3	truly hungerless regarding all desires,
snp3.11:29.4	desireless, one is quenched.
snp3.11:30.1	Having wandered for alms,
snp3.11:30.2	they’d take themselves into the forest;
snp3.11:30.3	and nearing the foot of a tree,
snp3.11:30.4	the sage would take their seat.
snp3.11:31.1	That wise one intent on absorption,
snp3.11:31.2	would delight within the forest.
snp3.11:31.3	They’d practice absorption at the foot of a tree,
snp3.11:31.4	filling themselves with bliss.
snp3.11:32.1	Then, at the end of the night,
snp3.11:32.2	they’d take themselves into a village.
snp3.11:32.3	They’d not welcome being called,
snp3.11:32.4	nor offerings brought from the village.
snp3.11:33.1	A sage who has come to a village
snp3.11:33.2	would not walk hastily among the families.
snp3.11:33.3	They’d not discuss their search for food,
snp3.11:33.4	nor would they speak suggestively. 
snp3.11:34.1	‘I got something, that’s good.
snp3.11:34.2	I got nothing, that’s fine.’
snp3.11:34.3	Impartial in both cases,
snp3.11:34.4	they return right to the tree.
snp3.11:35.1	Wandering with bowl in hand,
snp3.11:35.2	not dumb, but thought to be dumb,
snp3.11:35.3	they wouldn’t scorn a tiny gift,
snp3.11:35.4	nor look down upon the giver.
snp3.11:36.1	For the practice has many aspects,
snp3.11:36.2	as explained by the Ascetic.
snp3.11:36.3	They do not go to the far shore twice,
snp3.11:36.4	nor having gone once do they fall away.
snp3.11:37.1	When a mendicant has no creeping,
snp3.11:37.2	and has cut the stream of craving,
snp3.11:37.3	and given up all the various duties,
snp3.11:37.4	no fever is found in them.
snp3.11:38.1	I shall school you in sagacity.
snp3.11:38.2	Practice as if you were licking a razor’s edge.
snp3.11:38.3	With tongue pressed to the roof of your mouth,
snp3.11:38.4	be restrained regarding your stomach.
snp3.11:39.1	Don’t be sluggish in mind,
snp3.11:39.2	nor think overly much.
snp3.11:39.3	Be carrion-free and unattached,
snp3.11:39.4	committed to the spiritual life.
snp3.11:40.1	Train in a lonely seat,
snp3.11:40.2	attending closely to ascetics;
snp3.11:40.3	solitude is sagacity, they say.
snp3.11:40.4	If you welcome solitude,
snp3.11:40.5	you’ll light up the ten directions.
snp3.11:41.1	Having heard the words of the wise,
snp3.11:41.2	the meditators who’ve given up sensual desires,
snp3.11:41.3	a follower of mine would develop
snp3.11:41.4	conscience and faith all the more.
snp3.11:42.1	Understand this by the way streams move
snp3.11:42.2	in clefts and crevices:
snp3.11:42.3	the little creeks flow on babbling,
snp3.11:42.4	while silent flow the great rivers.
snp3.11:43.1	What is lacking, babbles;
snp3.11:43.2	what is full is at peace.
snp3.11:43.3	The fool is like a half-full pot;
snp3.11:43.4	the wise like a brimfull lake.
snp3.11:44.1	When the Ascetic speaks much
snp3.11:44.2	it is relevant and meaningful:
snp3.11:44.3	knowing, he teaches the Dhamma;
snp3.11:44.4	knowing, he speaks much.
snp3.11:45.1	But one who, knowing, is restrained,
snp3.11:45.2	knowing, does not speak much;
snp3.11:45.3	that sage is worthy of sagacity,
snp3.11:45.4	that sage has achieved sagacity.”
snp3.12:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp3.12:0.2	3.12 Contemplating Pairs
snp3.12:1.1	So I have heard. 
snp3.12:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. 
snp3.12:1.3	Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks. 
snp3.12:1.4	Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were so very silent. He addressed them: 
snp3.12:2.1	“Suppose, mendicants, they questioned you thus: ‘There are skillful teachings that are noble, emancipating, and lead to awakening. What is the real reason for listening to such teachings?’ You should answer:
snp3.12:2.2	‘Only so as to truly know the pairs of teachings.’
snp3.12:2.3	And what pairs do they speak of?
snp3.12:3.1	‘This is suffering; this is the origin of suffering’: this is the first contemplation.
snp3.12:3.2	‘This is the cessation of suffering; this is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’: this is the second contemplation.
snp3.12:3.3	When a mendicant meditates rightly contemplating a pair of teachings in this way—diligent, keen, and resolute—they can expect one of two results: 
snp3.12:3.4	enlightenment in the present life, or if there’s something left over, non-return.” 
snp3.12:4.1	That is what the Buddha said. 
snp3.12:4.2	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
snp3.12:5.1	“There are those who don’t understand suffering 
snp3.12:5.2	and suffering’s cause, 
snp3.12:5.3	and where all suffering 
snp3.12:5.4	ceases with nothing left over. 
snp3.12:5.5	And they don’t know the path 
snp3.12:5.6	that leads to the stilling of suffering.
snp3.12:6.1	They lack the heart’s release, 
snp3.12:6.2	as well as the release by wisdom. 
snp3.12:6.3	Unable to make an end, 
snp3.12:6.4	they continue to be reborn and grow old. 
snp3.12:7.1	But there are those who understand suffering 
snp3.12:7.2	and suffering’s cause, 
snp3.12:7.3	and where all suffering 
snp3.12:7.4	ceases with nothing left over. 
snp3.12:7.5	And they understand the path 
snp3.12:7.6	that leads to the stilling of suffering.
snp3.12:8.1	They’re endowed with the heart’s release, 
snp3.12:8.2	as well as the release by wisdom. 
snp3.12:8.3	Able to make an end, 
snp3.12:8.4	they don’t continue to be reborn and grow old.” 
snp3.12:9.1	“Suppose, mendicants, they questioned you thus: ‘Could there be another way to contemplate the pairs?’ 
snp3.12:9.2	You should say, ‘There could.’
snp3.12:9.3	And how could there be?
snp3.12:9.4	‘All the suffering that originates is caused by attachment’: this is one contemplation.
snp3.12:9.5	‘With the utter cessation of attachment there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation.
snp3.12:9.6	When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”
snp3.12:9.7	Then the Teacher went on to say: 
snp3.12:10.1	“Attachment is the source of suffering
snp3.12:10.2	in all its countless forms in the world.
snp3.12:10.3	When an ignorant person builds up attachments,
snp3.12:10.4	that idiot returns to suffering again and again.
snp3.12:10.5	So let one who understands not build up attachments,
snp3.12:10.6	contemplating the birth and origin of suffering.” 
snp3.12:11.1	“Suppose, mendicants, they questioned you thus: ‘Could there be another way to contemplate the pairs?’ 
snp3.12:11.2	You should say, ‘There could.’
snp3.12:11.3	And how could there be?
snp3.12:11.4	‘All the suffering that originates is caused by ignorance’: this is one contemplation.
snp3.12:11.5	‘With the utter cessation of ignorance there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation.
snp3.12:11.6	When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”
snp3.12:11.7	Then the Teacher went on to say: 
snp3.12:12.1	“Those who journey again and again,
snp3.12:12.2	transmigrating through birth and death;
snp3.12:12.3	they go from this state to another, 
snp3.12:12.4	destined only for ignorance.
snp3.12:13.1	For ignorance is the great delusion
snp3.12:13.2	because of which we have long transmigrated.
snp3.12:13.3	Those beings who have arrived at knowledge
snp3.12:13.4	do not proceed to a future life.”
snp3.12:14.1	“‘Could there be another way?’ …
snp3.12:14.2	And how could there be?
snp3.12:14.3	‘All the suffering that originates is caused by choices’: this is one contemplation.
snp3.12:14.4	‘With the utter cessation of choices there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation.
snp3.12:14.5	When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”
snp3.12:14.6	Then the Teacher went on to say: 
snp3.12:15.1	“All the suffering that originates
snp3.12:15.2	is caused by ignorance.
snp3.12:15.3	With the cessation of choices, 
snp3.12:15.4	there is no origination of suffering.
snp3.12:16.1	Knowing this danger,
snp3.12:16.2	that suffering is caused by choices;
snp3.12:16.3	through the stilling of all choices,
snp3.12:16.4	and the stopping of perceptions,
snp3.12:16.5	this is the way suffering ends.
snp3.12:16.6	For those who truly know this,
snp3.12:17.1	rightly seeing, knowledge masters,
snp3.12:17.2	the astute, understanding rightly,
snp3.12:17.3	having overcome Māra’s bonds,
snp3.12:17.4	do not proceed to a future life.”
snp3.12:18.1	“‘Could there be another way?’ …
snp3.12:18.2	And how could there be?
snp3.12:18.3	‘All the suffering that originates is caused by consciousness’: this is one contemplation.
snp3.12:18.4	‘With the utter cessation of consciousness there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation.
snp3.12:18.5	When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”
snp3.12:18.6	Then the Teacher went on to say: 
snp3.12:19.1	“All the suffering that originates
snp3.12:19.2	is caused by consciousness.
snp3.12:19.3	With the cessation of consciousness, 
snp3.12:19.4	there is no origination of suffering.
snp3.12:20.1	Knowing this danger,
snp3.12:20.2	that suffering is caused by consciousness,
snp3.12:20.3	with the stilling of consciousness a mendicant
snp3.12:20.4	is hungerless, extinguished.”
snp3.12:21.1	“‘Could there be another way?’ …
snp3.12:21.2	And how could there be?
snp3.12:21.3	‘All the suffering that originates is caused by contact’: this is one contemplation.
snp3.12:21.4	‘With the utter cessation of contact there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation.
snp3.12:21.5	When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”
snp3.12:21.6	Then the Teacher went on to say: 
snp3.12:22.1	“Those mired in contact,
snp3.12:22.2	swept down the stream of rebirths,
snp3.12:22.3	practicing the wrong way,
snp3.12:22.4	are far from the ending of fetters.
snp3.12:23.1	But those who completely understand contact, 
snp3.12:23.2	who, understanding, delight in peace;
snp3.12:23.3	by comprehending contact
snp3.12:23.4	they are hungerless, extinguished.”
snp3.12:24.1	“‘Could there be another way?’ …
snp3.12:24.2	And how could there be?
snp3.12:24.3	‘All the suffering that originates is caused by feeling’: this is one contemplation.
snp3.12:24.4	‘With the utter cessation of feeling there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation.
snp3.12:24.5	When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”
snp3.12:24.6	Then the Teacher went on to say: 
snp3.12:25.1	“Whatever is felt 
snp3.12:25.2	internally and externally—
snp3.12:25.3	whether pleasure or pain 
snp3.12:25.4	as well as what’s neutral—
snp3.12:26.1	having known this as suffering, 
snp3.12:26.2	deceptive, falling apart, 
snp3.12:26.3	one sees them vanish as they’re experienced again and again: 
snp3.12:26.4	that’s how to understand them.
snp3.12:26.5	With the ending of feelings, a mendicant 
snp3.12:26.6	is hungerless, extinguished.”
snp3.12:27.1	“‘Could there be another way?’ …
snp3.12:27.2	And how could there be?
snp3.12:27.3	‘All the suffering that originates is caused by craving’: this is one contemplation.
snp3.12:27.4	‘With the utter cessation of craving there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation.
snp3.12:27.5	When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”
snp3.12:27.6	Then the Teacher went on to say: 
snp3.12:28.1	“Craving is a person’s partner 
snp3.12:28.2	as they transmigrate on this long journey. 
snp3.12:28.3	They go from this state to another, 
snp3.12:28.4	but don’t escape transmigration. 
snp3.12:29.1	Knowing this danger,
snp3.12:29.2	that craving is the cause of suffering—
snp3.12:29.3	rid of craving, free of grasping,
snp3.12:29.4	a mendicant would wander mindful.” 
snp3.12:30.1	“‘Could there be another way?’ …
snp3.12:30.2	And how could there be?
snp3.12:30.3	‘All the suffering that originates is caused by grasping’: this is one contemplation.
snp3.12:30.4	‘With the utter cessation of grasping there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation.
snp3.12:30.5	When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”
snp3.12:30.6	Then the Teacher went on to say: 
snp3.12:31.1	“Grasping is the cause of continued existence; 
snp3.12:31.2	one who exists falls into suffering. 
snp3.12:31.3	Death comes to those who are born—
snp3.12:31.4	this is the origination of suffering.
snp3.12:32.1	That’s why with the end of grasping, 
snp3.12:32.2	the astute, understanding rightly,
snp3.12:32.3	having directly known the end of rebirth,
snp3.12:32.4	do not proceed to a future life.”
snp3.12:33.1	“‘Could there be another way?’ …
snp3.12:33.2	And how could there be?
snp3.12:33.3	‘All the suffering that originates is caused by instigating karma’: this is one contemplation.
snp3.12:33.4	‘With the utter cessation of instigation there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation.
snp3.12:33.5	When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”
snp3.12:33.6	Then the Teacher went on to say: 
snp3.12:34.1	“All the suffering that originates
snp3.12:34.2	is caused by instigating karma.
snp3.12:34.3	With the cessation of instigation, 
snp3.12:34.4	there is no origination of suffering.
snp3.12:35.1	Knowing this danger,
snp3.12:35.2	that suffering is caused by instigating karma,
snp3.12:35.3	having given up all instigation,
snp3.12:35.4	one is freed with respects to instigation.
snp3.12:36.1	For the mendicant with peaceful mind,
snp3.12:36.2	who has cut off craving for continued existence,
snp3.12:36.3	transmigration through births is finished;
snp3.12:36.4	there are no future lives for them.” 
snp3.12:37.1	“‘Could there be another way?’ …
snp3.12:37.2	And how could there be?
snp3.12:37.3	‘All the suffering that originates is caused by sustenance’: this is one contemplation.
snp3.12:37.4	‘With the utter cessation of sustenance there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation.
snp3.12:37.5	When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”
snp3.12:37.6	Then the Teacher went on to say: 
snp3.12:38.1	“All the suffering that originates
snp3.12:38.2	is caused by sustenance.
snp3.12:38.3	With the cessation of sustenance, 
snp3.12:38.4	there is no origination of suffering.
snp3.12:39.1	Knowing this danger,
snp3.12:39.2	that suffering is caused by sustenance,
snp3.12:39.3	completely understanding all sustenance, 
snp3.12:39.4	one is independent of all sustenance.
snp3.12:40.1	Having rightly understood the state of health,
snp3.12:40.2	through the ending of defilements, 
snp3.12:40.3	using after reflection, firm in principle, 
snp3.12:40.4	a knowledge master cannot be reckoned.”
snp3.12:41.1	“‘Could there be another way?’ …
snp3.12:41.2	And how could there be?
snp3.12:41.3	‘All the suffering that originates is caused by perturbation’: this is one contemplation.
snp3.12:41.4	‘With the utter cessation of perturbation there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation.
snp3.12:41.5	When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”
snp3.12:41.6	Then the Teacher went on to say: 
snp3.12:42.1	“All the suffering that originates
snp3.12:42.2	is caused by perturbation.
snp3.12:42.3	With the cessation of perturbation, 
snp3.12:42.4	there is no origination of suffering.
snp3.12:43.1	Knowing this danger,
snp3.12:43.2	that suffering is caused by perturbation,
snp3.12:43.3	that’s why, having relinquished perturbation,
snp3.12:43.4	and stopped making karmic choices,
snp3.12:43.5	imperturbable, free of grasping,
snp3.12:43.6	a mendicant would wander mindful.” 
snp3.12:44.1	“‘Could there be another way?’ …
snp3.12:44.2	And how could there be?
snp3.12:44.3	‘For the dependent there is agitation’: this is the first contemplation.
snp3.12:44.4	‘For the independent there’s no agitation’: this is the second contemplation.
snp3.12:44.5	When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”
snp3.12:44.6	Then the Teacher went on to say: 
snp3.12:45.1	“For the independent there’s no agitation.
snp3.12:45.2	The dependent, grasping,
snp3.12:45.3	goes from this state to another, 
snp3.12:45.4	without escaping transmigration. 
snp3.12:46.1	Knowing this danger,
snp3.12:46.2	the great fear in dependencies,
snp3.12:46.3	independent, free of grasping,
snp3.12:46.4	a mendicant would wander mindful.” 
snp3.12:47.1	“‘Could there be another way?’ …
snp3.12:47.2	And how could there be?
snp3.12:47.3	‘Formless states are more peaceful than states of form’: this is the first contemplation.
snp3.12:47.4	‘Cessation is more peaceful than formless states’: this is the second contemplation.
snp3.12:47.5	When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”
snp3.12:47.6	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
snp3.12:48.1	“There are beings in the realm of luminous form, 
snp3.12:48.2	and others stuck in the formless. 
snp3.12:48.3	Not understanding cessation, 
snp3.12:48.4	they return in future lives.
snp3.12:49.1	But the people who completely understand form, 
snp3.12:49.2	not stuck in the formless,
snp3.12:49.3	released in cessation—
snp3.12:49.4	they are destroyers of death.”
snp3.12:50.1	“‘Could there be another way?’ …
snp3.12:50.2	And how could there be?
snp3.12:50.3	‘What this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—focuses on as true, the noble ones have clearly seen with right wisdom to be actually false’: this is the first contemplation.
snp3.12:50.4	‘What this world focuses on as false, the noble ones have clearly seen with right wisdom to be actually true’: this is the second contemplation.
snp3.12:50.5	When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”
snp3.12:50.6	Then the Teacher went on to say: 
snp3.12:51.1	“See how the world with its gods
snp3.12:51.2	imagines not-self to be self;
snp3.12:51.3	habituated to name and form,
snp3.12:51.4	imagining this is truth.
snp3.12:52.1	For whatever you imagine it is, 
snp3.12:52.2	it turns out to be something else.
snp3.12:52.3	And that is what is false in it,
snp3.12:52.4	for the ephemeral is deceptive by nature.
snp3.12:53.1	Extinguishment has an undeceptive nature,
snp3.12:53.2	the noble ones know it as truth. 
snp3.12:53.3	Having comprehended the truth,
snp3.12:53.4	they are hungerless, extinguished.”
snp3.12:54.1	“Suppose, mendicants, they questioned you thus: ‘Could there be another way to contemplate the pairs?’ 
snp3.12:54.2	You should say, ‘There could.’
snp3.12:54.3	And how could there be?
snp3.12:54.4	‘What this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—focuses on as happiness, the noble ones have clearly seen with right wisdom to be actually suffering’: this is the first contemplation.
snp3.12:54.5	‘What this world focuses on as suffering, the noble ones have clearly seen with right wisdom to be actually happiness’: this is the second contemplation.
snp3.12:54.6	When a mendicant meditates rightly contemplating a pair of teachings in this way—diligent, keen, and resolute—they can expect one of two results: 
snp3.12:54.7	enlightenment in the present life, or if there’s something left over, non-return. 
snp3.12:54.8	That is what the Buddha said. 
snp3.12:54.9	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
snp3.12:55.1	“Sights, sounds, tastes, smells, 
snp3.12:55.2	touches, and thoughts, the lot of them—
snp3.12:55.3	they’re likable, desirable, and pleasurable 
snp3.12:55.4	as long as you can say that they exist. 
snp3.12:56.1	For all the world with its gods, 
snp3.12:56.2	this is what they agree is happiness. 
snp3.12:56.3	And where they cease 
snp3.12:56.4	is agreed on as suffering for them. 
snp3.12:57.1	The noble ones have seen as happiness
snp3.12:57.2	the ceasing of identity.
snp3.12:57.3	This insight by those who see
snp3.12:57.4	contradicts the whole world. 
snp3.12:58.1	What others say is happiness 
snp3.12:58.2	the noble ones say is suffering. 
snp3.12:58.3	What others say is suffering 
snp3.12:58.4	the noble ones know as happiness. 
snp3.12:59.1	See, this teaching is hard to understand, 
snp3.12:59.2	it confuses the ignorant. 
snp3.12:59.3	There is darkness for the shrouded;
snp3.12:59.4	blackness for those who don’t see.
snp3.12:60.1	But the good are open; 
snp3.12:60.2	like light for those who see. 
snp3.12:60.3	Though close, they do not understand,
snp3.12:60.4	those fools inexpert in the teaching.
snp3.12:61.1	They’re mired in desire to be reborn, 
snp3.12:61.2	flowing along the stream of lives, 
snp3.12:61.3	mired in Māra’s sway: 
snp3.12:61.4	this teaching isn’t easy for them to understand. 
snp3.12:62.1	Who, apart from the noble ones, 
snp3.12:62.2	is qualified to understand this state? 
snp3.12:62.3	When they’ve rightly understood it, 
snp3.12:62.4	they become extinguished without defilements.” 
snp3.12:63.1	That is what the Buddha said. 
snp3.12:63.2	Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. 
snp3.12:63.3	And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of sixty mendicants were freed from defilements by not grasping. 
snp3.1:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp3.1:0.2	Going Forth 
snp3.1:1.1	“I shall extol going forth 
snp3.1:1.2	with the example of the seer,
snp3.1:1.3	the course of inquiry that led to
snp3.1:1.4	his choice to go forth.
snp3.1:2.1	‘This life at home is cramped,
snp3.1:2.2	a realm of dirt.’
snp3.1:2.3	‘The life of one gone forth is like an open space.’
snp3.1:2.4	Seeing this, he went forth.
snp3.1:3.1	Having gone forth, he shunned
snp3.1:3.2	bad deeds of body.
snp3.1:3.3	And leaving verbal misconduct behind,
snp3.1:3.4	he purified his livelihood.
snp3.1:4.1	The Buddha went to Rājagaha,
snp3.1:4.2	the Mountainfold of the Magadhans.
snp3.1:4.3	He betook himself for alms,
snp3.1:4.4	replete with auspicious marks.
snp3.1:5.1	Bimbisāra saw him
snp3.1:5.2	while standing atop his longhouse.
snp3.1:5.3	Noticing that he was endowed with marks,
snp3.1:5.4	he said the following:
snp3.1:6.1	‘Pay heed, sirs, to this one,
snp3.1:6.2	handsome, majestic, radiant;
snp3.1:6.3	accomplished in deportment,
snp3.1:6.4	he looks just a plough’s length in front. 
snp3.1:7.1	Eyes downcast, mindful,
snp3.1:7.2	unlike one from a low family.
snp3.1:7.3	Let the king’s messengers run out,
snp3.1:7.4	and find where the mendicant will go.’
snp3.1:8.1	The messengers sent out
snp3.1:8.2	followed right behind, thinking
snp3.1:8.3	‘Where will the mendicant go?
snp3.1:8.4	Where shall he find a place to stay?’
snp3.1:9.1	Wandering indiscriminately for alms,
snp3.1:9.2	sense-doors guarded and well restrained,
snp3.1:9.3	his bowl was quickly filled,
snp3.1:9.4	aware and mindful. 
snp3.1:10.1	Having wandered for alms,
snp3.1:10.2	the sage left the city.
snp3.1:10.3	He betook himself to Mount Paṇḍava,
snp3.1:10.4	thinking, ‘Here is the place I shall stay.’
snp3.1:11.1	Seeing that’d he arrived at a place to stay,
snp3.1:11.2	the messengers withdrew nearby,
snp3.1:11.3	but one of them returned
snp3.1:11.4	to inform the king.
snp3.1:12.1	‘Great king, the mendicant
snp3.1:12.2	is on the east flank of Mount Paṇḍava.
snp3.1:12.3	There he sits, like a tiger or a bull,
snp3.1:12.4	like a lion in a mountain cave.’
snp3.1:13.1	Hearing the messenger’s report,
snp3.1:13.2	the aristocrat set out
snp3.1:13.3	hurriedly in his fine chariot
snp3.1:13.4	towards Mount Paṇḍava.
snp3.1:14.1	He went as far as vehicles could go,
snp3.1:14.2	then dismounted from his chariot,
snp3.1:14.3	approached on foot,
snp3.1:14.4	and reaching him, drew near.
snp3.1:15.1	Seated, the king greeted him
snp3.1:15.2	and made polite conversation.
snp3.1:15.3	When the courtesies were over,
snp3.1:15.4	he said the following:
snp3.1:16.1	‘You are young, just a youth,
snp3.1:16.2	a lad in the prime of life.
snp3.1:16.3	You are endowed with beauty and stature,
snp3.1:16.4	like an aristocrat of good lineage
snp3.1:17.1	in glory at the army’s head,
snp3.1:17.2	surrounded by a troop of elephants.
snp3.1:17.3	I shall give you wealth to enjoy.
snp3.1:17.4	But please tell me your lineage by birth.’
snp3.1:18.1	‘Up north lies a nation, great king,
snp3.1:18.2	on the slope of the Himalayas,
snp3.1:18.3	full of wealth and strength,
snp3.1:18.4	led by one loyal to the Kosalans.
snp3.1:19.1	They are of the Solar clan, Ādiccas;
snp3.1:19.2	their lineage is the Sakyans.
snp3.1:19.3	I have gone forth from that family—
snp3.1:19.4	I do not yearn for sensual pleasures.
snp3.1:20.1	Seeing the danger in sensual pleasures,
snp3.1:20.2	seeing renunciation as sanctuary,
snp3.1:20.3	I shall go on to strive;
snp3.1:20.4	that is where my mind delights.’”
snp3.2:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp3.2:0.2	Striving
snp3.2:1.1	“During my time of resolute striving
snp3.2:1.2	on the bank of the Nerañjara River,
snp3.2:1.3	I was meditating very hard
snp3.2:1.4	for the sake of finding sanctuary.
snp3.2:2.1	Namucī came to me,
snp3.2:2.2	speaking words of kindness:
snp3.2:2.3	‘You’re thin, discolored,
snp3.2:2.4	on the verge of death.
snp3.2:3.1	Death has a thousand parts of you,
snp3.2:3.2	one fraction is left to life.
snp3.2:3.3	Live sir! Life is better!
snp3.2:3.4	Living, you can make merits.
snp3.2:4.1	While leading the spiritual life
snp3.2:4.2	and serving the sacred flame,
snp3.2:4.3	you can pile up abundant merit—
snp3.2:4.4	so what will striving do for you? 
snp3.2:5.1	Hard to walk is the path of striving,
snp3.2:5.2	hard to do, a hard challenge to win.’”
snp3.2:5.3	These are the verses Māra spoke
snp3.2:5.4	as he stood beside the Buddha.
snp3.2:6.1	When Māra had spoken in this way,
snp3.2:6.2	the Buddha said this:
snp3.2:6.3	“O Wicked One, kinsman of the negligent, 
snp3.2:6.4	you’re here for your own purpose.
snp3.2:7.1	I have no need for 
snp3.2:7.2	the slightest bit of merit.
snp3.2:7.3	Those with need for merit
snp3.2:7.4	are fit for Māra to address.
snp3.2:8.1	I have faith and energy too,
snp3.2:8.2	and wisdom is found in me.
snp3.2:8.3	When I am so resolute,
snp3.2:8.4	why do you beg me to live?
snp3.2:9.1	The rivers and streams
snp3.2:9.2	might be dried by the wind,
snp3.2:9.3	so why, when I am resolute,
snp3.2:9.4	should it not dry up my blood?
snp3.2:10.1	And while the blood is drying up,
snp3.2:10.2	the bile and phlegm dry too.
snp3.2:10.3	And as my muscles waste away,
snp3.2:10.4	my mind grows more serene.
snp3.2:10.5	And all the stronger grow mindfulness
snp3.2:10.6	and wisdom and immersion.
snp3.2:11.1	As I meditate like this,
snp3.2:11.2	I have experienced the ultimate feeling.
snp3.2:11.3	My mind has no interest in sensual pleasures:
snp3.2:11.4	behold a being’s purity!
snp3.2:12.1	Sensual pleasures are your first army,
snp3.2:12.2	the second is called discontent,
snp3.2:12.3	hunger and thirst are the third,
snp3.2:12.4	and the fourth is said to be craving.
snp3.2:13.1	Your fifth is dullness and drowsiness,
snp3.2:13.2	the sixth is said to be cowardice,
snp3.2:13.3	your seventh is doubt,
snp3.2:13.4	contempt and obstinacy are your eighth.
snp3.2:14.1	Profit, praise, and honor,
snp3.2:14.2	and misbegotten fame;
snp3.2:14.3	the extolling of oneself
snp3.2:14.4	while scorning others. 
snp3.2:15.1	This is your army, Namucī,
snp3.2:15.2	the strike force of the Dark One.
snp3.2:15.3	Only a hero can defeat it,
snp3.2:15.4	but in victory there lies bliss.
snp3.2:16.1	Let me gird myself—
snp3.2:16.2	so what if I die!
snp3.2:16.3	I’d rather die in battle
snp3.2:16.4	than live on in defeat.
snp3.2:17.1	Here some ascetics and brahmins
snp3.2:17.2	are swallowed up, not to be seen again.
snp3.2:17.3	They do not know the path
snp3.2:17.4	traveled by those true to their vows.
snp3.2:18.1	Seeing Māra ready on his mount,
snp3.2:18.2	surrounded by his bannered forces,
snp3.2:18.3	I shall meet them in battle—
snp3.2:18.4	they’ll never make me retreat!
snp3.2:19.1	That army of yours has never been beaten
snp3.2:19.2	by the world with all its gods.
snp3.2:19.3	Yet I shall smash it with wisdom,
snp3.2:19.4	like an unfired pot with a stone.
snp3.2:20.1	When my thoughts are under control,
snp3.2:20.2	and mindfulness is well established,
snp3.2:20.3	I shall wander from country to country,
snp3.2:20.4	guiding many disciples.
snp3.2:21.1	Diligent and resolute,
snp3.2:21.2	following my instructions,
snp3.2:21.3	they will proceed despite your will,
snp3.2:21.4	to where there is no sorrow.”
snp3.2:22.1	“For seven years I followed 
snp3.2:22.2	step by step behind the Blessed One.
snp3.2:22.3	I found no vulnerability
snp3.2:22.4	in the mindful Awakened One.
snp3.2:23.1	A crow once circled a stone 
snp3.2:23.2	that looked like a lump of fat. 
snp3.2:23.3	‘Perhaps I’ll find something tender,’ it thought, 
snp3.2:23.4	‘perhaps there’s something tasty.’ 
snp3.2:24.1	But finding nothing tasty, 
snp3.2:24.2	the crow left that place. 
snp3.2:24.3	Like the crow that pecked the stone, 
snp3.2:24.4	I leave Gotama disappointed.”
snp3.2:25.1	So stricken with sorrow
snp3.2:25.2	that his harp dropped from his armpit, 
snp3.2:25.3	that spirit, downcast, 
snp3.2:25.4	vanished right there.
snp3.3:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp3.3:0.2	Well-Spoken Words 
snp3.3:1.1	So I have heard. 
snp3.3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 
snp3.3:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, 
snp3.3:1.4	“Mendicants!” 
snp3.3:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied. 
snp3.3:1.6	The Buddha said this: 
snp3.3:2.1	“Mendicants, speech that has four factors is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s blameless and is not criticized by sensible people. 
snp3.3:2.2	What four? 
snp3.3:2.3	It’s when a mendicant speaks well, not poorly; they speak on the teaching, not against the teaching; they speak pleasantly, not unpleasantly; and they speak truthfully, not falsely. 
snp3.3:2.4	Speech with these four factors is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s blameless and is not criticized by sensible people.” 
snp3.3:2.5	That is what the Buddha said. 
snp3.3:2.6	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 
snp3.3:3.1	“Good people say that well-spoken words are foremost; 
snp3.3:3.2	second, speak on the teaching, not against it; 
snp3.3:3.3	third, speak pleasantly, not unpleasantly; 
snp3.3:3.4	and fourth, speak truthfully, not falsely.” 
snp3.3:4.1	Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said, 
snp3.3:4.2	“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” 
snp3.3:4.3	“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. 
snp3.3:4.4	Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses: 
snp3.3:5.1	“Speak only such words
snp3.3:5.2	that do not hurt yourself
snp3.3:5.3	nor harm others;
snp3.3:5.4	such speech is truly well spoken.
snp3.3:6.1	Speak only pleasing words,
snp3.3:6.2	words gladly welcomed.
snp3.3:6.3	Pleasing words are those
snp3.3:6.4	that bring nothing bad to others.
snp3.3:7.1	Truth itself is the undying word:
snp3.3:7.2	this is an ancient law. 
snp3.3:7.3	Good people say that the teaching and its meaning
snp3.3:7.4	are grounded in the truth.
snp3.3:8.1	The words spoken by the Buddha
snp3.3:8.2	for realizing the sanctuary, extinguishment,
snp3.3:8.3	for the attainment of vision,
snp3.3:8.4	this really is the best kind of speech.”
snp3.4:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp3.4:0.2	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarika on the Sacrificial Cake
snp3.4:1.1	So I have heard. 
snp3.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the Kosalan lands on the bank of the Sundarika river. 
snp3.4:1.3	Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarika was serving the sacred flame and performing the fire sacrifice on the bank of the river Sundarika. 
snp3.4:1.4	Then he looked all around the four directions, wondering, 
snp3.4:1.5	“Now who might eat the leftovers of this offering?” 
snp3.4:1.6	He saw the Buddha meditating at the root of a certain tree with his robe pulled over his head. 
snp3.4:1.7	Taking the leftovers of the offering in his left hand and a pitcher in the right he approached the Buddha. 
snp3.4:2.1	When he heard Sundarika’s footsteps the Buddha uncovered his head. 
snp3.4:2.2	Sundarika thought, “This man is shaven, he is shaven!” And he wanted to turn back. 
snp3.4:2.3	But he thought, 
snp3.4:2.4	“Even some brahmins are shaven. Why don’t I go to him and ask about his birth?” 
snp3.4:2.5	Then Sundarika the brahmin went up to the Buddha and said to him, 
snp3.4:2.6	“Sir, in what caste were you born?” 
snp3.4:3.1	Then the Buddha addressed Sundarika in verse: 
snp3.4:4.1	“I am no brahmin, nor am I a prince,
snp3.4:4.2	nor merchant nor anything else.
snp3.4:4.3	Fully understanding the clan of ordinary people,
snp3.4:4.4	I wander in the world owning nothing, reflective.
snp3.4:5.1	Clad in my cloak, I wander without home,
snp3.4:5.2	my hair shorn, quenched.
snp3.4:5.3	Since I’m unburdened by youngsters,
snp3.4:5.4	it’s inappropriate to ask me about clan.”
snp3.4:6.1	“Actually sir, when brahmins meet they politely
snp3.4:6.2	ask each other whether they are brahmins.”
snp3.4:7.1	“Well, if you say that you’re a brahmin,
snp3.4:7.2	and that I am not,
snp3.4:7.3	I shall question you on the Gāyatrī Mantra,
snp3.4:7.4	with its three lines and twenty-four syllables.”
snp3.4:8.1	“On what grounds have hermits and men,
snp3.4:8.2	aristocrats and brahmins here in the world
snp3.4:8.3	performed so many different sacrifices to the gods?”
snp3.4:9.1	“During a sacrifice, should a past master, a knowledge master, 
snp3.4:9.2	receive an oblation, it profits the donor, I say.”
snp3.4:10.1	“Then clearly my oblation will be profitable,”
snp3.4:10.2	said the brahmin,
snp3.4:10.3	“since I have met such a knowledge master.
snp3.4:10.4	It’s because I’d never met anyone like you 
snp3.4:10.5	that others ate the sacrificial cake.” 
snp3.4:11.1	“So then, brahmin, since you have approached me
snp3.4:11.2	as a seeker of the good, ask.
snp3.4:11.3	Perhaps you may find here someone intelligent,
snp3.4:11.4	peaceful, unclouded, untroubled, with no need for hope.”
snp3.4:12.1	“Master Gotama, I like to sacrifice
snp3.4:12.2	and wish to perform a sacrifice. Please advise me,
snp3.4:12.3	for I do not understand
snp3.4:12.4	where an oblation is profitable; tell me this.”
snp3.4:13.1	“Well then, brahmin, lend an ear, I will teach you the Dhamma. 
snp3.4:14.1	Don’t ask about birth, ask about conduct; 
snp3.4:14.2	for any wood can surely generate fire. 
snp3.4:14.3	A steadfast sage, even though from a low class family, 
snp3.4:14.4	is a thoroughbred checked by conscience. 
snp3.4:15.1	Tamed by truth, fulfilled by taming, 
snp3.4:15.2	a complete knowledge master who has completed the spiritual journey—
snp3.4:15.3	that is where a brahmin seeking merit
snp3.4:15.4	should bestow a timely offering as sacrifice.
snp3.4:16.1	Those who have left sensuality behind, wandering homeless,
snp3.4:16.2	self-controlled, straight as a shuttle—
snp3.4:16.3	that is where a brahmin seeking merit
snp3.4:16.4	should bestow a timely offering as sacrifice.
snp3.4:17.1	Those freed of greed, with senses stilled,
snp3.4:17.2	like the moon released from the eclipse—
snp3.4:17.3	that is where a brahmin seeking merit
snp3.4:17.4	should bestow a timely offering as sacrifice.
snp3.4:18.1	They wander the world unimpeded,
snp3.4:18.2	always mindful, calling nothing their own—
snp3.4:18.3	that is where a brahmin seeking merit
snp3.4:18.4	should bestow a timely offering as sacrifice.
snp3.4:19.1	Having left sensuality behind, wandering triumphant,
snp3.4:19.2	knowing the end of rebirth and death,
snp3.4:19.3	extinguished and cool as a lake:
snp3.4:19.4	the Realized One is worthy of the sacrificial cake.
snp3.4:20.1	Good among the good, far from the bad,
snp3.4:20.2	the Realized One has infinite wisdom.
snp3.4:20.3	Unsullied in this world and the next:
snp3.4:20.4	the Realized One is worthy of the sacrificial cake.
snp3.4:21.1	In whom dwells no deceit or conceit,
snp3.4:21.2	rid of greed, unselfish, with no need for hope,
snp3.4:21.3	with anger eliminated, quenched,
snp3.4:21.4	a brahmin rid of sorrow’s stain: 
snp3.4:21.5	the Realized One is worthy of the sacrificial cake.
snp3.4:22.1	He has given up the mind’s home,
snp3.4:22.2	and has no possessions at all.
snp3.4:22.3	Not grasping to this world or the next:
snp3.4:22.4	the Realized One is worthy of the sacrificial cake.
snp3.4:23.1	Serene, he has crossed the flood,
snp3.4:23.2	and has understood the teaching with ultimate view.
snp3.4:23.3	With defilements ended, bearing his final body: 
snp3.4:23.4	the Realized One is worthy of the sacrificial cake.
snp3.4:24.1	In whom desire to be reborn, and caustic speech
snp3.4:24.2	are cleared and ended, they are no more;
snp3.4:24.3	that knowledge master, everywhere free:
snp3.4:24.4	the Realized One is worthy of the sacrificial cake.
snp3.4:25.1	They’ve escaped their chains, they’re chained no more,
snp3.4:25.2	among those caught in conceit he is free of conceit;
snp3.4:25.3	he has fully understood suffering with its field and ground: 
snp3.4:25.4	the Realized One is worthy of the sacrificial cake.
snp3.4:26.1	Not relying on hope, seeing seclusion,
snp3.4:26.2	well past the views proclaimed by others.
snp3.4:26.3	In him there are no supporting conditions at all:
snp3.4:26.4	the Realized One is worthy of the sacrificial cake.
snp3.4:27.1	He has comprehended all things, high and low, 
snp3.4:27.2	cleared them and ended them, so they are no more.
snp3.4:27.3	Peaceful, freed in the ending of grasping: 
snp3.4:27.4	the Realized One is worthy of the sacrificial cake.
snp3.4:28.1	He sees the utter ending of rebirth’s fetter,
snp3.4:28.2	and has swept away all manner of desire.
snp3.4:28.3	Pure, stainless, immaculate, flawless:
snp3.4:28.4	the Realized One is worthy of the sacrificial cake.
snp3.4:29.1	Not seeing himself in terms of a self,
snp3.4:29.2	he is stilled, upright, and steadfast.
snp3.4:29.3	Imperturbable, kind, wishless:
snp3.4:29.4	the Realized One is worthy of the sacrificial cake.
snp3.4:30.1	He harbors no delusions within at all,
snp3.4:30.2	he has insight into all things. 
snp3.4:30.3	He bears his final body, 
snp3.4:30.4	attained to the state of grace, the supreme awakening.
snp3.4:30.5	That’s how the purity of a spirit is defined:
snp3.4:30.6	the Realized One is worthy of the sacrificial cake.”
snp3.4:31.1	“Let my oblation be a true offering,
snp3.4:31.2	since I have found such a knowledge master! 
snp3.4:31.3	I see Brahmā in person! Accept my offering, Blessed One:
snp3.4:31.4	please eat my sacrificial cake.” 
snp3.4:32.1	“Food enchanted by a spell isn’t fit for me to eat. 
snp3.4:32.2	That’s not the principle of those who see, brahmin. 
snp3.4:32.3	The Buddhas reject things enchanted with spells. 
snp3.4:32.4	Since there is such a principle, brahmin, that’s how they live. 
snp3.4:33.1	Serve with other food and drink 
snp3.4:33.2	the consummate one, the great hermit, 
snp3.4:33.3	with defilements ended and remorse stilled. 
snp3.4:33.4	For he is the field for the seeker of merit.” 
snp3.4:34.1	“Please, Blessed One, help me understand:
snp3.4:34.2	now that I have encountered your teaching,
snp3.4:34.3	when I look for someone during a sacrifice,
snp3.4:34.4	who should eat the religious donation of one like me?”
snp3.4:35.1	“One who is rid of aggression,
snp3.4:35.2	whose mind is unclouded,
snp3.4:35.3	who is liberated from sensual pleasures,
snp3.4:35.4	and who has dispelled dullness.
snp3.4:36.1	One who has erased boundaries and limits,
snp3.4:36.2	expert in birth and death,
snp3.4:36.3	a sage, blessed with sagacity.
snp3.4:36.4	When such a person comes to the sacrifice,
snp3.4:37.1	get rid of your scowl!
snp3.4:37.2	Honor them with joined palms,
snp3.4:37.3	and venerate them with food and drink,
snp3.4:37.4	and in this way your religious donation will succeed.”
snp3.4:38.1	“The Buddha is worthy of the sacrificial cake,
snp3.4:38.2	he is the supreme field of merit,
snp3.4:38.3	Recipient of gifts from the whole world,
snp3.4:38.4	what’s given to the worthy one is very fruitful.” 
snp3.4:39.1	Then Sundarika the brahmin said to the Buddha, 
snp3.4:39.2	“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! 
snp3.4:39.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. 
snp3.4:39.4	I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
snp3.4:39.5	Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” 
snp3.4:39.6	And the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. 
snp3.4:39.7	And soon after, he became one of the perfected. 
snp3.5:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp3.5:0.2	With Māgha 
snp3.5:1.1	So I have heard. 
snp3.5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. 
snp3.5:1.3	Then the brahmin student Māgha approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. 
snp3.5:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, 
snp3.5:1.5	and said to the Buddha: 
snp3.5:2.1	“I’m a giver, Master Gotama, a donor; I am bountiful and committed to charity.
snp3.5:2.2	I seek wealth in a principled manner, 
snp3.5:2.3	and with that legitimate wealth I give to one person, to two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred people or even more.
snp3.5:2.4	Giving and sacrificing like this, Master Gotama, do I accrue much merit?”
snp3.5:3.1	“Indeed you do, student.
snp3.5:3.2	A giver or donor who is bountiful and committed to charity,
snp3.5:3.3	who seeks wealth in a principled manner, 
snp3.5:3.4	and with that legitimate wealth gives to one person, or up to a hundred people or even more, accrues much merit.”
snp3.5:3.5	Then Māgha addressed the Buddha in verse: 
snp3.5:4.1	“I ask the bountiful Gotama,”
snp3.5:4.2	said Māgha,
snp3.5:4.3	“wearing an ochre robe, wandering homeless.
snp3.5:4.4	Suppose a lay donor who is committed to charity
snp3.5:4.5	makes a sacrifice seeking merit, looking for merit.
snp3.5:4.6	Giving food and drink to others here,
snp3.5:4.7	how is their offering purifed?”
snp3.5:5.1	“Suppose a lay donor who is committed to charity,”
snp3.5:5.2	replied the Buddha,
snp3.5:5.3	“makes a sacrifice seeking merit, looking for merit,
snp3.5:5.4	giving food and drink to others here:
snp3.5:5.5	such a one would succeed due to those who are worthy of donations.”
snp3.5:6.1	“Suppose a lay donor who is committed to charity,”
snp3.5:6.2	said Māgha,
snp3.5:6.3	“makes a sacrifice seeking merit, looking for merit,
snp3.5:6.4	giving food and drink to others here:
snp3.5:6.5	explain to me who is worthy of donations.”
snp3.5:7.1	“Those who wander the world unattached,
snp3.5:7.2	consummate, restrained, owning nothing:
snp3.5:7.3	that is where a brahmin seeking merit
snp3.5:7.4	should bestow a timely offering as sacrifice.
snp3.5:8.1	Those who have cut off all fetters and bonds,
snp3.5:8.2	tamed, liberated, untroubled, with no need for hope:
snp3.5:8.3	that is where a brahmin seeking merit
snp3.5:8.4	should bestow a timely offering as sacrifice.
snp3.5:9.1	Those who are released from all fetters,
snp3.5:9.2	tamed, liberated, untroubled, with no need for hope:
snp3.5:9.3	that is where a brahmin seeking merit
snp3.5:9.4	should bestow a timely offering as sacrifice.
snp3.5:10.1	Having given up greed, hate, and delusion, 
snp3.5:10.2	with defilements ended, the spiritual journey completed:
snp3.5:10.3	that is where a brahmin seeking merit
snp3.5:10.4	should bestow a timely offering as sacrifice.
snp3.5:11.1	Those in whom dwells no deceit or conceit,
snp3.5:11.2	with defilements ended, the spiritual journey completed:
snp3.5:11.3	that is where a brahmin seeking merit
snp3.5:11.4	should bestow a timely offering as sacrifice.
snp3.5:12.1	Those rid of greed, unselfish, with no need for hope,
snp3.5:12.2	with defilements ended, the spiritual journey completed:
snp3.5:12.3	that is where a brahmin seeking merit
snp3.5:12.4	should bestow a timely offering as sacrifice.
snp3.5:13.1	Those not fallen prey to cravings,
snp3.5:13.2	who, having crossed the flood, live unselfishly:
snp3.5:13.3	that is where a brahmin seeking merit
snp3.5:13.4	should bestow a timely offering as sacrifice.
snp3.5:14.1	Those with no craving at all in the world
snp3.5:14.2	to any form of existence in this life or the next:
snp3.5:14.3	that is where a brahmin seeking merit
snp3.5:14.4	should bestow a timely offering as sacrifice.
snp3.5:15.1	Those who have left sensuality behind, wandering homeless,
snp3.5:15.2	self-controlled, straight as a shuttle:
snp3.5:15.3	that is where a brahmin seeking merit
snp3.5:15.4	should bestow a timely offering as sacrifice.
snp3.5:16.1	Those freed of greed, with senses stilled,
snp3.5:16.2	like the moon released from the eclipse:
snp3.5:16.3	that is where a brahmin seeking merit
snp3.5:16.4	should bestow a timely offering as sacrifice.
snp3.5:17.1	Those peaceful ones free of greed and anger,
snp3.5:17.2	for whom there are no destinies, being rid of them in this life:
snp3.5:17.3	that is where a brahmin seeking merit
snp3.5:17.4	should bestow a timely offering as sacrifice.
snp3.5:18.1	They’ve given up rebirth and death completely,
snp3.5:18.2	and have gone beyond all doubt:
snp3.5:18.3	that is where a brahmin seeking merit
snp3.5:18.4	should bestow a timely offering as sacrifice.
snp3.5:19.1	Those who live as their own island,
snp3.5:19.2	everywhere free, owning nothing:
snp3.5:19.3	that is where a brahmin seeking merit
snp3.5:19.4	should bestow a timely offering as sacrifice.
snp3.5:20.1	Those here who know this to be true:
snp3.5:20.2	‘This is my last life, there are no future lives’: 
snp3.5:20.3	that is where a brahmin seeking merit
snp3.5:20.4	should bestow a timely offering as sacrifice.
snp3.5:21.1	A knowledge master, loving absorption, mindful,
snp3.5:21.2	who has reached awakening and is a refuge for many:
snp3.5:21.3	that is where a brahmin seeking merit
snp3.5:21.4	should bestow a timely offering as sacrifice.”
snp3.5:22.1	“Clearly my questions were not in vain!”
snp3.5:22.2	said Māgha,
snp3.5:22.3	“The Buddha has explained to me who is worthy of donations.
snp3.5:22.4	You are the one here who knows this to be true,
snp3.5:22.5	for truly you understand this matter.
snp3.5:23.1	Suppose a lay donor who is committed to charity
snp3.5:23.2	makes a sacrifice seeking merit, looking for merit,
snp3.5:23.3	giving food and drink to others here:
snp3.5:23.4	explain to me how to accomplish the sacrifice.”
snp3.5:24.1	“Sacrifice, and while doing so,”
snp3.5:24.2	replied the Buddha, 
snp3.5:24.3	“be clear and confident in every way.
snp3.5:24.4	Sacrifice is the ground standing upon which
snp3.5:24.5	the sacrificer sheds their flaws.
snp3.5:25.1	One free of greed, rid of anger,
snp3.5:25.2	developing a heart of limitless love,
snp3.5:25.3	spreads that limitlessness in every direction,
snp3.5:25.4	ever diligent day and night.”
snp3.5:26.1	“Who is purified, freed, awake?
snp3.5:26.2	How can one go to the Brahmā realm oneself?
snp3.5:26.3	I do not know, so please tell me when asked,
snp3.5:26.4	for the Buddha is the Brahmā I see in person today!
snp3.5:26.5	To us you are truly the equal of Brahmā.
snp3.5:26.6	Splendid One, how is one reborn in the Brahmā realm?”
snp3.5:27.1	“One who accomplishes the sacrifice with three modes,” 
snp3.5:27.2	replied the Buddha,
snp3.5:27.3	“such a one would succeed due to those who are worthy of donations.
snp3.5:27.4	Sacrificing like this, one rightly committed to charity
snp3.5:27.5	is reborn in the Brahmā realm, I say.”
snp3.5:28.1	When he had spoken, the student Māgha said to the Buddha, 
snp3.5:28.2	“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! … 
snp3.5:28.3	From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 
snp3.6:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp3.6:0.2	With Sabhiya
snp3.6:1.1	So I have heard. 
snp3.6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 
snp3.6:1.3	Now at that time the wanderer Sabhiya had been presented with a question by a deity who was a former relative, saying:
snp3.6:1.4	“Sabhiya, you should practice the spiritual life with whatever ascetic or brahmin answers this question.”
snp3.6:2.1	Then Sabhiya, after learning that question in the presence of that deity, approached those ascetics and brahmins who led an order and a community, and taught a community, who were well-known and famous religious founders, regarded as holy by many people. That is, 
snp3.6:2.2	Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, Pakudha Kaccāyana, and Ajita Kesakambala. 
snp3.6:2.3	And he asked them that question,
snp3.6:2.4	by they were stumped by it,
snp3.6:2.5	Displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness,
snp3.6:2.6	they questioned Sabiya in return.
snp3.6:3.1	Then Sabhiya thought,
snp3.6:3.2	“Those famous ascetics and brahmins
snp3.6:3.4	were stumped by my question. 
snp3.6:3.5	Displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness,
snp3.6:3.6	they questioned me in return on that matter.
snp3.6:3.7	Why don’t I return to a lesser life so I can enjoy sensual pleasures?” 
snp3.6:4.1	Then Sabhiya thought,
snp3.6:4.2	“This ascetic Gotama also leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. 
snp3.6:4.3	Why don’t I ask him this question?” 
snp3.6:5.1	Then he thought,
snp3.6:5.2	“Even those ascetics and brahmins who elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; who are senior, long standing, long gone forth; who lead an order and a community, and teach a community; who are well-known and famous religious founders, regarded as holy by many people—that is
snp3.6:5.3	Pūraṇa Kassapa and the rest—
snp3.6:5.4	were stumped by my question. 
snp3.6:5.5	They displayed annoyance, hate, and bitterness, and even questioned me in return.
snp3.6:5.6	How can the ascetic Gotama possibly answer my question,
snp3.6:5.7	since he is so young in age and newly gone forth?” 
snp3.6:6.1	Then he thought,
snp3.6:6.2	“An ascetic should not be looked down upon or disparaged because they are young. 
snp3.6:6.3	Though young, the ascetic Gotama has great psychic power and might. Why don’t I ask him this question?” 
snp3.6:7.1	Then Sabhiya set out for Rājagaha. 
snp3.6:7.2	Traveling stage by stage, he came to Rājagaha, the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. He went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. 
snp3.6:7.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, 
snp3.6:7.4	and addressed the Buddha in verse: 
snp3.6:8.1	“I’ve come full of  doubts and uncertainties,”
snp3.6:8.2	said Sabhiya,
snp3.6:8.3	“wishing to ask a question.
snp3.6:8.4	Please solve them for me.
snp3.6:8.5	Answer my questions in turn, in accordance with the truth.”
snp3.6:9.1	“You have come from afar, Sabhiya,”
snp3.6:9.2	said the Buddha,
snp3.6:9.3	“wishing to ask a question.
snp3.6:9.4	I shall solve them for you,
snp3.6:9.5	answering your questions in turn, in accordance with the truth.
snp3.6:10.1	Ask me your question, Sabhiya, 
snp3.6:10.2	whatever you want. 
snp3.6:10.3	I’ll solve each and every 
snp3.6:10.4	question you have.” 
snp3.6:11.1	Then Sabhiya thought,
snp3.6:11.2	“It’s incredible, it’s amazing! 
snp3.6:11.3	Where those other ascetics and brahmins didn’t even give me a chance, the Buddha has invited me.”
snp3.6:11.4	Uplifted and elated, full of rapture and happiness, he asked this question.
snp3.6:12.1	“What must one attain to be called a mendicant?”
snp3.6:12.2	said Sabhiya,
snp3.6:12.3	“How is one ‘sweet’, how said to be ‘tamed’?
snp3.6:12.4	How is one declared to be ‘awakened’? 
snp3.6:12.5	May the Buddha please answer my question.”
snp3.6:13.1	“When by the path they have walked themselves,”
snp3.6:13.2	said the Buddha to Sabhiya,
snp3.6:13.3	“they reach quenching, with doubt overcome;
snp3.6:13.4	giving up desire to continue existence or to end it,
snp3.6:13.5	their journey complete, their rebirths ended: that is a mendicant.
snp3.6:14.1	Equanimous towards everything, mindful,
snp3.6:14.2	they don’t harm anyone in the world.
snp3.6:14.3	An ascetic who has crossed over, unclouded,
snp3.6:14.4	not full of themselves, is sweet-natured.
snp3.6:15.1	Their faculties have been developed
snp3.6:15.2	inside and out in the whole world.
snp3.6:15.3	Having pierced through this world and the next,
snp3.6:15.4	tamed, they bide their time.
snp3.6:16.1	They have examined the aeons in their entirety,
snp3.6:16.2	and both sides of transmigration—passing away and rebirth.
snp3.6:16.3	Rid of dust, unblemished, purified:
snp3.6:16.4	the one they call ‘awakened’ has attained the end of rebirth.”
snp3.6:17.1	And then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, uplifted and elated, full of rapture and happiness, Sabhiya asked another question: 
snp3.6:18.1	“What must one attain to be called ‘brahmin’?”
snp3.6:18.2	said Sabhiya.
snp3.6:18.3	“Why is one an ‘ascetic’, and how a ‘bathed initiate’?
snp3.6:18.4	How is one declared to be a ‘giant’? 
snp3.6:18.5	May the Buddha please answer my question.”
snp3.6:19.1	“Having banished all bad things,”
snp3.6:19.2	said the Buddha to Sabhiya,
snp3.6:19.3	“immaculate, well-composed, steadfast, 
snp3.6:19.4	consummate, they’ve left transmigration behind:
snp3.6:19.5	such an unattached one is called ‘brahmin’.
snp3.6:20.1	A peaceful one who has given up good and evil,
snp3.6:20.2	stainless, understanding this world and the next,
snp3.6:20.3	gone beyond rebirth and death:
snp3.6:20.4	such an one is rightly called ‘ascetic’.
snp3.6:21.1	Having washed off all bad things
snp3.6:21.2	inside and out in the whole world,
snp3.6:21.3	among gods and humans bound to creations,
snp3.6:21.4	the one they call ‘washed’ does not return to creation.
snp3.6:22.1	They do nothing monstrous at all in the world,
snp3.6:22.2	discarding all fetters and bonds,
snp3.6:22.3	everywhere not stuck, freed:
snp3.6:22.4	such an one is rightly called ‘giant’.”
snp3.6:23.1	And then Sabhiya asked another question: 
snp3.6:24.1	“Who is a ‘field-victor’ according to the Buddhas?”
snp3.6:24.2	said Sabhiya,
snp3.6:24.3	“Why is one ‘skillful’, and how ‘a wise scholar’?
snp3.6:24.4	How is one declared to be a ‘sage’? 
snp3.6:24.5	May the Buddha please answer my question.”
snp3.6:25.1	“They are victorious over the fields of deeds in their entirety,”
snp3.6:25.2	said the Buddha to Sabhiya,
snp3.6:25.3	“the fields of gods, humans, and Brahmas;
snp3.6:25.4	released from the root bondage to all fields:
snp3.6:25.5	such an one is rightly called ‘field-victor’.
snp3.6:26.1	They have examined the stockpiles of deeds in their entirety,
snp3.6:26.2	the stockpiles of gods, humans, and Brahmas;
snp3.6:26.3	released from the root bondage to all stockpiles:
snp3.6:26.4	such an one is rightly called ‘skillful’.
snp3.6:27.1	They have examined whiteness 
snp3.6:27.2	both inside and out; understanding purity,
snp3.6:27.3	they have left dark and bright behind:
snp3.6:27.4	such an one is rightly called ‘a wise scholar’.”
snp3.6:28.1	Understanding the nature of the bad and the good
snp3.6:28.2	inside and out in the whole world;
snp3.6:28.3	one worthy of honor by gods and humans,
snp3.6:28.4	who has escaped from the net and the snare: that is a sage.”
snp3.6:29.1	And then Sabhiya asked another question: 
snp3.6:30.1	“What must one attain to be called ‘knowledge master’?”
snp3.6:30.2	said Sabhiya,
snp3.6:30.3	“Why is one ‘studied’, and how is one ‘heroic’?
snp3.6:30.4	How to gain the name ‘thoroughbred’?
snp3.6:30.5	May the Buddha please answer my question.”
snp3.6:31.1	“They have examined knowledges in their entirety,”
snp3.6:31.2	said the Buddha to Sabhiya,
snp3.6:31.3	“those that are current among ascetics and brahmins;
snp3.6:31.4	rid of greed for all feelings,
snp3.6:31.5	having left all knowledges behind: that is a knowledge master.
snp3.6:32.1	Having studied proliferation and name & form
snp3.6:32.2	inside and out—the root of disease;
snp3.6:32.3	released from the root bondage to all disease:
snp3.6:32.4	such an one is rightly called ‘studied’.
snp3.6:33.1	Refraining from all evil here,
snp3.6:33.2	heroic, he escapes from the suffering of hell;
snp3.6:33.3	he is heroic and energetic:
snp3.6:33.4	such an one is rightly called ‘hero’.
snp3.6:34.1	Whoever’s bonds are cut,
snp3.6:34.2	the root of clinging inside and out;
snp3.6:34.3	released from the root bondage to all clinging:
snp3.6:34.4	such an one is rightly called ‘thoroughbred’.”
snp3.6:35.1	And then Sabhiya asked another question: 
snp3.6:36.1	“What must one attain to be called ‘scholar’?”
snp3.6:36.2	said Sabhiya,
snp3.6:36.3	“Why is one ‘noble’, and how is one ‘well conducted’?
snp3.6:36.4	How to gain the name ‘wanderer’?
snp3.6:36.5	May the Buddha please answer my question.”
snp3.6:37.1	“One who has learned every teaching,”
snp3.6:37.2	said the Buddha to Sabhiya,
snp3.6:37.3	“and has known for themselves whatever is blameworthy and blameless in the world;
snp3.6:37.4	a champion, decided, liberated,
snp3.6:37.5	untroubled everywhere: they call them ‘scholar’.
snp3.6:38.1	Having cut off defilements and attachments, 
snp3.6:38.2	being wise, they enter no womb.
snp3.6:38.3	They’ve expelled the bog of the three perceptions,
snp3.6:38.4	the one they call ‘noble’ does not return to creation.
snp3.6:39.1	One here who is accomplished and skillful in all forms of good conduct;
snp3.6:39.2	always understanding the teaching,
snp3.6:39.3	everywhere not stuck, freed in mind,
snp3.6:39.4	who has no repulsion: they are ‘well-conducted’.
snp3.6:40.1	Avoiding any deed that results in suffering—
snp3.6:40.2	above, below, all round, between:
snp3.6:40.3	deceit and conceit, as well as greed and anger,
snp3.6:40.4	they live full of wisdom.
snp3.6:40.5	They have made a limit on name & form;
snp3.6:40.6	the one they call a ‘wanderer’ has reached their destination.”
snp3.6:41.1	And then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, uplifted and elated, full of rapture and happiness, Sabhiya got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses:
snp3.6:42.1	“O one of vast wisdom, there are three & sixty opinions
snp3.6:42.2	based on the doctrines of ascetics:
snp3.6:42.3	they are expressions of perception, based on perception.
snp3.6:42.4	Having dispelled them all, you passed over the dark flood.
snp3.6:43.1	You have gone to the end, gone beyond suffering, 
snp3.6:43.2	you are perfected, a fully awakened Buddha; I think you have ended defilements.
snp3.6:43.3	Splendid, intelligent, abounding in wisdom,
snp3.6:43.4	ender of suffering—you brought me across!
snp3.6:44.1	When you understood my uncertainty,
snp3.6:44.2	you brought me beyond doubt—homage to you!
snp3.6:44.3	A sage, accomplished in the ways of sagacity,
snp3.6:44.4	you are gentle, not hardhearted, O Kinsman of the Sun.
snp3.6:45.1	Any doubts that I once had,
snp3.6:45.2	you have answered for me, O Seer.
snp3.6:45.3	Clearly you are a sage, an Awakened One,
snp3.6:45.4	there are no hindrances in you.
snp3.6:46.1	All your distress
snp3.6:46.2	is blown away and mown down.
snp3.6:46.3	Cooled, tamed, steadfast:
snp3.6:46.4	truth is your strength.
snp3.6:47.1	O giant among giants, O great hero,
snp3.6:47.2	when you are speaking
snp3.6:47.3	all the gods rejoice,
snp3.6:47.4	including both Nārada and Pabbata.
snp3.6:48.1	Homage to you, O thoroughbred! 
snp3.6:48.2	Homage to you, supreme among men! 
snp3.6:48.3	In the world with its gods, 
snp3.6:48.4	you have no counterpart.
snp3.6:49.1	You are the Buddha, you are the Teacher,
snp3.6:49.2	you are the sage who has overcome Māra;
snp3.6:49.3	you have cut off the underlying tendencies,
snp3.6:49.4	you’ve crossed over, and you bring humanity across. 
snp3.6:50.1	You have transcended attachments,
snp3.6:50.2	your defilements are shattered;
snp3.6:50.3	you are a lion, free of grasping,
snp3.6:50.4	with fear and dread given up.
snp3.6:51.1	Like a graceful lotus
snp3.6:51.2	to which water does not stick,
snp3.6:51.3	so both good and evil
snp3.6:51.4	do not stick to you.
snp3.6:51.5	Stretch out your feet, great hero:
snp3.6:51.6	Sabhiya bows to the Teacher.”
snp3.6:52.1	Then the wanderer Sabhiya bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet and said, 
snp3.6:52.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent! … 
snp3.6:52.3	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. 
snp3.6:52.4	Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” 
snp3.6:53.1	“Seniya, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood. 
snp3.6:53.2	However, I have recognized individual differences in this matter.” 
snp3.6:54.1	“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.” 
snp3.6:54.2	And the wanderer Sabhiya received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. 
snp3.6:54.3	And Venerable Sabhiya became one of the perfected. 
snp3.7:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp3.7:0.2	With Sela 
snp3.7:1.1	So I have heard. 
snp3.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Northern Āpaṇas together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Northern Āpaṇas named Āpaṇa. 
snp3.7:1.3	The matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya heard: 
snp3.7:1.4	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Āpaṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants. 
snp3.7:1.5	He has this good reputation: 
snp3.7:1.6	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
snp3.7:1.7	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. 
snp3.7:1.8	He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. 
snp3.7:1.9	It’s good to see such perfected ones.” 
snp3.7:2.1	So Keṇiya approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. 
snp3.7:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. 
snp3.7:2.3	The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk. 
snp3.7:2.4	Then he said to the Buddha, 
snp3.7:2.5	“Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?” 
snp3.7:2.6	When he said this, the Buddha said to him, 
snp3.7:2.7	“The Saṅgha is large, Keṇiya; there are 1,250 mendicants. And you are devoted to the brahmins.” 
snp3.7:3.1	For a second time, Keṇiya asked the Buddha to accept a meal offering. 
snp3.7:3.2	“Never mind that the Saṅgha is large, with 1,250 mendicants, and that I am devoted to the brahmins.
snp3.7:3.3	Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?” 
snp3.7:3.4	And for a second time, the Buddha gave the same reply.
snp3.7:4.1	For a third time, Keṇiya asked the Buddha to accept a meal offering. 
snp3.7:4.2	“Never mind that the Saṅgha is large, with 1,250 mendicants, and that I am devoted to the brahmins.
snp3.7:4.3	Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?” 
snp3.7:4.4	The Buddha consented in silence. 
snp3.7:4.5	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Keṇiya got up from his seat and went to his own hermitage. There he addressed his friends and colleagues, relatives and family members, 
snp3.7:4.6	“Gentlemen, please listen. 
snp3.7:4.7	The ascetic Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal. 
snp3.7:4.8	Please help me with the preparations.” 
snp3.7:4.9	“Yes, sir,” they replied. Some dug ovens, some chopped wood, some washed dishes, some set out a water jar, and some spread out seats. 
snp3.7:4.10	Meanwhile, Keṇiya set up the pavilion himself. 
snp3.7:5.1	Now at that time the brahmin Sela was residing in Āpaṇa. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knew philology and grammar, and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. And he was teaching three hundred students to recite the hymns. 
snp3.7:6.1	And at that time Keṇiya was devoted to Sela. 
snp3.7:6.2	Then Sela, while going for a walk escorted by the three hundred students, approached Keṇiya’s hermitage. 
snp3.7:6.3	He saw the preparations going on, 
snp3.7:6.4	and said to Keṇiya, 
snp3.7:6.5	“Keṇiya, is your son or daughter being married? Or are you setting up a big sacrifice? Or has King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha been invited for tomorrow’s meal?” 
snp3.7:7.1	“There is no marriage, Sela, and the king is not coming. 
snp3.7:7.2	Rather, I am setting up a big sacrifice. 
snp3.7:7.3	The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Āpaṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants. 
snp3.7:7.4	He has this good reputation: 
snp3.7:7.5	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
snp3.7:7.6	He has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal together with the mendicant Saṅgha.” 
snp3.7:7.7	“Mister Keṇiya, did you say ‘the awakened one’?” 
snp3.7:7.8	“I said ‘the awakened one’.” 
snp3.7:7.9	“Mister Keṇiya, did you say ‘the awakened one’?” 
snp3.7:7.10	“I said ‘the awakened one’.” 
snp3.7:8.1	Then Sela thought, 
snp3.7:8.2	“It’s hard to even find the word ‘awakened one’ in the world. 
snp3.7:8.3	The thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other. 
snp3.7:8.4	If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures. 
snp3.7:8.5	He has the following seven treasures: 
snp3.7:8.6	the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure. 
snp3.7:8.7	He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. 
snp3.7:8.8	After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword. 
snp3.7:8.9	But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world. 
snp3.7:8.10	“But Keṇiya, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?” 
snp3.7:9.1	When he said this, Keṇiya pointed with his right arm and said, 
snp3.7:9.2	“There, Mister Sela, at that line of blue forest.” 
snp3.7:9.3	Then Sela, together with his students, approached the Buddha. 
snp3.7:9.4	He said to his students, 
snp3.7:9.5	“Come quietly, gentlemen, tread gently. 
snp3.7:9.6	For the Buddhas are intimidating, like a lion living alone. 
snp3.7:9.7	When I’m consulting with the ascetic Gotama, don’t interrupt. 
snp3.7:9.8	Wait until I’ve finished speaking.” 
snp3.7:10.1	Then Sela went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 
snp3.7:10.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. 
snp3.7:10.3	and scrutinized the Buddha’s body for the thirty-two marks of a great man. 
snp3.7:10.4	He saw all of them except for two, 
snp3.7:10.5	which he has doubts about: 
snp3.7:10.6	whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue. 
snp3.7:11.1	Then it occurred to the Buddha, 
snp3.7:11.2	“Sela sees all the marks except for two, 
snp3.7:11.3	which he has doubts about: 
snp3.7:11.4	whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.” 
snp3.7:11.5	The Buddha used his psychic power to will that Sela would see his private parts covered in a foreskin. 
snp3.7:11.6	And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue. 
snp3.7:12.1	Then Sela thought, 
snp3.7:12.2	“The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks completely, lacking none. 
snp3.7:12.3	But I don’t know whether or not he is an awakened one. 
snp3.7:12.4	I have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior, the teachers of teachers, said, 
snp3.7:12.5	‘Those who are perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas reveal themselves when praised.’ 
snp3.7:12.6	Why don’t I extoll him in his presence with fitting verses?” 
snp3.7:12.7	Then Sela extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses: 
snp3.7:13.1	“O Blessed One, your body’s perfect,
snp3.7:13.2	you’re radiant, handsome, lovely to behold;
snp3.7:13.3	golden colored,
snp3.7:13.4	with teeth so white; you’re strong.
snp3.7:14.1	The characteristics
snp3.7:14.2	of a handsome man,
snp3.7:14.3	the marks of a great man,
snp3.7:14.4	are all found on your body.
snp3.7:15.1	Your eyes are clear, your face is fair,
snp3.7:15.2	you’re formidable, upright, majestic.
snp3.7:15.3	In the midst of the Saṅgha of ascetics,
snp3.7:15.4	you shine like the sun.
snp3.7:16.1	You’re a mendicant fine to see, 
snp3.7:16.2	with skin of golden sheen.
snp3.7:16.3	But with such excellent appearance,
snp3.7:16.4	what do you want with the ascetic life?
snp3.7:17.1	You’re fit to be a king,
snp3.7:17.2	a wheel-turning monarch, chief of charioteers,
snp3.7:17.3	victorious in the four directions,
snp3.7:17.4	lord of all India.
snp3.7:18.1	Aristocrats, nobles, and kings 
snp3.7:18.2	ought follow your rule. 
snp3.7:18.3	Gotama, you should reign
snp3.7:18.4	as king of kings, lord of men!”
snp3.7:19.1	“I am a king, Sela”,
snp3.7:19.2	said the Buddha,
snp3.7:19.3	“the supreme king of the teaching.
snp3.7:19.4	By the teaching I roll forth the wheel
snp3.7:19.5	which cannot be rolled back.”
snp3.7:20.1	“You claim to be awakened,”
snp3.7:20.2	said Sela the brahmin,
snp3.7:20.3	“the supreme king of the teaching.
snp3.7:20.4	‘I roll forth the teaching’:
snp3.7:20.5	so you say, Gotama. 
snp3.7:21.1	Then who is your general,
snp3.7:21.2	the disciple who follows the Teacher’s way?
snp3.7:21.3	Who keeps rolling the wheel 
snp3.7:21.4	of the teaching you rolled forth?”
snp3.7:22.1	“By me the wheel was rolled forth,”
snp3.7:22.2	said the Buddha,
snp3.7:22.3	“the supreme wheel of the teaching.
snp3.7:22.4	Sāriputta, taking after the Realized One,
snp3.7:22.5	keeps it rolling on.
snp3.7:23.1	I have known what should be known, 
snp3.7:23.2	and developed what should be developed, 
snp3.7:23.3	and given up what should be given up: 
snp3.7:23.4	and so, brahmin, I am a Buddha. 
snp3.7:24.1	Dispel your doubt in me—
snp3.7:24.2	make up your mind, brahmin!
snp3.7:24.3	The sight of a Buddha
snp3.7:24.4	is hard to find again.
snp3.7:25.1	I am a Buddha, brahmin,
snp3.7:25.2	the supreme surgeon,
snp3.7:25.3	one of those whose appearance in the world 
snp3.7:25.4	is hard to find again.
snp3.7:26.1	Holy, unequaled,
snp3.7:26.2	crusher of Māra’s army;
snp3.7:26.3	having subdued all my opponents,
snp3.7:26.4	I rejoice, fearing nothing from any quarter.”
snp3.7:27.1	“Pay heed, sirs, to what 
snp3.7:27.2	is spoken by the seer.
snp3.7:27.3	The surgeon, the great hero,
snp3.7:27.4	roars like a lion in the jungle.
snp3.7:28.1	Holy, unequaled,
snp3.7:28.2	crusher of Māra’s army;
snp3.7:28.3	who would not be inspired by him,
snp3.7:28.4	even one whose nature is dark?
snp3.7:29.1	Those who wish may follow me;
snp3.7:29.2	those who don’t may go.
snp3.7:29.3	Right here, I’ll go forth in his presence,
snp3.7:29.4	the one of such splendid wisdom.”
snp3.7:30.1	“Sir, if you like
snp3.7:30.2	in the teaching of the Buddha,
snp3.7:30.3	we’ll also go forth in his presence,
snp3.7:30.4	the one of such splendid wisdom.”
snp3.7:31.1	“These three hundred brahmins
snp3.7:31.2	with joined palms held up, ask:
snp3.7:31.3	‘May we lead the spiritual life
snp3.7:31.4	in your presence, Blessed One?’” 
snp3.7:32.1	“The spiritual life is well explained,”
snp3.7:32.2	said the Buddha,
snp3.7:32.3	“visible in this very life, immediately effective.
snp3.7:32.4	Here the going forth isn’t in vain
snp3.7:32.5	for one who trains with diligence.” 
snp3.7:33.1	And the brahmin Sela together with his assembly received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. 
snp3.7:33.2	And when the night had passed Keṇiya had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, 
snp3.7:33.3	“Itʼs time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.” 
snp3.7:33.4	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Keṇiya’s hermitage, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. 
snp3.7:34.1	Then Keṇiya served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods. 
snp3.7:34.2	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Keṇiya took a low seat and sat to one side. 
snp3.7:34.3	The Buddha expressed his appreciation with these verses: 
snp3.7:35.1	“The foremost of sacrifices is offering to the sacred flame; 
snp3.7:35.2	the Gāyatrī Mantra is the foremost of poetic meters; 
snp3.7:35.3	of humans, the king is the foremost; 
snp3.7:35.4	the ocean’s the foremost of rivers; 
snp3.7:36.1	the foremost of stars is the moon; 
snp3.7:36.2	the sun is the foremost of lights; 
snp3.7:36.3	for those who sacrifice seeking merit, 
snp3.7:36.4	the Saṅgha is the foremost.” 
snp3.7:37.1	When the Buddha had expressed his appreciation to Keṇiya the matted-hair ascetic with these verses, he got up from his seat and left. 
snp3.7:37.2	Then Venerable Sela and his assembly, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. They lived having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 
snp3.7:37.3	And Venerable Sela together with his assembly became perfected. 
snp3.7:38.1	Then Sela with his assembly went to see the Buddha. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: 
snp3.7:39.1	“This is the eighth day since
snp3.7:39.2	we went for refuge, O seer. 
snp3.7:39.3	In these seven days, Blessed One,
snp3.7:39.4	we’ve become tamed in your teaching.
snp3.7:40.1	You are the Buddha, you are the Teacher,
snp3.7:40.2	you are the sage who has overcome Māra;
snp3.7:40.3	you have cut off the underlying tendencies,
snp3.7:40.4	you’ve crossed over, and you bring humanity across.
snp3.7:41.1	You have transcended attachments,
snp3.7:41.2	your defilements are shattered;
snp3.7:41.3	you are a lion, free of grasping,
snp3.7:41.4	with fear and dread given up.
snp3.7:42.1	These three hundred mendicants
snp3.7:42.2	stand with joined palms raised.
snp3.7:42.3	Stretch out your feet, great hero:
snp3.7:42.4	let these giants bow to the Teacher.”
snp3.8:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp3.8:0.2	The Dart
snp3.8:1.1	Unforeseen and unknown
snp3.8:1.2	is the extent of this mortal life—
snp3.8:1.3	hard and short
snp3.8:1.4	and bound to pain.
snp3.8:2.1	There is no way that
snp3.8:2.2	those born will not die. 
snp3.8:2.3	On reaching old age death follows:
snp3.8:2.4	such is the nature of living creatures.
snp3.8:3.1	As ripe fruit
snp3.8:3.2	are always in danger of falling,
snp3.8:3.3	so mortals once born
snp3.8:3.4	are always in danger of death.
snp3.8:4.1	As clay pots 
snp3.8:4.2	made by a potter
snp3.8:4.3	all end up being broken,
snp3.8:4.4	so is the life of mortals.
snp3.8:5.1	Young and old,
snp3.8:5.2	foolish and wise—
snp3.8:5.3	all go under the sway of death;
snp3.8:5.4	all are destined to die.
snp3.8:6.1	When those overcome by death
snp3.8:6.2	leave this world for the next,
snp3.8:6.3	a father cannot protect his son,
snp3.8:6.4	nor relatives their kin.
snp3.8:7.1	See how, while relatives look on,
snp3.8:7.2	wailing profusely,
snp3.8:7.3	mortals are led away one by one,
snp3.8:7.4	like a cow to the slaughter.
snp3.8:8.1	And so the world is stricken
snp3.8:8.2	by old age and by death.
snp3.8:8.3	That is why the wise do not grieve,
snp3.8:8.4	for they understand the way of the world. 
snp3.8:9.1	For one whose path you do not know—
snp3.8:9.2	not whence they came nor where they went—
snp3.8:9.3	you lament in vain,
snp3.8:9.4	seeing neither end.
snp3.8:10.1	If a bewildered person,
snp3.8:10.2	lamenting and self-harming,
snp3.8:10.3	could extract any good from that,
snp3.8:10.4	then those who see clearly would do the same.
snp3.8:11.1	For not by weeping and wailing
snp3.8:11.2	will you find peace of heart.
snp3.8:11.3	It just gives rise to more suffering,
snp3.8:11.4	and distresses your body.
snp3.8:12.1	Growing thin and pale,
snp3.8:12.2	you hurt yourself.
snp3.8:12.3	It does nothing to help the dead:
snp3.8:12.4	your lamentation is in vain.
snp3.8:13.1	Unless a person gives up grief,
snp3.8:13.2	they fall into suffering all the more.
snp3.8:13.3	Bewailing those whose time has come,
snp3.8:13.4	you fall under the sway of grief.
snp3.8:14.1	See, too, other folk departing
snp3.8:14.2	to fare after their deeds;
snp3.8:14.3	fallen under the sway of death,
snp3.8:14.4	beings flounder while still here.
snp3.8:15.1	For whatever you imagine it is, 
snp3.8:15.2	it turns out to be something else.
snp3.8:15.3	Such is separation:
snp3.8:15.4	see the way of the world!
snp3.8:16.1	Even if a human lives 
snp3.8:16.2	a hundred years or more,
snp3.8:16.3	they are parted from their family circle,
snp3.8:16.4	they leave this life behind.
snp3.8:17.1	Therefore, having learned from the Perfected One,
snp3.8:17.2	dispel lamentation.
snp3.8:17.3	Seeing the dead and departed, think:
snp3.8:17.4	“I cannot escape this.”
snp3.8:18.1	 As one would extinguish
snp3.8:18.2	a blazing refuge with water,
snp3.8:18.3	so too a sage—a wise,
snp3.8:18.4	astute, and skilled person—
snp3.8:18.5	would swiftly blow away grief that comes up,
snp3.8:18.6	like the wind a tuft of cotton.
snp3.8:19.1	One who seeks their own happiness
snp3.8:19.2	would pluck out the dart from themselves—
snp3.8:19.3	the wailing and moaning,
snp3.8:19.4	and sadness inside.
snp3.8:20.1	With dart plucked out, unattached,
snp3.8:20.2	having found peace of mind,
snp3.8:20.3	overcoming all sorrow,
snp3.8:20.4	one is sorrowless and extinguished.”
snp3.9:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp3.9:0.2	With Vāseṭṭha 
snp3.9:1.1	So I have heard. 
snp3.9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. 
snp3.9:1.3	Now at that time several very well-known well-to-do brahmins were residing in Icchānaṅgala. They included 
snp3.9:1.4	the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jāṇussoṇi, Todeyya, and others. 
snp3.9:1.5	Then as the brahmin students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began to discuss the question:
snp3.9:1.6	“How do you become a brahmin?”
snp3.9:2.1	Bhāradvāja said this: 
snp3.9:2.2	“When you’re well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation—
snp3.9:2.3	then you’re a brahmin.” 
snp3.9:3.1	Vāseṭṭha said this: 
snp3.9:3.2	“When you’re ethical and accomplished in doing your duties—
snp3.9:3.3	then you’re a brahmin.” 
snp3.9:3.4	But neither was able to persuade the other. 
snp3.9:4.1	So Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja, 
snp3.9:4.2	“Master Bhāradvāja, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. 
snp3.9:4.3	He has this good reputation: 
snp3.9:4.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 
snp3.9:4.5	Come, let’s go to see him and ask him about this matter. 
snp3.9:4.6	As he answers, so we’ll remember it.” 
snp3.9:4.7	“Yes, sir,” replied Bhāradvāja. 
snp3.9:5.1	So they went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. 
snp3.9:5.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side, 
snp3.9:5.3	and Vāseṭṭha addressed the Buddha in verse: 
snp3.9:6.1	“We’re both authorized masters 
snp3.9:6.2	of the three Vedas. 
snp3.9:6.3	I’m a student of Pokkharasāti, 
snp3.9:6.4	and he of Tārukkha. 
snp3.9:7.1	We’re fully qualified 
snp3.9:7.2	in all the Vedic experts teach. 
snp3.9:7.3	As philologists and grammarians, 
snp3.9:7.4	we match our teachers in recitation. 
snp3.9:8.1	We have a dispute 
snp3.9:8.2	regarding the question of ancestry. 
snp3.9:8.3	For Bhāradvāja says that 
snp3.9:8.4	one is a brahmin due to birth, 
snp3.9:8.5	but I declare it’s because of one’s actions. 
snp3.9:8.6	Oh seer, know this as our debate. 
snp3.9:9.1	Since neither of us was able 
snp3.9:9.2	to convince the other, 
snp3.9:9.3	we’ve come to ask you, sir, 
snp3.9:9.4	renowned as the awakened one. 
snp3.9:10.1	As people honor with joined palms 
snp3.9:10.2	the moon on the cusp of waxing, 
snp3.9:10.3	bowing, they revere 
snp3.9:10.4	Gotama in the world. 
snp3.9:11.1	We ask this of Gotama, 
snp3.9:11.2	the eye arisen in the world: 
snp3.9:11.3	is one a brahmin due to birth, 
snp3.9:11.4	or else because of actions? 
snp3.9:11.5	We don’t know, please tell us, 
snp3.9:11.6	so that we can recognize a brahmin.” 
snp3.9:12.1	“I shall explain to you,” 
snp3.9:12.2	said the Buddha, 
snp3.9:12.3	“accurately and in sequence, 
snp3.9:12.4	the taxonomy of living creatures, 
snp3.9:12.5	for species are indeed diverse. 
snp3.9:13.1	Know the grass and trees, 
snp3.9:13.2	though they lack self-awareness. 
snp3.9:13.3	They’re defined by birth, 
snp3.9:13.4	for species are indeed diverse. 
snp3.9:14.1	Next there are bugs and moths, 
snp3.9:14.2	and so on, to ants and termites. 
snp3.9:14.3	They’re defined by birth, 
snp3.9:14.4	for species are indeed diverse. 
snp3.9:15.1	Know the quadrupeds, too, 
snp3.9:15.2	both small and large. 
snp3.9:15.3	They’re defined by birth, 
snp3.9:15.4	for species are indeed diverse. 
snp3.9:16.1	Know, too, the long-backed snakes, 
snp3.9:16.2	crawling on their bellies. 
snp3.9:16.3	They’re defined by birth, 
snp3.9:16.4	for species are indeed diverse. 
snp3.9:17.1	Next know the fish, 
snp3.9:17.2	whose habitat is the water. 
snp3.9:17.3	They’re defined by birth, 
snp3.9:17.4	for species are indeed diverse. 
snp3.9:18.1	Next know the birds, 
snp3.9:18.2	flying with wings as chariots. 
snp3.9:18.3	They’re defined by birth, 
snp3.9:18.4	for species are indeed diverse. 
snp3.9:19.1	While the differences between these species 
snp3.9:19.2	are defined by birth, 
snp3.9:19.3	the differences between humans 
snp3.9:19.4	are not defined by birth. 
snp3.9:20.1	Not by hair nor by head, 
snp3.9:20.2	not by ear nor by eye, 
snp3.9:20.3	not by mouth nor by nose, 
snp3.9:20.4	not by lips nor by eyebrow, 
snp3.9:21.1	not by shoulder nor by neck, 
snp3.9:21.2	not by belly nor by back, 
snp3.9:21.3	not by buttocks nor by breast, 
snp3.9:21.4	not by groin nor by genitals, 
snp3.9:22.1	not by hands nor by feet, 
snp3.9:22.2	not by fingers nor by nails, 
snp3.9:22.3	not by knees nor by thighs, 
snp3.9:22.4	not by color nor by voice: 
snp3.9:22.5	none of these are defined by birth 
snp3.9:22.6	as it is for other species. 
snp3.9:23.1	In individual human bodies 
snp3.9:23.2	you can’t find such distinctions. 
snp3.9:23.3	The distinctions among humans 
snp3.9:23.4	are spoken of by convention. 
snp3.9:24.1	Anyone among humans 
snp3.9:24.2	who lives off keeping cattle: 
snp3.9:24.3	know them, Vāseṭṭha, 
snp3.9:24.4	as a farmer, not a brahmin. 
snp3.9:25.1	Anyone among humans 
snp3.9:25.2	who lives off various professions: 
snp3.9:25.3	know them, Vāseṭṭha, 
snp3.9:25.4	as a professional, not a brahmin. 
snp3.9:26.1	Anyone among humans 
snp3.9:26.2	who lives off trade: 
snp3.9:26.3	know them, Vāseṭṭha, 
snp3.9:26.4	as a trader, not a brahmin. 
snp3.9:27.1	Anyone among humans 
snp3.9:27.2	who lives off serving others: 
snp3.9:27.3	know them, Vāseṭṭha, 
snp3.9:27.4	as an employee, not a brahmin. 
snp3.9:28.1	Anyone among humans 
snp3.9:28.2	who lives off stealing: 
snp3.9:28.3	know them, Vāseṭṭha, 
snp3.9:28.4	as a bandit, not a brahmin. 
snp3.9:29.1	Anyone among humans 
snp3.9:29.2	who lives off archery: 
snp3.9:29.3	know them, Vāseṭṭha, 
snp3.9:29.4	as a soldier, not a brahmin. 
snp3.9:30.1	Anyone among humans 
snp3.9:30.2	who lives off priesthood: 
snp3.9:30.3	know them, Vāseṭṭha, 
snp3.9:30.4	as a sacrificer, not a brahmin. 
snp3.9:31.1	Anyone among humans 
snp3.9:31.2	who taxes village and nation, 
snp3.9:31.3	know them, Vāseṭṭha, 
snp3.9:31.4	as a ruler, not a brahmin. 
snp3.9:32.1	I don’t call someone a brahmin 
snp3.9:32.2	after the mother or womb they came from. 
snp3.9:32.3	If they still have attachments, 
snp3.9:32.4	they’re just someone who says ‘sir’. 
snp3.9:32.5	Having nothing, taking nothing: 
snp3.9:32.6	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
snp3.9:33.1	Having cut off all fetters 
snp3.9:33.2	they have no anxiety;
snp3.9:33.3	they’ve got over clinging, and are detached: 
snp3.9:33.4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
snp3.9:34.1	They’ve cut the strap and harness, 
snp3.9:34.2	the reins and bridle too;
snp3.9:34.3	with cross-bar lifted, they’re awakened: 
snp3.9:34.4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
snp3.9:35.1	Abuse, killing, caging: 
snp3.9:35.2	they endure these without anger. 
snp3.9:35.3	Patience is their powerful army: 
snp3.9:35.4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
snp3.9:36.1	Not irritable or stuck up, 
snp3.9:36.2	dutiful in precepts and observances, 
snp3.9:36.3	tamed, bearing their final body: 
snp3.9:36.4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
snp3.9:37.1	Like water from a lotus leaf,
snp3.9:37.2	like a mustard seed off a pin-point,
snp3.9:37.3	sensual pleasures slip off them: 
snp3.9:37.4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
snp3.9:38.1	They understand for themselves 
snp3.9:38.2	the end of suffering in this life;
snp3.9:38.3	with burden put down, detached: 
snp3.9:38.4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
snp3.9:39.1	Deep in wisdom, intelligent, 
snp3.9:39.2	expert in the variety of paths; 
snp3.9:39.3	arrived at the highest goal: 
snp3.9:39.4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
snp3.9:40.1	Socializing with neither 
snp3.9:40.2	householders nor the homeless;
snp3.9:40.3	a migrant with no shelter, few in wishes: 
snp3.9:40.4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
snp3.9:41.1	They’ve laid aside violence 
snp3.9:41.2	against creatures firm and frail; 
snp3.9:41.3	not killing or making others kill: 
snp3.9:41.4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
snp3.9:42.1	Not fighting among those who fight, 
snp3.9:42.2	extinguished among those who are armed,
snp3.9:42.3	not taking among those who take: 
snp3.9:42.4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
snp3.9:43.1	They’ve discarded greed and hate, 
snp3.9:43.2	along with conceit and contempt,
snp3.9:43.3	like a mustard seed off the point of a pin: 
snp3.9:43.4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
snp3.9:44.1	The words they utter 
snp3.9:44.2	are sweet, informative, and true, 
snp3.9:44.3	and don’t offend anyone: 
snp3.9:44.4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
snp3.9:45.1	They don’t steal anything in the world, 
snp3.9:45.2	long or short, 
snp3.9:45.3	fine or coarse, beautiful or ugly: 
snp3.9:45.4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
snp3.9:46.1	They have no hope 
snp3.9:46.2	in this world and the next. 
snp3.9:46.3	with no need for hope, detached: 
snp3.9:46.4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
snp3.9:47.1	They have no clinging, 
snp3.9:47.2	knowledge has freed them of indecision, 
snp3.9:47.3	they’ve plunged right into the deathless: 
snp3.9:47.4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
snp3.9:48.1	They’ve escaped clinging 
snp3.9:48.2	to both good and bad deeds; 
snp3.9:48.3	sorrowless, stainless, pure: 
snp3.9:48.4	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
snp3.9:49.1	Pure as the spotless moon, 
snp3.9:49.2	clear and undisturbed, 
snp3.9:49.3	they’ve ended desire to be reborn: 
snp3.9:49.4	that’s who I call a brahmin.

snp3.9:50.2	of delusion, transmigration.
snp3.9:50.3	They’ve crossed over to the far shore,

snp3.9:50.5	They’re extinguished by not grasping: 
snp3.9:50.6	that’s who I call a brahmin. 
snp3.9:51.1	They’ve given up sensual stimulations, 
snp3.9:51.2	and have gone forth from lay life;

snp3.9:55.1	They know the passing away 
snp3.9:55.2	and rebirth of all beings;

snp3.9:61.1	For a long time this misconception 
snp3.9:61.2	has prejudiced those who don’t understand. 
snp3.9:61.3	Ignorant, they declare 
snp3.9:61.4	that one is a brahmin by birth. 
snp3.9:62.1	You’re not a brahmin by birth,

snp3.9:62.3	You’re a brahmin by your deeds, 
snp3.9:62.4	and by deeds a non-brahmin. 
snp3.9:63.1	You’re a farmer by your deeds, 
snp3.9:63.2	by deeds you’re a professional; 
snp3.9:63.3	you’re a trader by your deeds, 
snp3.9:63.4	by deeds are you an employee; 
snp3.9:64.1	you’re a bandit by your deeds,

snp4.11:1.3	What of conceit and arrogance, and slander too—
snp4.11:1.4	tell me please, where do they come from?”
snp4.11:2.1	“Quarrels and disputes come from what we hold dear,
snp4.11:2.2	as do lamentation and sorrow, stinginess,
snp4.11:2.3	conceit and arrogance.
snp4.11:2.4	Quarrels and disputes are linked to stinginess,
snp4.11:2.5	and when disputes have arisen there is slander.”
snp4.11:3.1	“So where do what we hold dear in the world spring from?
snp4.11:3.2	And the lusts that are loose in the world?
snp4.11:3.3	Where spring the hopes and aims
snp4.11:3.4	a man has for the next life?”
snp4.11:4.1	“What we hold dear in the world spring from desire,
snp4.11:4.2	as do the lusts that are loose in the world.
snp4.11:4.3	From there spring the hopes and aims

snp4.11:5.1	“So where does desire in the world spring from?
snp4.11:5.2	And judgments, too, where do they come from?
snp4.11:5.3	And anger, lies, and doubt,

snp4.11:6.1	“What they call pleasure and pain in the world—
snp4.11:6.2	based on that, desire comes about.
snp4.11:6.3	Seeing the appearance and disappearance of forms,
snp4.11:6.4	a person forms judgments in the world.
snp4.11:7.1	Anger, lies, and doubt—
snp4.11:7.2	these things are, too, when that pair is present.
snp4.11:7.3	One who has doubts should train in the path of knowledge;
snp4.11:7.4	it is from knowledge that the Ascetic speaks of these things.”
snp4.11:8.1	“Where do pleasure and pain spring from?
snp4.11:8.2	When what is absent do these things not occur?
snp4.11:8.3	And also, on the topic of appearance and disappearance—
snp4.11:8.4	tell me where they spring from.”
snp4.11:9.1	“Pleasure and pain spring from contact;
snp4.11:9.2	when contact is absent they do not occur.
snp4.11:9.3	And on the topic of appearance and disappearance—
snp4.11:9.4	I tell you they spring from there.”
snp4.11:10.1	“So where does contact in the world spring from?
snp4.11:10.2	And possessions, too, where do they come from?
snp4.11:10.3	When what is absent is there no possessiveness?
snp4.11:10.4	When what disappears do contacts not strike?”
snp4.11:11.1	“Name and form cause contact;
snp4.11:11.2	possessions spring from wishing;
snp4.11:11.3	when wishing is absent there is no possessiveness;
snp4.11:11.4	when form disappears, contacts don’t strike.”
snp4.11:12.1	“How to proceed so that form disappears?
snp4.11:12.2	And how do happiness and suffering disappear?
snp4.11:12.3	Tell me how they disappear;
snp4.11:12.4	I think we ought to know these things.”
snp4.11:13.1	“Without normal perception or distorted perception;
snp4.11:13.2	not lacking perception, nor perceiving what has disappeared.
snp4.11:13.3	That’s how to proceed so that form disappears:
snp4.11:13.4	for concepts of identity due to proliferation spring from perception.”
snp4.11:14.1	“Whatever I asked you have explained to me.
snp4.11:14.2	I ask you once more, please tell me this:
snp4.11:14.3	Do some astute folk here say that this is the extent

snp4.11:15.1	“Some astute folk do say that this is the highest extent
snp4.11:15.2	of purification of the spirit.
snp4.11:15.3	But some of them, claiming to be experts,
snp4.11:15.4	speak of a time when nothing remains.
snp4.11:16.1	Knowing that these states are dependent,

snp4.12:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp4.12:0.2	The Shorter Discourse on Arrayed For Battle
snp4.12:1.1	“Each maintaining their own view,
snp4.12:1.2	the experts disagree, arguing:
snp4.12:1.3	‘Whoever sees it this way has understood the teaching;
snp4.12:1.4	those who reject this are inadequate.’
snp4.12:2.1	So arguing, they quarrel,
snp4.12:2.2	saying, ‘The other is a fool, an amateur!’
snp4.12:2.3	Which one of these speaks true,
snp4.12:2.4	for they all claim to be an expert?”
snp4.12:3.1	“If not accepting another’s teaching
snp4.12:3.2	makes you a useless fool lacking wisdom,
snp4.12:3.3	then they’re all fools lacking wisdom,
snp4.12:3.4	for they all maintain their own view.
snp4.12:4.1	But if having your own view is what makes you pristine—
snp4.12:4.2	pure in wisdom, expert and intelligent—
snp4.12:4.3	then none of them lack wisdom,
snp4.12:4.4	for such is the view they have all embraced.
snp4.12:5.1	I do not say that it is correct
snp4.12:5.2	when they call each other fools.
snp4.12:5.3	Each has built up their own view to be the truth,
snp4.12:5.4	which is why they take the other as a fool.”
snp4.12:6.1	“What some say is true and correct,
snp4.12:6.2	others say is hollow and false.
snp4.12:6.3	So arguing, they quarrel;
snp4.12:6.4	why don’t ascetics say the same thing?”
snp4.12:7.1	“The truth is one, there is no second;
snp4.12:7.2	wise folk would not argue about this.
snp4.12:7.3	But those ascetics each boast of different truths;
snp4.12:7.4	that’s why they don’t say the same thing.”
snp4.12:8.1	“But why do they speak of different truths,
snp4.12:8.2	these proponents who claim to be experts?
snp4.12:8.3	Are there really so many different truths,
snp4.12:8.4	or do they just follow their own lines of reasoning?”
snp4.12:9.1	“No, there are not many different truths
snp4.12:9.2	that, apart from perception, are lasting in the world.
snp4.12:9.3	Having formed their reasoning regarding different views,
snp4.12:9.4	they say there are two things: true and false.
snp4.12:10.1	The seen, heard, or thought, or precepts or vows—
snp4.12:10.2	based on these they show disdain.
snp4.12:10.3	Standing in judgment, they scoff,
snp4.12:10.4	saying, ‘The other is a fool, an amateur!’
snp4.12:11.1	They take the other as a fool on the same grounds
snp4.12:11.2	that they speak of themselves as an expert.
snp4.12:11.3	Claiming to be an expert on their own authority,
snp4.12:11.4	they disdain the other while saying the same thing.
snp4.12:12.1	They are perfect, according to their own extreme view;
snp4.12:12.2	drunk on conceit, imagining themselves proficient.
snp4.12:12.3	They have anointed themselves in their own mind,
snp4.12:12.4	for such is the view they have embraced.
snp4.12:13.1	If the word of your opponent makes you deficient,
snp4.12:13.2	then they too are lacking wisdom.
snp4.12:13.3	But if on your own authority you’re a knowledge master, a wise person,
snp4.12:13.4	then there are no fools among the ascetics.
snp4.12:14.1	‘Those who proclaim a teaching other than this
snp4.12:14.2	have fallen short of purity, and are inadequate’:
snp4.12:14.3	so say each one of the sectarians,
snp4.12:14.4	for they are deeply attached to their own view.
snp4.12:15.1	‘Here alone is purity,’ they say,
snp4.12:15.2	denying that there is purification in other teachings.
snp4.12:15.3	Thus each one of the sectarians, being dogmatic,
snp4.12:15.4	speaks forcefully within the context of their own journey.
snp4.12:16.1	But in that case, so long as they are speaking forcefully of their own journey,
snp4.12:16.2	how can they take the other as a fool?
snp4.12:16.3	They are the ones who provoke conflict
snp4.12:16.4	when they call the other a fool with an impure teaching.
snp4.12:17.1	Standing in judgment, measuring by their own standard,
snp4.12:17.2	they keep getting into disputes with the world.
snp4.12:17.3	But a person who has given up all judgments
snp4.12:17.4	creates no conflict in the world.”

snp4.13:1.1	“Regarding those who maintain their own view,
snp4.13:1.2	arguing that, ‘This is the only truth’:
snp4.13:1.3	are all of them subject only to criticism,
snp4.13:1.4	or do some also win praise for that?”
snp4.13:2.1	“That is a small thing, insufficient for peace,
snp4.13:2.2	these two fruits of conflict, I say.
snp4.13:2.3	Seeing this, one ought not get into arguments,
snp4.13:2.4	looking for sanctuary in the land of no conflict.
snp4.13:3.1	One who knows does not get involved 
snp4.13:3.2	with any of the many different convictions.
snp4.13:3.3	Why would the uninvolved get involved,
snp4.13:3.4	since they do not believe based on the seen or the heard?
snp4.13:4.1	Those who champion ethics speak of purity through self-control;
snp4.13:4.2	having undertaken a vow, they stick to it:
snp4.13:4.3	‘Let us train right here, then we will be pure.’
snp4.13:4.4	Claiming to be experts, they are led on to future lives.
snp4.13:5.1	If they fall away from their precepts and vows,
snp4.13:5.2	they tremble, having failed in their task.
snp4.13:5.3	They pray and long for purity,
snp4.13:5.4	like one who has lost their caravan while journeying far from home.
snp4.13:6.1	But having given up all precepts and vows,
snp4.13:6.2	and these deeds blameworthy or blameless;
snp4.13:6.3	not longing for ‘purity’ or ‘impurity’,
snp4.13:6.4	live detached, fostering peace.
snp4.13:7.1	Relying on mortification in disgust at sin,
snp4.13:7.2	or else on what is seen, heard, or thought,
snp4.13:7.3	they moan that purification comes through heading upstream,
snp4.13:7.4	not rid of craving for life after life.
snp4.13:8.1	For one who longs there are prayers,
snp4.13:8.2	and trembling too over ideas they have formed.
snp4.13:8.3	But one here for whom there is no passing away or reappearing:
snp4.13:8.4	why would they tremble? For what would they pray?”
snp4.13:9.1	“The very same teaching that some say is ‘ultimate’,
snp4.13:9.2	others say is inferior.
snp4.13:9.3	Which of these doctrines is true,
snp4.13:9.4	for they all claim to be an expert?”
snp4.13:10.1	“They say their own teaching is perfect,
snp4.13:10.2	while the teaching of others is inferior.
snp4.13:10.3	So arguing, they quarrel,
snp4.13:10.4	each saying their own convictions are the truth.
snp4.13:11.1	If you became inferior because someone else disparaged you,
snp4.13:11.2	no-one in any teaching would be distinguished.
snp4.13:11.3	For each of them says the other’s teaching is lacking,
snp4.13:11.4	while forcefully advocating their own.
snp4.13:12.1	But if they honor their own teachings
snp4.13:12.2	just as they praise their own journeys,
snp4.13:12.3	then all doctrines would be equally valid,
snp4.13:12.4	and purity for them would be an individual matter. 
snp4.13:13.1	After judging among the teachings, a brahmin has adopted nothing
snp4.13:13.2	that requires interpretation by another.
snp4.13:13.3	That’s why they’ve gotten over disputes,
snp4.13:13.4	for they see no other doctrine as best.
snp4.13:14.1	Saying, ‘I know, I see, that’s how it is’,
snp4.13:14.2	some believe that purity comes from view.
snp4.13:14.3	But if they’ve really seen, what use is that view to them?
snp4.13:14.4	Overlooking what matters, they say purity comes from another.
snp4.13:15.1	When a person sees, they see name and form,
snp4.13:15.2	and having seen, they will know just these things.
snp4.13:15.3	Gladly let them see much or little,
snp4.13:15.4	for experts say this is no way to purity.
snp4.13:16.1	It’s not easy to educate someone who is dogmatic,
snp4.13:16.2	promoting a view they have formulated.
snp4.13:16.3	Speaking of the beauty in that which they depend on,
snp4.13:16.4	they talk of purity in accord with what they saw there.
snp4.13:17.1	The brahmin does not get involved with formulating and calculating;
snp4.13:17.2	they’re not followers of views, nor kinsmen of notions.
snp4.13:17.3	Having understood the many different convictions,
snp4.13:17.4	they look on when others grasp.
snp4.13:18.1	Having untied the knots here in the world,
snp4.13:18.2	the sage takes no side among factions.
snp4.13:18.3	Peaceful among the peaceless, equanimous,
snp4.13:18.4	they don’t grasp when others grasp.
snp4.13:19.1	Having given up former defilements, and not making new ones,
snp4.13:19.2	not swayed by preference, nor a proponent of dogma,
snp4.13:19.3	that wise one is released from views,
snp4.13:19.4	not clinging to the world, nor reproaching themselves.
snp4.13:20.1	They are remote from all things
snp4.13:20.2	seen, heard, or thought.
snp4.13:20.3	With burden put down, the sage is released:

snp4.14:1.3	How, having seen, is a mendicant quenched, 
snp4.14:1.4	not grasping anything in this world?”
snp4.14:2.1	“They would cut off the idea, ‘I am the thinker,”
snp4.14:2.2	said the Buddha,
snp4.14:2.3	“which is the root of all concepts of identity due to proliferation.
snp4.14:2.4	Ever mindful, they would train to remove
snp4.14:2.5	any internal cravings.
snp4.14:3.1	Regardless of what things they know,
snp4.14:3.2	whether internal or external,
snp4.14:3.3	they wouldn’t be proud because of that,
snp4.14:3.4	for that is not extinguishment, say the good.
snp4.14:4.1	They wouldn’t let that make them conceited, 
snp4.14:4.2	thinking themselves better or worse or alike.
snp4.14:4.3	When questioned in many ways,
snp4.14:4.4	they wouldn’t keep justifying themselves.
snp4.14:5.1	A mendicant would find peace inside themselves,
snp4.14:5.2	and not seek peace from another.
snp4.14:5.3	For one at peace inside themselves,
snp4.14:5.4	there’s no picking up, whence putting down?
snp4.14:6.1	Just as, in the mid-ocean deeps 
snp4.14:6.2	no waves arise, it stays still;
snp4.14:6.3	so too one unstirred is still—
snp4.14:6.4	a mendicant would nurse no pride at all.”
snp4.14:7.1	“He whose eyes are open has explained
snp4.14:7.2	the truth he witnessed, where adversities are removed.
snp4.14:7.3	Please now speak of the practice, sir,
snp4.14:7.4	the monastic code and immersion in samādhi.”
snp4.14:8.1	“With eyes not wanton,
snp4.14:8.2	they’d turn their ears from village gossip.
snp4.14:8.3	They wouldn’t be greedy for flavors,
snp4.14:8.4	nor possessive about anything in the world.
snp4.14:9.1	Though struck by contacts,
snp4.14:9.2	a mendicant would not lament at all.
snp4.14:9.3	They wouldn’t pray for another life,
snp4.14:9.4	nor tremble in the face of dangers.
snp4.14:10.1	When they receive food and drink,
snp4.14:10.2	edibles and clothes,
snp4.14:10.3	they wouldn’t store them up,
snp4.14:10.4	nor worry about not getting them.
snp4.14:11.1	Meditative, not footloose,
snp4.14:11.2	they’d avoid remorse and not be negligent.
snp4.14:11.3	Then a mendicant would stay 
snp4.14:11.4	in quiet places to sit and rest.
snp4.14:12.1	They wouldn’t take much sleep,
snp4.14:12.2	but, being keen, would apply themselves to wakefulness.
snp4.14:12.3	They’d give up sloth, illusion, mirth, and play,
snp4.14:12.4	and sex and ornamentation.
snp4.14:13.1	They wouldn’t cast Artharvaṇa spells, interpret dreams
snp4.14:13.2	or omens, or practice astrology.
snp4.14:13.3	My followers would not decipher animal cries, practice healing,
snp4.14:13.4	or cast pregnancy spells.
snp4.14:14.1	Not shaken by criticism,
snp4.14:14.2	a mendicant would not pride themselves when praised.
snp4.14:14.3	They’d reject greed and stinginess,
snp4.14:14.4	anger, and slander.
snp4.14:15.1	They’d not stand for buying and selling;
snp4.14:15.2	a mendicant would not speak ill at all.
snp4.14:15.3	They wouldn’t linger in the village,
snp4.14:15.4	nor cajole people from desire for profit.
snp4.14:16.1	A mendicant would be no boaster,
snp4.14:16.2	nor would they speak suggestively.
snp4.14:16.3	They wouldn’t train in impudence,
snp4.14:16.4	nor speak argumentatively.
snp4.14:17.1	They wouldn’t be led into lying,
snp4.14:17.2	nor be deliberately devious.
snp4.14:17.3	And they’d never look down on another
snp4.14:17.4	because of livelihood, wisdom, or precepts and vows.
snp4.14:18.1	Though provoked from hearing much talk
snp4.14:18.2	from ascetics saying all different things,
snp4.14:18.3	they wouldn’t react harshly,
snp4.14:18.4	for the virtuous do not retaliate.
snp4.14:19.1	Having understood this teaching,
snp4.14:19.2	inquiring, a mendicant would always train mindfully.
snp4.14:19.3	Knowing extinguishment as peace,
snp4.14:19.4	they’d not be negligent in Gotama’s bidding.
snp4.14:20.1	For he is the undefeated, the champion,
snp4.14:20.2	seer of the truth as witness, not by hearsay—
snp4.14:20.3	that’s why, being diligent, they would always respectfully train 
snp4.14:20.4	in the Buddha’s teaching.”
snp4.15:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp4.15:0.2	Taking Up Arms
snp4.15:1.1	Peril stems from those who take up arms—
snp4.15:1.2	just look at people in conflict!
snp4.15:1.3	I shall extol how I came to be
snp4.15:1.4	stirred with a sense of urgency.
snp4.15:2.1	I saw this population flounder,
snp4.15:2.2	like a fish in a little puddle.
snp4.15:2.3	Seeing them fight each other,
snp4.15:2.4	fear came upon me.
snp4.15:3.1	The world around was hollow,
snp4.15:3.2	all directions were in turmoil.
snp4.15:3.3	Wanting a home for myself,
snp4.15:3.4	I saw nowhere unsettled.
snp4.15:4.1	But even in their settlement they fight—
snp4.15:4.2	seeing that, I grew uneasy.
snp4.15:4.3	Then I saw a dart there,
snp4.15:4.4	so hard to see, stuck in the heart.
snp4.15:5.1	When struck by that dart,
snp4.15:5.2	you run about in all directions.
snp4.15:5.3	But when that same dart has been plucked out,
snp4.15:5.4	you neither run about nor sink down.
snp4.15:6.1	(On that topic, the trainings are recited.)
snp4.15:6.2	Whatever attachments there are in the world,
snp4.15:6.3	don’t pursue them.
snp4.15:6.4	Having pierced through sensual pleasures in every way,
snp4.15:6.5	train yourself for quenching.
snp4.15:7.1	Be truthful, not rude,
snp4.15:7.2	free of deceit, and rid of slander;
snp4.15:7.3	without anger, a sage would cross over
snp4.15:7.4	the evils of greed and avarice.
snp4.15:8.1	Prevail over sleepiness, sloth, and drowsiness, 
snp4.15:8.2	don’t abide in negligence,
snp4.15:8.3	A person intent on quenching
snp4.15:8.4	would not stand for arrogance.
snp4.15:9.1	Don’t be led into lying,
snp4.15:9.2	or get caught up in fondness for form.
snp4.15:9.3	Completely understand conceit,
snp4.15:9.4	and desist from hasty conduct.
snp4.15:10.1	Don’t relish the old,
snp4.15:10.2	or welcome the new.
snp4.15:10.3	Don’t grieve for what is running out,
snp4.15:10.4	or get attached to things that pull you in.
snp4.15:11.1	Greed, I say, is the great flood,
snp4.15:11.2	and longing is the current—
snp4.15:11.3	the basis, the compulsion,
snp4.15:11.4	the swamp of sensuality so hard to get past.
snp4.15:12.1	The sage never strays from the truth;
snp4.15:12.2	the brahman stands firm on the shore.
snp4.15:12.3	Having given up everything,
snp4.15:12.4	they are said to be at peace.
snp4.15:13.1	They have truly known, they’re a knowledge master,
snp4.15:13.2	understanding the teaching, they are independent.
snp4.15:13.3	They rightly proceed in the world,
snp4.15:13.4	not coveting anything here.
snp4.15:14.1	One who has crossed over sensuality here,
snp4.15:14.2	the snare in the world so hard to get past,
snp4.15:14.3	grieves not, nor hopes;
snp4.15:14.4	they’ve cut the strings, they’re no longer bound.
snp4.15:15.1	What came before, let wither away,
snp4.15:15.2	and after, let there be nothing.
snp4.15:15.3	If you don’t grasp at the middle,
snp4.15:15.4	you will live at peace.
snp4.15:16.1	One who has no sense of ownership
snp4.15:16.2	in the whole realm of name and form,
snp4.15:16.3	does not grieve for that which is not,
snp4.15:16.4	they suffer no loss in the world.
snp4.15:17.1	If you don’t think of anything
snp4.15:17.2	as belonging to yourself or others,
snp4.15:17.3	not finding anything to be ‘mine’,
snp4.15:17.4	you won’t grieve, thinking ‘I don’t have it’.
snp4.15:18.1	Not bitter, not fawning,
snp4.15:18.2	unstirred, everywhere even;
snp4.15:18.3	when asked about one who is unshakable,
snp4.15:18.4	I declare that that is the benefit.
snp4.15:19.1	For the unstirred who understand,
snp4.15:19.2	there’s no performance of deeds.
snp4.15:19.3	Desisting from instigation,
snp4.15:19.4	they see sanctuary everywhere.
snp4.15:20.1	A sage doesn’t speak of themselves as being
snp4.15:20.2	among superiors, inferiors, or equals.
snp4.15:20.3	peaceful, rid of stinginess, 
snp4.15:20.4	they neither take nor reject.
snp4.16:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp4.16:0.2	With Sāriputta 
snp4.16:1.1	“Never before have I seen,”
snp4.16:1.2	said Venerable Sāriputta, 
snp4.16:1.3	“or heard from anyone
snp4.16:1.4	about a teacher of such graceful speech,
snp4.16:1.5	come from Tusita heaven to lead a community.
snp4.16:2.1	To all the world with its gods
snp4.16:2.2	he appears as a seer
snp4.16:2.3	who has dispelled all darkness,
snp4.16:2.4	and alone attained to bliss.
snp4.16:3.1	On behalf of the many here still bound,
snp4.16:3.2	I have come in need with a question 
snp4.16:3.3	to that Buddha, unattached and impartial,
snp4.16:3.4	free of deceit, come to lead a community.
snp4.16:4.1	Suppose a mendicant who loathes attachment
snp4.16:4.2	frequents a lonely lodging—
snp4.16:4.3	the root of a tree, a charnel ground,
snp4.16:4.4	on mountains, or in caves.
snp4.16:5.1	In these many different lodgings,
snp4.16:5.2	how many dangers are there
snp4.16:5.3	at which a mendicant in their silent lodging
snp4.16:5.4	ought not tremble?
snp4.16:6.1	On their journey to the untrodden place,
snp4.16:6.2	how many adversities are there in the world
snp4.16:6.3	that must they overcome
snp4.16:6.4	in their remote lodging?
snp4.16:7.1	What ways of speech should they have?
snp4.16:7.2	Where should they go for alms?
snp4.16:7.3	What precepts and vows
snp4.16:7.4	should a resolute mendicant uphold?
snp4.16:8.1	Having undertaken what training,
snp4.16:8.2	unified, alert, and mindful,
snp4.16:8.3	would they purge their own stains,
snp4.16:8.4	like a smith smelting silver?”
snp4.16:9.1	“If one who loathes attachment frequents a lonely lodging,”
snp4.16:9.2	said the Buddha to Sāriputta,
snp4.16:9.3	“in their search for awakening—as accords with the teaching—
snp4.16:9.4	I shall tell you, as I understand it,
snp4.16:9.5	what is comfortable for them.
snp4.16:10.1	A wise one, a mindful mendicant living on the periphery
snp4.16:10.2	should not be afraid of five perils:
snp4.16:10.3	flies, mosquitoes, snakes,
snp4.16:10.4	human contact, or four-legged creatures.
snp4.16:11.1	Nor should they fear followers of other teachings,
snp4.16:11.2	even having seen the threats they pose.
snp4.16:11.3	And then one seeking the good 
snp4.16:11.4	should overcome any other adversities.
snp4.16:12.1	Afflicted by illness and hunger,
snp4.16:12.2	they should endure cold and excessive heat.
snp4.16:12.3	Though afflicted by many such things, the homeless one
snp4.16:12.4	should exert energy, firmly striving.
snp4.16:13.1	They must not steal or lie;
snp4.16:13.2	and should touch creatures firm or frail with love.
snp4.16:13.3	If they notice any clouding of the mind,
snp4.16:13.4	they should dispel it as Māra’s ally.
snp4.16:14.1	They must not fall under the sway of anger or arrogance;
snp4.16:14.2	having dug them out by the root, they would stand firm.
snp4.16:14.3	Then, withstanding likes and dislikes,
snp4.16:14.4	they would overcome.
snp4.16:15.1	Putting wisdom in the foremost place, rejoicing in goodness,
snp4.16:15.2	they would put an end to those adversities.
snp4.16:15.3	They’d vanquish discontent in their remote lodging.
snp4.16:15.4	And they’d vanquish the four lamentations:
snp4.16:16.1	‘What will I eat? Where will I eat?
snp4.16:16.2	Oh, I slept badly! Where will I sleep?’
snp4.16:16.3	The trainee, the homeless migrant, 
snp4.16:16.4	would dispel these lamentable thoughts.
snp4.16:17.1	Receiving food and clothes in due season,
snp4.16:17.2	they would know moderation for the sake of contentment.
snp4.16:17.3	Guarded in these things, walking restrained in the village,
snp4.16:17.4	they wouldn’t speak harshly even when provoked.
snp4.16:18.1	Eyes downcast, not footloose,
snp4.16:18.2	devoted to absorption, they’d be very wakeful.
snp4.16:18.3	Grounded in equanimity, serene,
snp4.16:18.4	they should cut off worrisome habits of thought.
snp4.16:19.1	A mindful one should welcome repoach,
snp4.16:19.2	breaking up hard-heartedness towards their spiritual companions.
snp4.16:19.3	They may utter skillful speech, but not for too long,
snp4.16:19.4	and they shouldn’t provoke people to blame.
snp4.16:20.1	And there are five more taints in the world,
snp4.16:20.2	for the removal of which the mindful one should train,
snp4.16:20.3	vanquishing desire for sights,
snp4.16:20.4	sounds, flavors, smells, and touches.
snp4.16:21.1	Having removed desire for these things,
snp4.16:21.2	a mindful mendicant, their heart well freed,
snp4.16:21.3	rightly investigating the Dhamma in good time,
snp4.16:21.4	unified, would shatter the darkness.”
snp4.1:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp4.1:0.2	Sensual Pleasures 
snp4.1:1.1	If a mortal desires sensual pleasure
snp4.1:1.2	and their desire succeeds,
snp4.1:1.3	they definitely become elated,
snp4.1:1.4	having got what they want.
snp4.1:2.1	But for that person in the throes of pleasure,
snp4.1:2.2	aroused by desire,
snp4.1:2.3	if those pleasures fade,
snp4.1:2.4	it hurts like an arrow’s strike.
snp4.1:3.1	One who, being mindful,
snp4.1:3.2	avoids sensual pleasures
snp4.1:3.3	like side-stepping a snake’s head,
snp4.1:3.4	transcends attachment to the world.
snp4.1:4.1	There are many objects of sensual desire:
snp4.1:4.2	fields, lands, and gold; cattle and horses;
snp4.1:4.3	slaves and servants; women and relatives.
snp4.1:4.4	When a man lusts over these,
snp4.1:5.1	the weak overpower him
snp4.1:5.2	and adversities crush him.
snp4.1:5.3	Suffering follows him
snp4.1:5.4	like water in a leaky boat.
snp4.1:6.1	That’s why a person, ever mindful, 
snp4.1:6.2	should avoid sensual pleasures.
snp4.1:6.3	Give them up and cross the flood,
snp4.1:6.4	as a bailed-out boat reaches the far shore.
snp4.2:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp4.2:0.2	Eight on the Cave
snp4.2:1.1	Trapped in a cave, thickly overspread,
snp4.2:1.2	sunk in delusion they stay.
snp4.2:1.3	A person like this is far from seclusion,
snp4.2:1.4	for sensual pleasures in the world are not easy to give up. 
snp4.2:2.1	The chains of desire, the bonds of life’s pleasures
snp4.2:2.2	are hard to escape, for one cannot free another.
snp4.2:2.3	Looking to the past or the future,
snp4.2:2.4	they pray for these pleasures or former ones.
snp4.2:3.1	Greedy, fixated, infatuated by sensual pleasures, 
snp4.2:3.2	they are incorrigible, habitually immoral.
snp4.2:3.3	When led to suffering they lament,
snp4.2:3.4	“What will become of us when we pass away from here?”
snp4.2:4.1	That’s why a person should train in this life:
snp4.2:4.2	should you know that anything in the world is wrong,
snp4.2:4.3	don’t act wrongly on account of that;
snp4.2:4.4	for the wise say this life is short.
snp4.2:5.1	I see the world’s population floundering,
snp4.2:5.2	given to craving for future lives.
snp4.2:5.3	Base men wail in the jaws of death,
snp4.2:5.4	not rid of craving for life after life.
snp4.2:6.1	See them flounder over belongings,
snp4.2:6.2	like fish in puddles of a dried-up stream.
snp4.2:6.3	Seeing this, live unselfishly,
snp4.2:6.4	forming no attachment to future lives.
snp4.2:7.1	Rid of desire for both ends,
snp4.2:7.2	having completely understand contact, free of greed,
snp4.2:7.3	doing nothing for which they’d blame themselves,
snp4.2:7.4	the wise don’t cling to the seen and the heard.
snp4.2:8.1	Having understood perception and crossed the flood,
snp4.2:8.2	the sage, not clinging to possessions,
snp4.2:8.3	with dart plucked out, living diligently,
snp4.2:8.4	does not long for this world or the next.
snp4.3:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp4.3:0.2	Eight on Malice
snp4.3:1.1	Some speak with malicious intent,
snp4.3:1.2	while other speak set on truth.
snp4.3:1.3	When disputes come up a sage does not get involved,
snp4.3:1.4	which is why they’ve no barrenness at all.
snp4.3:2.1	How can you transcend your own view
snp4.3:2.2	when you’re led by preference, dogmatic in belief?
snp4.3:2.3	Inventing your own undertakings,
snp4.3:2.4	you’d speak according to your notion.
snp4.3:3.1	Some, unasked, tell others 
snp4.3:3.2	of their own precepts and vows.
snp4.3:3.3	They have an ignoble nature, say the experts,
snp4.3:3.4	since they speak about themselves of their own accord.
snp4.3:4.1	A mendicant, peaceful, quenched,
snp4.3:4.2	never boasts “thus am I” of their precepts.
snp4.3:4.3	They have a noble nature, say the experts,
snp4.3:4.4	not proud of anything in the world.
snp4.3:5.1	For one who formulates and creates teachings,
snp4.3:5.2	and promotes them despite their defects,
snp4.3:5.3	if they see an advantage for themselves,
snp4.3:5.4	they become dependent on that, relying on unstable peace.
snp4.3:6.1	It’s not easy to get over dogmatic views
snp4.3:6.2	adopted after judging among the teachings.
snp4.3:6.3	That’s why, among all these dogmas, a person
snp4.3:6.4	rejects one teaching and takes up another.
snp4.3:7.1	The cleansed one has no formulated view
snp4.3:7.2	at all in the world about the different realms.
snp4.3:7.3	Having given up illusion and conceit,
snp4.3:7.4	by what path would they go? They are not involved.
snp4.3:8.1	For one who is involved gets embroiled in disputes about teachings—
snp4.3:8.2	but how to dispute with the uninvolved? About what?
snp4.3:8.3	For picking up and putting down is not what they do;
snp4.3:8.4	they have shaken off all views in this very life.
snp4.4:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp4.4:0.2	Eight on the Pure
snp4.4:1.1	“I see a pure being of ultimate wellness;
snp4.4:1.2	it is vision that grants a person purity.”
snp4.4:1.3	Recalling this notion of the ultimate,
snp4.4:1.4	they believe in the notion that there is one who observes purity.
snp4.4:2.1	If a person were granted purity through vision,
snp4.4:2.2	or if by a notion they could give up suffering,
snp4.4:2.3	then one with attachments is purified by another:
snp4.4:2.4	their view betrays them as one who asserts thus.
snp4.4:3.1	The brahmin speaks not of purity from another
snp4.4:3.2	in terms of what is seen, heard, or thought; or by precepts or vows.
snp4.4:3.3	They are unsullied in the midst of good and evil,
snp4.4:3.4	letting go what was picked up, without creating anything new here.
snp4.4:4.1	Having let go the last they lay hold of the next;
snp4.4:4.2	following impulse, they don’t get past the snare.
snp4.4:4.3	They grab on and let go like a monkey
snp4.4:4.4	grabbing and releasing a branch.
snp4.4:5.1	Having undertaken their own vows, a person
snp4.4:5.2	visits various teachers, being attached to perception.
snp4.4:5.3	One who knows, having comprehended the truth through the knowledges,
snp4.4:5.4	does not visit various teachers, being of vast wisdom.
snp4.4:6.1	They are remote from all things
snp4.4:6.2	seen, heard, or thought.
snp4.4:6.3	Seeing them living openly,
snp4.4:6.4	how could anyone in this world judge them?
snp4.4:7.1	They don’t make things up or promote them,
snp4.4:7.2	or speak of the uttermost purity.
snp4.4:7.3	After untying the tight knot of grasping
snp4.4:7.4	they long for nothing in the world.
snp4.4:8.1	The brahmin has stepped over the boundary;
snp4.4:8.2	knowing and seeing, they adopt nothing.
snp4.4:8.3	Neither in love with passion nor besotted by dispassion,
snp4.4:8.4	there is nothing here they adopt as the ultimate.
snp4.5:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp4.5:0.2	Eight on the Ultimate
snp4.5:1.1	If, maintaining that theirs is the “ultimate” view, 
snp4.5:1.2	a person makes it out to be highest in the world;
snp4.5:1.3	then they declare all others are “lesser”;
snp4.5:1.4	that’s why they’re not over disputes.
snp4.5:2.1	If they see an advantage for themselves
snp4.5:2.2	in what’s seen, heard, or thought; or in precepts or vows,
snp4.5:2.3	in that case, having adopted that one alone,
snp4.5:2.4	they see all others as inferior.
snp4.5:3.1	Experts say that, too, is a knot,
snp4.5:3.2	relying on which people see others as lesser.
snp4.5:3.3	That’s why a mendicant ought not rely 
snp4.5:3.4	on what’s seen, heard, or thought, or on precepts and vows.
snp4.5:4.1	Nor would they form a view about the world
snp4.5:4.2	through a notion or through precepts and vows.
snp4.5:4.3	They would never represent themselves as “equal”,
snp4.5:4.4	nor conceive themselves “worse” or “better”.
snp4.5:5.1	What was picked up has been set down and is not grasped again;
snp4.5:5.2	they form no dependency even on notions.
snp4.5:5.3	They follow no side among the factions,
snp4.5:5.4	and believe in no view at all.
snp4.5:6.1	One here who has no wish for either end—
snp4.5:6.2	for any form of existence in this life or the next—
snp4.5:6.3	has adopted no dogma at all
snp4.5:6.4	after judging among the teachings.
snp4.5:7.1	For them not even the tiniest idea is formulated here
snp4.5:7.2	regarding what is seen, heard, or thought.
snp4.5:7.3	That brahmin does not grasp any view—
snp4.5:7.4	how could anyone in this world judge them?
snp4.5:8.1	They don’t make things up or promote them,
snp4.5:8.2	and don’t subscribe to any of the doctrines.
snp4.5:8.3	The brahmin has no need to be led by precept or vow;
snp4.5:8.4	gone to the far shore, one such does not return.
snp4.6:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp4.6:0.2	Old Age 
snp4.6:1.1	Short, alas, is this life;
snp4.6:1.2	you die before a hundred years.
snp4.6:1.3	Even if you live a little longer, 
snp4.6:1.4	you still die of old age.
snp4.6:2.1	People grieve over belongings,
snp4.6:2.2	yet there is no such thing as permanent possessions.
snp4.6:2.3	Separation is a fact of life; when you see this,
snp4.6:2.4	you wouldn’t stay living at home.
snp4.6:3.1	Whatever a person thinks of as belonging to them,
snp4.6:3.2	that too is given up when they die.
snp4.6:3.3	Knowing this, an astute follower of mine
snp4.6:3.4	would not be bent on ownership.
snp4.6:4.1	Just as, upon awakening, a person does not see
snp4.6:4.2	what they encountered in a dream;
snp4.6:4.3	so too you do not see your loved ones
snp4.6:4.4	when they are dead and gone.
snp4.6:5.1	You used to see and hear those folk,
snp4.6:5.2	and call them by their name.
snp4.6:5.3	Yet the name is all that’s left to tell
snp4.6:5.4	of a person when they’re gone.
snp4.6:6.1	Those who are greedy for belongings
snp4.6:6.2	don’t give up sorrow, lamentation, and stinginess.
snp4.6:6.3	That’s why the sages, seers of sanctuary,
snp4.6:6.4	left possessions behind and wandered.
snp4.6:7.1	For a mendicant who lives withdrawn,
snp4.6:7.2	frequenting a secluded seat,
snp4.6:7.3	they say it’s fitting
snp4.6:7.4	to not show themselves in a home.
snp4.6:8.1	The sage is independent everywhere,
snp4.6:8.2	they don’t form likes or dislikes.
snp4.6:8.3	Lamentation and stinginess
snp4.6:8.4	slip off them like water from a leaf.
snp4.6:9.1	Like a droplet slips from a lotus-leaf,
snp4.6:9.2	like water from a lotus flower;
snp4.6:9.3	the sage doesn’t cling to that
snp4.6:9.4	which is seen or heard or thought.
snp4.6:10.1	For the one who is cleansed does not conceive
snp4.6:10.2	in terms of things seen, heard, or thought.
snp4.6:10.3	They do not wish to be purified by another;
snp4.6:10.4	they are neither passionate nor growing dispassioned.
snp4.7:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp4.7:0.2	With Tissametteyya
snp4.7:1.1	“When someone indulges in sex,”
snp4.7:1.2	said Venerable Tissametteyya, 
snp4.7:1.3	“tell us, sir: what trouble befalls them?
snp4.7:1.4	After hearing your instruction,
snp4.7:1.5	we shall train in seclusion.”
snp4.7:2.1	“When someone indulges in sex,”
snp4.7:2.2	replied the Buddha,
snp4.7:2.3	“they forget their instructions
snp4.7:2.4	and go the wrong way—
snp4.7:2.5	that is something ignoble in them.
snp4.7:3.1	Someone who formerly lived alone
snp4.7:3.2	and then resorts to sex
snp4.7:3.3	is like a chariot careening off-track;
snp4.7:3.4	in the world they call them a low, ordinary person.
snp4.7:4.1	Their former fame and reputation
snp4.7:4.2	also fall away.
snp4.7:4.3	Seeing this, they’d train 
snp4.7:4.4	to give up sex.
snp4.7:5.1	Oppressed by thoughts,
snp4.7:5.2	they brood like a wretch.
snp4.7:5.3	When they hear what others are saying,
snp4.7:5.4	such a person is embarrassed.
snp4.7:6.1	Then they lash out with verbal daggers
snp4.7:6.2	when reproached by others.
snp4.7:6.3	This is their great blind spot;
snp4.7:6.4	they sink to lies.
snp4.7:7.1	They once were considered astute, 
snp4.7:7.2	committed to the solitary life.
snp4.7:7.3	But then they indulged in sex,
snp4.7:7.4	dragged along by desire like an idiot.
snp4.7:8.1	Knowing this danger
snp4.7:8.2	in falling from a former state here,
snp4.7:8.3	a sage would firmly resolve to wander alone,
snp4.7:8.4	and would not resort to sex.
snp4.7:9.1	They’d train themselves only in seclusion;
snp4.7:9.2	this, for the noble ones, is highest.
snp4.7:9.3	One who wouldn’t conceive themselves “best” due to that—
snp4.7:9.4	they have truly drawn near to extinguishment.
snp4.7:10.1	People tied to sensual pleasures envy them:
snp4.7:10.2	the isolated, wandering sage
snp4.7:10.3	who has crossed the flood,
snp4.7:10.4	unconcerned for sensual pleasures.
snp4.8:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp4.8:0.2	With Pasūra
snp4.8:1.1	“Here alone is purity,” they say,
snp4.8:1.2	denying that there is purification in other teachings.
snp4.8:1.3	Speaking of the beauty in that which they depend on,
snp4.8:1.4	each one is dogmatic about their own idiosyncratic interpretation.
snp4.8:2.1	Desiring debate, they plunge into an assembly,
snp4.8:2.2	where each takes the other as a fool.
snp4.8:2.3	Relying on others they state their contention,
snp4.8:2.4	desiring praise while claiming to be experts.
snp4.8:3.1	Addicted to debating in the midst of the assembly,
snp4.8:3.2	their need for praise makes them nervous.
snp4.8:3.3	But when they’re repudiated they get embarrassed;
snp4.8:3.4	upset at criticism, they find fault in others.
snp4.8:4.1	If their doctrine is said to be weak,
snp4.8:4.2	and judges declare it repudiated,
snp4.8:4.3	the loser weeps and wails,
snp4.8:4.4	moaning, “They beat me.”
snp4.8:5.1	When these arguments come up among ascetics,
snp4.8:5.2	they get excited or dejected.
snp4.8:5.3	Seeing this, refrain from contention,
snp4.8:5.4	for the only purpose is praise and profit.
snp4.8:6.1	But if, having declared their doctrine, 
snp4.8:6.2	they are praised there in the midst of the assembly,
snp4.8:6.3	they laugh and proudly show off because of it,
snp4.8:6.4	having got what they wanted.
snp4.8:7.1	Their pride is their downfall,
snp4.8:7.2	yet they speak from conceit and arrogance.
snp4.8:7.3	Seeing this, one ought not get into arguments,
snp4.8:7.4	for experts say this is no way to purity.
snp4.8:8.1	As a warrior, after feasting on royal food,
snp4.8:8.2	goes roaring, wanting an opponent—
snp4.8:8.3	go off and find an opponent, Sūra,
snp4.8:8.4	for here, as before, there is no-one to fight.
snp4.8:9.1	When someone argues about a view they have adopted,
snp4.8:9.2	saying, “This is the only truth,”
snp4.8:9.3	say to them, “Here you’ll have no adversary
snp4.8:9.4	when a dispute has come up.”
snp4.8:10.1	There are those who live far from the crowd,
snp4.8:10.2	not countering views with view.
snp4.8:10.3	Who is there to argue with you, Pasūra,
snp4.8:10.4	among those who grasp nothing here as the highest?
snp4.8:11.1	And so you come along speculating,
snp4.8:11.2	thinking up theories in your mind.
snp4.8:11.3	Now that you’ve challenged someone who’s cleansed,
snp4.8:11.4	you’ll not be able to respond.
snp4.9:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp4.9:0.2	With Māgaṇḍiya 
snp4.9:1.1	“Even when I saw the sirens Craving, Delight, and Lust,
snp4.9:1.2	I had no desire for sex.
snp4.9:1.3	What is this body full of piss and shit?
snp4.9:1.4	I wouldn’t even want to touch it with my foot.”
snp4.9:2.1	“If you do not want a gem such as this,
snp4.9:2.2	a lady desired by many rulers of men,
snp4.9:2.3	then what kind of theory, precepts and vows, livelihood,
snp4.9:2.4	and rebirth in a new life do you assert?”
snp4.9:3.1	“After judging among the teachings,”
snp4.9:3.2	said the Buddha to Māgaṇḍiya,
snp4.9:3.3	“none have been adopted thinking, ‘I assert this.’
snp4.9:3.4	Seeing views without adopting any,
snp4.9:3.5	searching, I saw inner peace.”
snp4.9:4.1	“O sage, you speak of judgments you have formed,”
snp4.9:4.2	said Māgaṇḍiya,
snp4.9:4.3	“without having adopted any of those views.
snp4.9:4.4	As to that matter of ‘inner peace’—
snp4.9:4.5	how is that described by the wise?”
snp4.9:5.1	“Purity is neither spoken of in terms of view,”
snp4.9:5.2	said the Buddha to Māgaṇḍiya,
snp4.9:5.3	“oral transmission, notion, and precepts and vows;
snp4.9:5.4	nor in terms of that without view, oral transmission, 
snp4.9:5.5	notion, and precepts and vows.
snp4.9:5.6	Having relinquished these, not adopting them,
snp4.9:5.7	peaceful, independent, one would not pray to be reborn.”
snp4.9:6.1	“It seems purity is neither spoken of in terms of view,”
snp4.9:6.2	said Māgaṇḍiya,
snp4.9:6.3	“oral transmission, notion, and precepts and vows;
snp4.9:6.4	nor in terms of that without view, oral transmission, 
snp4.9:6.5	notion, and precepts and vows.
snp4.9:6.6	If so, I think this teaching is sheer confusion;
snp4.9:6.7	for some believe in purity in terms of view.”
snp4.9:7.1	“Continuing to question while relying on a view,”
snp4.9:7.2	said the Buddha to Māgaṇḍiya,
snp4.9:7.3	“you’ve become confused by all you’ve adopted.
snp4.9:7.4	From this you’ve not glimpsed the slightest idea,
snp4.9:7.5	which is why you consider the teaching confused.
snp4.9:8.1	If you think that ‘I’m equal, 
snp4.9:8.2	special, or worse’, you’ll get into arguments. 
snp4.9:8.3	Unwavering in the face of the three discriminations, 
snp4.9:8.4	you’ll have no thought ‘I’m equal or special’. 
snp4.9:9.1	Why would that brahmin say, ‘It’s true’,
snp4.9:9.2	or with whom would they argue, ‘It’s false’?
snp4.9:9.3	There is no equal or unequal in them,
snp4.9:9.4	so who would they take on in debate?
snp4.9:10.1	After leaving shelter to migrate unsettled, 
snp4.9:10.2	a sage doesn’t get close to anyone in town. 
snp4.9:10.3	Rid of sensual pleasures, expecting nothing, 
snp4.9:10.4	they wouldn’t get in arguments with people.
snp4.9:11.1	A spiritual giant would not take up for argument
snp4.9:11.2	the things in the world from which they live secluded.
snp4.9:11.3	As a prickly lotus born in the water
snp4.9:11.4	is unsullied by water and mud,
snp4.9:11.5	so the greedless sage, proponent of peace,
snp4.9:11.6	is unsmeared by sensuality and the world.
snp4.9:12.1	A knowledge master does not become conceited
snp4.9:12.2	due to view or thought, for they do not identify with that.
snp4.9:12.3	They’ve no need for deeds or learning,
snp4.9:12.4	they’re not indoctrinated in dogmas.
snp4.9:13.1	There are no ties for one detached from ideas;
snp4.9:13.2	there are no delusions for one freed by wisdom.
snp4.9:13.3	But those who have adopted ideas and views
snp4.9:13.4	wander the world causing conflict.”

snp5.10:1.3	“and for whom there is no craving,
snp5.10:1.4	and who has crossed over doubts—
snp5.10:1.5	of what kind is their liberation?”
snp5.10:2.1	“In whom sensual pleasures do not dwell,”
snp5.10:2.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.10:2.3	“and for whom there is no craving,
snp5.10:2.4	and who has crossed over doubts—
snp5.10:2.5	their liberation is none other than this.”
snp5.10:3.1	“Are they free of hope, or are they still in need of hope?
snp5.10:3.2	Do they possess wisdom, or are they still forming wisdom?
snp5.10:3.3	O Sakyan, elucidate the sage to me,
snp5.10:3.4	so that I may understand, All-seer.”
snp5.10:4.1	“They are free of hope, they are not in need of hope.
snp5.10:4.2	They possess wisdom, they are not still forming wisdom.
snp5.10:4.3	That, Todeyya, is how to understand a sage,

snp5.11:1.6	Explain to me an island
snp5.11:1.7	so that this may not occur again.”
snp5.11:2.1	“For those overwhelmed by old age and death,”

snp5.11:2.3	“stuck mid-stream
snp5.11:2.4	as the terrifying flood arises,
snp5.11:2.5	I shall tell you an island, Kappa.
snp5.11:3.1	Having nothing, taking nothing: 
snp5.11:3.2	this is the isle of no return.
snp5.11:3.3	I call it extinguishment,
snp5.11:3.4	the ending of old age and death.
snp5.11:4.1	Those who have fully understood this, mindful,
snp5.11:4.2	are extinguished in this very life.

snp5.12:1.1	“Hearing of the hero with no desire for sensual pleasures,”

snp5.12:1.3	“who has passed over the flood, I’ve come with a question for that desireless one.
snp5.12:1.4	Tell me the state of peace, O natural visionary.
snp5.12:1.5	Tell me this, Blessed One, as it really is.
snp5.12:2.1	For, having mastered sensual desires, the Blessed One proceeds,
snp5.12:2.2	as the blazing sun shines on the earth. 
snp5.12:2.3	May you of vast wisdom explain the teaching
snp5.12:2.4	to me of little wisdom so that I may understand
snp5.12:2.5	the giving up of rebirth and old age here.”
snp5.12:3.1	“With sensual desire dispelled,”
snp5.12:3.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.12:3.3	“seeing renunciation as sanctuary,
snp5.12:3.4	don’t be taking up or putting down
snp5.12:3.5	anything at all.
snp5.12:4.1	What came before, let wither away,
snp5.12:4.2	and after, let there be nothing.

snp5.13:1.5	Many people have gathered from different lands
snp5.13:2.1	wishing to hear your word, O hero.
snp5.13:2.2	After hearing the spiritual giant they will depart from here.
snp5.13:2.3	Please, sage, answer them clearly,
snp5.13:2.4	for truly you understand this matter.”
snp5.13:3.1	“Dispel all acquisitive craving,”
snp5.13:3.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.13:3.3	“above, below, all round, between.
snp5.13:3.4	For Māra pursues a person
snp5.13:3.5	using whatever they grasp in the world.

snp5.14:1.5	I have come in need with a question.
snp5.14:1.6	Tell me the liberation by enlightenment, 
snp5.14:1.7	the smashing of ignorance.” 
snp5.14:2.1	“The giving up of both ,”
snp5.14:2.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.14:2.3	sensual desires and aversion; 
snp5.14:2.4	the dispelling of dullness, 
snp5.14:2.5	and the cessation of remorse. 
snp5.14:3.1	Pure equanimity and mindfulness, 
snp5.14:3.2	preceded by investigation of principles—
snp5.14:3.3	this, I declare, is liberation by enlightenment,

snp5.15:1.3	who is imperturbable, with doubts cut off,
snp5.15:1.4	and who has gone beyond all things,
snp5.15:1.5	I have come in need with a question.
snp5.15:2.1	Consider one who perceives the disappearance of form,
snp5.15:2.2	who has entirely given up the body,
snp5.15:2.3	and who sees nothing at all
snp5.15:2.4	internally and externally.
snp5.15:2.5	I ask the Sakyan about knowledge for them;
snp5.15:2.6	how should one like that be guided?”
snp5.15:3.1	“The Realized One directly knows,”

snp5.15:3.5	committed to that as their final goal.
snp5.15:4.1	Understanding that desire for rebirth 
snp5.15:4.2	in the dimension of nothingness is a fetter,

snp5.16:2.3	I’m not familiar with the view
snp5.16:2.4	of the renowned Gotama.
snp5.16:3.1	So I’ve come in need with a question
snp5.16:3.2	to the one of excellent vision.
snp5.16:3.3	How to look upon the world
snp5.16:3.4	so the King of Death won’t see you?”
snp5.16:4.1	“Look upon the world as empty,
snp5.16:4.2	Mogharājā, ever mindful.
snp5.16:4.3	Having uprooted the view of self,
snp5.16:4.4	 you may thus cross over death.
snp5.16:4.5	That’s how to look upon the world
snp5.16:4.6	so the King of Death won’t see you.”

snp5.17:0.2	The Questions of Piṅgiya
snp5.17:1.1	“I am old, feeble, and pallid,”
snp5.17:1.2	said Venerable Piṅgiya,
snp5.17:1.3	“my eyes unclear, my hearing faint.
snp5.17:1.4	Don’t let stupid me perish meanwhile;
snp5.17:1.5	explain the teaching so that I may understand
snp5.17:1.6	the giving up of rebirth and old age here.”
snp5.17:2.1	“Having seen those stricken by forms,”
snp5.17:2.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.17:2.3	“negligent people afflicted by forms;
snp5.17:2.4	therefore, Piṅgiya, being diligent,
snp5.17:2.5	give up form so as not to be reborn.”
snp5.17:3.1	“The four directions, the intermediate directions, 
snp5.17:3.2	below, and above: in these ten directions
snp5.17:3.3	there’s nothing at all in the world
snp5.17:3.4	that you’ve not seen, heard, thought, or cognized.
snp5.17:3.5	Explain the teaching so that I may understand
snp5.17:3.6	the giving up of rebirth and old age here.”
snp5.17:4.1	“Observing people sunk in craving,”
snp5.17:4.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.17:4.3	“tormented, mired in old age;
snp5.17:4.4	therefore, Piṅgiya, being diligent,
snp5.17:4.5	give up craving so as not to be reborn.”
snp5.18:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp5.18:0.2	Homage to the Way to the Beyond
snp5.18:1.1	This was said by the Buddha while staying in the land of the Magadhans at the Pāsāṇake shrine. 
snp5.18:1.2	When requested by the sixteen brahmin devotees, he answered their questions one by one. 
snp5.18:1.3	If you understand the meaning and the teaching of each of these questions, and practice accordingly, you may go right to the far shore of old age and death.
snp5.18:1.4	These teachings are said to lead to the far shore, which is why the name of this exposition of the teaching is “The Way to the Beyond”.
snp5.18:2.1	Ajita, Tissametteyya,
snp5.18:2.2	Puṇṇaka and Mettagū,
snp5.18:2.3	Dhotaka and Upasiva,
snp5.18:2.4	Nanda and then Hemaka,
snp5.18:3.1	both Todeyya and Kappa,
snp5.18:3.2	and Jatukaṇṇī the astute,
snp5.18:3.3	Bhadrāvudha and Udaya,
snp5.18:3.4	and the brahmin Posala,
snp5.18:3.5	Mogharājā the intelligent,
snp5.18:3.6	and Piṅgiya the great hermit:
snp5.18:4.1	they approached the Buddha,
snp5.18:4.2	the hermit of consummate conduct.
snp5.18:4.3	Asking their subtle questions,
snp5.18:4.4	they came to the most excellent Buddha.
snp5.18:5.1	The Buddha answered their questions
snp5.18:5.2	in accordance with truth.
snp5.18:5.3	The sage satisfied the brahmins
snp5.18:5.4	with his answers to their questions.
snp5.18:6.1	Those who were satisfied by the all-seer,
snp5.18:6.2	the Buddha, Kinsman of the Sun,
snp5.18:6.3	led the spiritual life in his presence,
snp5.18:6.4	the one of such splendid wisdom.
snp5.18:7.1	If you practice in accordance
snp5.18:7.2	with each of these questions
snp5.18:7.3	as taught by the Buddha,
snp5.18:7.4	you’ll go from the near shore to the far.
snp5.18:8.1	Developing the supreme path,
snp5.18:8.2	you’ll go from the near shore to the far.
snp5.18:8.3	This path is for going to the far shore;
snp5.18:8.4	that’s why it’s called “The Way to the Beyond”.
snp5.19:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp5.19:0.2	Preserving the Way to the Beyond
snp5.19:1.1	“I shall keep reciting the Way to the Beyond,”
snp5.19:1.2	said Venerable Piṅgiya,
snp5.19:1.3	“which was taught as it was seen
snp5.19:1.4	by the immaculate one of vast intelligence.
snp5.19:1.5	He is desireless, unentangled, a spiritual giant:
snp5.19:1.6	why would he speak falsely?
snp5.19:2.1	Come, let me extol
snp5.19:2.2	in sweet words of praise
snp5.19:2.3	the one who’s given up stains and delusions,
snp5.19:2.4	conceit and contempt.
snp5.19:3.1	The Buddha, all-seer, dispeler of darkness,
snp5.19:3.2	has gone to world’s end, beyond all rebirths;
snp5.19:3.3	he is free of defilements, and has given up all pain,
snp5.19:3.4	the rightly-named one, brahmin, is revered by me.
snp5.19:4.1	Like a bird that flees a little copse,
snp5.19:4.2	to roost in a forest abounding in fruit,
snp5.19:4.3	I’ve left the near-sighted behind,
snp5.19:4.4	like a swan come to a great river.
snp5.19:5.1	Those who explained to me previously,
snp5.19:5.2	before I encountered Gotama’s teaching,
snp5.19:5.3	said ‘thus it was’ or ‘so it shall be’.
snp5.19:5.4	All that was just the testament of hearsay;
snp5.19:5.5	all that just fostered speculation.
snp5.19:6.1	Alone, the dispeler of darkness
snp5.19:6.2	is splendid, a beacon:
snp5.19:6.3	Gotama, vast in wisdom,
snp5.19:6.4	Gotama, vast in intelligence.
snp5.19:7.1	He is the one who taught me Dhamma,
snp5.19:7.2	visible in this very life, immediately effective,
snp5.19:7.3	the untroubled, the end of craving,
snp5.19:7.4	to which there is no compare.”
snp5.19:8.1	“Why would you dwell apart from him
snp5.19:8.2	even for an hour, Piṅgiya?
snp5.19:8.3	From Gotama, vast in wisdom,
snp5.19:8.4	from Gotama, vast in intelligence?
snp5.19:9.1	He is the one who taught you Dhamma,
snp5.19:9.2	visible in this very life, immediately effective,
snp5.19:9.3	the untroubled, the end of craving,
snp5.19:9.4	to which there is no compare.”
snp5.19:10.1	“I never dwell apart from him,
snp5.19:10.2	not even for an hour, brahmin.
snp5.19:10.3	From Gotama, vast in wisdom,
snp5.19:10.4	from Gotama, vast in intelligence.
snp5.19:11.1	He is the one who taught me Dhamma,
snp5.19:11.2	visible in this very life, immediately effective,
snp5.19:11.3	the untroubled, the end of craving,
snp5.19:11.4	to which there is no compare.
snp5.19:12.1	Being diligent, I see him 
snp5.19:12.2	in my mind’s eye day and night.
snp5.19:12.3	I spend the name in homage to him,
snp5.19:12.4	hence I think I dwell with him.
snp5.19:13.1	My faith and joy and intent and mindfulness
snp5.19:13.2	never stray from Gotama’s teaching.
snp5.19:13.3	I bow to whatever direction 
snp5.19:13.4	the one of vast wisdom heads.
snp5.19:14.1	I’m old and feeble,
snp5.19:14.2	so my body cannot go there,
snp5.19:14.3	but I always travel in my thoughts,
snp5.19:14.4	for my mind, brahmin, is bound to him.
snp5.19:15.1	Lying floundering in the mud,
snp5.19:15.2	I drifted from island to island.
snp5.19:15.3	Then I saw the Buddha,
snp5.19:15.4	the undefiled one who has crossed the flood.”
snp5.19:16.1	“Just as Vakkali was committed to faith—
snp5.19:16.2	Bhadrāvudha and Gotama of Āḷavī too—
snp5.19:16.3	so too you should commit to faith. 
snp5.19:16.4	You will go, Piṅgiya, beyond the domain of death.”
snp5.19:17.1	“My confidence grew
snp5.19:17.2	when I heard the word of the sage,
snp5.19:17.3	the Buddha with veil drawn back,
snp5.19:17.4	so kind and eloquent.
snp5.19:18.1	Having directly known all about the gods,
snp5.19:18.2	he understands all top to bottom,
snp5.19:18.3	the teacher who settles all questions
snp5.19:18.4	for those who admit their doubts.
snp5.19:19.1	Unfaltering, unshakable;
snp5.19:19.2	that to which there is no compare.
snp5.19:19.3	For sure I will go there, I have no doubt of that.
snp5.19:19.4	Remember me as one whose mind is made up.”
snp5.19:40.5	The Anthology of Discourses is completed.
snp5.1:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp5.1:0.2	Introductory Verses
snp5.1:1.1	From the fair city of the Kosalans
snp5.1:1.2	to the southern region
snp5.1:1.3	came a brahmin expert in hymns,
snp5.1:1.4	aspiring to nothingness.
snp5.1:2.1	In the domain of Assaka,
snp5.1:2.2	close by Aḷaka,
snp5.1:2.3	he lived on the bank of the Godhāvarī River,
snp5.1:2.4	getting by on gleanings and fruit.
snp5.1:3.1	He was supported
snp5.1:3.2	by a prosperous village nearby.
snp5.1:3.3	With the revenue earned from there
snp5.1:3.4	he performed a great sacrifice.
snp5.1:4.1	When he had completed the great sacrifice,
snp5.1:4.2	he returned to his hermitage once more.
snp5.1:4.3	Upon his return,
snp5.1:4.4	another brahmin arrived.
snp5.1:5.1	Foot-sore and thirsty,
snp5.1:5.2	with grotty teeth and dusty head,
snp5.1:5.3	he approached the other
snp5.1:5.4	and asked for five hundred coins.
snp5.1:6.1	When Bāvari saw him,
snp5.1:6.2	he invited him to sit down,
snp5.1:6.3	asked of his happiness and well-being,
snp5.1:6.4	and said the following.
snp5.1:7.1	“Whatever I had available to give,
snp5.1:7.2	I have already distributed.
snp5.1:7.3	Believe me, brahmin,
snp5.1:7.4	I don’t have five hundred coins.”
snp5.1:8.1	“If, good sir, you do not
snp5.1:8.2	give me what I ask,
snp5.1:8.3	then on the seventh day,
snp5.1:8.4	let your head explode in seven!”
snp5.1:9.1	After performing a ritual,
snp5.1:9.2	that charlatan uttered his dreadful curse.
snp5.1:9.3	When he heard these words,
snp5.1:9.4	Bāvari became distressed.
snp5.1:10.1	Not eating, he grew emaciated,
snp5.1:10.2	stricken by the dart of sorrow.
snp5.1:10.3	And in such a state of mind,
snp5.1:10.4	he could not enjoy absorption.
snp5.1:11.1	Seeing him anxious and distraught,
snp5.1:11.2	a goddess wishing to help,
snp5.1:11.3	approached Bāvari
snp5.1:11.4	and said the following.
snp5.1:12.1	“That charlatan understands nothing
snp5.1:12.2	about the head, he only wants money.
snp5.1:12.3	When it comes to heads or head-splitting,
snp5.1:12.4	he has no knowledge at all.”
snp5.1:13.1	“Madam, surely you must know—
snp5.1:13.2	please answer my question.
snp5.1:13.3	Let me hear what you say
snp5.1:13.4	about heads and head-splitting.”
snp5.1:14.1	“I too do not know that,
snp5.1:14.2	I have no knowledge in that matter.
snp5.1:14.3	When it comes to heads or head-splitting,
snp5.1:14.4	it is the Victors who have vision.”
snp5.1:15.1	“Then, in all this vast territory,
snp5.1:15.2	who exactly does know
snp5.1:15.3	about heads and head-splitting?
snp5.1:15.4	Please tell me, goddess.”
snp5.1:16.1	“From the city of Kapilavatthu
snp5.1:16.2	the World Leader has gone forth.
snp5.1:16.3	He is a scion of King Okkāka,
snp5.1:16.4	a Sakyan, and a beacon.
snp5.1:17.1	For he, brahmin, is the Awakened One!
snp5.1:17.2	He has gone beyond all things;
snp5.1:17.3	he has attained to all knowledge and power;
snp5.1:17.4	he is the seer into all things,
snp5.1:17.5	he has attained the end of all deeds;
snp5.1:17.6	he is freed with the ending of attachments. 
snp5.1:18.1	That Buddha, the Blessed One in the world,
snp5.1:18.2	the Seer, teaches Dhamma.
snp5.1:18.3	Go to him and ask—
snp5.1:18.4	he will answer you.”
snp5.1:19.1	When he heard the word “Buddha”,
snp5.1:19.2	Bāvari was elated.
snp5.1:19.3	His sorrow faded,
snp5.1:19.4	and he was filled abundant joy. 
snp5.1:20.1	Uplifted, elated, and inspired,
snp5.1:20.2	Bāvari questioned that goddess:
snp5.1:20.3	“But in what village or town,
snp5.1:20.4	or in what land is the protector of the world,
snp5.1:20.5	where we may go and pay respects
snp5.1:20.6	to the Awakened One, best of men?”
snp5.1:21.1	“Near Sāvatthī, the home of the Kosalans, is the Victor
snp5.1:21.2	abounding in wisdom, vast in intelligence. 
snp5.1:21.3	That Sakyan is indefatigable, free of defilements, a bull among men:
snp5.1:21.4	he understands head-splitting.
snp5.1:22.1	Therefore he addressed his pupils,
snp5.1:22.2	brahmins who had mastered the hymns:
snp5.1:22.3	“Come, students, I shall speak.
snp5.1:22.4	Listen to what I say.
snp5.1:23.1	Today has arisen in the world
snp5.1:23.2	one whose appearance in the world
snp5.1:23.3	is hard to find again—
snp5.1:23.4	he is renowned as the Awakened One. 
snp5.1:23.5	Quickly go to Sāvatthī
snp5.1:23.6	and see the best of men.”
snp5.1:24.1	“Brahmin, how exactly are we to know
snp5.1:24.2	the Buddha when we see him?
snp5.1:24.3	We don’t know, please tell us, 
snp5.1:24.4	so that we can recognize him.” 
snp5.1:25.1	“The marks of a great man 
snp5.1:25.2	have been handed down in our hymns. 
snp5.1:25.3	Thirty-two have been have been described,
snp5.1:25.4	complete and in order.
snp5.1:26.1	One upon whose body is found
snp5.1:26.2	these marks of a great man
snp5.1:26.3	has two possible destinies,
snp5.1:26.4	there is no third.
snp5.1:27.1	If he stays at home,
snp5.1:27.2	having conquered this land
snp5.1:27.3	without rod or sword,
snp5.1:27.4	he shall govern by principle.
snp5.1:28.1	But if he goes forth
snp5.1:28.2	from the lay life to homelessness,
snp5.1:28.3	he becomes an Awakened One, a perfected one,
snp5.1:28.4	with veil drawn back, supreme.
snp5.1:29.1	Ask him about my birth, clan, and marks,
snp5.1:29.2	my hymns and students; and further, 
snp5.1:29.3	about heads and head-splitting—
snp5.1:29.4	but do so only in your mind!
snp5.1:30.1	If he is the Buddha
snp5.1:30.2	of unobstructed vision,
snp5.1:30.3	he will answer with his voice
snp5.1:30.4	the questions in your mind.”
snp5.1:31.1	Sixteen brahmin pupils
snp5.1:31.2	heard what Bāvari said:
snp5.1:31.3	Ajita, Tissametteyya,
snp5.1:31.4	Puṇṇaka and Mettagū,
snp5.1:32.1	Dhotaka and Upasiva,
snp5.1:32.2	Nanda and then Hemaka,
snp5.1:32.3	both Todeyya and Kappa,
snp5.1:32.4	and Jatukaṇṇī the astute,
snp5.1:33.1	Bhadrāvudha and Udaya,
snp5.1:33.2	and the brahmin Posala,
snp5.1:33.3	Mogharājā the intelligent,
snp5.1:33.4	and Piṅgiya the great hermit.
snp5.1:34.1	Each of them had their own following,
snp5.1:34.2	they were renowned the whole world over.
snp5.1:34.3	Those wise ones, meditators who love absorption,
snp5.1:34.4	were redolent with the potential of their past deeds.
snp5.1:35.1	Having bowed to Bāvari,
snp5.1:35.2	and circled him to his right,
snp5.1:35.3	they set out for the north,
snp5.1:35.4	with their dreadlocks and hides.
snp5.1:36.1	First to Patiṭṭhāna of Aḷaka,
snp5.1:36.2	then on to the city of Mahissati;
snp5.1:36.3	to Ujjenī and Gonaddhā,
snp5.1:36.4	and Vedisa, and Vanasa.
snp5.1:37.1	Then to Kosambi and Sāketa, 
snp5.1:37.2	and the supreme city of Sāvatthī;
snp5.1:37.3	on they went to Setavyā and Kapilavatthu,
snp5.1:37.4	and the homestead at Kusinārā.
snp5.1:38.1	To Pāvā they went, and Bhoganagara,
snp5.1:38.2	and on to Vesālī and the Magadhan city.
snp5.1:38.3	Finally they reached the Pāsāṇaka shrine,
snp5.1:38.4	fair and delightful.
snp5.1:39.1	Like a thirsty person to cool water,
snp5.1:39.2	like a merchant to great profit,
snp5.1:39.3	like a heat-struck person to shade,
snp5.1:39.4	they quickly climbed the mountain.
snp5.1:40.1	At that time the Buddha
snp5.1:40.2	at the fore of the mendicant Saṅgha,
snp5.1:40.3	was teaching the mendicants the Dhamma,
snp5.1:40.4	like a lion roaring in the jungle.
snp5.1:41.1	Ajita saw the Buddha,
snp5.1:41.2	like the sun shining with a hundred rays,
snp5.1:41.3	like the moon on the fifteenth day
snp5.1:41.4	when it has come into its fullness.
snp5.1:42.1	Then he saw his body,
snp5.1:42.2	complete in all features.
snp5.1:42.3	Thrilled, he stood to one side
snp5.1:42.4	and asked this question in his mind.
snp5.1:43.1	“Speak about the brahmin’s birth;
snp5.1:43.2	of his clan; and his own marks;
snp5.1:43.3	what hymns is he proficient in;
snp5.1:43.4	and how many he teaches.”
snp5.1:44.1	“His age is a hundred and twenty.
snp5.1:44.2	By clan he is a Bāvari.
snp5.1:44.3	There are three marks on his body.
snp5.1:44.4	He is a master of the three Vedas,
snp5.1:45.1	the teachings on the marks, the testaments,
snp5.1:45.2	the vocabularies, and the rituals.
snp5.1:45.3	He teaches five hundred,
snp5.1:45.4	and has reached proficiency in his own teaching.”
snp5.1:46.1	“O supreme person, cutter of craving,
snp5.1:46.2	please reveal in detail
snp5.1:46.3	Bāvari’s marks—
snp5.1:46.4	let us doubt no longer!”
snp5.1:47.1	“He can cover his face with his tongue;
snp5.1:47.2	there is a tuft of hair between his eyebrows;
snp5.1:47.3	his private parts are concealed in a foreskin:
snp5.1:47.4	know them as this, young man.”
snp5.1:48.1	Hearing the answers 
snp5.1:48.2	without having heard any questions,
snp5.1:48.3	all the people, inspired, 
snp5.1:48.4	with joined palms, wondered:
snp5.1:49.1	“Who is it that asked a question with their mind? 
snp5.1:49.2	Was it a god or Brahmā?
snp5.1:49.3	Or Indra, Sujā’s husband?
snp5.1:49.4	To whom does the Buddha reply?”
snp5.1:50.1	“Bāvari asks
snp5.1:50.2	about heads and head-splitting.
snp5.1:50.3	May the Buddha please answer,
snp5.1:50.4	and so, O hermit, dispel our doubt.”
snp5.1:51.1	“Know ignorance as the head,
snp5.1:51.2	and knowledge as the head-splitter,
snp5.1:51.3	when joined with faith, mindfulness, and immersion,
snp5.1:51.4	and enthusiasm and energy.”
snp5.1:52.1	At that, the brahmin student,
snp5.1:52.2	full of inspiration,
snp5.1:52.3	arranged his antelope-skin cloak over one shoulder,
snp5.1:52.4	and fell with his head to the Buddha’s feet.
snp5.1:53.1	“Good sir, the brahmin Bāvari
snp5.1:53.2	together with his pupils,
snp5.1:53.3	elated and happy,
snp5.1:53.4	bows to your feet, O seer!”
snp5.1:54.1	“May the brahmin Bāvari be happy,
snp5.1:54.2	together with his pupils.
snp5.1:54.3	And may you, too, be happy!
snp5.1:54.4	May you live long, young man.
snp5.1:55.1	To Bāvari and you all
snp5.1:55.2	I grant the opportunity to clear up all doubt.
snp5.1:55.3	Please ask 
snp5.1:55.4	whatever you want.”
snp5.1:56.1	Granted the opportunity by the Buddha,
snp5.1:56.2	they sat down with joined palms.
snp5.1:56.3	Ajita asked the Realized One
snp5.1:56.4	the first question right there.

snp5.2:0.2	The Questions of Ajita
snp5.2:1.1	“By what is the world shrouded?”
snp5.2:1.2	said Venerable Ajita.
snp5.2:1.3	“Why does it not shine?
snp5.2:1.4	Tell me, what is its tar pit?
snp5.2:1.5	What is its greatest fear?”
snp5.2:2.1	“The world is shrouded in ignorance.”
snp5.2:2.2	replied the Buddha.
snp5.2:2.3	“Avarice and negligence make it not shine.
snp5.2:2.4	Prayer is its tar pit.
snp5.2:2.5	Suffering is its greatest fear.”
snp5.2:3.1	“The streams flow everywhere,”
snp5.2:3.2	said Venerable Ajita.
snp5.2:3.3	“What is there to block them?
snp5.2:3.4	And tell me the restraint of streams—
snp5.2:3.5	by what are they locked out?”
snp5.2:4.1	“The streams in the world,”
snp5.2:4.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.2:4.3	“are blocked by mindfulness.
snp5.2:4.4	I tell you the restraint of streams—
snp5.2:4.5	they are locked out by wisdom.”
snp5.2:5.1	“That wisdom and mindfulness,”
snp5.2:5.2	said Venerable Ajita,
snp5.2:5.3	“and that which is name and form, good sir;
snp5.2:5.4	when questioned, please tell me of this:
snp5.2:5.5	where does this all cease?”
snp5.2:6.1	“This question which you have asked,
snp5.2:6.2	I shall answer you, Ajita.
snp5.2:6.3	Where name and form 
snp5.2:6.4	cease with nothing left over—
snp5.2:6.5	with the cessation of consciousness, 
snp5.2:6.6	that’s where they cease.”
snp5.2:7.1	“There are those who have assessed the teaching, 
snp5.2:7.2	and many kinds of trainees here.
snp5.2:7.3	Tell me about their behavior, good sir,
snp5.2:7.4	when asked, for you are alert.”
snp5.2:8.1	“Not greedy for sensual pleasures,
snp5.2:8.2	their mind would be unclouded.
snp5.2:8.3	Skilled in all things,
snp5.2:8.4	a mendicant would wander mindful.”

snp5.3:0.2	The Questions of Tissametteyya
snp5.3:1.1	“Who is content here in the world?”
snp5.3:1.2	said Venerable Tissametteyya.
snp5.3:1.3	“Who has no disturbances?
snp5.3:1.4	Who, having known both ends,
snp5.3:1.5	is not stuck in the middle?
snp5.3:1.6	Who do they say is a great man?
snp5.3:1.7	Who here has escaped the seamstress?”
snp5.3:2.1	“Leading the spiritual life among sensual pleasures,”
snp5.3:2.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.3:2.3	“rid of craving, ever mindful;
snp5.3:2.4	a mendicant who, after assessing, is quenched:
snp5.3:2.5	that’s who has no disturbances.
snp5.3:3.1	That’s who, having known both ends,
snp5.3:3.2	is not stuck in the middle. 
snp5.3:3.3	He is a great man, I declare, 
snp5.3:3.4	he has escaped the seamstress here.”

snp5.4:0.2	The Questions of Puṇṇaka
snp5.4:1.1	“To the imperturbable, the seer of the root,”
snp5.4:1.2	said Venerable Puṇṇaka,
snp5.4:1.3	“I have come in need with a question.
snp5.4:1.4	On what grounds have hermits and men,
snp5.4:1.5	aristocrats and brahmins here in the world
snp5.4:1.6	performed so many different sacrifices to the gods?
snp5.4:1.7	I ask you, Blessed One; please tell me this.”
snp5.4:2.1	“Whatever hermits and men,”
snp5.4:2.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.4:2.3	“aristocrats and brahmins here in the world
snp5.4:2.4	have performed so many different sacrifices to the gods:
snp5.4:2.5	all performed sacrifices bound to old age,
snp5.4:2.6	hoping for some state of existence.”
snp5.4:3.1	“As to those hermits and men,”
snp5.4:3.2	said Venerable Puṇṇaka,
snp5.4:3.3	“and aristocrats and brahmins here in the world
snp5.4:3.4	who have performed so many different sacrifices to the gods:
snp5.4:3.5	being diligent in the methods of sacrifice,
snp5.4:3.6	have they crossed over rebirth and old age, good sir?
snp5.4:3.7	I ask you, Blessed One; please tell me this.”
snp5.4:4.1	“Hoping, invoking, praying, and worshiping,”
snp5.4:4.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.4:4.3	“they pray for pleasure derived from profit.
snp5.4:4.4	Devoted to sacrifice, besotted by rebirth,
snp5.4:4.5	they’ve not crossed over rebirth and old age, I declare.”
snp5.4:5.1	“If those devoted to sacrifice,”
snp5.4:5.2	said Venerable Puṇṇaka,
snp5.4:5.3	“have not, by sacrificing, crossed over rebirth and old age,
snp5.4:5.4	then who exactly in the world of gods and humans
snp5.4:5.5	has crossed over rebirth and old age, good sir?
snp5.4:5.6	I ask you, Blessed One; please tell me this.”
snp5.4:6.1	“Having assessed the world high and low,” 
snp5.4:6.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.4:6.3	“there is nothing in the world that disturbs them. 
snp5.4:6.4	Peaceful, unclouded, untroubled, with no need for hope—
snp5.4:6.5	they’ve crossed over rebirth and old age, I declare.”
snp5.5:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp5.5:0.2	The Questions of Mettagū
snp5.5:1.1	“I ask you, Blessed One; please tell me this,”
snp5.5:1.2	said Venerable Mettagū,
snp5.5:1.3	“for I think you are a knowledge master, evolved.
snp5.5:1.4	Where do all these sufferings come from,
snp5.5:1.5	in all their countless forms in the world?”
snp5.5:2.1	“You have rightly asked me of the origin of suffering,”
snp5.5:2.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.5:2.3	“I shall tell you as I understand it.
snp5.5:2.4	Attachment is the source of suffering
snp5.5:2.5	in all its countless forms in the world.
snp5.5:3.1	When an ignorant person builds up attachments,
snp5.5:3.2	that idiot returns to suffering again and again.
snp5.5:3.3	So let one who understands not build up attachments,
snp5.5:3.4	contemplating the birth and origin of suffering.” 
snp5.5:4.1	“Whatever I asked you have explained to me.
snp5.5:4.2	I ask you once more, please tell me this:
snp5.5:4.3	How do the wise cross the flood
snp5.5:4.4	of rebirth, old age, sorrow, and lamenting?
snp5.5:4.5	Please, sage, answer me clearly,
snp5.5:4.6	for truly you understand this matter.”
snp5.5:5.1	“I shall extol a teaching to you,”
snp5.5:5.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.5:5.3	“that is apparent in the present, not relying on tradition.
snp5.5:5.4	Having understood it, one who lives mindfully
snp5.5:5.5	may cross over clinging in the world.”
snp5.5:6.1	“And I rejoice, great hermit,
snp5.5:6.2	in that supreme teaching,
snp5.5:6.3	having understood which, one who lives mindfully
snp5.5:6.4	may cross over clinging in the world.”
snp5.5:7.1	“Once you’ve expelled relishing and dogmatism,”
snp5.5:7.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.5:7.3	“regarding everything you are aware of—
snp5.5:7.4	above, below, all round, between—
snp5.5:7.5	don’t plant consciousness in a new life.
snp5.5:8.1	A mendicant who wanders meditating like this,
snp5.5:8.2	diligent and mindful, calling nothing their own,
snp5.5:8.3	would, being wise, give up the suffering
snp5.5:8.4	of rebirth, old age, sorrow and lamenting right here.”
snp5.5:9.1	“I rejoice in the words of the great hermit!
snp5.5:9.2	You have expounded non-attachment well, Gotama.
snp5.5:9.3	Clearly the Buddha has given up suffering,
snp5.5:9.4	for truly you understand this matter.
snp5.5:10.1	Surely those you’d regularly instruct
snp5.5:10.2	would also give up suffering.
snp5.5:10.3	Therefore, having met, I bow to you, O spiritual giant;
snp5.5:10.4	hopefully the Buddha may regularly instruct me.”
snp5.5:11.1	“Any brahmin recognized as a knowledge master,
snp5.5:11.2	who has nothing, unattached to sensual life,
snp5.5:11.3	clearly has crossed this flood,
snp5.5:11.4	crossed to the far shore, kind, wishless.
snp5.5:12.1	And a wise person here, a knowledge master,
snp5.5:12.2	having untied the bond to live after life,
snp5.5:12.3	free of craving, untroubled, with no need for hope,
snp5.5:12.4	has crossed over rebirth and old age, I declare.” 
snp5.6:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp5.6:0.2	The Questions of Dhotaka
snp5.6:1.1	“I ask you, Blessed One; please tell me this,”
snp5.6:1.2	said Venerable Dhotaka,
snp5.6:1.3	“I long for your voice, great hermit.
snp5.6:1.4	After hearing your message,
snp5.6:1.5	I shall train myself for quenching.”
snp5.6:2.1	“Well then, be keen, alert,”
snp5.6:2.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.6:2.3	“and mindful right here.
snp5.6:2.4	After hearing this message, go on
snp5.6:2.5	and train yourself for quenching.”
snp5.6:3.1	“I see in the world of gods and humans
snp5.6:3.2	a brahmin travelling with nothing.
snp5.6:3.3	Therefore I bow to you, all-seer:
snp5.6:3.4	release me, Sakyan, from my doubts.”
snp5.6:4.1	“I am not able to release anyone
snp5.6:4.2	 in the world who has doubts, Dhotaka.
snp5.6:4.3	But when you understand the best of teachings,
snp5.6:4.4	you shall cross this flood.”
snp5.6:5.1	“Teach me, brahmin, out of compassion,
snp5.6:5.2	the principle of seclusion so that I may understand.
snp5.6:5.3	I wish to practice right here, peaceful, independent,
snp5.6:5.4	as unimpeded as space.”
snp5.6:6.1	“I shall extol that peace for you,”
snp5.6:6.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.6:6.3	“that is apparent in the present, not relying on tradition.
snp5.6:6.4	Having understood it, one who lives mindfully
snp5.6:6.5	may cross over clinging in the world.”
snp5.6:7.1	“And I rejoice, great hermit,
snp5.6:7.2	in that supreme peace,
snp5.6:7.3	having understood which, one who lives mindfully
snp5.6:7.4	may cross over clinging in the world.”
snp5.6:8.1	“Once you have understood that everything,”
snp5.6:8.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.6:8.3	“you are aware of in the world—
snp5.6:8.4	above, below, all round, between—
snp5.6:8.5	is a snare, don’t crave for life after life.”
snp5.7:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp5.7:0.2	The Questions of Upasiva
snp5.7:1.1	“Alone and independent, O Sakyan,”
snp5.7:1.2	said Venerable Upasiva,
snp5.7:1.3	“I am not able to cross the great flood.
snp5.7:1.4	Tell me a support, All-seer,
snp5.7:1.5	depending on which I may cross this flood.”
snp5.7:2.1	“Mindfully contemplating nothingness,”
snp5.7:2.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.7:2.3	depending on the perception ‘there is nothing’, cross the flood.
snp5.7:2.4	Giving up sensual pleasures, refraining from chatter,
snp5.7:2.5	watch day and night for the ending of craving.”
snp5.7:3.1	“One who is free of sensual desire,”
snp5.7:3.2	said Venerable Upasiva,
snp5.7:3.3	“depending on nothingness, all else left behind,
snp5.7:3.4	freed in the ultimate liberation of perception:
snp5.7:3.5	would they remain there without travelling on?”
snp5.7:4.1	“One free of sensual desire,”
snp5.7:4.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.7:4.3	“depending on nothingness, all else left behind,
snp5.7:4.4	freed in the ultimate liberation of perception:
snp5.7:4.5	they would remain there without travelling on.”
snp5.7:5.1	“If they were to remain there without travelling on,
snp5.7:5.2	even for many years, All-seer,
snp5.7:5.3	and, growing cool right there, were freed,
snp5.7:5.4	would the consciousness of such a one pass away?”
snp5.7:6.1	“As a flame tossed by a gust of wind,”
snp5.7:6.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.7:6.3	“comes to an end and no longer counts;
snp5.7:6.4	so too, a sage freed from mental phenomena
snp5.7:6.5	comes to an end and no longer counts.”
snp5.7:7.1	“One who has comes to an end—do they not exist?
snp5.7:7.2	Or are they eternally well?
snp5.7:7.3	Please, sage, answer me clearly,
snp5.7:7.4	for truly you understand this matter.”
snp5.7:8.1	“One who’s come to an end cannot be measured,”
snp5.7:8.2	replied the Buddha.
snp5.7:8.3	“They have nothing by which one might describe them.
snp5.7:8.4	When all things have been eradicated,
snp5.7:8.5	eradicated, too, are all ways of speech.”
snp5.8:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp5.8:0.2	The Questions of Nanda
snp5.8:1.1	“People say there are sages in the world,”
snp5.8:1.2	said Venerable Nanda,
snp5.8:1.3	“but how is this the case?
snp5.8:1.4	Is someone called a sage because of their knowledge,
snp5.8:1.5	or because of their way of life?”
snp5.8:2.1	“Experts do not speak of a sage in terms of
snp5.8:2.2	view, oral transmission, or notion.
snp5.8:2.3	Those who are sages live far from the crowd, I say,
snp5.8:2.4	untroubled, with no need for hope.”
snp5.8:3.1	“As to those ascetics and brahmins,”
snp5.8:3.2	said Venerable Nanda,
snp5.8:3.3	“who speak of purity in terms of what is seen or heard,
snp5.8:3.4	or in terms of precepts and vows,
snp5.8:3.5	or in terms of countless different things.
snp5.8:3.6	Living self-controlled in that matter,
snp5.8:3.7	have they crossed over rebirth and old age, good sir?
snp5.8:3.8	I ask you, Blessed One; please tell me this.”
snp5.8:4.1	“As to those ascetics and brahmins,”
snp5.8:4.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.8:4.3	“who speak of purity in terms of what is seen or heard,
snp5.8:4.4	or in terms of precepts and vows,
snp5.8:4.5	or in terms of countless different things.
snp5.8:4.6	Even though they live self-controlled in that matter,
snp5.8:4.7	they’ve not crossed over rebirth and old age, I declare.”
snp5.8:5.1	“As to those ascetics and brahmins,”
snp5.8:5.2	said Venerable Nanda,
snp5.8:5.3	“who speak of purity in terms of what is seen or heard,
snp5.8:5.4	or in terms of precepts and vows,
snp5.8:5.5	or in terms of countless different things.
snp5.8:5.6	You say they have not crossed the flood, sage.
snp5.8:5.7	Then who exactly in the world of gods and humans
snp5.8:5.8	has crossed over rebirth and old age, good sir?
snp5.8:5.9	I ask you, Blessed One; please tell me this.”
snp5.8:6.1	“I don’t say that all ascetics and brahmins,”
snp5.8:6.2	replied the Buddha,
snp5.8:6.3	“are shrouded by rebirth and old age.
snp5.8:6.4	There are those here who have given up all 
snp5.8:6.5	that is seen, heard, and thought, and precepts and vows,
snp5.8:6.6	who have given up all the countless different things.
snp5.8:6.7	Fully understanding craving, free of defilements,
snp5.8:6.8	those people, I say, have crossed the flood.”
snp5.8:7.1	“I rejoice in the words of the great hermit!
snp5.8:7.2	You have expounded non-attachment well, Gotama.
snp5.8:7.3	There are those here who have given up all 
snp5.8:7.4	that is seen, heard, and thought, and precepts and vows,
snp5.8:7.5	who have given up all the countless different things.
snp5.8:7.6	Fully understanding craving, free of defilements,
snp5.8:7.7	those people, I agree, have crossed the flood.”
snp5.9:0.1	Anthology of Discourses
snp5.9:0.2	The Questions of Hemaka
snp5.9:1.1	“Those who have previously answered me,”
snp5.9:1.2	said Venerable Hemaka,
snp5.9:1.3	“before I encountered Gotama’s teaching,
snp5.9:1.4	said ‘thus it was’ or ‘so it shall be’.
snp5.9:1.5	All that was just the testament of hearsay;
snp5.9:1.6	all that just fostered speculation:
snp5.9:1.7	I found no delight in that.
snp5.9:2.1	But you, sage, explain to me
snp5.9:2.2	 the teaching that destroys craving.
snp5.9:2.3	Having understood it, one who lives mindfully
snp5.9:2.4	may cross over clinging in the world.”
snp5.9:3.1	“The removal of desire and lust, Hemaka,
snp5.9:3.2	for what is seen, heard, thought, or cognized here;
snp5.9:3.3	for anything liked or disliked,
snp5.9:3.4	is extinguishment, the imperishable state.
snp5.9:4.1	Those who have fully understood this, mindful,
snp5.9:4.2	are extinguished in this very life. 
snp5.9:4.3	Always at peace,
snp5.9:4.4	they’ve crossed over clinging to the world.”
