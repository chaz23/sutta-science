an2.1:0.1	Numbered Discourses 2
an2.1:0.2	1. Punishments
an2.1:0.3	1–10
an2.1:1.0	1. Faults
an2.1:1.1	So I have heard.
an2.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an2.1:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
an2.1:1.4	“Mendicants!”
an2.1:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.
an2.1:1.6	The Buddha said this:
an2.1:2.1	“There are, mendicants, these two faults.
an2.1:2.2	What two?
an2.1:2.3	The fault apparent in the present life, and the fault to do with lives to come.
an2.1:2.4	What is the fault apparent in the present life?
an2.1:2.5	It’s when someone sees that kings have arrested a bandit, a criminal, and subjected them to various punishments—
an2.1:2.6	whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘demon’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘grass blades’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded.
an2.1:3.1	It occurs to them:
an2.1:3.2	‘If I were to commit the kinds of bad deeds for which the kings arrested that bandit, that criminal,
an2.1:3.3	NA
an2.1:3.4	the rulers would arrest me and subject me to the same punishments.
an2.1:3.5	NA
an2.1:3.6	Afraid of the fault apparent in the present life, they do not steal the belongings of others.
an2.1:3.7	This is called the fault apparent in the present life.
an2.1:4.1	What is the fault to do with lives to come?
an2.1:4.2	It’s when someone reflects:
an2.1:4.3	‘Bad conduct of body, speech, or mind has a bad, painful result in the next life.
an2.1:4.4	If I conduct myself badly,
an2.1:4.5	then, when my body breaks up, after death, won’t I be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell?’
an2.1:4.6	Afraid of the fault to do with lives to come, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure.
an2.1:4.7	This is called the fault to do with lives to come.
an2.1:4.8	These are the two faults.
an2.1:4.9	So you should train like this:
an2.1:4.10	‘We will fear the fault apparent in the present life, and we will fear the fault to do with lives to come. We will fear faults, seeing the danger in faults.’
an2.1:4.11	That’s how you should train.
an2.1:4.12	If you fear faults, seeing the danger in faults, you can expect to be freed from all faults.”
an2.1:4.13	NA
an2.2:1.0	2. Endeavor
an2.2:1.1	“These two endeavors are challenging in the world.
an2.2:1.2	What two?
an2.2:1.3	The endeavor of laypeople staying in a home to provide robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And the endeavor of those gone forth from the lay life to homelessness to let go of all attachments.
an2.2:1.4	These are the two endeavors that are challenging in the world.
an2.2:2.1	The better of these two endeavors is the effort to let go of all attachments.
an2.2:2.2	So you should train like this:
an2.2:2.3	‘We shall endeavor to let go of all attachments.’
an2.2:2.4	That’s how you should train.”
an2.2:2.5	NA
an2.3:1.0	3. Mortifying
an2.3:1.1	“These two things, mendicants, are mortifying.
an2.3:1.2	What two?

an2.3:1.4	NA
an2.3:1.5	NA
an2.3:1.6	Thinking, ‘I’ve done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind’, they’re mortified. Thinking, ‘I haven’t done good things by way of body, speech, and mind’, they’re mortified.

an2.4:1.10	NA
an2.5:1.0	5. Learned for Myself
an2.5:1.1	“Mendicants, I have learned these two things for myself—
an2.5:1.2	to never be content with skillful qualities, and to never stop trying.
an2.5:1.3	I never stopped trying, thinking:
an2.5:1.4	‘Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.’
an2.5:1.5	It was by diligence that I achieved awakening, and by diligence that I achieved the supreme sanctuary.
an2.5:1.6	If you too never stop trying, thinking:
an2.5:1.7	‘Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.’
an2.5:1.8	You will soon realize the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
an2.5:1.9	So you should train like this:
an2.5:1.10	‘We will never stop trying, thinking:
an2.5:1.11	“Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.”’
an2.5:1.12	That’s how you should train.”

an2.6:1.1	“There are, mendicants, these two things.
an2.6:1.2	What two?
an2.6:1.3	Seeing things that are prone to being fettered as gratifying, and seeing things that are prone to being fettered as boring.
an2.6:1.4	When you keep seeing things that are prone to being fettered as gratifying, you don’t give up greed, hate, and delusion.
an2.6:1.5	When these are not given up, you’re not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
an2.6:1.6	You’re not freed from suffering, I say.
an2.6:2.1	When you keep seeing things that are prone to being fettered as boring, you give up greed, hate, and delusion.
an2.6:2.2	When these are given up, you’re freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.

an2.9:1.0	9. Conduct
an2.9:1.1	“These two bright things, mendicants, protect the world.
an2.9:1.2	What two?
an2.9:1.3	Conscience and prudence.
an2.9:1.4	If these two bright things did not protect the world, there would be no recognition of the status of mother, aunts, or wives and partners of teachers and respected people.
an2.9:1.5	The world would become promiscuous, like goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and dogs and jackals.
an2.9:1.6	But because the two bright things protect the world, there is recognition of the status of mother, aunts, and wives and partners of teachers and respected people.”

an2.11:1.2	What two?
an2.11:1.3	The power of reflection and the power of development.
an2.11:1.4	And what, mendicants, is the power of reflection?
an2.11:1.5	It’s when someone reflects:
an2.11:1.6	‘Bad conduct of body, speech, or mind has a bad, painful result in both this life and the next.’
an2.11:1.7	Reflecting like this, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure.
an2.11:1.8	This is called the power of reflection.
an2.11:2.1	And what, mendicants, is the power of development?
an2.11:2.2	In this context, the power of development is the power of the trainees.
an2.11:2.3	For when you rely on the power of a trainee, you give up greed, hate, and delusion.
an2.11:2.4	Then you don’t do anything unskillful, or practice anything bad.

an2.12:2.5	rapture,

an2.13:2.2	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an2.13:2.3	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an2.13:2.4	And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
an2.13:2.5	Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.

an2.14:1.4	These are two ways of teaching the Dhamma.”

an2.15:1.1	“Mendicants, in a disciplinary issue, if neither the offending mendicant nor the accusing mendicant carefully checks themselves, you can expect that issue
an2.15:1.2	will lead to lasting acrimony and enmity, and the mendicants won’t live comfortably.
an2.15:1.3	But in a disciplinary issue, if both the offending mendicant and the accusing mendicant carefully check themselves, you can expect that issue
an2.15:1.4	won’t lead to lasting acrimony and enmity, and the mendicants will live comfortably.
an2.15:2.1	And how, mendicants, does an offending mendicant carefully check themselves?
an2.15:2.2	An offending mendicant reflects:
an2.15:2.3	‘I have committed a certain unskillful offense with the body.
an2.15:2.4	That mendicant saw me do this.
an2.15:2.5	If I hadn’t committed that offense, they wouldn’t have seen me.
an2.15:2.6	But since I did commit that offense, they did see me.
an2.15:2.7	When they saw me, they were upset,
an2.15:2.8	and they voiced their unhappiness to me.
an2.15:2.9	Then I also got upset,

an2.16:1.1	Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.
an2.16:1.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:

an2.16:1.4	“Unprincipled and immoral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.”
an2.16:2.1	“What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?”
an2.16:2.2	“Principled and moral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”
an2.16:3.1	“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!
an2.16:3.2	As if he was righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.
an2.16:3.3	I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.

an2.17:1.1	Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
an2.17:1.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
an2.17:1.3	“What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell?”
an2.17:1.4	“What they’ve done and what they’ve not done.
an2.17:1.5	That’s why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.”
an2.17:1.6	“But what is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?”
an2.17:1.7	“What they’ve done and what they’ve not done.
an2.17:1.8	That’s why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”
an2.17:1.9	“I don’t understand the meaning of what Master Gotama has said in brief, without explaining the details.
an2.17:1.10	Master Gotama, please teach me this matter in detail so I can understand the meaning.”
an2.17:1.11	“Well then, brahmin, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an2.17:1.12	“Yes sir,” Jāṇussoṇi replied.
an2.17:1.13	The Buddha said this:
an2.17:2.1	“Firstly, brahmin, someone has done bad things and not done good things by way of body, speech, and mind.
an2.17:2.2	NA
an2.17:2.3	NA
an2.17:2.4	So what they’ve done and what they’ve not done is why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
an2.17:2.5	Furthermore, brahmin, someone has done good things and not done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.
an2.17:2.6	NA
an2.17:2.7	NA
an2.17:2.8	So what they’ve done and what they’ve not done is why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”

an2.18:1.0	18
an2.18:1.1	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,
an2.18:1.2	“Ānanda, I absolutely say that you should not do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.”
an2.18:1.3	“But, sir, if someone does these things that should not be done, what drawbacks should they expect?”
an2.18:1.4	“They should expect these drawbacks.
an2.18:1.5	They blame themselves.
an2.18:1.6	After examination, sensible people criticize them.
an2.18:1.7	They get a bad reputation.
an2.18:1.8	They feel lost when they die.
an2.18:1.9	And when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
an2.18:1.10	These are the drawbacks they should expect.”
an2.18:2.1	“Ānanda, I absolutely say that you should do good things by way of body, speech, and mind.”
an2.18:2.2	“But, sir, if someone does these things that should be done, what benefits should they expect?”
an2.18:2.3	“They should expect these benefits.
an2.18:2.4	They don’t blame themselves.
an2.18:2.5	After examination, sensible people praise them.
an2.18:2.6	They get a good reputation.
an2.18:2.7	They don’t feel lost when they die.
an2.18:2.8	And when the body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
an2.18:2.9	These are the benefits they should expect.”
an2.19:1.0	19
an2.19:1.1	“Mendicants, give up the unskillful.
an2.19:1.2	It is possible to give up the unskillful.
an2.19:1.3	If it wasn’t possible, I wouldn’t say:
an2.19:1.4	‘Give up the unskillful.’
an2.19:1.5	But it is possible, and so I say:
an2.19:1.6	‘Give up the unskillful.’
an2.19:1.7	And if giving up the unskillful led to harm and suffering, I would not say:
an2.19:1.8	‘Give up the unskillful.’
an2.19:1.9	But giving up the unskillful leads to welfare and happiness, so I say:
an2.19:1.10	‘Give up the unskillful.’
an2.19:2.1	Mendicants, develop the skillful.
an2.19:2.2	It is possible to develop the skillful.
an2.19:2.3	If it wasn’t possible, I wouldn’t say:
an2.19:2.4	‘Develop the skillful.’
an2.19:2.5	But it is possible, and so I say:

an2.19:2.7	If developing the skillful led to harm and suffering I wouldn’t say:

an2.21:1.3	One who doesn’t recognize when they’ve made a mistake. And one who doesn’t properly accept the confession of someone who’s made a mistake.

an2.31:1.0	31
an2.31:1.1	“These two things play a part in realization.

an2.32:0.3	32–41
an2.32:1.0	32
an2.32:1.1	“Mendicants, I will teach you the level of the bad person and the level of the good person.
an2.32:1.2	Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an2.32:1.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.
an2.32:1.4	The Buddha said this:
an2.32:2.1	“What is the level of the bad person?
an2.32:2.2	The bad person is ungrateful and thankless,
an2.32:2.3	for the wicked only know how to be ungrateful and thankless.
an2.32:2.4	It is totally the level of a bad person to be ungrateful and thankless.
an2.32:2.5	The good person is grateful and thankful,
an2.32:2.6	for the virtuous only know how to be grateful and thankful.
an2.32:2.7	It is totally the level of a good person to be grateful and thankful.”
an2.33:1.0	33
an2.33:1.1	“Mendicants, I say that these two people cannot easily be repaid.
an2.33:1.2	What two?
an2.33:1.3	Mother and father.
an2.33:1.4	You would not have done enough to repay your mother and father even if you were to carry your mother around on one shoulder and your father on the other, and if you lived like this for a hundred years, and if you were to anoint, massage, bathe, and rub them;
an2.33:1.5	and even if they were to defecate and urinate right there.
an2.33:1.6	Even if you were to establish your mother and father as supreme monarchs of this great earth, abounding in the seven treasures, you would still not have done enough to repay them.
an2.33:1.7	Why is that?
an2.33:1.8	Parents are very helpful to their children: they raise them, nurture them, and show them the world.
an2.33:1.9	But you have done enough, more than enough, to repay them if you encourage, settle, and ground unfaithful parents in faith, unethical parents in ethical conduct, stingy parents in generosity, or ignorant parents in wisdom.”
an2.34:1.0	34
an2.34:1.1	Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,
an2.34:1.2	“What does Master Gotama teach? What does he explain?”
an2.34:1.3	“Brahmin, I teach action and inaction.”
an2.34:1.4	“But in what way does Master Gotama teach action and inaction?”
an2.34:2.1	“I teach inaction regarding bad bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and the many kinds of unskillful things.
an2.34:2.2	I teach action regarding good bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and the many kinds of skillful things.
an2.34:2.3	This is the kind of action and inaction that I teach.”
an2.34:3.1	“Excellent, Master Gotama! … From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
an2.35:1.0	35
an2.35:1.1	Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha,
an2.35:1.2	“How many kinds of people in the world are worthy of a religious donation? And where should a gift be given?”
an2.35:1.3	“Householder, there are two kinds of people in the world who are worthy of a religious donation:
an2.35:1.4	the trainee and the master.
an2.35:1.5	These are two kinds of people in the world who are worthy of a religious donation, and that’s where you should give a gift.”
an2.35:2.1	That is what the Buddha said.
an2.35:2.2	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:
an2.35:3.1	“In this world, the trainee and the master,
an2.35:3.2	are worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods.
an2.35:3.3	They are upright in body,
an2.35:3.4	speech, and mind.
an2.35:3.5	This is the field for sponsors of sacrifice—
an2.35:3.6	what’s given here is very fruitful.”
an2.36:1.0	36
an2.36:1.1	So I have heard.
an2.36:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an2.36:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.
an2.36:1.4	There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:
an2.36:1.5	“Reverends, mendicants!”
an2.36:1.6	“Reverend,” they replied.
an2.36:1.7	Sāriputta said this:
an2.36:1.8	“I will teach you about a person fettered internally and one fettered externally.
an2.36:1.9	Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an2.36:1.10	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.
an2.36:1.11	Sāriputta said this:
an2.36:2.1	“Who is a person fettered internally?
an2.36:2.2	It’s a mendicant who is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
an2.36:2.3	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in one of the orders of gods.
an2.36:2.4	When they pass away from there, they’re a returner, who comes back to this state of existence.
an2.36:2.5	This is called a person who is fettered internally, a returner, who comes back to this state of existence.
an2.36:3.1	Who is a person fettered externally?
an2.36:3.2	It’s a mendicant who is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
an2.36:3.3	They enter and remain in a certain peaceful state of freed mind.
an2.36:3.4	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in one of the orders of gods.
an2.36:3.5	When they pass away from there, they’re a non-returner, not coming back to this state of existence.
an2.36:3.6	This is called a person who is fettered externally, a non-returner, who does not come back to this state of existence.
an2.36:4.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is ethical … they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
an2.36:4.2	They simply practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding sensual pleasures.
an2.36:4.3	They simply practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding future lives.
an2.36:4.4	They practice for the ending of craving.
an2.36:4.5	They practice for the ending of greed.
an2.36:4.6	When their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in one of the orders of gods.
an2.36:4.7	When they pass away from there, they are non-returners, not coming back to this state of existence.
an2.36:4.8	This is called a person who is fettered externally, a non-returner, who does not come back to this state of existence.”
an2.36:5.1	Then several peaceful-minded deities went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to the Buddha,
an2.36:5.2	“Sir, Venerable Sāriputta is in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, where he is teaching the mendicants about a person with internal fetters and one with external fetters.
an2.36:5.3	The assembly is overjoyed!
an2.36:5.4	Sir, please go to Venerable Sāriputta out of compassion.”
an2.36:5.5	The Buddha consented in silence.
an2.36:5.6	Then the Buddha, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, in front of Sāriputta.
an2.36:5.7	He sat on the seat spread out.
an2.36:5.8	Sāriputta bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.
an2.36:5.9	The Buddha said to him:
an2.36:6.1	“Just now, Sāriputta, several peaceful-minded deities came up to me, bowed, and stood to one side. Those deities said to me:
an2.36:6.2	‘Sir, Venerable Sāriputta is in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, where he is teaching the mendicants about a person with internal fetters and one with external fetters.
an2.36:6.3	The assembly is overjoyed!
an2.36:6.4	Sir, please go to Venerable Sāriputta out of compassion.’
an2.36:6.5	Those deities, though they number ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or sixty, can stand on the point of a needle without bumping up against each other.
an2.36:6.6	Sāriputta, you might think:
an2.36:6.7	‘Surely those deities, since so many of them can stand on the point of a needle without bumping up against each other, must have developed their minds in that place.’
an2.36:6.8	But you should not see it like this.
an2.36:6.9	It was right here that those deities developed their minds.
an2.36:6.10	So you should train like this:
an2.36:6.11	‘We shall have peaceful faculties and peaceful minds.’
an2.36:6.12	That’s how you should train.
an2.36:6.13	When your faculties and mind are peaceful, your acts of body, speech, and mind will be peaceful, thinking:
an2.36:6.14	‘We shall present the gift of peace to our spiritual companions.’
an2.36:6.15	That’s how you should train.
an2.36:6.16	Those wanderers who follow other paths, Sāriputta, who have not heard this exposition of the teaching are lost.”
an2.37:1.0	37
an2.37:1.1	So I have heard.
an2.37:1.2	At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying at Varaṇā, on the bank of the Kaddama Lake.
an2.37:1.3	Then the brahmin Ārāmadaṇḍa went up to Mahākaccāna, and exchanged greetings with him.
an2.37:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Mahākaccāna:
an2.37:1.5	“What is the cause, Master Kaccāna, what is the reason why aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, and householders fight with householders?”
an2.37:1.6	“It is because of their insistence on sensual desire, their shackles, avarice, and attachment, that aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, and householders fight with householders.”
an2.37:2.1	“What is the cause, Master Kaccāna, what is the reason why ascetics fight with ascetics?”
an2.37:2.2	“It is because of their insistence on views, their shackles, avarice, and attachment, that ascetics fight with ascetics.”
an2.37:3.1	“Master Kaccāna, is there anyone in the world who has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views?”
an2.37:3.2	“There is, brahmin.”
an2.37:4.1	“Who in the world has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views?”
an2.37:4.2	“In the eastern lands there is a city called Sāvatthī.
an2.37:4.3	There the Blessed One is now staying, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.
an2.37:4.4	He, brahmin, has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views.”
an2.37:5.1	When this was said, the brahmin Ārāmadaṇḍa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times:
an2.37:6.1	“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!
an2.37:7.1	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!
an2.37:8.1	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!
an2.37:9.1	He who has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views.
an2.37:10.1	Excellent, Master Kaccāna! Excellent!
an2.37:10.2	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Kaccāna has made the teaching clear in many ways.
an2.37:10.3	I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
an2.37:10.4	From this day forth, may Master Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
an2.38:1.0	38
an2.38:1.1	At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying near Madhurā, in Gunda’s Grove.
an2.38:1.2	Then the brahmin Kandarāyana went up to Mahākaccāna, and exchanged greetings with him … He sat down to one side and said to Mahākaccāna:
an2.38:1.3	“I have heard, Master Kaccāna, that the ascetic Kaccāna doesn’t bow to old brahmins, the elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat.
an2.38:1.4	And this is indeed the case,
an2.38:1.5	for the ascetic Kaccāna does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat.
an2.38:1.6	This is not appropriate, Master Kaccāna.”
an2.38:2.1	“There is the stage of an elder and the stage of youth as explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.
an2.38:2.2	If an elder, though eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old, still dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying them, consumed by thoughts of them, burning with fever for them, and eagerly seeking more,
an2.38:2.3	they are reckoned as a child, not a senior.
an2.38:2.4	If a youth, young, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life,
an2.38:2.5	does not dwell in the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying them, consumed by thoughts of them, burning with fever for them, and eagerly seeking more,
an2.38:2.6	they are reckoned as astute, a senior.”
an2.38:3.1	When this was said, the brahmin Kandarāyana got up from his seat, placed his robe over one shoulder, and bowed with his head at the feet of the young mendicants, saying,
an2.38:3.2	“The masters are elders, at the stage of the elder;
an2.38:3.3	we are youths, at the stage of youth.
an2.38:4.1	Excellent, Master Kaccāna! … From this day forth, may Master Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
an2.39:1.0	39
an2.39:1.1	“At a time when bandits are strong, kings are weak.
an2.39:1.2	Then the king is not at ease when going out or coming back or when touring the provinces.
an2.39:1.3	The brahmins and householders, likewise, are not at ease when going out or coming back, or when inspecting their business activities.
an2.39:1.4	In the same way, at a time when bad mendicants are strong, good-hearted mendicants are weak.
an2.39:1.5	Then the good-hearted mendicants continually adhere to silence in the midst of the Saṅgha, or they stay in the borderlands.
an2.39:1.6	This is for the hurt and unhappiness of the people, for the harm, hurt, and suffering of many people, of gods and humans.
an2.39:2.1	At a time when kings are strong, bandits are weak.
an2.39:2.2	Then the king is at ease when going out or coming back or when inspecting the provinces.
an2.39:2.3	The brahmins and householders, likewise, are at ease when going out or coming back, or when inspecting their business activities.
an2.39:2.4	In the same way, at a time when good-hearted mendicants are strong, bad mendicants are weak.
an2.39:2.5	Then the bad mendicants continually adhere to silence in the midst of the Saṅgha, or they leave for some place or other.
an2.39:2.6	This is for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.”
an2.40:1.0	40
an2.40:1.1	“Mendicants, I don’t praise wrong practice for these two, for laypeople and renunciates.
an2.40:1.2	Because of wrong practice, neither laypeople nor renunciates succeed in completing the procedure of the skillful teaching.
an2.40:2.1	I praise right practice for these two, for laypeople and renunciates.
an2.40:2.2	Because of right practice, both laypeople and renunciates succeed in completing the procedure of the skillful teaching.”
an2.41:1.0	41
an2.41:1.1	“Mendicants, by memorizing the discourses incorrectly, taking only a semblance of the phrasing, some mendicants shut out the meaning and the teaching. They act for the hurt and unhappiness of the people, for the harm, hurt, and suffering of many people, of gods and humans.
an2.41:1.2	They make much bad karma and make the true teaching disappear.
an2.41:2.1	But by memorizing the discourses well, not taking only a semblance of the phrasing, some mendicants reinforce the meaning and the teaching. They act for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of the people, of gods and humans.
an2.41:2.2	They make much merit and make the true teaching continue.”
an2.42:0.1	Numbered Discourses 2
an2.42:0.2	5. Assemblies
an2.42:0.3	42–51
an2.42:1.0	42
an2.42:1.1	“There are, mendicants, these two assemblies.
an2.42:1.2	What two?
an2.42:1.3	A shallow assembly and a deep assembly.
an2.42:1.4	And what is a shallow assembly?
an2.42:1.5	An assembly where the mendicants are restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties.
an2.42:1.6	This is called a shallow assembly.
an2.42:2.1	And what is a deep assembly?
an2.42:2.2	An assembly where the mendicants are not restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, or loose-tongued, but have established mindfulness, situational awareness, immersion, unified minds, and restrained faculties.
an2.42:2.3	This is called a deep assembly.
an2.42:2.4	These are the two assemblies.
an2.42:2.5	The better of these two assemblies is the deep assembly.”
an2.43:1.0	43
an2.43:1.1	“There are, mendicants, these two assemblies.
an2.43:1.2	What two?
an2.43:1.3	A divided assembly and a harmonious assembly.
an2.43:1.4	And what is a divided assembly?
an2.43:1.5	An assembly where the mendicants argue, quarrel, and dispute, continually wounding each other with barbed words.
an2.43:1.6	This is called a divided assembly.
an2.43:2.1	And what is a harmonious assembly?
an2.43:2.2	An assembly where the mendicants live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes.
an2.43:2.3	This is called a harmonious assembly.
an2.43:2.4	These are the two assemblies.
an2.43:2.5	The better of these two assemblies is the harmonious assembly.”

an2.44:1.1	“There are, mendicants, these two assemblies.
an2.44:1.2	What two?
an2.44:1.3	An assembly of the worst and an assembly of the best.
an2.44:1.4	And what is an assembly of the worst?
an2.44:1.5	An assembly where the senior mendicants are indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, not rousing energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.
an2.44:1.6	Those who come after follow their example.
an2.44:1.7	They too become indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, not rousing energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.
an2.44:1.8	This is called an assembly of the worst.
an2.44:2.1	And what is an assembly of the best?
an2.44:2.2	An assembly where the senior mendicants are not indulgent or slack, nor are they backsliders; instead, they take the lead in seclusion, rousing energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.
an2.44:2.3	Those who come after follow their example.
an2.44:2.4	They too are not indulgent or slack, nor are they backsliders; instead, they take the lead in seclusion, rousing energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.
an2.44:2.5	This is called an assembly of the best.
an2.44:2.6	These are the two assemblies.

an3.1:1.1	So I have heard.
an3.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an3.1:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
an3.1:1.4	“Mendicants!”
an3.1:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.
an3.1:1.6	The Buddha said this:
an3.1:2.1	“Whatever dangers there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.
an3.1:2.2	Whatever perils there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.
an3.1:2.3	Whatever hazards there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.
an3.1:2.4	It’s like a fire that spreads from a hut made of reeds or grass, and burns down even a bungalow, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with latches fastened and windows shuttered.
an3.1:2.5	In the same way, whatever dangers there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.
an3.1:2.6	Whatever perils there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.
an3.1:2.7	Whatever hazards there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.
an3.1:3.1	So, the fool is dangerous, but the astute person is safe.
an3.1:3.2	The fool is perilous, but the astute person is not.
an3.1:3.3	The fool is hazardous, but the astute person is not.
an3.1:3.4	There’s no danger, peril, or hazard that comes from the astute.
an3.1:4.1	So you should train like this:
an3.1:4.2	‘We will reject the three things by which a fool is known, and we will undertake and follow the three things by which an astute person is known.’

an3.13:1.2	What three?
an3.13:1.3	The hopeless, the hopeful, and the one who has done away with hope.
an3.13:1.4	And what, mendicants, is a hopeless person?
an3.13:1.5	It’s when some person is reborn in a low family—a family of outcastes, bamboo-workers, hunters, chariot-makers, or waste-collectors—poor, with little to eat or drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find.
an3.13:1.6	And they’re ugly, unsightly, deformed, chronically ill—one-eyed, crippled, lame, or half-paralyzed. They don’t get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, fragrances, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting.
an3.13:1.7	They hear this:

an3.13:1.11	This is called a hopeless person.
an3.13:2.1	And what, mendicants, is a hopeful person?
an3.13:2.2	It’s when some person is the eldest son of an anointed aristocratic king. He has not yet been anointed, but is eligible, and has been confirmed in the succession.
an3.13:2.3	He hears this:
an3.13:2.4	‘They say that the aristocrats have anointed the aristocrat named so-and-so as king.’
an3.13:2.5	It occurs to him:
an3.13:2.6	‘Oh, when will the aristocrats anoint me too as king?’
an3.13:2.7	This is called a hopeful person.
an3.13:3.1	And what, mendicants, is a person who has done away with hope?

an3.13:3.5	It never occurs to him:
an3.13:3.6	‘Oh, when will the aristocrats anoint me too as king?’
an3.13:3.7	Why is that?
an3.13:3.8	Because the former hope he had to be anointed has now died down.
an3.13:3.9	This is called a person who has done away with hope.
an3.13:3.10	These are the three kinds of people found in the world.
an3.13:4.1	In the same way, these three kinds of people are found among the mendicants.

an3.13:4.4	And what, mendicants, is a hopeless person?
an3.13:4.5	It’s when some person is unethical, of bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual practitioner—though claiming to be one—rotten inside, corrupt, and depraved.
an3.13:4.6	They hear this:

an3.13:4.10	This is called a hopeless person.
an3.13:5.1	And what, mendicants, is a hopeful person?

an3.13:5.7	This is called a hopeful person.
an3.13:6.1	And what, mendicants, is a person who has done away with hope?
an3.13:6.2	It’s when a mendicant is a perfected one, who has ended all defilements.
an3.13:6.3	They hear this:

an3.14:1.1	“Mendicants, even a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king, does not wield power without having their own king.”
an3.14:1.2	When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha:
an3.14:1.3	“But who is the king of the wheel-turning monarch, the just and principled king?”
an3.14:1.4	“It is principle, monk,” said the Buddha.
an3.14:1.5	“Monk, a wheel-turning monarch provides just protection and security for his court, relying only on principle—honoring, respecting, and venerating principle, having principle as his flag, banner, and authority.
an3.14:2.1	He provides just protection and security for his aristocrats, vassals, troops, brahmins and householders, people of town and country, ascetics and brahmins, beasts and birds.
an3.14:2.2	When he has done this, he wields power only in a principled manner.
an3.14:2.3	And this power cannot be undermined by any human enemy.
an3.14:3.1	In the same way, monk, a Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, a just and principled king, provides just protection and security regarding bodily actions, relying only on principle—honoring, respecting, and venerating principle, having principle as his flag, banner, and authority.
an3.14:3.2	‘This kind of bodily action should be cultivated. This kind of bodily action should not be cultivated.’
an3.14:4.1	Furthermore, a Realized One … provides just protection and security regarding verbal actions, saying:
an3.14:4.2	‘This kind of verbal action should be cultivated. This kind of verbal action should not be cultivated.’ … And regarding mental actions:
an3.14:4.3	‘This kind of mental action should be cultivated. This kind of mental action should not be cultivated.’
an3.14:5.1	And when a Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha has provided just protection and security regarding actions of body, speech, and mind, he rolls forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma.
an3.14:5.2	And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.”
an3.15:0.1	Numbered Discourses 3
an3.15:0.2	2. The Chariot-Maker
an3.15:0.3	15. About Pacetana
an3.15:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana.
an3.15:1.2	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
an3.15:1.3	“Mendicants!”
an3.15:1.4	“Venerable sir,” they replied.
an3.15:1.5	The Buddha said this:
an3.15:2.1	“Once upon a time there was a king named Pacetana.
an3.15:2.2	Then King Pacetana addressed his chariot-maker,
an3.15:2.3	‘In six months’ time, my good chariot-maker, there will be a battle.
an3.15:2.4	Are you able to make me a new pair of wheels?’
an3.15:2.5	‘I can, Your Majesty,’ replied the chariot-maker.
an3.15:2.6	Then, when it was six days less than six months later, the chariot-maker had finished one wheel.
an3.15:2.7	Then King Pacetana addressed his chariot-maker,
an3.15:2.8	‘In six days’ time there will be a battle. Is my new pair of wheels finished?’
an3.15:2.9	‘Now that it is six days less than six months, Your Majesty, I have finished one wheel.’
an3.15:2.10	‘Are you able to finish the second wheel in these six days?’
an3.15:2.11	Saying, ‘I can, Your Majesty,’ the chariot-maker finished the second wheel in six days. Taking the pair of wheels he went up to King Pacetana, and said this to the king,
an3.15:2.12	‘Your Majesty, these are your two new wheels, finished.’
an3.15:2.13	‘But, my good chariot-maker, what is the difference between the wheel that was finished in six days less than six months, and the wheel finished in just six days?
an3.15:2.14	Because I can’t see any difference between them.’
an3.15:2.15	‘But, Your Majesty, there is a difference.
an3.15:2.16	See now what it is.’
an3.15:3.1	Then the chariot-maker rolled forth the wheel that had been finished in six days.
an3.15:3.2	It rolled as far as the original impetus took it, then wobbled and fell down.
an3.15:3.3	Then he rolled forth the wheel that had been finished in six days less than six months.
an3.15:3.4	It rolled as far as the original impetus took it, then stood still as if fixed to an axle.
an3.15:4.1	‘But what is the cause, my good chariot-maker, what is the reason why the wheel that was finished in six days wobbled and fell,
an3.15:4.2	while the one that was finished in six days less than six months stood still as if fixed to an axle?’
an3.15:4.3	‘The wheel that was finished in six days, Your Majesty, is crooked, flawed, and defective in rim, spoke, and hub.
an3.15:4.4	That’s why it wobbled and fell.
an3.15:4.5	The wheel that was finished in six days less than six months, Your Majesty, is not crooked, flawed, and defective in rim, spoke, and hub.
an3.15:4.6	That’s why it stood still as if fixed to an axle.’
an3.15:5.1	Now, mendicants, you might think:
an3.15:5.2	‘Surely that chariot-maker must have been someone else at that time?’
an3.15:5.3	But you should not see it like that.
an3.15:5.4	I myself was the chariot-maker at that time.
an3.15:5.5	Then I was skilled in the crooks, flaws, and defects of wood.
an3.15:5.6	Now that I am a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, I am skilled in the crooks, flaws, and defects of actions by body, speech, and mind.
an3.15:5.7	Whatever monk or nun has not given up the crooks, flaws, and defects of body, speech, and mind has fallen from the teaching and training, just like the wheel that was finished in six days.
an3.15:6.1	Whatever monk or nun has given up the crooks, flaws, and defects of body, speech, and mind is established in the teaching and training, just like the wheel that was finished in six days less than six months.
an3.15:7.1	So you should train like this:
an3.15:7.2	‘We will give up the crooks, flaws, and defects of body, speech, and mind.’
an3.15:7.3	That’s how you should train.”

an3.16:1.2	What three?
an3.16:1.3	It’s when a mendicant guards the sense doors, eats in moderation, and is dedicated to wakefulness.
an3.16:2.1	And how does a mendicant guard the sense doors?
an3.16:2.2	When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
an3.16:2.3	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.
an3.16:2.4	When they hear a sound with their ears …
an3.16:2.5	When they smell an odor with their nose …
an3.16:2.6	When they taste a flavor with their tongue …
an3.16:2.7	When they feel a touch with their body …
an3.16:2.8	When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
an3.16:2.9	If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint.
an3.16:2.10	That’s how a mendicant guards the sense doors.
an3.16:3.1	And how does a mendicant eat in moderation?
an3.16:3.2	It’s when a mendicant reflects properly on the food that they eat:
an3.16:3.3	‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’
an3.16:3.4	That’s how a mendicant eats in moderation.
an3.16:4.1	And how is a mendicant dedicated to wakefulness?
an3.16:4.2	It’s when a mendicant practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind from obstacles. In the evening, they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation. In the middle of the night, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. In the last part of the night, they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying their mind from obstacles.
an3.16:4.3	This is how a mendicant is dedicated to wakefulness.
an3.16:4.4	When a mendicant has these three things their practice is guaranteed, and they have laid the groundwork for ending the defilements.”

an3.20:5.1	And how is a mendicant indefatigable?
an3.20:5.2	It’s when a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.
an3.20:5.3	That’s how a mendicant is indefatigable.
an3.20:6.1	And how does a mendicant have supporters?
an3.20:6.2	It’s when from time to time a mendicant goes up to those mendicants who are very learned—knowledgeable in the scriptures, who have memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the outlines—and asks them questions:
an3.20:6.3	‘Why, sir, does it say this? What does that mean?’
an3.20:6.4	Those venerables clarify what is unclear, reveal what is obscure, and dispel doubt regarding the many doubtful matters.
an3.20:6.5	That’s how a mendicant has supporters.
an3.20:6.6	A mendicant who has these three qualities soon acquires great and abundant skillful qualities.”

an3.21:1.1	So I have heard.
an3.21:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an3.21:1.3	Then Venerable Saviṭṭha and Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.
an3.21:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and Venerable Sāriputta said to Venerable Saviṭṭha,
an3.21:2.1	“Reverend Saviṭṭha, these three people are found in the world.
an3.21:2.2	What three?
an3.21:2.3	The personal witness, the one attained to view, and the one freed by faith.
an3.21:2.4	These are the three people found in the world.
an3.21:2.5	Of these three people, who do you believe to be the finest?”
an3.21:3.1	“Reverend Sāriputta, these three people are found in the world.

an3.21:3.3	The personal witness, the one attained to view, and the one freed by faith.
an3.21:3.4	These are the three people found in the world.
an3.21:3.5	Of these three people, I believe the person freed by faith to be finest.
an3.21:3.6	Why is that?
an3.21:3.7	Because this person’s faculty of faith is outstanding.”
an3.21:4.1	Then Sāriputta said to Mahākoṭṭhita,
an3.21:4.2	“Reverend Koṭṭhika, these three people are found in the world.
an3.21:4.3	What three?
an3.21:4.4	The personal witness, the one attained to view, and the one freed by faith.
an3.21:4.5	These are the three people found in the world.

an3.21:5.4	These are the three people found in the world.
an3.21:5.5	Of these three people, I believe the personal witness to be finest.
an3.21:5.6	Why is that?
an3.21:5.7	Because this person’s faculty of immersion is outstanding.”
an3.21:6.1	Then Mahākoṭṭhita said to Sāriputta,
an3.21:6.2	“Reverend Sāriputta, these three people are found in the world.
an3.21:6.3	What three?
an3.21:6.4	The personal witness, the one attained to view, and the one freed by faith.

an3.21:7.3	The personal witness, the one attained to view, and the one freed by faith.
an3.21:7.4	These are the three people found in the world.
an3.21:7.5	Of these three people, I believe the person attained to view to be finest.
an3.21:7.6	Why is that?
an3.21:7.7	Because this person’s faculty of wisdom is outstanding.”
an3.21:8.1	Then Sāriputta said to Saviṭṭha and Mahākoṭṭhita,
an3.21:8.2	“Each of us has spoken from the heart.
an3.21:8.3	Come, reverends, let’s go to the Buddha, and tell him about this.
an3.21:8.4	As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”
an3.21:8.5	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.
an3.21:8.6	Then Sāriputta, Saviṭṭha, and Mahākoṭṭhita went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
an3.21:8.7	Then Sāriputta told the Buddha of all they had discussed.
an3.21:9.1	“In this matter, Sāriputta, it’s not easy to definitively declare that
an3.21:9.2	one of these three people is finest.
an3.21:9.3	In some cases, a person who is freed by faith is practicing for perfection, while the personal witness and the one attained to view are once-returners or non-returners.
an3.21:10.1	In this matter, it’s not easy to definitively declare that
an3.21:10.2	one of these three people is finest.

an3.22:1.2	What three?
an3.22:1.3	In some cases a patient won’t recover from an illness, regardless of whether or not they get suitable food and medicines, and a capable carer.
an3.22:2.1	In some cases a patient will recover from an illness, regardless of whether or not they get suitable food and medicines, and a capable carer.
an3.22:3.1	In some cases a patient can recover from an illness, but only if they get suitable food and medicines, and a capable carer, and not if they don’t get these things.
an3.22:4.1	Now, it’s for the sake of the last patient—who will recover only if they get suitable food and medicines, and a capable carer—that food, medicines, and a carer are prescribed.
an3.22:4.2	But also, for the sake of this patient, the other patients should be looked after.
an3.22:4.3	These are the three kinds of patients found in the world.

an3.22:8.1	Now, it’s for the sake of this last person that teaching the Dhamma is prescribed, that is, the one who can enter the sure path with regards to skillful qualities, but only if they get to see a Realized One, and to hear the teaching and training that he proclaims.
an3.22:8.2	But also, for the sake of this person, the other people should be taught Dhamma.

an3.23:1.4	Having made these choices, they’re reborn in a hurtful world,
an3.23:1.5	where hurtful contacts strike them.
an3.23:1.6	Touched by hurtful contacts, they experience hurtful feelings that are exclusively painful—like the beings in hell.
an3.23:2.1	Furthermore, another person makes pleasing choices by way of body, speech, and mind.

an3.23:3.2	Having made these choices, they are reborn in a world that is both hurtful and pleasing,
an3.23:3.3	where hurtful and pleasing contacts strike them.
an3.23:3.4	Touched by both hurtful and pleasing contacts, they experience both hurtful and pleasing feelings that are a mixture of pleasure and pain—like humans, some gods, and some beings in the underworld.

an3.24:1.2	What three?
an3.24:1.3	The person who has enabled you to go for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.
an3.24:1.4	This person is very helpful to another.
an3.24:2.1	Furthermore, the person who has enabled you to truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.

an3.24:4.1	And I say that there is no-one more helpful to another than these three people.
an3.24:4.2	And I also say that it’s not easy to repay these three people by bowing down to them, rising up for them, greeting them with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for them; or by providing them with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.”

an3.26:2.3	You should associate with, accompany, and attend such a person.
an3.26:2.4	Why is that?

an3.30:1.1	“These three kinds of people are found in the world.
an3.30:1.2	What three?
an3.30:1.3	One with upside-down wisdom, one with wisdom on their lap, and one with wide wisdom.
an3.30:1.4	And who is the person with upside-down wisdom?
an3.30:1.5	It’s someone who often goes to the monastery to hear the teaching in the presence of the mendicants.
an3.30:1.6	The mendicants teach them Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
an3.30:1.7	But even while sitting there, that person doesn’t pay attention to the beginning, middle, or end of the discussion.
an3.30:1.8	And when they get up from their seat, they don’t pay attention to the beginning, middle, or end of the discussion.
an3.30:1.9	It’s like when a pot full of water is tipped over, so the water drains out and doesn’t stay.
an3.30:1.10	In the same way, someone often goes to the monastery to hear the teaching in the presence of the mendicants.
an3.30:1.11	The mendicants teach them Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
an3.30:1.12	But even while sitting there, that person doesn’t pay attention to the discussion in the beginning, middle, or end.
an3.30:1.13	And when they get up from their seat, they don’t pay attention to the beginning, middle, or end of the discussion.
an3.30:1.14	This is called a person with upside-down wisdom.
an3.30:2.1	And who is the person with wisdom on their lap?
an3.30:2.2	It’s someone who often goes to the monastery to hear the teaching in the presence of the mendicants.
an3.30:2.3	The mendicants teach them Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
an3.30:2.4	While sitting there, that person pays attention to the discussion in the beginning, middle, and end.
an3.30:2.5	But when they get up from their seat, they don’t pay attention to the beginning, middle, or end of the discussion.
an3.30:2.6	It’s like a person who has different kinds of food crammed on their lap—
an3.30:2.7	such as sesame, rice, sweets, or jujube—
an3.30:2.8	so that if they get up from the seat without mindfulness, everything gets scattered.
an3.30:2.9	In the same way, someone often goes to the monastery to hear the teaching in the presence of the mendicants.
an3.30:2.10	The mendicants teach them Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
an3.30:2.11	While sitting there, that person pays attention to the discussion in the beginning, middle, and end.
an3.30:2.12	But when they get up from their seat, they don’t pay attention to the beginning, middle, or end of the discussion.
an3.30:2.13	This is called a person with wisdom on their lap.
an3.30:3.1	And who is the person with wide wisdom?
an3.30:3.2	It’s someone who often goes to the monastery to hear the teaching in the presence of the mendicants.
an3.30:3.3	The mendicants teach them Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
an3.30:3.4	While sitting there, that person pays attention to the discussion in the beginning, middle, and end.
an3.30:3.5	And when they get up from their seat, they continue to pay attention to the beginning, middle, or end of the discussion.
an3.30:3.6	It’s like when a pot full of water is set straight, so the water stays and doesn’t drain out.
an3.30:3.7	In the same way, someone often goes to the monastery to hear the teaching in the presence of the mendicants.
an3.30:3.8	The mendicants teach them Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
an3.30:3.9	While sitting there, that person pays attention to the discussion in the beginning, middle, and end.
an3.30:3.10	And when they get up from their seat, they continue to pay attention to the beginning, middle, or end of the discussion.
an3.30:3.11	This is called a person with wide wisdom.
an3.30:3.12	These are the three kinds of people found in the world.
an3.30:4.1	A person with upside-down wisdom,
an3.30:4.2	is stupid and cannot see,
an3.30:4.3	and even if they frequently
an3.30:4.4	go into the mendicants’ presence,
an3.30:5.1	such a person can’t learn
an3.30:5.2	the beginning, middle, or end
an3.30:5.3	of the discussion,
an3.30:5.4	for their wisdom is lacking.
an3.30:6.1	The person with wisdom on their lap
an3.30:6.2	is better than that, it’s said;
an3.30:6.3	but even if they frequently
an3.30:6.4	go into the mendicants’ presence,
an3.30:7.1	such a person can only learn
an3.30:7.2	the beginning, middle, and end
an3.30:7.3	while sitting in that seat;
an3.30:7.4	but they’ve only grasped the phrasing,
an3.30:7.5	for when they get up their understanding fails,
an3.30:7.6	and what they’ve learned is lost.
an3.30:8.1	The person with wide wisdom
an3.30:8.2	is better than that, it’s said;
an3.30:8.3	and if they, too, frequently
an3.30:8.4	go into the mendicants’ presence,
an3.30:9.1	such a person can learn
an3.30:9.2	the beginning, middle, and end
an3.30:9.3	while sitting in that seat;
an3.30:9.4	and when they’ve grasped the phrasing,
an3.30:10.1	they remember it with the best of intentions.
an3.30:10.2	That peaceful-hearted person,
an3.30:10.3	practicing in line with the teaching,
an3.30:10.4	would make an end of suffering.”

an3.31:0.3	31. With Brahmā
an3.31:1.1	“Mendicants, a family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to live with Brahmā.
an3.31:1.2	A family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to live with the first teachers.
an3.31:1.3	A family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to live with those worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods.
an3.31:1.4	‘Brahmā’ is a term for your parents.
an3.31:1.5	‘First teachers’ is a term for your parents.
an3.31:1.6	‘Worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods’ is a term for your parents.
an3.31:1.7	Why is that?
an3.31:1.8	Parents are very helpful to their children, they raise them, nurture them, and show them the world.
an3.31:2.1	Parents are said to be ‘Brahmā’
an3.31:2.2	and ‘first teachers’, it’s said.
an3.31:2.3	They’re worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods from their children,
an3.31:2.4	for they love their offspring.
an3.31:3.1	Therefore an astute person
an3.31:3.2	would revere them and honor them
an3.31:3.3	with food and drink,
an3.31:3.4	clothes and bedding,
an3.31:3.5	anointing and bathing,
an3.31:3.6	and by washing their feet.
an3.31:4.1	Because they look after
an3.31:4.2	their parents like this,
an3.31:4.3	in this life they’re praised by the astute,
an3.31:4.4	and they depart to rejoice in heaven.”

an3.32:0.3	32. With Ānanda
an3.32:1.1	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:
an3.32:2.1	“Could it be, sir, that a mendicant might gain a state of immersion such that there’s no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body; and no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for all external stimuli;
an3.32:2.2	and that they’d live having attained the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where ego, possessiveness, and underlying tendency to conceit are no more?”
an3.32:2.3	“It could be, Ānanda, that a mendicant gains a state of immersion such that they have no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body; and no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for all external stimuli;
an3.32:2.4	and that they’d live having attained the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where ego, possessiveness, and underlying tendency to conceit are no more.”
an3.32:3.1	“But how could this be, sir?”
an3.32:3.2	NA
an3.32:4.1	“Ānanda, it’s when a mendicant thinks:
an3.32:4.2	‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.’
an3.32:4.3	That’s how, Ānanda, a mendicant might gain a state of immersion such that there’s no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body; and no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for all external stimuli;
an3.32:4.4	and that they’d live having achieved the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where ego, possessiveness, and underlying tendency to conceit are no more.
an3.32:5.1	And Ānanda, this is what I was referring to in ‘The Way to the Beyond’, in ‘The Questions of Puṇṇaka’ when I said:
an3.32:6.1	‘Having assessed the world high and low,
an3.32:6.2	there is nothing in the world that disturbs them.
an3.32:6.3	Peaceful, unclouded, untroubled, with no need for hope—
an3.32:6.4	they’ve crossed over rebirth and old age, I declare.’”
an3.33:0.1	Numbered Discourses 3
an3.33:0.2	4. Messengers of the Gods
an3.33:0.3	33. With Sāriputta
an3.33:1.1	Then Venerable Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,
an3.33:1.2	“Maybe I’ll teach Dhamma in brief,
an3.33:1.3	maybe in detail,
an3.33:1.4	maybe both in brief and in detail.
an3.33:1.5	But it’s hard to find anyone who understands.”
an3.33:1.6	“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!
an3.33:1.7	Let the Buddha teach Dhamma in brief, in detail, and both in brief and in detail.
an3.33:1.8	There will be those who understand the teaching!”
an3.33:2.1	“So, Sāriputta, you should train like this:
an3.33:2.2	‘There’ll be no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body; and no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for all external stimuli; and we’ll live having achieved the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where ego, possessiveness, and underlying tendency to conceit are no more.’
an3.33:2.3	That’s how you should train.
an3.33:3.1	When a mendicant has no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body; and no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for all external stimuli; and they live having attained the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where ego, possessiveness, and underlying tendency to conceit are no more—
an3.33:3.2	they’re called
an3.33:3.3	a mendicant who has cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of suffering.
an3.33:3.4	And Sāriputta, this is what I was referring to in ‘The Way to the Beyond’, in ‘The Questions of Udaya’ when I said:
an3.33:4.1	‘The giving up of both
an3.33:4.2	sensual desires and aversion;
an3.33:4.3	the dispelling of dullness,
an3.33:4.4	and the cessation of remorse.
an3.33:5.1	Pure equanimity and mindfulness,
an3.33:5.2	preceded by investigation of principles—
an3.33:5.3	this, I declare, is liberation by enlightenment,
an3.33:5.4	the smashing of ignorance.’”
an3.34:0.1	Numbered Discourses 3
an3.34:0.2	4. Messengers of the Gods
an3.34:0.3	34. Sources
an3.34:1.1	“Mendicants, there are these three sources that give rise to deeds.
an3.34:1.2	What three?
an3.34:1.3	Greed, hate, and delusion are sources that give rise to deeds.
an3.34:2.1	Any deed that emerges from greed—born, sourced, and originated from greed—ripens where that new life-form is born.
an3.34:2.2	And wherever that deed ripens, its result is experienced—either in the present life, or in the next life, or in some subsequent period.
an3.34:3.1	Any deed that emerges from hate—born, sourced, and originated from hate—ripens where that new life-form is born.
an3.34:3.2	And wherever that deed ripens, its result is experienced—either in the present life, or in the next life, or in some subsequent period.
an3.34:4.1	Any deed that emerges from delusion—born, sourced, and originated from delusion—ripens where that new life-form is born.
an3.34:4.2	And wherever that deed ripens, its result is experienced—either in the present life, or in the next life, or in some subsequent period.
an3.34:5.1	Suppose some seeds were intact, unspoiled, not weather-damaged, fertile, and well-kept. They’re sown in a well-prepared, productive field,
an3.34:5.2	and the heavens provide plenty of rain.
an3.34:5.3	Then those seeds would grow, increase, and mature.
an3.34:5.4	In the same way, any deed that emerges from greed—born, sourced, and originated from greed—ripens where that new life-form is born.
an3.34:5.5	And wherever that deed ripens, its result is experienced—either in the present life, or in the next life, or in some subsequent period.
an3.34:6.1	Any deed that emerges from hate …
an3.34:6.2	Any deed that emerges from delusion—born, sourced, and originated from delusion—ripens where that new life-form is born.
an3.34:6.3	And wherever that deed ripens, its result is experienced—either in the present life, or in the next life, or in some subsequent period.
an3.34:6.4	These are three sources that give rise to deeds.
an3.34:7.1	Mendicants, there are these three sources that give rise to deeds.
an3.34:7.2	What three?
an3.34:7.3	Contentment, love, and understanding are sources that give rise to deeds.
an3.34:8.1	Any deed that emerges from contentment—born, sourced, and originated from contentment—is given up when greed is done away with. It’s cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
an3.34:9.1	Any deed that emerges from love—born, sourced, and originated from love—is abandoned when hate is done away with. It’s cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
an3.34:10.1	Any deed that emerges from understanding—born, sourced, and originated from understanding—is abandoned when delusion is done away with. It’s cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
an3.34:11.1	Suppose some seeds were intact, unspoiled, not damaged by wind and sun, fertile, and well-kept.
an3.34:11.2	But someone would burn them with fire,
an3.34:11.3	reduce them to ashes,
an3.34:11.4	and sweep away the ashes in a strong wind, or float them away down a swift stream.
an3.34:11.5	Then those seeds would be cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
an3.34:11.6	In the same way, any deed that emerges from contentment—born, sourced, and originated from contentment—is abandoned when greed is done away with. It’s cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
an3.34:12.1	Any deed that emerges from love …
an3.34:12.2	Any deed that emerges from understanding—born, sourced, and originated from understanding—is abandoned when delusion is done away with.
an3.34:12.3	It’s cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
an3.34:12.4	These are three sources that give rise to deeds.
an3.34:13.1	When an ignorant person acts
an3.34:13.2	out of greed, hate, or delusion,
an3.34:13.3	any deeds they have performed
an3.34:13.4	—whether a little or a lot—
an3.34:13.5	are to be experienced right here,
an3.34:13.6	not in any other place.
an3.34:14.1	So a wise person,
an3.34:14.2	a mendicant arousing knowledge
an3.34:14.3	of the outcome of greed, hate, and delusion,
an3.34:14.4	would cast off all bad destinies.”
an3.35:0.1	Numbered Discourses 3
an3.35:0.2	4. Messengers of the Gods
an3.35:0.3	35. With Hatthaka
an3.35:1.1	So I have heard.
an3.35:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Āḷavī, on a mat of leaves by a cow-path in a grove of Indian Rosewood.
an3.35:1.3	Then as Hatthaka of Āḷavī was going for a walk he saw the Buddha sitting on that mat of leaves.
an3.35:1.4	He went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said,
an3.35:1.5	“Sir, I trust the Buddha slept well?”
an3.35:1.6	“Yes, prince, I slept well.
an3.35:1.7	I am one of those who sleep at ease in the world.”
an3.35:2.1	“The winter nights are cold, sir, and it’s the week of mid-winter, when the snow falls. Rough is the ground trampled under the cows’ hooves, and thin is the mat of leaves. The leaves are sparse on the trees, the ocher robes are cold, and cold blows the north wind.
an3.35:2.2	And yet the Buddha says,
an3.35:2.3	‘Yes, prince, I slept well.
an3.35:2.4	I am one of those who sleep at ease in the world.’”
an3.35:3.1	“Well then, prince, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.
an3.35:3.2	What do you think? Take the case of a householder or his son, who lives in a bungalow, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with latches fastened and windows shuttered.
an3.35:3.3	His couch is spread with woolen covers—shag-piled, pure white, or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide. It has a canopy above and red pillows at both ends.
an3.35:3.4	An oil lamp is burning there,
an3.35:3.5	while his four wives attend to him in all manner of agreeable ways.
an3.35:3.6	What do you think, prince, would he sleep at ease, or not?
an3.35:3.7	Or how do you see this?”
an3.35:3.8	“He would sleep at ease, sir.
an3.35:3.9	Of those who sleep at ease in the world, he would be one.”
an3.35:4.1	“What do you think, prince?
an3.35:4.2	Is it not possible that a fever born of greed—physical or mental—might arise in that householder or householder’s son, burning him so he sleeps badly?”
an3.35:4.3	“Yes, sir.”
an3.35:5.1	“The greed that burns that householder or householder’s son, making them sleep badly, has been cut off at the root by the Realized One, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
an3.35:5.2	That’s why I sleep at ease.
an3.35:6.1	What do you think, prince?
an3.35:6.2	Is it not possible that a fever born of hate …
an3.35:6.3	or a fever born of delusion—physical or mental—might arise in that householder or householder’s son, burning him so he sleeps badly?”
an3.35:6.4	“Yes, sir.”
an3.35:7.1	“The delusion that burns that householder or householder’s son, making them sleep badly, has been cut off at the root by the Realized One, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
an3.35:7.2	That’s why I sleep at ease.
an3.35:8.1	A brahmin who is fully extinguished
an3.35:8.2	always sleeps at ease.
an3.35:8.3	Sensual pleasures slip off them,
an3.35:8.4	they’re cooled, free of attachments.
an3.35:9.1	Since they’ve cut off all clinging,
an3.35:9.2	and removed the stress from the heart,
an3.35:9.3	the peaceful sleep at ease,
an3.35:9.4	having found peace of mind.”
an3.36:0.1	Numbered Discourses 3
an3.36:0.2	4. Messengers of the Gods
an3.36:0.3	36. Messengers of the Gods
an3.36:1.1	“There are, mendicants, these three messengers of the gods.
an3.36:1.2	What three?
an3.36:1.3	Firstly, someone does bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.
an3.36:1.4	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
an3.36:1.5	Then the wardens of hell take them by the arms and present them to King Yama, saying:
an3.36:1.6	‘Your Majesty, this person did not pay due respect to their mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, or honor the elders in the family.
an3.36:1.7	May Your Majesty punish them!’
an3.36:2.1	Then King Yama pursues, presses, and grills them about the first messenger of the gods:
an3.36:2.2	‘Mister, did you not see the first messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’
an3.36:2.3	They say,
an3.36:2.4	‘I saw nothing, sir.’
an3.36:3.1	Then King Yama says,
an3.36:3.2	‘Mister, did you not see among human beings an elderly woman or a man—eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old—bent double, crooked, leaning on a staff, trembling as they walk, ailing, past their prime, with teeth broken, hair grey and scanty or bald, skin wrinkled, and limbs blotchy?’
an3.36:3.3	They say,
an3.36:3.4	‘I saw that, sir.’
an3.36:4.1	Then King Yama says,
an3.36:4.2	‘Mister, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature—
an3.36:4.3	“I, too, am liable to grow old. I’m not exempt from old age. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’
an3.36:4.4	They say,
an3.36:4.5	‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’
an3.36:5.1	Then King Yama says,
an3.36:5.2	‘Mister, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind.
an3.36:5.3	Indeed, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence.
an3.36:5.4	That bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by the deities, or by ascetics and brahmins.
an3.36:5.5	That bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’
an3.36:6.1	Then King Yama grills them about the second messenger of the gods:
an3.36:6.2	‘Mister, did you not see the second messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’
an3.36:6.3	They say,
an3.36:6.4	‘I saw nothing, sir.’
an3.36:6.5	Then King Yama says,
an3.36:6.6	‘Mister, did you not see among human beings a woman or a man, sick, suffering, gravely ill, collapsed in their own urine and feces, being picked up by some and put down by others?’
an3.36:6.7	They say,
an3.36:6.8	‘I saw that, sir.’
an3.36:7.1	Then King Yama says,
an3.36:7.2	‘Mister, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature—
an3.36:7.3	“I, too, am liable to become sick. I’m not exempt from sickness. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’
an3.36:7.4	They say,
an3.36:7.5	‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’
an3.36:8.1	Then King Yama says,
an3.36:8.2	‘Mister, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind.
an3.36:8.3	Well, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence.
an3.36:8.4	That bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by the deities, or by ascetics and brahmins.
an3.36:8.5	That bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’
an3.36:9.1	Then King Yama grills them about the third messenger of the gods:
an3.36:9.2	‘Mister, did you not see the third messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’
an3.36:9.3	They say,
an3.36:9.4	‘I saw nothing, sir.’
an3.36:10.1	Then King Yama says,
an3.36:10.2	‘Mister, did you not see among human beings a woman or a man, dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering?’
an3.36:10.3	They say,
an3.36:10.4	‘I saw that, sir.’
an3.36:11.1	Then King Yama says,
an3.36:11.2	‘Mister, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature—
an3.36:11.3	“I, too, am liable to die. I’m not exempt from death. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’
an3.36:11.4	They say,
an3.36:11.5	‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’
an3.36:12.1	Then King Yama says,
an3.36:12.2	‘Mister, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind.
an3.36:12.3	Well, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence.
an3.36:12.4	That bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by the deities, or by ascetics and brahmins.
an3.36:12.5	That bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’
an3.36:13.1	Then, after grilling them about the third messenger of the gods, King Yama falls silent.
an3.36:13.2	Then the wardens of hell punish them with the five-fold crucifixion.
an3.36:13.3	They drive red-hot stakes through the hands and feet, and another in the middle of the chest.
an3.36:13.4	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.
an3.36:14.1	Then the wardens of hell throw them down and hack them with axes. …
an3.36:14.2	NA
an3.36:15.1	They hang them upside-down and hack them with hatchets. …
an3.36:15.2	They harness them to a chariot, and drive them back and forth across burning ground, blazing and glowing. …
an3.36:15.3	They make them climb up and down a huge mountain of burning coals, blazing and glowing. …
an3.36:15.4	Then the wardens of hell turn them upside down and throw them in a red-hot copper pot, burning, blazing, and glowing.
an3.36:15.5	There they’re seared in boiling scum, and they’re swept up and down and round and round.
an3.36:15.6	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.
an3.36:15.7	Then the wardens of hell toss them into the Great Hell.
an3.36:15.8	Now, about that Great Hell:
an3.36:16.1	‘Four are its corners, four its doors,
an3.36:16.2	neatly divided in equal parts.
an3.36:16.3	Surrounded by an iron wall,
an3.36:16.4	of iron is its roof.
an3.36:17.1	The ground is even made of iron,
an3.36:17.2	it burns with fierce fire.
an3.36:17.3	The heat forever radiates
an3.36:17.4	a hundred leagues around.’
an3.36:18.1	Once upon a time, King Yama thought,
an3.36:18.2	‘Those who do such bad deeds in the world receive these many different punishments.
an3.36:18.3	Oh, I hope I may be reborn as a human being! And that a Realized One—a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha—arises in the world! And that I may pay homage to the Buddha!
an3.36:18.4	Then the Buddha can teach me Dhamma, so that I may understand his teaching.’
an3.36:18.5	Now, I don’t say this because I’ve heard it from some other ascetic or brahmin. I only say it because I’ve known, seen, and realized it for myself.
an3.36:19.1	Those people who are negligent,
an3.36:19.2	when warned by the gods’ messengers:
an3.36:19.3	a long time they sorrow,
an3.36:19.4	when they go to that wretched place.
an3.36:20.1	But those good and peaceful people,
an3.36:20.2	when warned by the god’s messengers,
an3.36:20.3	never neglect
an3.36:20.4	the teaching of the noble ones.
an3.36:21.1	Seeing the peril in grasping,
an3.36:21.2	the origin of birth and death,
an3.36:21.3	they’re freed by not grasping,
an3.36:21.4	with the ending of birth and death.
an3.36:22.1	Happy, they’ve come to a safe place,
an3.36:22.2	extinguished in this very life.
an3.36:22.3	They’ve gone beyond all threats and perils,
an3.36:22.4	and risen above all suffering.”

an3.37:0.3	37. The Four Great Kings (1st)
an3.37:1.1	“On the eighth day of the fortnight, mendicants, the ministers and counselors of the Four Great Kings wander about the world, thinking:
an3.37:1.2	‘Hopefully most humans are paying due respect to their parents, ascetics and brahmins, honoring the elders in their families, observing the sabbath, staying awake, and making merit.’
an3.37:1.3	And on the fourteenth day of the fortnight, the sons of the Four Great Kings wander about the world, thinking:
an3.37:1.4	‘Hopefully most humans are paying due respect to their parents … and making merit.’
an3.37:1.5	And on the fifteenth day sabbath, the Four Great Kings themselves wander about the world, thinking:
an3.37:1.6	‘Hopefully most humans are paying due respect to their parents … and making merit.’
an3.37:2.1	If only a few humans are paying due respect to their parents … and making merit,
an3.37:2.2	then the Four Great Kings address the gods of the Thirty-Three, seated together in the Hall of Justice:
an3.37:2.3	‘Only a few humans are paying due respect to their parents … and making merit.’
an3.37:2.4	Then the gods of the Thirty-Three are disappointed, thinking,
an3.37:2.5	‘The heavenly hosts will dwindle, while the demon hosts will swell!’
an3.37:3.1	But if many humans are paying due respect to their parents … and making merit,
an3.37:3.2	then the Four Great Kings address the gods of the Thirty-Three, seated together in the Hall of Justice:
an3.37:3.3	‘Many humans are paying due respect to their parents … and making merit.’
an3.37:3.4	Then the gods of the Thirty-Three are pleased, thinking,
an3.37:3.5	‘The heavenly hosts will swell, while the demon hosts will dwindle!’
an3.37:4.1	Once upon a time, Sakka, lord of gods, guiding the gods of the Thirty-Three, recited this verse:
an3.37:5.1	‘Whoever wants to be like me
an3.37:5.2	would observe the sabbath
an3.37:5.3	complete in all eight factors,
an3.37:5.4	on the fourteenth and the fifteenth days,
an3.37:5.5	and the eighth day of the fortnight,
an3.37:5.6	as well as on the fortnightly special displays.’
an3.37:6.1	But that verse was poorly sung by Sakka, lord of gods, not well sung; poorly spoken, not well spoken.
an3.37:6.2	Why is that?
an3.37:6.3	Sakka, lord of gods, is not free of greed, hate, and delusion.
an3.37:7.1	But for a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—it is appropriate to say:
an3.37:8.1	‘Whoever wants to be like me
an3.37:8.2	would observe the sabbath,
an3.37:8.3	complete in all eight factors,
an3.37:8.4	on the fourteenth and the fifteenth days,
an3.37:8.5	and the eighth day of the fortnight,
an3.37:8.6	as well as on the fortnightly special displays.’
an3.37:9.1	Why is that?
an3.37:9.2	Because that mendicant is free of greed, hate, and delusion.”

an3.38:3.1	But that verse was poorly sung by Sakka, lord of gods, not well sung; poorly spoken, not well spoken.
an3.38:3.2	Why is that?
an3.38:3.3	Because Sakka, lord of gods, is not exempt from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. He is not exempt from suffering, I say.

an3.39:0.3	39. A Delicate Lifestyle
an3.39:1.1	“My lifestyle was delicate, mendicants, most delicate, extremely delicate.
an3.39:1.2	In my father’s home, lotus ponds were made just for me.
an3.39:1.3	In some, blue water lilies blossomed, while in others, there were pink or white lotuses, just for my benefit.
an3.39:1.4	I only used sandalwood from Kāsī, and my turbans, jackets, sarongs, and upper robes also came from Kāsī.
an3.39:1.5	And a white parasol was held over me night and day, with the thought:
an3.39:1.6	‘Don’t let cold, heat, grass, dust, or damp bother him.’
an3.39:2.1	I had three stilt longhouses—one for the winter, one for the summer, and one for the rainy season.
an3.39:2.2	I stayed in a stilt longhouse without coming downstairs for the four months of the rainy season, where I was entertained by musicians—none of them men.
an3.39:2.3	While the bondservants, workers, and staff in other houses are given rough gruel with pickles to eat, in my father’s home they eat fine rice with meat.
an3.39:3.1	Amid such prosperity and such a delicate lifestyle, I thought:
an3.39:3.2	‘When an uneducated ordinary person—who is liable to grow old, not being exempt from old age—sees someone else who is old, they’re horrified, repelled, and disgusted, overlooking the fact that they themselves are in the same situation.
an3.39:3.3	But since I, too, am liable to grow old, it would not be appropriate for me to be horrified, embarrassed, and disgusted, when I see someone else who is old.’
an3.39:3.4	Reflecting like this, I entirely gave up the vanity of youth.
an3.39:4.1	‘When an uneducated ordinary person—who is liable to get sick, not being exempt from sickness—sees someone else who is sick, they’re horrified, repelled, and disgusted, overlooking the fact that they themselves are in the same situation.
an3.39:4.2	But since I, too, am liable to get sick, it would not be appropriate for me to be horrified, embarrassed, and disgusted, when I see someone else who is sick.’
an3.39:4.3	Reflecting like this, I entirely gave up the vanity of health.
an3.39:5.1	‘When an uneducated ordinary person—who is liable to die, not being exempt from death—sees someone else who is dead, they’re horrified, repelled, and disgusted, overlooking the fact that they themselves are in the same situation.
an3.39:5.2	But since I, too, am liable to die, it would not be appropriate for me to be horrified, embarrassed, and disgusted, when I see someone else who is dead.’
an3.39:5.3	Reflecting like this, I entirely gave up the vanity of life.
an3.39:6.1	There are these three vanities.
an3.39:6.2	What three?
an3.39:6.3	The vanity of youth, of health, and of life.
an3.39:6.4	Intoxicated with the vanity of youth, an uneducated ordinary person does bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.
an3.39:6.5	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
an3.39:6.6	Intoxicated with the vanity of health …
an3.39:6.7	Intoxicated with the vanity of life, an uneducated ordinary person does bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.
an3.39:6.8	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
an3.39:7.1	Intoxicated with the vanity of youth, health, or life, a mendicant resigns the training and returns to a lesser life.
an3.39:7.2	NA
an3.39:7.3	NA
an3.39:8.1	For others, sickness is natural,
an3.39:8.2	and so are old age and death.
an3.39:8.3	Though this is how their nature is,
an3.39:8.4	ordinary people feel disgusted.
an3.39:9.1	If I were to be disgusted
an3.39:9.2	with creatures whose nature is such,
an3.39:9.3	it would not be appropriate for me,
an3.39:9.4	since my life is just the same.
an3.39:10.1	Living in such a way,
an3.39:10.2	I understood the reality without attachments.
an3.39:10.3	I mastered all vanities—
an3.39:10.4	of health, of youth,
an3.39:11.1	and even of life—
an3.39:11.2	seeing renunciation as sanctuary.
an3.39:11.3	Zeal sprang up in me
an3.39:11.4	as I looked to extinguishment.
an3.39:12.1	Now I’m unable
an3.39:12.2	to indulge in sensual pleasures;
an3.39:12.3	there’s no turning back,
an3.39:12.4	I’m committed to the spiritual life.”

an3.40:0.3	40. In Charge
an3.40:1.1	“There are, mendicants, these three things to put in charge.
an3.40:1.2	What three?
an3.40:1.3	Putting oneself, the world, or the teaching in charge.
an3.40:1.4	And what, mendicants, is putting oneself in charge?
an3.40:1.5	It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this:
an3.40:1.6	‘I didn’t go forth from the lay life to homelessness for the sake of a robe,
an3.40:1.7	almsfood, lodgings, or rebirth in this or that state.
an3.40:1.8	But I was swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I was swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.
an3.40:1.9	And I thought, “Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.”
an3.40:1.10	But it would not be appropriate for me to seek sensual pleasures like those I abandoned when I went forth, or even worse.’
an3.40:1.11	Then they reflect:
an3.40:1.12	‘My energy shall be roused up and unflagging, mindfulness shall be established and lucid, my body shall be tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind shall be immersed in samādhi.’
an3.40:1.13	Putting themselves in charge, they give up the unskillful and develop the skillful, they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless, and they keep themselves pure.
an3.40:1.14	This is called putting oneself in charge.
an3.40:2.1	And what, mendicants, is putting the world in charge?
an3.40:2.2	It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this:
an3.40:2.3	‘I didn’t go forth from the lay life to homelessness for the sake of a robe,
an3.40:2.4	almsfood, lodgings, or rebirth in this or that state.
an3.40:2.5	But I was swamped by rebirth, old age, and death, by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I was swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.
an3.40:2.6	And I thought, “Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.”
an3.40:2.7	And now, since I’ve now gone forth, I might have sensual, malicious, or cruel thoughts. But the population of the world is large,
an3.40:2.8	and there are ascetics and brahmins who have psychic power—they’re clairvoyant, and can read the minds of others.
an3.40:2.9	They see far without being seen, even by those close; and they understand the minds of others.
an3.40:2.10	They would know me:
an3.40:2.11	“Look at this gentleman; he’s gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, but he’s living mixed up with bad, unskillful qualities.”
an3.40:2.12	And there are deities, too, who have psychic power—they’re clairvoyant, and can read the minds of others.
an3.40:2.13	They see far without being seen, even by those close; and they understand the minds of others.
an3.40:2.14	They would know me:
an3.40:2.15	“Look at this gentleman; he’s gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, but he’s living mixed up with bad, unskillful qualities.”’
an3.40:2.16	Then they reflect:
an3.40:2.17	‘My energy shall be roused up and unflagging, mindfulness shall be established and lucid, my body shall be tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind shall be immersed in samādhi.’
an3.40:2.18	Putting the world in charge, they give up the unskillful and develop the skillful, they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless, and they keep themselves pure.
an3.40:2.19	This is called putting the world in charge.
an3.40:3.1	And what, mendicants, is putting the teaching in charge?
an3.40:3.2	It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this:
an3.40:3.3	‘I didn’t go forth from the lay life to homelessness for the sake of a robe,
an3.40:3.4	almsfood, lodgings, or rebirth in this or that state.
an3.40:3.5	But I was swamped by rebirth, old age, and death, by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I was swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.
an3.40:3.6	And I thought, “Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.”
an3.40:3.7	The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.
an3.40:3.8	I have spiritual companions who live knowing and seeing.
an3.40:3.9	Now that I’ve gone forth in this well explained teaching and training, it would not be appropriate for me to live lazy and heedless.’
an3.40:3.10	Then they reflect:
an3.40:3.11	‘My energy shall be roused up and unflagging, mindfulness shall be established and lucid, my body shall be tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind shall be immersed in samādhi.’
an3.40:3.12	Putting the teaching in charge, they give up the unskillful and develop the skillful, they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless, and they keep themselves pure.
an3.40:3.13	This is called putting the teaching in charge.
an3.40:3.14	These are the three things to put in charge.
an3.40:4.1	There’s no privacy in the world,
an3.40:4.2	for someone who does bad deeds.
an3.40:4.3	You’ll know for yourself,
an3.40:4.4	whether you’ve lied or told the truth.
an3.40:5.1	When you witness your good self,
an3.40:5.2	you despise it;
an3.40:5.3	while you disguise
an3.40:5.4	your bad self inside yourself.
an3.40:6.1	The gods and the Realized One see
an3.40:6.2	the fool who lives unjustly in the world.
an3.40:6.3	So with yourself in charge, live mindfully;
an3.40:6.4	with the world in charge, be alert and practice absorption;
an3.40:6.5	with the teaching in charge, live in line with that teaching:
an3.40:6.6	a sage who tries for the truth doesn’t deteriorate.
an3.40:7.1	Māra’s destroyed; the terminator’s overcome:
an3.40:7.2	one who strives reaches the end of rebirth.
an3.40:7.3	Poised, clever, knowing the world—
an3.40:7.4	that sage identifies with nothing at all.”

an3.49:1.4	In these three situations, you should be keen.
an3.49:2.1	It’s a mendicant who is keen to prevent bad, unskillful qualities from arising. They’re keen to give rise to skillful qualities. And they’re keen to endure physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, life-threatening.

an3.50:3.1	And how does a master thief rely on powerful individuals?
an3.50:3.2	It’s when a master thief relies on rulers or their ministers.

an3.50:3.6	That’s how a master thief relies on powerful individuals.
an3.50:3.7	A master thief with these three factors breaks into houses, plunders wealth, steals from isolated buildings, and commits highway robbery.

an3.57:3.5	However, I also say that a gift to an ethical person is more fruitful than one to an unethical person. They’ve given up five factors, and possess five factors.

an3.57:4.2	Sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt.

an3.58:2.1	“But brahmin, how do the brahmins describe a brahmin who is master of the three Vedic knowledges?”
an3.58:2.2	“Master Gotama, it’s when a brahmin is well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation. He recites and remembers the hymns, and has mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knows philology and grammar, and is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.
an3.58:2.3	That’s how the brahmins describe a brahmin who is master of the three Vedic knowledges.”
an3.58:3.1	“Brahmin, a master of three knowledges according to the brahmins is quite different from a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble One.”

an3.58:3.3	Master Gotama, please teach me this.”
an3.58:3.4	“Well then, brahmin, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an3.58:3.5	“Yes sir,” Tikaṇṇa replied.
an3.58:3.6	The Buddha said this:
an3.58:4.1	“Brahmin, it’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an3.58:4.2	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an3.58:4.3	And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
an3.58:4.4	With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
an3.58:5.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives.
an3.58:5.2	They recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
an3.58:5.3	This is the first knowledge that they attain.
an3.58:5.4	Ignorance is destroyed and knowledge has arisen; darkness is destroyed and light has arisen, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.
an3.58:6.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.
an3.58:6.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
an3.58:6.3	This is the second knowledge that they attain.
an3.58:6.4	Ignorance is destroyed and knowledge has arisen; darkness is destroyed and light has arisen, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.
an3.58:7.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.
an3.58:7.2	They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
an3.58:7.3	They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.
an3.58:7.4	Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.
an3.58:7.5	When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
an3.58:7.6	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’
an3.58:7.7	This is the third knowledge that they attain.
an3.58:7.8	Ignorance is destroyed and knowledge has arisen; darkness is destroyed, and light has arisen, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.
an3.58:8.1	For someone whose ethical conduct doesn’t waver,
an3.58:8.2	who is alert, practicing absorption;
an3.58:8.3	whose mind is mastered,
an3.58:8.4	unified, serene.
an3.58:9.1	That wise one dispels the darkness,
an3.58:9.2	master of the three knowledges, destroyer of death.
an3.58:9.3	For the welfare of gods and humans,
an3.58:9.4	he has given up everything, they say.
an3.58:10.1	Accomplished in the three knowledges,
an3.58:10.2	living without confusion,
an3.58:10.3	bearing the final body,
an3.58:10.4	they revere the awakened Gotama.
an3.58:11.1	Who knows their past lives,
an3.58:11.2	and sees heaven and places of loss,
an3.58:11.3	and has attained the ending of rebirth,
an3.58:11.4	that sage has perfect insight.
an3.58:12.1	It’s because of these three knowledges
an3.58:12.2	that a brahmin is a master of the three knowledges.
an3.58:12.3	That’s who I call a three-knowledge master,
an3.58:12.4	and not some mere reciter.
an3.58:13.1	This, brahmin, is a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble One.”
an3.58:13.2	“Master Gotama, a master of three knowledges according to the brahmins is quite different from a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble One.
an3.58:13.3	And, Master Gotama, a master of three knowledges according to the brahmins is not worth a sixteenth part of a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble One.
an3.58:14.1	Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! …
an3.58:14.2	From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
an3.59:0.1	Numbered Discourses 3
an3.59:0.2	6. Brahmins
an3.59:0.3	59. With Jāṇussoṇi
an3.59:1.1	Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. Seated to one side he said to the Buddha:
an3.59:1.2	“Master Gotama, whoever has a sacrifice, an offering of food for ancestors, a dish of milk-rice prepared for an auspicious ceremony, or a gift to give, should give it to the brahmins who have mastered the three Vedic knowledges.”
an3.59:1.3	“But brahmin, how do the brahmins describe a brahmin who is proficient in the three Vedic knowledges?”
an3.59:1.4	“Master Gotama, it’s when a brahmin is well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation. He recites and remembers the hymns, and has mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knows philology and grammar, and is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.
an3.59:1.5	That’s how the brahmins describe a brahmin who is proficient in the three Vedic knowledges.”
an3.59:2.1	“Brahmin, a master of three knowledges according to the brahmins is quite different from a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble One.”
an3.59:2.2	“But Master Gotama, how is one a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble One?
an3.59:2.3	Master Gotama, please teach me this.”
an3.59:2.4	“Well then, brahmin, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an3.59:2.5	“Yes sir,” Jāṇussoṇi replied.
an3.59:2.6	The Buddha said this:
an3.59:3.1	“Brahmin, it’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures …
an3.59:3.2	enters and remains in the fourth absorption.
an3.59:4.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives.
an3.59:4.2	They recollect many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
an3.59:4.3	This is the first knowledge that they attain.
an3.59:4.4	Ignorance is destroyed and knowledge has arisen; darkness is destroyed and light has arisen, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.
an3.59:5.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.
an3.59:5.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human, they understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
an3.59:5.3	This is the second knowledge that they attain.
an3.59:5.4	Ignorance is destroyed and knowledge has arisen; darkness is destroyed and light has arisen, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.
an3.59:6.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.
an3.59:6.2	They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
an3.59:6.3	They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.
an3.59:6.4	Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.
an3.59:6.5	When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
an3.59:6.6	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’
an3.59:6.7	This is the third knowledge that they attain.
an3.59:6.8	Ignorance is destroyed and knowledge has arisen; darkness is destroyed, and light has arisen, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.
an3.59:7.1	One who is perfect in precepts and observances,
an3.59:7.2	resolute and serene,
an3.59:7.3	whose mind is mastered,
an3.59:7.4	unified, serene;
an3.59:8.1	who knows their past lives,
an3.59:8.2	and sees heaven and places of loss,
an3.59:8.3	and has attained the end of rebirth,
an3.59:8.4	that sage has perfect insight.
an3.59:9.1	Because of these three knowledges
an3.59:9.2	a brahmin is a master of the three knowledges.
an3.59:9.3	That’s who I call a three-knowledge master,
an3.59:9.4	and not some mere reciter.
an3.59:10.1	This, brahmin, is a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble One.”
an3.59:10.2	“Master Gotama, the master of three knowledges according to the brahmins is quite different from a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble One.
an3.59:10.3	And, Master Gotama, a master of three knowledges according to the brahmins is not worth a sixteenth part of a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble One.
an3.59:11.1	Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! …
an3.59:11.2	From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
an3.60:0.1	Numbered Discourses 3
an3.60:0.2	6. Brahmins
an3.60:0.3	60. With Saṅgārava
an3.60:1.1	Then Saṅgārava the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
an3.60:1.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
an3.60:1.3	“Master Gotama, we who are called brahmins
an3.60:1.4	make sacrifices and encourage others to make sacrifices.
an3.60:1.5	Now, Master Gotama, both of these people—the one who sacrifices and the one who encourages others to sacrifice—are doing good for many people on account of that sacrifice.
an3.60:1.6	But, Master Gotama, when someone has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness, they tame, calm, and extinguish themselves alone. That being so, they are doing good for just one person on account of that going forth.”
an3.60:2.1	“Well then, brahmin, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.
an3.60:2.2	What do you think, brahmin?
an3.60:2.3	A Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.
an3.60:2.4	He says,
an3.60:2.5	‘Come, this is the path, this is the practice. Practicing like this, I realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual life with my own insight, and I make it known.
an3.60:2.6	Please, all of you, practice like this, and you too will realize the supreme culmination of the spiritual life, and will live having realized it with your own insight.’
an3.60:2.7	So the teacher teaches Dhamma, and others practice accordingly, in their hundreds and thousands, and hundreds of thousands.
an3.60:3.1	What do you think, brahmin?
an3.60:3.2	This being so, are they doing good for just one person or for many people on account of going forth?”
an3.60:3.3	“This being so, Master Gotama, they are doing good for many people on account of going forth.”
an3.60:4.1	When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to Saṅgārava,
an3.60:4.2	“Brahmin, which of these two practices do you believe has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?”
an3.60:4.3	Saṅgārava said to Ānanda,
an3.60:4.4	“Those such as the masters Gotama and Ānanda
an3.60:4.5	are honored and praised by me!”
an3.60:5.1	For a second time, Ānanda said to Saṅgārava,
an3.60:5.2	“Brahmin, I didn’t ask you
an3.60:5.3	who you honor and praise.
an3.60:5.4	I asked you
an3.60:5.5	which of these two practices do you believe has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?”
an3.60:5.6	For a second time Saṅgārava said to Ānanda,
an3.60:5.7	“Those such as the masters Gotama and Ānanda
an3.60:5.8	are honored and praised by me!”
an3.60:6.1	For a third time, Ānanda said to Saṅgārava,
an3.60:6.2	“Brahmin, I didn’t ask you
an3.60:6.3	who you honor and praise.
an3.60:6.4	I asked you
an3.60:6.5	which of these two practices do you believe has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?”
an3.60:6.6	For a third time Saṅgārava said to Ānanda,
an3.60:6.7	“Those such as the masters Gotama and Ānanda
an3.60:6.8	are honored and praised by me!”
an3.60:7.1	Then it occurred to the Buddha,
an3.60:7.2	“Though Ānanda asked him a sensible question three times, Saṅgārava falters without answering.
an3.60:7.3	Why don’t I give him a way out?”
an3.60:7.4	So the Buddha said to Saṅgārava,
an3.60:7.5	“Brahmin, what came up in the conversation among the king’s retinue today, sitting together in the royal compound?”
an3.60:7.6	“Master Gotama, this came up:
an3.60:7.7	‘Formerly, it seems, there were fewer mendicants, but more of them displayed superhuman demonstrations of psychic power;
an3.60:7.8	while these days, there are more mendicants, but fewer display superhuman demonstrations of psychic power.’
an3.60:7.9	This is what came up in the conversation among the king’s retinue today, while sitting together in the royal compound.”
an3.60:8.1	“Brahmin, there are three kinds of demonstration.
an3.60:8.2	What three?
an3.60:8.3	A demonstration of psychic power, a demonstration of revealing, and a demonstration of instruction.
an3.60:8.4	And what is the demonstration of psychic power?
an3.60:8.5	It’s when someone wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. They control the body as far as the Brahmā realm.
an3.60:8.6	This is called the demonstration of psychic power.
an3.60:9.1	And what is the demonstration of revealing?
an3.60:9.2	In one case, someone reveals by means of a sign:
an3.60:9.3	‘This is what you’re thinking, such is your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’
an3.60:9.4	And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise.
an3.60:10.1	In another case, someone reveals after hearing it from humans or non-humans or deities:
an3.60:10.2	‘This is what you’re thinking, such is your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’
an3.60:10.3	And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise.
an3.60:11.1	In another case, someone reveals by hearing the sound of thought spreading as someone thinks and considers:
an3.60:11.2	‘This is what you’re thinking, such is your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’
an3.60:11.3	And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise.
an3.60:12.1	In another case, someone comprehends the mind of a person who has attained the immersion that’s free of placing the mind and keeping it connected. They understand:
an3.60:12.2	‘Judging by the way this person’s intentions are directed, immediately after this mind state, they’ll think this thought.’
an3.60:12.3	And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise.
an3.60:12.4	This is called the demonstration of revealing.
an3.60:13.1	And what is a demonstration of instruction?
an3.60:13.2	It’s when someone instructs others like this:
an3.60:13.3	‘Think like this, not like that. Focus your mind like this, not like that. Give up this, and live having achieved that.’
an3.60:13.4	This is called a demonstration of instruction.
an3.60:13.5	These are the three kinds of demonstration.
an3.60:13.6	Of these three kinds of demonstration, which do you consider to be the finest?”
an3.60:14.1	“Regarding this, Master Gotama, a demonstration of psychic power
an3.60:14.2	NA
an3.60:14.3	is experienced only by the one who performs it, occurring only to them.
an3.60:14.4	This seems to me like a magic trick.
an3.60:15.1	And the demonstration where someone reveals something by means of a sign,
an3.60:15.2	NA
an3.60:15.3	or after hearing it from humans, non-humans, or deities,
an3.60:15.4	or by hearing the sound of thought spreading as someone thinks and considers,
an3.60:15.5	or by comprehending the mind of another person,
an3.60:15.6	NA
an3.60:15.7	is also experienced only by the one who performs it, occurring only to them.
an3.60:15.8	This also seems to me like a magic trick.
an3.60:16.1	But as to the demonstration where someone instructs others:
an3.60:16.2	‘Think like this, not like that. Focus your mind like this, not like that. Give up this, and live having achieved that.’
an3.60:16.3	I prefer this demonstration, Master Gotama. It’s the finest of the three kinds of demonstration.
an3.60:17.1	It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing,
an3.60:17.2	how well this was said by Master Gotama. We regard Master Gotama as someone who possesses these three kinds of demonstration.
an3.60:17.3	For Master Gotama wields the many kinds of psychic power … controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm.
an3.60:17.4	And Master Gotama comprehends the mind of another person who has attained the immersion that is free of placing the mind and keeping it connected. He understands:
an3.60:17.5	‘Judging by the way this person’s intentions are directed, immediately after this mind state they’ll think this thought.’
an3.60:17.6	And Master Gotama instructs others like this:
an3.60:17.7	‘Think like this, not like that. Focus your mind like this, not like that. Give up this, and live having achieved that.’”
an3.60:18.1	“Your words are clearly invasive and intrusive, brahmin.
an3.60:18.2	Nevertheless, I will answer you.
an3.60:18.3	For I do wield the many kinds of psychic power … controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm.
an3.60:18.4	And I do comprehend the mind of another person who has attained the immersion that is free of placing the mind and keeping it connected. I understand:
an3.60:18.5	‘Judging by the way this person’s intentions are directed, immediately after this mind state they’ll think this thought.’
an3.60:18.6	And I do instruct others like this:
an3.60:18.7	‘Think like this, not like that. Focus your mind like this, not like that. Give up this, and live having achieved that.’”
an3.60:19.1	“But Master Gotama, is there even one other mendicant who possesses these three kinds of demonstration, apart from Master Gotama?”
an3.60:19.2	“There’s not just one hundred mendicants, brahmin, who possess these three kinds of demonstration, nor two, three, four, or five hundred, but many more than that.”
an3.60:19.3	“But where are these mendicants now staying?”
an3.60:19.4	“Right here, brahmin, in this Saṅgha of mendicants.”
an3.60:20.1	“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!
an3.60:20.2	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.
an3.60:20.3	I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
an3.60:20.4	From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

an3.61:0.3	61. Sectarian Tenets
an3.61:1.1	“Mendicants, these three sectarian tenets—as pursued, pressed, and grilled by the astute—when taken to their conclusion, end with inaction.
an3.61:1.2	What three?
an3.61:1.3	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
an3.61:1.4	‘Everything this individual experiences—pleasurable, painful, or neutral—is because of past deeds.’
an3.61:1.5	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
an3.61:1.6	‘Everything this individual experiences—pleasurable, painful, or neutral—is because of the Lord God’s creation.’
an3.61:1.7	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
an3.61:1.8	‘Everything this individual experiences—pleasurable, painful, or neutral—has no cause or reason.’
an3.61:2.1	Regarding this, I went up to the ascetics and brahmins whose view is that
an3.61:2.2	everything that is experienced is because of past deeds, and I said to them:
an3.61:2.3	‘Is it really true that this is the venerables’ view?’
an3.61:2.4	NA
an3.61:2.5	And they answered, ‘Yes’.
an3.61:2.6	I said to them:
an3.61:2.7	‘In that case, you might kill living creatures, steal, be unchaste; use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; be covetous, malicious, or have wrong view, all because of past deeds.’
an3.61:3.1	Those who believe that past deeds are the most important thing have no enthusiasm or effort, no idea that there are things that should and should not be done.
an3.61:3.2	Since they don’t acknowledge as a genuine fact that there are things that should and should not be done, they’re unmindful and careless, and can’t rightly be called ascetics.
an3.61:3.3	This is my first legitimate refutation of the ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view.
an3.61:4.1	Regarding this, I went up to the ascetics and brahmins whose view is that
an3.61:4.2	everything that is experienced is because of the Lord God’s creation, and I said to them:
an3.61:4.3	‘Is it really true that this is the venerables’ view?’
an3.61:4.4	NA

an3.61:4.6	I said to them:
an3.61:4.7	‘In that case, you might kill living creatures, steal, be unchaste; use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; be covetous, malicious, or have wrong view, all because of the Lord God’s creation.’
an3.61:5.1	Those who believe that the Lord God’s creative power is the most important thing have no enthusiasm, no effort, no idea that there are things that should and should not be done.
an3.61:5.2	Since they don’t acknowledge as a genuine fact that there are things that should and should not be done, they’re unmindful and careless, and can’t rightly be called ascetics.
an3.61:5.3	This is my second legitimate refutation of the ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view.
an3.61:6.1	Regarding this, I went up to the ascetics and brahmins whose view is that
an3.61:6.2	everything that is experienced has no cause or reason, and I said to them:
an3.61:6.3	‘Is it really true that this is the venerables’ view?’
an3.61:6.4	NA
an3.61:6.5	And they answered, ‘Yes’.
an3.61:6.6	I said to them:
an3.61:6.7	‘In that case, you might kill living creatures, steal, be unchaste; use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; be covetous, malicious, or have wrong view, all without cause or reason.’
an3.61:7.1	Those who believe that the absence of cause or reason is the most important thing have no enthusiasm, no effort, no idea that there are things that should and should not be done.
an3.61:7.2	Since they don’t acknowledge as a genuine fact that there are things that should and should not be done, they’re unmindful and careless, and can’t rightly be called ascetics.
an3.61:7.3	This is my third legitimate refutation of the ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view.
an3.61:8.1	These are the three sectarian tenets—as pursued, pressed, and grilled by the astute—which, when taken to their conclusion, end with inaction.
an3.61:9.1	But the Dhamma that I’ve taught is irrefutable, uncorrupted, beyond reproach, and not scorned by sensible ascetics and brahmins.
an3.61:9.2	What is the Dhamma that I’ve taught?
an3.61:9.3	‘These are the six elements’: this is the Dhamma I’ve taught …
an3.61:9.4	‘These are the six fields of contact’: this is the Dhamma I’ve taught …
an3.61:9.5	‘These are the eighteen mental preoccupations’: this is the Dhamma I’ve taught …
an3.61:9.6	‘These are the four noble truths’: this is the Dhamma I’ve taught that is irrefutable, uncorrupted, beyond reproach, and is not scorned by sensible ascetics and brahmins.
an3.61:10.1	‘“These are the six elements”: this is the Dhamma I’ve taught …’
an3.61:10.2	That’s what I said,
an3.61:10.3	but why did I say it?
an3.61:10.4	There are these six elements:
an3.61:10.5	the elements of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness.
an3.61:10.6	‘“These are the six elements”: this is the Dhamma I’ve taught …’
an3.61:10.7	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
an3.61:11.1	‘“These are the six fields of contact”: this is the Dhamma I’ve taught …’
an3.61:11.2	That’s what I said,
an3.61:11.3	but why did I say it?
an3.61:11.4	There are these six fields of contact:
an3.61:11.5	eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind contact.
an3.61:11.6	‘“These are the six fields of contact”: this is the Dhamma I’ve taught …’
an3.61:11.7	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
an3.61:12.1	‘“These are the eighteen mental preoccupations”: this is the Dhamma I’ve taught …’
an3.61:12.2	This is what I said,
an3.61:12.3	but why did I say it?
an3.61:12.4	Seeing a sight with the eye, one is preoccupied with a sight that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity.
an3.61:12.5	Hearing a sound with the ear …
an3.61:12.6	Smelling an odor with the nose …
an3.61:12.7	Tasting a flavor with the tongue …
an3.61:12.8	Feeling a touch with the body …
an3.61:12.9	Becoming conscious of a thought with the mind, one is preoccupied with a thought that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity.
an3.61:12.10	‘“These are the eighteen mental preoccupations”: this is the Dhamma I’ve taught …’
an3.61:12.11	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
an3.61:13.1	‘“These are the four noble truths”: this is the Dhamma I’ve taught …’
an3.61:13.2	That’s what I said,
an3.61:13.3	but why did I say it?
an3.61:13.4	Supported by the six elements, an embryo is conceived.
an3.61:13.5	When it is conceived, there are name and form. Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling.
an3.61:13.6	It’s for one who feels that I declare: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
an3.61:14.1	And what is the noble truth of suffering?
an3.61:14.2	Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; association with the disliked is suffering; separation from the liked is suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering.
an3.61:14.3	This is called the noble truth of suffering.
an3.61:15.1	And what is the noble truth of the origin of suffering?
an3.61:15.2	Ignorance is a condition for choices.
an3.61:15.3	Choices are a condition for consciousness.
an3.61:15.4	Consciousness is a condition for name and form.
an3.61:15.5	Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields.
an3.61:15.6	The six sense fields are conditions for contact.
an3.61:15.7	Contact is a condition for feeling.
an3.61:15.8	Feeling is a condition for craving.
an3.61:15.9	Craving is a condition for grasping.
an3.61:15.10	Grasping is a condition for continued existence.
an3.61:15.11	Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.
an3.61:15.12	Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be.
an3.61:15.13	That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
an3.61:15.14	This is called the noble truth of the origin of suffering.
an3.61:16.1	And what is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering?
an3.61:16.2	When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease.
an3.61:16.3	When choices cease, consciousness ceases.
an3.61:16.4	When consciousness ceases, name and form cease.
an3.61:16.5	When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease.
an3.61:16.6	When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases.
an3.61:16.7	When contact ceases, feeling ceases.
an3.61:16.8	When feeling ceases, craving ceases.
an3.61:16.9	When craving ceases, grasping ceases.
an3.61:16.10	When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases.
an3.61:16.11	When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases.
an3.61:16.12	When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease.
an3.61:16.13	That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.
an3.61:16.14	This is called the noble truth of the cessation of suffering.
an3.61:17.1	And what is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering?
an3.61:17.2	It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
an3.61:17.3	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
an3.61:17.4	This is called the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.
an3.61:17.5	‘“These are the four noble truths”: this is the Dhamma I’ve taught that is irrefutable, uncorrupted, beyond reproach, and is not scorned by sensible ascetics and brahmins.’
an3.61:17.6	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.”

an3.63:0.1	Numbered Discourses 3
an3.63:0.2	7. The Great Chapter
an3.63:0.3	63. At Venāgapura
an3.63:1.1	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Venāgapura.
an3.63:1.2	The brahmins and householders of Venāgapura heard:
an3.63:1.3	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Venāgapura.
an3.63:1.4	He has this good reputation:
an3.63:1.5	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
an3.63:1.6	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.
an3.63:1.7	He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
an3.63:1.8	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”
an3.63:2.1	Then the brahmins and householders of Venāgapura went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Then the brahmin Vacchagotta of Venāgapura said to the Buddha:
an3.63:3.1	“It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing,
an3.63:3.2	how your faculties are so very clear, and the complexion of your skin is pure and bright.
an3.63:3.3	It’s like a golden brown jujube in the autumn,
an3.63:3.4	NA
an3.63:3.5	or a palm fruit freshly plucked from the stalk,
an3.63:3.6	NA
an3.63:3.7	or a pendant of river gold, fashioned by a deft smith, well-wrought in the forge, and placed on a cream rug where it shines and glows and radiates.
an3.63:3.8	In the same way, your faculties are so very clear, and the complexion of your skin is pure and bright.
an3.63:3.9	Surely Master Gotama gets when he wants, without trouble or difficulty, various kinds of high and luxurious bedding, such as:
an3.63:3.10	sofas, couches, woolen covers—shag-piled, colorful, white, embroidered with flowers, quilted, embroidered with animals, double-or single-fringed—and silk covers studded with gems, as well as silken sheets, woven carpets, rugs for elephants, horses, or chariots, antelope hide rugs, and spreads of fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red cushions at both ends.”
an3.63:4.1	“Brahmin, these various kinds of high and luxurious bedding
an3.63:4.2	NA
an3.63:4.3	are hard for renunciates to find. And even if they do get them, they’re not allowed.
an3.63:5.1	There are, brahmin, these three high and luxurious beds that I get these days when I want, without trouble or difficulty.
an3.63:5.2	What three?
an3.63:5.3	The high and luxurious beds of the gods, of Brahmā, and of the noble ones.
an3.63:5.4	These are the three high and luxurious beds that I get these days when I want, without trouble or difficulty.”
an3.63:6.1	“But what, Master Gotama, is the high and luxurious bed of the gods?”
an3.63:6.2	“Brahmin, when I am living supported by a village or town, I robe up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, enter the town or village for alms.
an3.63:6.3	After the meal, on my return from almsround, I enter within a forest.
an3.63:6.4	I gather up some grass or leaves into a pile, and sit down cross-legged, with my body straight, and establish mindfulness right there.
an3.63:6.5	Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an3.63:6.6	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, I enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an3.63:6.7	And with the fading away of rapture, I enter and remain in the third absorption, where I meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
an3.63:6.8	With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
an3.63:6.9	When I’m practicing like this, if I walk, at that time I walk like the gods.
an3.63:6.10	When I’m practicing like this, if I stand, at that time I stand like the gods.
an3.63:6.11	When I’m practicing like this, if I sit, at that time I sit like the gods.
an3.63:6.12	When I’m practicing like this, if I lie down, at that time I lie down like the gods.
an3.63:6.13	This is the high and luxurious bed of the gods that I get these days when I want, without trouble or difficulty.”
an3.63:7.1	“It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing!
an3.63:7.2	Who but Master Gotama could get such a high and luxurious bed of the gods when he wants, without trouble or difficulty?
an3.63:8.1	But what, Master Gotama, is the high and luxurious bed of Brahmā?”
an3.63:8.2	“Brahmin, when I am living supported by a village or town, I robe up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, enter the town or village for alms.
an3.63:8.3	After the meal, on my return from almsround, I enter within a forest.
an3.63:8.4	I gather up some grass or leaves into a pile, and sit down cross-legged, with my body straight, and establish mindfulness right there.
an3.63:8.5	I meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, I spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
an3.63:8.6	I meditate spreading a heart full of compassion to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, I spread a heart full of compassion to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
an3.63:8.7	I meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, I spread a heart full of rejoicing to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
an3.63:8.8	I meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, I spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
an3.63:8.9	When I’m practicing like this, if I walk, at that time I walk like Brahmā.
an3.63:8.10	… I stand like Brahmā. …
an3.63:8.11	I sit like Brahmā …
an3.63:8.12	When I’m practicing like this, if I lie down, at that time I lie down like Brahmā.
an3.63:8.13	This is the high and luxurious bed of Brahmā that I get these days when I want, without trouble or difficulty.”
an3.63:9.1	“It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing!
an3.63:9.2	Who but Master Gotama could get such a high and luxurious bed of Brahmā when he wants, without trouble or difficulty?
an3.63:10.1	But what, Master Gotama, is the high and luxurious bed of the noble ones?”

an3.63:12.1	Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!
an3.63:12.2	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.
an3.63:12.3	We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.

an3.64:0.3	64. With Sarabha
an3.64:1.1	So I have heard.
an3.64:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
an3.64:1.3	Now at that time a wanderer called Sarabha had recently left this teaching and training.
an3.64:1.4	He was telling a crowd in Rājagaha,
an3.64:1.5	“I learned the teaching of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan,
an3.64:1.6	then I left their teaching and training.”
an3.64:1.7	Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Rājagaha for alms.
an3.64:1.8	They heard what Sarabha was saying.
an3.64:1.9	NA
an3.64:1.10	NA
an3.64:2.1	Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
an3.64:2.2	“The wanderer called Sarabha has recently left this teaching and training.
an3.64:2.3	He was telling a crowd in Rājagaha:
an3.64:2.4	‘I learned the teaching of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan,
an3.64:2.5	then I left their teaching and training.’
an3.64:2.6	Sir, please go to the wanderers’ monastery on the banks of the Sappinī river to see Sarabha the wanderer out of compassion.”
an3.64:2.7	The Buddha consented in silence.
an3.64:3.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the wanderers’ monastery on the banks of the Sappinī river to visit Sarabha the wanderer. He sat on the seat spread out, and said to the wanderer Sarabha,
an3.64:3.2	“Is it really true, Sarabha, that you’ve been saying:
an3.64:3.3	‘I learned the teaching of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan,
an3.64:3.4	then I left their teaching and training.’”
an3.64:3.5	When he said this, Sarabha kept silent.
an3.64:4.1	For a second time, the Buddha said to Sarabha,
an3.64:4.2	“Tell me, Sarabha, what exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan?
an3.64:4.3	If you’ve not learned it fully, I’ll fill you in.
an3.64:4.4	But if you have learned it fully, I’ll agree.”
an3.64:4.5	For a second time, Sarabha kept silent.
an3.64:5.1	For a third time, the Buddha said to Sarabha,
an3.64:5.2	“Sarabha, the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan are clear to me. What exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan?
an3.64:5.3	If you’ve not learned it fully, I’ll fill you in.
an3.64:5.4	But if you have learned it fully, I’ll agree.”
an3.64:5.5	For a third time, Sarabha kept silent.
an3.64:6.1	Then those wanderers said to Sarabha,
an3.64:6.2	“The ascetic Gotama has offered to tell you anything you ask for.
an3.64:6.3	Speak, reverend Sarabha, what exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan?
an3.64:6.4	If you’ve not learned it fully, he’ll fill you in.
an3.64:6.5	But if you have learned it fully, he’ll agree.”
an3.64:6.6	When this was said, Sarabha sat silent, embarrassed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.
an3.64:7.1	Knowing this, the Buddha said to the wanderers:
an3.64:8.1	“Wanderers, someone might say to me:
an3.64:8.2	‘You claim to be a fully awakened Buddha, but regarding these things you’re not fully awakened.’ Then I’d carefully pursue, press, and grill them on that point.
an3.64:8.3	When grilled by me, they would, without a doubt, fall into one of these three categories. They’d dodge the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points. They’d display annoyance, hate, and bitterness. Or they’d sit silent, embarrassed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say, like Sarabha.
an3.64:9.1	Wanderers, someone might say to me:
an3.64:9.2	‘You claim to have ended all defilements, but you still have these defilements.’ Then I’d carefully pursue, press, and grill them on that point.
an3.64:9.3	When grilled by me, they would, without a doubt, fall into one of these three categories. They’d dodge the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points. They’d display annoyance, hate, and bitterness. Or they’d sit silent, embarrassed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say, like Sarabha.
an3.64:10.1	Wanderers, someone might say to me:
an3.64:10.2	‘Your teaching does not lead someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of suffering.’ Then I’d carefully pursue, press, and grill them on that point.
an3.64:10.3	When grilled by me, they would, without a doubt, fall into one of these three categories. They’d dodge the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points. They’d display annoyance, hate, and bitterness. Or they’d sit silent, embarrassed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say, like Sarabha.”
an3.64:10.4	Then the Buddha, having roared his lion’s roar three times in the wanderers’ monastery on the bank of the Sappinī river, rose into the sky and flew away.
an3.64:11.1	Soon after the Buddha left, those wanderers gave Sarabha a comprehensive tongue-lashing:
an3.64:11.2	“Reverend Sarabha, you’re just like an old jackal in the formidable wilderness who thinks, ‘I’ll roar a lion’s roar!’ but they still only manage to squeal and yelp like a jackal.
an3.64:11.3	In the same way, when the ascetic Gotama wasn’t here you said ‘I’ll roar a lion’s roar!’ but you only managed to squeal and yelp like a jackal.
an3.64:11.4	You’re just like a golden oriole who thinks, ‘I’ll cry like a cuckoo!’ but they still only manage to cry like a golden oriole.
an3.64:11.5	In the same way, when the ascetic Gotama wasn’t here you said ‘I’ll cry like a cuckoo!’ but you still only managed to cry like a golden oriole.
an3.64:11.6	You’re just like a bull that thinks to bellow only when the cowstall is empty.
an3.64:11.7	In the same way, you only thought to bellow when the ascetic Gotama wasn’t here.”
an3.64:11.8	That’s how those wanderers gave Sarabha a comprehensive tongue-lashing.
an3.65:0.1	Numbered Discourses 3
an3.65:0.2	7. The Great Chapter
an3.65:0.3	65. With the Kālāmas of Kesamutta
an3.65:1.1	So I have heard.
an3.65:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Kālāmas named Kesamutta.
an3.65:1.3	The Kālāmas of Kesamutta heard:
an3.65:1.4	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Kesamutta.
an3.65:1.5	He has this good reputation:
an3.65:1.6	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha …’
an3.65:1.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”
an3.65:2.1	Then the Kālāmas went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Seated to one side the Kālāmas said to the Buddha:
an3.65:3.1	“There are, sir, some ascetics and brahmins who come to Kesamutta.
an3.65:3.2	They explain and promote only their own doctrine, while they attack, badmouth, disparage, and smear the doctrines of others.
an3.65:3.3	Then some other ascetics and brahmins come to Kesamutta.
an3.65:3.4	They too explain and promote only their own doctrine, while they attack, badmouth, disparage, and smear the doctrines of others.
an3.65:3.5	So, sir, we’re doubting and uncertain:
an3.65:3.6	‘I wonder who of these respected ascetics and brahmins speaks the truth, and who speaks falsehood?’”
an3.65:3.7	“It is enough, Kālāmas, for you to be doubting and uncertain.
an3.65:3.8	Doubt has come up in you about an uncertain matter.
an3.65:4.1	Please, Kālāmas, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’
an3.65:4.2	But when you know for yourselves:
an3.65:4.3	‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering’, then you should give them up.
an3.65:5.1	What do you think, Kālāmas?
an3.65:5.2	Does greed come up in a person for their welfare or harm?”
an3.65:6.1	“Harm, sir.”
an3.65:7.1	“A greedy individual, overcome by greed, kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”
an3.65:8.1	“Yes, sir.”
an3.65:9.1	“What do you think, Kālāmas?
an3.65:9.2	Does hate come up in a person for their welfare or harm?”
an3.65:10.1	“Harm, sir.”
an3.65:11.1	“A hateful individual, overcome by hate, kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”
an3.65:12.1	“Yes, sir.”
an3.65:13.1	“What do you think, Kālāmas?
an3.65:13.2	Does delusion come up in a person for their welfare or harm?”
an3.65:14.1	“Harm, sir.”
an3.65:15.1	“A deluded individual, overcome by delusion, kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”
an3.65:16.1	“Yes, sir.”
an3.65:17.1	“What do you think, Kālāmas, are these things skillful or unskillful?”
an3.65:18.1	“Unskillful, sir.”
an3.65:19.1	“Blameworthy or blameless?”
an3.65:20.1	“Blameworthy, sir.”
an3.65:21.1	“Criticized or praised by sensible people?”
an3.65:22.1	“Criticized by sensible people, sir.”
an3.65:23.1	“When you undertake them, do they lead to harm and suffering, or not?
an3.65:23.2	Or how do you see this?”
an3.65:24.1	“When you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering.
an3.65:24.2	That’s how we see it.”
an3.65:25.1	“So, Kālāmas, when I said:
an3.65:25.2	‘Please,
an3.65:25.3	don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think “The ascetic is our respected teacher.”
an3.65:25.4	But when you know for yourselves:
an3.65:25.5	“These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering”, then you should give them up.’
an3.65:25.6	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
an3.65:26.1	Please, Kālāmas, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’
an3.65:26.2	But when you know for yourselves:
an3.65:26.3	‘These things are skillful, blameless, praised by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness’, then you should acquire them and keep them.
an3.65:27.1	What do you think, Kālāmas?
an3.65:27.2	Does contentment come up in a person for their welfare or harm?”
an3.65:28.1	“Welfare, sir.”
an3.65:29.1	“An individual who is content, not overcome by greed, doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie, or encourage others to do the same. Is that for their lasting welfare and happiness?”
an3.65:30.1	“Yes, sir.”
an3.65:31.1	“What do you think, Kālāmas?
an3.65:31.2	Does love come up in a person for their welfare or harm? …
an3.65:31.3	Does understanding come up in a person for their welfare or harm? …
an3.65:31.4	Is that for their lasting welfare and happiness?”
an3.65:32.1	“Yes, sir.”
an3.65:33.1	“What do you think, Kālāmas, are these things skillful or unskillful?”
an3.65:34.1	“Skillful, sir.”
an3.65:35.1	“Blameworthy or blameless?”
an3.65:36.1	“Blameless, sir.”
an3.65:37.1	“Criticized or praised by sensible people?”
an3.65:38.1	“Praised by sensible people, sir.”
an3.65:39.1	“When you undertake them, do they lead to welfare and happiness, or not?
an3.65:39.2	Or how do you see this?”
an3.65:40.1	“When you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness.
an3.65:40.2	That’s how we see it.”
an3.65:41.1	“So, Kālāmas, when I said:
an3.65:41.2	‘Please,
an3.65:41.3	don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think “The ascetic is our respected teacher.”
an3.65:41.4	But when you know for yourselves:
an3.65:41.5	“These things are skillful, blameless, praised by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness”, then you should acquire them and keep them.’
an3.65:41.6	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
an3.65:42.1	Then that noble disciple is rid of desire, rid of ill will, unconfused, aware, and mindful. They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
an3.65:42.2	They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of compassion to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
an3.65:42.3	They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of rejoicing to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
an3.65:42.4	They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
an3.65:43.1	When that noble disciple has a mind that’s free of enmity and ill will, uncorrupted and purified,
an3.65:43.2	they’ve won four consolations in the present life.
an3.65:43.3	‘If it turns out there is another world, and good and bad deeds have a result, then—when the body breaks up, after death—I’ll be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ This is the first consolation they’ve won.
an3.65:44.1	‘If it turns out there is no other world, and good and bad deeds don’t have a result, then in the present life I’ll keep myself free of enmity and ill will, untroubled and happy.’ This is the second consolation they’ve won.
an3.65:45.1	‘If it turns out that bad things happen to people who do bad things, then since I have no bad intentions,
an3.65:45.2	and since I’m not doing anything bad, how can suffering touch me?’ This is the third consolation they’ve won.
an3.65:46.1	‘If it turns out that bad things don’t happen to people who do bad things, then I still see myself pure on both sides.’ This is the fourth consolation they’ve won.
an3.65:47.1	When that noble disciple has a mind that’s free of enmity and ill will, undefiled and purified,
an3.65:47.2	they’ve won these four consolations in the present life.”
an3.65:48.1	“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!
an3.65:48.2	When that noble disciple has a mind that’s free of enmity and ill will, undefiled and purified,
an3.65:48.3	they’ve won these four consolations in the present life. …

an3.65:52.1	NA

an3.65:53.1	Excellent, sir! Excellent! …
an3.65:53.2	We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
an3.65:53.3	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”
an3.66:0.1	Numbered Discourses 3
an3.66:0.2	7. The Great Chapter
an3.66:0.3	66. With Sāḷha and His Friend
an3.66:1.1	So I have heard.
an3.66:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Nandaka was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.
an3.66:1.3	Then Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, and Rohaṇa, Pekhuṇiya’s grandson went up to Venerable Nandaka, bowed, and sat down to one side. Then Venerable Nandaka said to Sāḷha:
an3.66:2.1	“Please, Sāḷha and friend, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’
an3.66:2.2	But when you know for yourselves: ‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering’, then you should give them up.
an3.66:3.1	What do you think, Sāḷha?
an3.66:3.2	Is greed real?”
an3.66:4.1	“Yes, sir.”
an3.66:5.1	“‘Covetousness’ is what I mean by this.
an3.66:5.2	A person who is greedy and covetous kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”
an3.66:6.1	“Yes, sir.”
an3.66:7.1	“What do you think, Sāḷha?
an3.66:7.2	Is hate real?”
an3.66:8.1	“Yes, sir.”
an3.66:9.1	“‘Malice’ is what I mean by this.
an3.66:9.2	A hateful and malicious person kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”
an3.66:10.1	“Yes, sir.”
an3.66:11.1	“What do you think, Sāḷha?
an3.66:11.2	Is delusion real?”
an3.66:12.1	“Yes, sir.”
an3.66:13.1	“‘Ignorance’ is what I mean by this.
an3.66:13.2	A person who is deluded and ignorant kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”
an3.66:14.1	“Yes, sir.”
an3.66:15.1	“What do you think, Sāḷha, are these things skillful or unskillful?”
an3.66:16.1	“Unskillful, sir.”
an3.66:17.1	“Blameworthy or blameless?”
an3.66:18.1	“Blameworthy, sir.”
an3.66:19.1	“Criticized or praised by sensible people?”
an3.66:20.1	“Criticized by sensible people, sir.”
an3.66:21.1	“When you undertake them, do they lead to harm and suffering, or not?
an3.66:21.2	Or how do you see this?”
an3.66:22.1	“When you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering.
an3.66:22.2	That’s how we see it.”
an3.66:23.1	“So, Sāḷha and friend, when I said:
an3.66:23.2	‘Please, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think “The ascetic is our respected teacher.”
an3.66:23.3	But when you know for yourselves:
an3.66:23.4	“These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering”, then you should give them up.’
an3.66:23.5	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
an3.66:24.1	Please, Sāḷha and friend, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’
an3.66:24.2	But when you know for yourselves:
an3.66:24.3	‘These things are skillful, blameless, praised by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness’, then you should acquire them and keep them.
an3.66:25.1	What do you think? Is contentment real?”
an3.66:26.1	“Yes, sir.”
an3.66:27.1	“‘Satisfaction’ is what I mean by this.
an3.66:27.2	A person who is content and satisfied doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie, or encourage others to do the same. Is that for their lasting welfare and happiness?”
an3.66:28.1	“Yes, sir.”
an3.66:29.1	What do you think? Is love real?”
an3.66:30.1	“Yes, sir.”
an3.66:31.1	“‘Kindness’ is what I mean by this.
an3.66:31.2	A loving and kind-hearted person doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie, or encourage others to do the same. Is that for their lasting welfare and happiness?”
an3.66:32.1	“Yes, sir.”
an3.66:33.1	“What do you think, Sāḷha?
an3.66:33.2	Is understanding real?”
an3.66:34.1	“Yes, sir.”
an3.66:35.1	“‘Knowledge’ is what I mean by this.
an3.66:35.2	A person who understands and knows doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie, or encourage others to do the same. Is that for their lasting welfare and happiness?”
an3.66:36.1	“Yes, sir.”
an3.66:37.1	“What do you think, Sāḷha, are these things skillful or unskillful?”
an3.66:38.1	“Skillful, sir.”
an3.66:39.1	“Blameworthy or blameless?”
an3.66:40.1	“Blameless, sir.”
an3.66:41.1	“Criticized or praised by sensible people?”
an3.66:42.1	“Praised by sensible people, sir.”
an3.66:43.1	“When you undertake them, do they lead to welfare and happiness, or not?
an3.66:43.2	Or how do you see this?”
an3.66:44.1	“When you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness.
an3.66:44.2	That’s how we see it.”
an3.66:45.1	“So, Sāḷha and friend, when I said:
an3.66:45.2	‘Please, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think “The ascetic is our respected teacher.”
an3.66:45.3	But when you know for yourselves:
an3.66:45.4	“These things are skillful, blameless, praised by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness”, then you should acquire them and keep them.’
an3.66:45.5	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
an3.66:46.1	Then that noble disciple is rid of desire, rid of ill will, unconfused, aware, and mindful. They meditate spreading a heart full of love …
an3.66:46.2	compassion …
an3.66:46.3	rejoicing …
an3.66:46.4	equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
an3.66:46.5	They understand:
an3.66:46.6	‘There is this, there is what is worse than this, there is what is better than this, and there is an escape beyond the scope of perception.’
an3.66:46.7	Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.
an3.66:46.8	When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
an3.66:46.9	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’
an3.66:47.1	They understand:
an3.66:47.2	‘Formerly there was greed, which was unskillful. Now there is none, so that’s skillful.
an3.66:47.3	Formerly there was hate, which was unskillful. Now there is none, so that’s skillful.
an3.66:47.4	Formerly there was delusion, which was unskillful. Now there is none, so that’s skillful.’
an3.66:47.5	So they live without wishes in the present life, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, having become holy in themselves.”
an3.67:0.1	Numbered Discourses 3
an3.67:0.2	7. The Great Chapter
an3.67:0.3	67. Topics of Discussion
an3.67:1.1	“There are, mendicants, these three topics of discussion.
an3.67:1.2	What three?
an3.67:1.3	You might discuss the past:
an3.67:1.4	‘That is how it was in the past.’
an3.67:1.5	You might discuss the future:
an3.67:1.6	‘That is how it will be in the future.’
an3.67:1.7	Or you might discuss the present:
an3.67:1.8	‘This is how it is at present.’
an3.67:2.1	You can know whether or not a person is competent to hold a discussion by seeing how they take part in a discussion.
an3.67:2.2	When a person is asked a question, if it needs to be answered definitively and they don’t answer it definitively; or if it needs analysis and they answer without analyzing it; or if it needs a counter-question and they answer without a counter-question; or if it should be set aside and they don’t set it aside, then that person is not competent to hold a discussion.
an3.67:2.3	When a person is asked a question, if it needs to be answered definitively and they answer it definitively; or if it needs analysis and they answer after analyzing it; or if it needs a counter-question and they answer with a counter-question; or if it should be set aside and they set it aside, then that person is competent to hold a discussion.
an3.67:3.1	You can know whether or not a person is competent to hold a discussion by seeing how they take part in a discussion.
an3.67:3.2	When a person is asked a question, if they’re not consistent about what their position is and what it isn’t; about what they propose; about speaking from what they know; and about the appropriate procedure, then that person is not competent to hold a discussion.
an3.67:3.3	When a person is asked a question, if they are consistent about what their position is and what it isn’t; about what they propose; about speaking from what they know; and about the appropriate procedure, then that person is competent to hold a discussion.
an3.67:4.1	You can know whether or not a person is competent to hold a discussion by seeing how they take part in a discussion.
an3.67:4.2	When a person is asked a question, if they dodge the issue; distract the discussion with irrelevant points; or display annoyance, hate, and bitterness, then that person is not competent to hold a discussion.
an3.67:4.3	When a person is asked a question, if they don’t dodge the issue; distract the discussion with irrelevant points; or display annoyance, hate, and bitterness, then that person is competent to hold a discussion.
an3.67:5.1	You can know whether or not a person is competent to hold a discussion by seeing how they take part in a discussion.
an3.67:5.2	When a person is asked a question, if they intimidate, crush, mock, or seize on trivial mistakes, then that person is not competent to hold a discussion.
an3.67:5.3	When a person is asked a question, if they don’t intimidate, crush, mock, or seize on trivial mistakes, then that person is competent to hold a discussion.
an3.67:6.1	You can know whether or not a person has what’s required by seeing how they take part in a discussion.
an3.67:6.2	If they lend an ear they have what’s required; if they don’t lend an ear they don’t have what’s required.
an3.67:6.3	Someone who has what’s required directly knows one thing, completely understands one thing, gives up one thing, and realizes one thing—
an3.67:6.4	and then they experience complete freedom.
an3.67:6.5	This is the purpose of discussion,
an3.67:6.6	consultation,
an3.67:6.7	the requirements,
an3.67:6.8	and listening well, that is, the liberation of the mind by not grasping.
an3.67:7.1	Those who converse with hostility,
an3.67:7.2	too sure of themselves, arrogant,
an3.67:7.3	ignoble, attacking virtues,
an3.67:7.4	they look for flaws in each other.
an3.67:8.1	They rejoice together when their opponent
an3.67:8.2	speaks poorly and makes a mistake,
an3.67:8.3	becoming confused and defeated—
an3.67:8.4	but the noble ones don’t discuss like this.

an3.67:9.2	connected with the teaching and its meaning—
an3.67:9.3	the kind of discussion that noble ones hold—
an3.67:9.4	then that wise one should start the discussion,
an3.67:10.1	knowing when the time is right,
an3.67:10.2	neither hostile nor arrogant.
an3.67:10.3	Not over-excited,
an3.67:10.4	contemptuous, or aggressive,
an3.67:11.1	or with a mind full of jealousy,
an3.67:11.2	they’d speak from what they rightly know.
an3.67:11.3	They agree with what was well spoken,
an3.67:11.4	without criticizing what was poorly said.
an3.67:12.1	They’d not persist in finding faults,
an3.67:12.2	nor seize on trivial mistakes,

an3.68:1.1	“Mendicants, if wanderers who follow other paths were to ask:
an3.68:1.2	‘There are these three things.
an3.68:1.3	What three?
an3.68:1.4	Greed, hate, and delusion.
an3.68:1.5	These are the three things.
an3.68:1.6	What’s the difference between them?’
an3.68:1.7	How would you answer them?”
an3.68:1.8	“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
an3.68:1.9	“Well then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an3.68:1.10	“Yes, sir,” they replied.
an3.68:1.11	The Buddha said this:

an3.68:2.5	These are the three things.

an3.68:2.7	You should answer them:
an3.68:2.8	‘Greed, reverends, is mildly blameworthy, but slow to fade away. Hate is very blameworthy, but quick to fade away. Delusion is very blameworthy, and slow to fade away.’
an3.68:3.1	And if they ask: ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why greed arises, and once arisen it increases and grows?’
an3.68:3.2	You should say: ‘The beautiful feature of things.
an3.68:3.3	When you attend improperly to the beautiful feature of things, greed arises, and once arisen it increases and grows.
an3.68:3.4	This is the cause, this is the reason why greed arises, and once arisen it increases and grows.’

an3.69:1.1	“Mendicants, there are these three unskillful roots.
an3.69:1.2	What three?
an3.69:1.3	Greed, hate, and delusion.
an3.69:2.1	Greed is a root of the unskillful.
an3.69:2.2	When a greedy person chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is unskillful.
an3.69:2.3	When a greedy person, overcome by greed, causes another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want power’, that too is unskillful.
an3.69:2.4	And so these many bad, unskillful things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and conditioned by greed.
an3.69:3.1	Hate is a root of the unskillful.
an3.69:3.2	When a hateful person chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is unskillful.
an3.69:3.3	When a hateful person, overcome by hate, causes another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want power’, that too is unskillful.
an3.69:3.4	And so these many bad, unskillful things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and conditioned by hate.
an3.69:4.1	Delusion is a root of the unskillful.
an3.69:4.2	When a deluded person chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is unskillful.
an3.69:4.3	When a deluded person, overcome by delusion, causes another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want power’, that too is unskillful.
an3.69:4.4	And so these many bad, unskillful things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and conditioned by delusion.
an3.69:4.5	Such a person is said to have speech that’s ill-timed, false, meaningless, not in line with the teaching and training.
an3.69:5.1	Why is this?
an3.69:5.2	This person causes another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want power’.
an3.69:5.3	So when someone makes a valid criticism, they’re scornful and admit nothing.
an3.69:5.4	When someone makes a baseless criticism, they make no effort to explain, ‘This is why that’s untrue, this is why that’s false.’
an3.69:5.5	That’s why such a person is said to have speech that’s ill-timed, false, meaningless, not in line with the teaching and training.
an3.69:6.1	Such a person—overcome with bad, unskillful qualities born of greed, hate, and delusion—suffers in the present life, with anguish, distress, and fever.

an3.69:10.2	When a contented person chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is skillful.
an3.69:10.3	When a contented person, not overcome by greed, doesn’t cause another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want power’, that too is skillful.
an3.69:10.4	And so these many skillful things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and conditioned by contentment.
an3.69:11.1	Love is a root of the skillful.

an3.70:0.2	7. The Great Chapter
an3.70:0.3	70. Sabbath
an3.70:1.1	So I have heard.
an3.70:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.
an3.70:1.3	Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to her,
an3.70:1.4	“So, Visākhā, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”
an3.70:1.5	“Today, sir, I’m observing the sabbath.”
an3.70:2.1	“There are, Visākhā, these three sabbaths.
an3.70:2.2	What three?
an3.70:2.3	The sabbath of the cowherds, the sabbath of the Jains, and the sabbath of the noble ones.
an3.70:2.4	And what is the sabbath of the cowherds?
an3.70:2.5	It’s just like a cowherd who, in the late afternoon, takes the cows back to their owners. They reflect:
an3.70:2.6	‘Today the cows grazed in this place and that, and they drank in this place and that.
an3.70:2.7	Tomorrow the cows will graze in this place and that, and drink in this place and that.’
an3.70:2.8	In the same way, someone keeping the sabbath reflects:
an3.70:2.9	‘Today I ate this and that, and had a meal of this and that.
an3.70:2.10	Tomorrow I’ll eat this and that, and have a meal of this and that.’
an3.70:2.11	And so they spend their day with a mind full of covetousness.
an3.70:2.12	That’s the sabbath of the cowherds.
an3.70:2.13	When the cowherd’s sabbath is observed like this it’s not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or bountiful.
an3.70:3.1	And what is the sabbath of the Jains?
an3.70:3.2	There’s a kind of ascetic belonging to a group called the Jains.
an3.70:3.3	They encourage their disciples:
an3.70:3.4	‘Please, good people, don’t hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the east.
an3.70:3.5	Don’t hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the west.
an3.70:3.6	Don’t hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the north.
an3.70:3.7	Don’t hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the south.’
an3.70:3.8	So they encourage kindness and compassion for some creatures and not others.
an3.70:3.9	On the sabbath, they encourage their disciples:
an3.70:3.10	‘Please, good people, take off all your clothes and say:
an3.70:3.11	“I don’t belong to anyone anywhere! And nothing belongs to me anywhere!”’
an3.70:3.12	But their mother and father still know,
an3.70:3.13	‘This is our child.’
an3.70:3.14	And they know,
an3.70:3.15	‘This is my mother and father.’
an3.70:3.16	Partner and child still know,
an3.70:3.17	‘This is our supporter.’
an3.70:3.18	And they know,
an3.70:3.19	‘This is my partner and child.’
an3.70:3.20	Bondservants, workers, and staff still know:
an3.70:3.21	‘This is our master.’
an3.70:3.22	And they know,
an3.70:3.23	‘These are my bondservants, workers, and staff.’
an3.70:3.24	So, at a time when they should be encouraged to speak the truth, the Jains encourage them to lie.
an3.70:3.25	This, I say, is lying.
an3.70:3.26	When the night has passed they use their possessions once more, though they’ve not been given back to them.
an3.70:3.27	This, I say, is stealing.
an3.70:3.28	That’s the sabbath of the Jains.
an3.70:3.29	When the Jain’s sabbath is observed like this it’s not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or bountiful.
an3.70:4.1	And what is the sabbath of the noble ones?
an3.70:4.2	A corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort.
an3.70:4.3	And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort?

an3.70:4.6	As they recollect the Realized One, their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up. It’s just like cleaning a dirty head by applying effort.
an3.70:5.1	And how is a dirty head cleaned by applying effort?
an3.70:5.2	With cleansing paste, clay, and water, and by applying the appropriate effort.

an3.70:10.2	And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort?

an3.70:10.4	‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’
an3.70:10.5	As they recollect the Saṅgha, their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up. It’s just like cleaning a dirty cloth by applying effort.
an3.70:11.1	And how is a dirty cloth cleaned by applying effort?
an3.70:11.2	With salt, lye, cow dung, and water, and by applying the appropriate effort.

an3.70:18.9	As they recollect the faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom of both themselves and those deities, their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up.
an3.70:18.10	This is called: ‘A noble disciple who observes the sabbath of the deities, living together with the deities. And because they think of the deities their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up.’
an3.70:18.11	That’s how a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort.
an3.70:19.1	Then that noble disciple reflects:
an3.70:19.2	‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They are scrupulous and kind, and live full of compassion for all living beings.
an3.70:19.3	I, too, for this day and night will give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. I’ll be scrupulous and kind, and live full of compassion for all living beings.
an3.70:19.4	I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.
an3.70:20.1	As long as they live, the perfected ones give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving.
an3.70:20.2	I, too, for this day and night will give up stealing. I’ll take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. I’ll keep myself clean by not thieving.
an3.70:20.3	I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.
an3.70:21.1	As long as they live, the perfected ones give up unchastity. They are celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex.
an3.70:21.2	I, too, for this day and night will give up unchastity. I will be celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex.
an3.70:21.3	I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.
an3.70:22.1	As long as they live, the perfected ones give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and trustworthy, and don’t trick the world with their words.
an3.70:22.2	I, too, for this day and night will give up lying. I’ll speak the truth and stick to the truth. I’ll be honest and trustworthy, and won’t trick the world with my words.
an3.70:22.3	I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.
an3.70:23.1	As long as they live, the perfected ones give up alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
an3.70:23.2	I, too, for this day and night will give up alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
an3.70:23.3	I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.
an3.70:24.1	As long as they live, the perfected ones eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and from food at the wrong time.
an3.70:24.2	I, too, for this day and night will eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time.
an3.70:24.3	I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.
an3.70:25.1	As long as they live, the perfected ones avoid dancing, singing, music, and seeing shows; and beautifying and adorning themselves with garlands, fragrance, and makeup.
an3.70:25.2	I, too, for this day and night will avoid dancing, singing, music, and seeing shows; and beautifying and adorning myself with garlands, fragrance, and makeup.
an3.70:25.3	I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.
an3.70:26.1	As long as they live, the perfected ones give up high and luxurious beds. They sleep in a low place, either a cot or a straw mat.
an3.70:26.2	I, too, for this day and night will give up high and luxurious beds. I’ll sleep in a low place, either a cot or a straw mat.
an3.70:26.3	I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’
an3.70:27.1	That’s the sabbath of the noble ones.
an3.70:27.2	When the sabbath of the noble ones is observed like this it’s very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful.
an3.70:28.1	How much so?
an3.70:28.2	Suppose you were to rule as sovereign lord over these sixteen great countries—Aṅga, Magadha, Kāsī, Kosala, Vajjī, Malla, Ceti, Vaṅga, Kuru, Pañcāla, Maccha, Sūrusena, Assaka, Avanti, Gandhāra, and Kamboja—full of the seven treasures.
an3.70:28.3	This wouldn’t be worth a sixteenth part of the sabbath with its eight factors.
an3.70:28.4	Why is that?
an3.70:28.5	Because human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.
an3.70:29.1	Fifty years in the human realm is one day and night for the gods of the Four Great Kings.
an3.70:29.2	Thirty such days make up a month.
an3.70:29.3	Twelve such months make up a year.
an3.70:29.4	The life span of the gods of the Four Great Kings is five hundred of these divine years.
an3.70:29.5	It’s possible that a woman or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will—when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company of the gods of the Four Great Kings.
an3.70:29.6	This is what I was referring to when I said:
an3.70:29.7	‘Human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’
an3.70:30.1	A hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for the Gods of the Thirty-Three.

an3.70:30.4	The life span of the Gods of the Thirty-Three is a thousand of these divine years.
an3.70:30.5	It’s possible that a woman or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will—when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company of the Gods of the Thirty-Three.

an3.70:31.2	Thirty such days make up a month.
an3.70:31.3	Twelve such months make up a year.
an3.70:31.4	The life span of the Gods of Yama is two thousand of these divine years.
an3.70:31.5	It’s possible that a woman or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will—when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company of the Gods of Yama.

an3.70:32.3	Twelve such months make up a year.
an3.70:32.4	The life span of the Joyful Gods is four thousand of these divine years.
an3.70:32.5	It’s possible that a woman or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will—when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company of the Joyful Gods.
an3.70:32.6	This is what I was referring to when I said:
an3.70:32.7	‘Human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’
an3.70:33.1	Eight hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for the Gods Who Love to Create.
an3.70:33.2	Thirty such days make up a month.
an3.70:33.3	Twelve such months make up a year.
an3.70:33.4	The life span of the Gods Who Love to Create is eight thousand of these divine years.
an3.70:33.5	It’s possible that a woman or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will—when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company of the Gods Who Love to Create.
an3.70:33.6	This is what I was referring to when I said:
an3.70:33.7	‘Human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’
an3.70:34.1	Sixteen hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others.
an3.70:34.2	Thirty such days make up a month.
an3.70:34.3	Twelve such months make up a year.
an3.70:34.4	The life span of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others is sixteen thousand of these divine years.
an3.70:34.5	It’s possible that a woman or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will—when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others.
an3.70:34.6	This is what I was referring to when I said:
an3.70:34.7	‘Human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’
an3.70:35.1	You shouldn’t kill living creatures, or steal,
an3.70:35.2	or lie, or drink alcohol.
an3.70:35.3	Be celibate, refraining from sex,
an3.70:35.4	and don’t eat at night, the wrong time.
an3.70:36.1	Not wearing garlands or applying fragrance,
an3.70:36.2	you should sleep on a low bed, or a mat on the ground.
an3.70:36.3	This is the eight-factored sabbath, they say,
an3.70:36.4	explained by the Buddha, who has gone to suffering’s end.
an3.70:37.1	The moon and sun are both fair to see,
an3.70:37.2	radiating as far as they revolve.
an3.70:37.3	Those shining ones in the sky light up the quarters,
an3.70:37.4	dispelling the darkness as they traverse the heavens.
an3.70:38.1	All of the wealth that’s found in this realm—
an3.70:38.2	pearls, gems, fine beryl too,
an3.70:38.3	horn-gold or mountain gold,
an3.70:38.4	or natural gold dug up by marmots—
an3.70:39.1	they’re not worth a sixteenth part
an3.70:39.2	of the sabbath with its eight factors,
an3.70:39.3	as starlight cannot rival the moon.
an3.70:40.1	So an ethical woman or man,
an3.70:40.2	who has observed the eight-factored sabbath,
an3.70:40.3	having made merit whose outcome is happiness,
an3.70:40.4	blameless, they go to a heavenly place.”

an3.71:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an3.71:1.2	Then the wanderer Channa went up to Venerable Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him.
an3.71:1.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda:
an3.71:1.4	“Reverend Ānanda, do you advocate giving up greed, hate, and delusion?”
an3.71:1.5	“We do, reverend.”
an3.71:2.1	“But what drawbacks have you seen, Reverend Ānanda, that you advocate giving up greed, hate, and delusion?”
an3.71:3.1	“A greedy person, overcome by greed, intends to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. They experience mental pain and sadness.
an3.71:3.2	When greed has been given up, they don’t intend to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. They don’t experience mental pain and sadness.
an3.71:3.3	A greedy person does bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.

an3.71:3.6	When greed has been given up, they truly understand what’s for their own good, the good of another, or the good of both.
an3.71:3.7	Greed is a destroyer of sight, vision, and knowledge. It blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of anguish, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment.

an3.72:0.3	72. A Disciple of the Ājīvakas
an3.72:1.1	At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery.
an3.72:1.2	Then a householder who was a disciple of the Ājīvaka ascetics went up to Venerable Ānanda, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to Ānanda:
an3.72:2.1	“Sir, whose teaching is well explained?
an3.72:2.2	Who in the world is practicing well?
an3.72:2.3	Who in the world has done well?”
an3.72:2.4	“Well then, householder, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.
an3.72:2.5	What do you think, householder?
an3.72:2.6	Is the teaching of those who teach for giving up greed, hate, and delusion well explained or not?
an3.72:2.7	Or how do you see this?”
an3.72:2.8	“The teaching of those who teach for giving up greed, hate, and delusion is well explained.
an3.72:2.9	That’s how I see it.”
an3.72:3.1	“What do you think, householder?
an3.72:3.2	Are those who practice for giving up greed, hate, and delusion practicing well or not?
an3.72:3.3	Or how do you see this?”
an3.72:3.4	“Those who practice for giving up greed, hate, and delusion are practicing well.
an3.72:3.5	That’s how I see it.”
an3.72:4.1	“What do you think, householder?
an3.72:4.2	Have those who’ve given up greed, hate, and delusion—so they’re cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future—done well in the world, or not?
an3.72:4.3	Or how do you see this?”
an3.72:4.4	“Those who’ve given up greed, hate, and delusion have done well in the world.
an3.72:4.5	That’s how I see it.”
an3.72:5.1	“So, householder, you’ve declared:
an3.72:5.2	‘The teaching of those who teach for giving up greed, hate, and delusion is well explained.’
an3.72:5.3	And you’ve declared:
an3.72:5.4	‘Those who practice for giving up greed, hate, and delusion are practicing well.’
an3.72:5.5	And you’ve declared:
an3.72:5.6	‘Those who’ve given up greed, hate, and delusion have done well in the world.’”
an3.72:6.1	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!
an3.72:6.2	There’s no acclaiming your own teaching or disrespecting someone else’s,
an3.72:6.3	just teaching what’s relevant in that context. The goal is spoken of, but the self is not involved.
an3.72:6.4	You, sir, teach Dhamma for giving up greed, hate, and delusion.
an3.72:6.5	Your teaching is well explained.
an3.72:6.6	You, sir, practice for giving up greed, hate, and delusion.
an3.72:6.7	You in the world are practicing well.
an3.72:6.8	You’ve given up greed, hate, and delusion.
an3.72:6.9	You in the world have done well.
an3.72:7.1	Excellent, sir! Excellent!
an3.72:7.2	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Venerable Ānanda has made the teaching clear in many ways.
an3.72:7.3	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
an3.72:7.4	From this day forth, may Venerable Ānanda remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

an3.73:0.3	73. With Mahānāma the Sakyan
an3.73:1.1	So I have heard.
an3.73:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.
an3.73:1.3	Now at that time the Buddha had recently recovered from an illness.
an3.73:1.4	Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an3.73:1.5	“For a long time, sir, I have understood your teaching like this:
an3.73:1.6	‘Knowledge is for those with immersion, not those without immersion.’
an3.73:1.7	But, sir, does immersion come first, then knowledge?
an3.73:1.8	Or does knowledge come first, then immersion?”
an3.73:1.9	Then Venerable Ānanda thought,
an3.73:1.10	“The Buddha has recently recovered from an illness,
an3.73:1.11	and this Mahānāma asks him a question that’s too deep.
an3.73:1.12	Why don’t I take him off to one side and teach him the Dhamma?”
an3.73:2.1	Then Ānanda took Mahānāma by the arm, led him off to one side, and said to him,
an3.73:2.2	“Mahānāma, the Buddha has spoken of the ethics, immersion, and wisdom of a trainee; and the ethics, immersion, and wisdom of an adept.
an3.73:2.3	What is the ethics of a trainee?
an3.73:2.4	It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, with good behavior and supporters. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
an3.73:2.5	This is called the ethics of a trainee.
an3.73:3.1	And what is the immersion of a trainee?
an3.73:3.2	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.
an3.73:3.3	This is called the immersion of a trainee.
an3.73:4.1	And what is the wisdom of a trainee?
an3.73:4.2	They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
an3.73:4.3	This is called the wisdom of a trainee.
an3.73:5.1	Then a noble disciple—accomplished in ethics, immersion, and wisdom—realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
an3.73:5.2	In this way the Buddha has spoken of the ethics, immersion, and wisdom of both a trainee and an adept.”
an3.74:0.1	Numbered Discourses 3
an3.74:0.2	8. Ānanda
an3.74:0.3	74. Jains
an3.74:1.1	At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
an3.74:1.2	Then the Licchavis Abhaya and Paṇḍitakumāra went up to Venerable Ānanda, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an3.74:1.3	“Sir, the Jain leader Nāṭaputta claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus:
an3.74:1.4	‘Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.’
an3.74:1.5	He advocates the elimination of past karma by mortification, and breaking the bridge by not making new karma.
an3.74:1.6	So with the ending of karma, suffering ends; with the ending of suffering, feeling ends; and with the ending of feeling, all suffering will have been worn away.
an3.74:1.7	This is how to go beyond suffering by means of this purification by wearing away in this very life.
an3.74:1.8	What, sir, does the Buddha say about this?”
an3.74:2.1	“Abhaya, these three kinds of purification by wearing away have been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.
an3.74:2.2	What three?
an3.74:2.3	It’s when, Abhaya, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the code of conduct, with good behavior and supporters. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
an3.74:2.4	They don’t perform any new deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little.
an3.74:2.5	This wearing away is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.
an3.74:3.1	Then a mendicant accomplished in ethics, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.
an3.74:3.2	They don’t perform any new deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little.
an3.74:3.3	This wearing away is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.
an3.74:4.1	Then a mendicant accomplished in immersion realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
an3.74:4.2	They don’t perform any new deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little.
an3.74:4.3	This wearing away is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.
an3.74:4.4	These are the three kinds of purification by wearing away that have been rightly explained by the Buddha … in order to realize extinguishment.”
an3.74:5.1	When he said this, Paṇḍitakumāra said to Abhaya,
an3.74:5.2	“Dear Abhaya, is there anything in what Ānanda has said so well that you would disagree with?”
an3.74:5.3	“How could I not agree with what was said so well by Ānanda?
an3.74:5.4	If anyone didn’t agree with him, their head would explode!”

an3.75:0.2	8. Ānanda
an3.75:0.3	75. Support
an3.75:1.1	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
an3.75:2.1	“Ānanda, those who you have sympathy for, and those worth listening to—friends and colleagues, relatives and family—should be encouraged, supported, and established in three things.
an3.75:2.2	What three?
an3.75:2.3	Experiential confidence in the Buddha:
an3.75:2.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
an3.75:2.5	Experiential confidence in the teaching:
an3.75:2.6	‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’
an3.75:2.7	Experiential confidence in the Saṅgha:
an3.75:2.8	‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’
an3.75:3.1	There might be change in the four primary elements—
an3.75:3.2	earth, water, air, and fire—but a noble disciple with experiential confidence in the Buddha would never change.
an3.75:3.3	In this context, ‘change’ means that such a noble disciple will be reborn in hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm: this is not possible.
an3.75:4.1	There might be change in the four primary elements—
an3.75:4.2	earth, water, air, and fire—but a noble disciple with experiential confidence in the teaching …

an3.78:1.3	“This is no simple matter, sir.”
an3.78:1.4	“Well then, Ānanda, break it down.”

an3.79:4.2	They don’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. They’re ethical, of good character.

an3.80:1.3	‘Ānanda, the Buddha Sikhi had a disciple called Abhibhū. Standing in the Brahmā realm, he could make his voice heard throughout the galaxy.’
an3.80:1.4	I wonder how far a Blessed One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha can make their voice heard?”

an3.80:3.6	“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!
an3.80:3.7	Let the Buddha speak. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
an3.80:3.8	“Well then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an3.80:3.9	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.
an3.80:3.10	The Buddha said this:
an3.80:4.1	“Ānanda, a galaxy extends a thousand times as far as the moon and sun revolve and the shining ones light up the quarters.
an3.80:4.2	In that galaxy there are a thousand moons, a thousand suns, a thousand Sinerus king of mountains, a thousand Indias, a thousand Western Continents, a thousand Northern Continents, a thousand Eastern Continents, four thousand oceans, four thousand Great Kings, a thousand realms of the Gods of the Four Great Kings, a thousand realms of the Gods of the Thirty-Three, of the Gods of Yama, of the Joyful Gods, of the Gods who Love to Create, of the Gods who Control the Creations of Others, and a thousand Brahmā realms.
an3.80:4.3	This is called a thousandfold lesser world system, a ‘galaxy’.
an3.80:5.1	A world system that extends for a thousand galaxies
an3.80:5.2	is called a millionfold middling world system, a ‘galactic cluster’.
an3.80:6.1	A world system that extends for a thousand galactic clusters
an3.80:6.2	is called a billionfold great world system, a ‘galactic supercluster’.
an3.80:7.1	If he wished, Ānanda, a Realized One could make his voice heard throughout a galactic supercluster, or as far as he wants.”
an3.80:8.1	“But how would the Buddha make his voice heard so far?”
an3.80:8.2	“First, Ānanda, a Realized One would fill the galactic supercluster with light.
an3.80:8.3	When sentient beings saw the light, the Realized One would project his call so that they’d hear the sound.
an3.80:8.4	That’s how a Realized One could make his voice heard throughout a galactic supercluster, or as far as he wants.”
an3.80:9.1	When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to Venerable Udāyī,
an3.80:9.2	“I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate,
an3.80:9.3	to have a teacher with such power and might!”
an3.80:9.4	When he said this, Venerable Udāyī said to Venerable Ānanda,
an3.80:9.5	“What is it to you, Reverend Ānanda, if your teacher has such power and might?”
an3.80:9.6	When he said this, the Buddha said to Venerable Udāyī,
an3.80:9.7	“Not so, Udāyī, not so!
an3.80:9.8	If Ānanda were to die while still not free of greed, he would rule as king of the gods for seven lifetimes, and as king of all India for seven lifetimes, because of the confidence of his heart.

an3.88:2.12	If they don’t penetrate so far, with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, they’re a once-returner. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.
an3.88:2.13	If they don’t penetrate so far, with the ending of three fetters, they’re a one-seeder. They will be reborn just one time in a human existence, then make an end of suffering.
an3.88:2.14	If they don’t penetrate so far, with the ending of three fetters, they go from family to family. They will transmigrate between two or three families and then make an end of suffering.
an3.88:2.15	If they don’t penetrate so far, with the ending of three fetters, they have at most seven rebirths. They will transmigrate at most seven times among gods and humans and then make an end of suffering.
an3.88:3.1	So, mendicants, if you practice fully you succeed fully. If you practice partially you succeed partially.
an3.88:3.2	These training rules are not a waste, I say.”

an3.91:0.3	91. At Paṅkadhā
an3.91:1.1	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. He arrived at a town of the Kosalans named Paṅkadhā,
an3.91:1.2	and stayed there.
an3.91:1.3	Now, at that time a monk called Kassapagotta was resident at Paṅkadhā.
an3.91:1.4	There the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about the training rules.
an3.91:1.5	Kassapagotta became quite impatient and bitter, thinking,
an3.91:1.6	“This ascetic is much too strict.”
an3.91:1.7	When the Buddha had stayed in Paṅkadhā as long as he wished, he set out for Rājagaha.
an3.91:1.8	Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Rājagaha,
an3.91:1.9	and stayed there.
an3.91:2.1	Soon after the Buddha left, Kassapagotta became quite remorseful and regretful, thinking,
an3.91:2.2	“It’s my loss, my misfortune,
an3.91:2.3	that when the Buddha was talking about the training rules I became quite impatient and bitter, thinking
an3.91:2.4	he was much too strict.
an3.91:2.5	Why don’t I go to the Buddha and confess my mistake to him?”
an3.91:2.6	Then Kassapagotta set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Rājagaha.
an3.91:2.7	Eventually he came to Rājagaha and the Vulture’s Peak. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, saying:

an3.91:3.12	‘This ascetic is much too strict.’
an3.91:3.13	Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.”
an3.91:4.1	“Indeed, Kassapa, you made a mistake.
an3.91:4.2	NA
an3.91:4.3	But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it.
an3.91:4.4	For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.
an3.91:5.1	Kassapa, take the case of a senior mendicant who doesn’t want to train and doesn’t praise taking up the training. They don’t encourage other mendicants who don’t want to train to take up the training. And they don’t truthfully and substantively praise at the right time those mendicants who do want to train. I don’t praise that kind of senior mendicant.
an3.91:5.2	Why is that?
an3.91:5.3	Because, hearing that I praised that mendicant, other mendicants might want to keep company with them. Then they might follow their example, which would be for their lasting harm and suffering.

an3.92:1.1	“Mendicants, a farmer has three urgent duties.
an3.92:1.2	What three?
an3.92:1.3	A farmer swiftly makes sure the field is well ploughed and tilled.
an3.92:1.4	Next they swiftly plant seeds in season.
an3.92:1.5	When the time is right, they swiftly irrigate or drain the field.
an3.92:1.6	These are the three urgent duties of a farmer.
an3.92:1.7	That farmer has no special power or ability to say:
an3.92:1.8	‘Let the crops germinate today! Let them flower tomorrow! Let them ripen the day after!’
an3.92:1.9	But there comes a time when that farmer’s crops germinate, flower, and ripen as the seasons change.
an3.92:2.1	In the same way, a mendicant has three urgent duties.
an3.92:2.2	What three?
an3.92:2.3	Undertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom.
an3.92:2.4	These are the three urgent duties of a mendicant.
an3.92:2.5	That mendicant has no special power or ability to say:
an3.92:2.6	‘Let my mind be freed from defilements by not grasping today! Or tomorrow! Or the day after!’
an3.92:2.7	But there comes a time—as that mendicant trains in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom—that their mind is freed from defilements by not grasping.
an3.92:3.1	So you should train like this:
an3.92:3.2	‘We will have keen enthusiasm for undertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom.’
an3.92:3.3	That’s how you should train.”

an3.93:1.2	What three?
an3.93:1.3	Seclusion in robes, almsfood, and lodgings.
an3.93:2.1	Wanderers who follow other paths advocate this kind of seclusion in robes. They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings.
an3.93:2.2	This is what wanderers who follow other paths advocate for seclusion in robes.
an3.93:3.1	Wanderers who follow other paths advocate this kind of seclusion in almsfood.
an3.93:3.2	They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.
an3.93:3.3	This is what the wanderers who follow other paths advocate for seclusion in almsfood.
an3.93:4.1	Wanderers who follow other paths advocate this kind of seclusion in lodgings. They stay in a wilderness, at the root of a tree, in a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw, or a threshing-hut.
an3.93:4.2	This is what wanderers who follow other paths advocate for seclusion in lodgings.
an3.93:4.3	These are the three kinds of seclusion that wanderers who follow other paths advocate.
an3.93:5.1	In this teaching and training, there are three kinds of seclusion for a mendicant.
an3.93:5.2	What three?
an3.93:5.3	Firstly, a mendicant is ethical, giving up unethical conduct, being secluded from it.
an3.93:5.4	They have right view, giving up wrong view, being secluded from it.
an3.93:5.5	They’ve ended defilements, giving up defilements, being secluded from them.
an3.93:5.6	When a mendicant has these three kinds of seclusion,
an3.93:5.7	NA
an3.93:5.8	NA
an3.93:5.9	they’re called a mendicant who has reached the peak and the pith, being pure and grounded in the essential.
an3.93:6.1	When a farmer’s rice field is ripe,
an3.93:6.2	they’d have the rice cut swiftly,
an3.93:6.3	gathered swiftly,
an3.93:6.4	transported swiftly,
an3.93:6.5	made into heaps swiftly,
an3.93:6.6	threshed swiftly,
an3.93:6.7	the straw and chaff removed swiftly,
an3.93:6.8	NA
an3.93:6.9	winnowed swiftly,
an3.93:6.10	brought over swiftly,
an3.93:6.11	pounded swiftly,
an3.93:6.12	and have the husks removed swiftly.
an3.93:6.13	In this way that farmer’s crop would reach the peak and the pith, being pure and consisting only of what is essential.
an3.93:7.1	In the same way, when a mendicant is ethical, giving up unethical conduct, being secluded from it;
an3.93:7.2	when they have right view, giving up wrong view, being secluded from it;
an3.93:7.3	when they’ve ended defilements, giving up defilements, being secluded from them:
an3.93:7.4	they’re called a mendicant who has reached the peak and the pith, being pure and grounded in the essential.”

an3.94:2.2	identity view, doubt, and misapprehension of precepts and observances.
an3.94:3.1	Afterwards they get rid of two things: desire and aversion.
an3.94:3.2	Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.

an3.95:1.2	What three?
an3.95:1.3	An assembly of the best, a divided assembly, and a harmonious assembly.
an3.95:2.1	And what is an assembly of the best?
an3.95:2.2	An assembly where the senior mendicants are not indulgent or slack, nor are they backsliders. Instead, they take the lead in seclusion, rousing energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. And those who come afterwards follow their example.
an3.95:2.3	They too are not indulgent or slack, nor are they backsliders. Instead, they take the lead in seclusion, rousing energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.
an3.95:2.4	This is called an assembly of the best.
an3.95:3.1	And what is a divided assembly?
an3.95:3.2	An assembly where the mendicants argue, quarrel, and dispute, continually wounding each other with barbed words. This is called a divided assembly.
an3.95:4.1	And what is a harmonious assembly?
an3.95:4.2	An assembly where the mendicants live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes. This is called a harmonious assembly.
an3.95:5.1	When the mendicants live in harmony like this, they make much merit.
an3.95:5.2	At that time the mendicants live in a holy dwelling, that is, the heart’s release by rejoicing.
an3.95:5.3	When they’re joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when they’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.
an3.95:6.1	It’s like when it rains heavily on a mountain top, and the water flows downhill to fill the hollows, crevices, and creeks. As they become full, they fill up the pools. The pools fill up the lakes, the lakes fill up the streams, and the streams fill up the rivers. And as the rivers become full, they fill up the ocean.
an3.95:7.1	In the same way, when the mendicants are in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes, they make much merit.
an3.95:7.2	At that time the mendicants live in a holy dwelling, that is, the heart’s release by rejoicing.

an3.116:3.3	The lifespan of the gods of nothingness is sixty thousand eons.

an3.123:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kusināra, in the Forest of Offerings.
an3.123:1.2	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
an3.123:1.3	“Mendicants!”
an3.123:1.4	“Venerable sir,” they replied.
an3.123:1.5	The Buddha said this:
an3.123:2.1	“Mendicants, take the case of a mendicant living supported by a town or village.
an3.123:2.2	A householder or their child approaches and invites them for the next day’s meal.
an3.123:2.3	The mendicant accepts if they want.
an3.123:2.4	When the night has passed, they robe up in the morning, take their bowl and robe, and approach that householder’s home, where they sit on the seat spread out.
an3.123:2.5	The householder or their child serves and satisfies them with their own hands with a variety of delicious foods.
an3.123:3.1	The mendicant thinks:
an3.123:3.2	‘It’s so good that this householder serves me with a variety of delicious foods.’
an3.123:3.3	Then they think:
an3.123:3.4	‘I really hope this householder serves me with a variety of delicious foods in the future, too.’
an3.123:3.5	They eat that food tied, infatuated, attached, blind to the drawbacks, and not understanding the escape.
an3.123:3.6	They think about it with sensual, malicious, or cruel thoughts.
an3.123:3.7	A gift to such a mendicant is not very fruitful, I say.
an3.123:3.8	Why is that?
an3.123:3.9	Because that mendicant is negligent.
an3.123:4.1	Take another case of a mendicant living supported by a town or village.
an3.123:4.2	A householder or their child approaches and invites them for the next day’s meal.

an3.123:4.5	The householder or their child serves and satisfies them with their own hands with a variety of delicious foods.
an3.123:5.1	It never occurs to them:
an3.123:5.2	‘It’s so good that the householder or their child serves and satisfies me with their own hands with a variety of delicious foods.’
an3.123:5.3	They don’t think:
an3.123:5.4	‘I really hope this householder serves me with a variety of delicious foods in the future, too.’
an3.123:5.5	They eat that almsfood untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawback, and understanding the escape.
an3.123:5.6	They think about it with thoughts of renunciation, good will, or harmlessness.
an3.123:5.7	A gift to such a mendicant is very fruitful, I say.

an3.125:2.3	I teach with a demonstrable basis, not without it.

an3.126:1.1	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans when he arrived at Kapilavatthu.
an3.126:1.2	Mahānāma the Sakyan heard that he had arrived.
an3.126:1.3	He went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. The Buddha said to him,
an3.126:2.1	“Go into Kapilavatthu, Mahānāma, and check if there’s a suitable guest house where I can spend the night.”
an3.126:2.2	“Yes, sir,” replied Mahānāma. He returned to Kapilavatthu and searched all over the city, but he couldn’t see a suitable guest house for the Buddha to spend the night.
an3.126:3.1	Then Mahānāma went up to the Buddha, and said to him,
an3.126:3.2	“Sir, there’s no suitable guest house in Kapilavatthu for you to spend the night.
an3.126:3.3	But there is this Bharaṇḍu the Kālāma, who used to be the Buddha’s spiritual companion.
an3.126:3.4	Why don’t you spend the night at his hermitage?”
an3.126:3.5	“Go, Mahānāma, and set out a mat.”
an3.126:3.6	“Yes, sir,” replied Mahānāma. He went to Bharaṇḍu’s hermitage, where he set out a mat, and got foot-washing water ready. Then he went back to the Buddha and said to him,
an3.126:3.7	“The mat and foot-washing water are set out.
an3.126:3.8	Please, sir, go at your convenience.”
an3.126:4.1	Then the Buddha went to Bharaṇḍu’s hermitage, sat down on the seat spread out,
an3.126:4.2	and washed his feet.
an3.126:4.3	Then it occurred to Mahānāma,
an3.126:4.4	“It’s too late to pay homage to the Buddha today.
an3.126:4.5	He’s tired.
an3.126:4.6	Tomorrow I’ll pay homage to the Buddha.” He bowed to the Buddha and respectfully circled him, keeping him on his right, then he left.
an3.126:5.1	Then, when the night had passed, Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
an3.126:5.2	“Mahānāma, there are these three teachers found in the world.
an3.126:5.3	What three?
an3.126:5.4	One teacher advocates the complete understanding of sensual pleasures,
an3.126:5.5	but not of sights or feelings.
an3.126:5.6	One teacher advocates the complete understanding of sensual pleasures and sights,
an3.126:5.7	but not of feelings.
an3.126:5.8	One teacher advocates the complete understanding of sensual pleasures, sights, and feelings.
an3.126:5.9	These are the three teachers found in the world.
an3.126:5.10	Do these three teachers have the same goal or different goals?”
an3.126:6.1	When he said this, Bharaṇḍu said to Mahānāma,
an3.126:6.2	“Say they’re the same, Mahānāma!”
an3.126:6.3	The Buddha said,
an3.126:6.4	“Say they’re different, Mahānāma!”
an3.126:6.5	For a second time, Bharaṇḍu said,
an3.126:6.6	“Say they’re the same, Mahānāma!”
an3.126:6.7	The Buddha said,
an3.126:6.8	“Say they’re different, Mahānāma!”
an3.126:6.9	For a third time, Bharaṇḍu said,
an3.126:6.10	“Say they’re the same, Mahānāma!”
an3.126:6.11	The Buddha said,
an3.126:6.12	“Say they’re different, Mahānāma!”
an3.126:7.1	Then it occurred to Bharaṇḍu,
an3.126:7.2	“The Buddha has rebuked me three times in front of this illustrious Mahānāma.
an3.126:7.3	Why don’t I leave Kapilavatthu?”
an3.126:7.4	Then Bharaṇḍu the Kālāma left Kapilavatthu,

an3.127:1.2	Then, late at night, the glorious god Hatthaka, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha. Thinking,

an3.127:2.4	The Buddha said to him,
an3.127:3.1	“Hatthaka, I wonder whether you still rehearse now the teachings that you rehearsed when you were a human being?”
an3.127:3.2	“I still rehearse now the teachings that I rehearsed as a human being.
an3.127:3.3	And I also rehearse teachings that I didn’t rehearse as a human being.
an3.127:3.4	Just as the Buddha these days lives crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their ministers, and teachers of other paths and their disciples,
an3.127:3.5	so I live crowded by the gods.
an3.127:3.6	The gods come from far away, thinking, ‘We’ll hear the teaching in the presence of Hatthaka.’
an3.127:3.7	Sir, I passed away without getting enough of three things.

an3.127:3.9	Seeing the Buddha;
an3.127:3.10	hearing the true teaching;

an3.128:2.3	Hearing this advice of the Buddha, that monk was struck with a sense of urgency.

an3.128:4.6	What is ‘carrion’?
an3.128:4.7	And what are the ‘flies’?”
an3.128:5.1	“Desire is bitterness;

an3.130:1.3	“Here’s the thing, Reverend Sāriputta. With clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human, I survey the entire galaxy.
an3.130:1.4	My energy is roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness is established and lucid, my body is tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind is immersed in samādhi.
an3.130:1.5	But my mind is not freed from the defilements by not grasping.”
an3.130:2.1	“Well, Reverend Anuruddha, when you say:
an3.130:2.2	‘With clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human, I survey the entire galaxy,’ that’s your conceit.
an3.130:2.3	And when you say:
an3.130:2.4	‘My energy is roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness is established and lucid, my body is tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind is immersed in samādhi,’ that’s your restlessness.
an3.130:2.5	And when you say:
an3.130:2.6	‘But my mind is not freed from the defilements by not grasping,’ that’s your remorse.
an3.130:2.7	It would be good to give up these three things. Instead of focusing on them, apply your mind to the deathless.”
an3.130:3.1	After some time Anuruddha gave up these three things. Instead of focusing on them, he applied his mind to the deathless.
an3.130:3.2	Then Anuruddha, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
an3.130:3.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”

an3.133:1.1	“Mendicants, a warrior with three factors is worthy of a king, fit to serve a king, and is reckoned as a factor of kingship.
an3.133:1.2	What three?
an3.133:1.3	He’s a long-distance shooter, a marksman, one who shatters large objects.
an3.133:1.4	A warrior with these three factors is worthy of a king, fit to serve a king, and is reckoned as a factor of kingship.
an3.133:1.5	In the same way, a mendicant with three factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.
an3.133:1.6	What three?
an3.133:1.7	They’re a long-distance shooter, a marksman, and one who shatters large objects.
an3.133:2.1	And how is a mendicant a long-distance shooter?
an3.133:2.2	It’s when a mendicant truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
an3.133:2.3	They truly see any kind of feeling at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* feeling—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
an3.133:2.4	They truly see any kind of perception at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* perception—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
an3.133:2.5	They truly see any kind of choices at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* choices—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
an3.133:2.6	They truly see any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near, *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
an3.133:2.7	That’s how a mendicant is a long-distance shooter.
an3.133:3.1	And how is a mendicant a marksman?
an3.133:3.2	It’s when a mendicant truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
an3.133:3.3	That’s how a mendicant is a marksman.
an3.133:4.1	And how does a mendicant shatter large objects?
an3.133:4.2	It’s when a mendicant shatters the great mass of ignorance.
an3.133:4.3	That’s how a mendicant shatters large objects.
an3.133:4.4	A mendicant with these three qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”

an3.137:1.2	It’s cold in the cold, hot in the heat, ugly, smelly, and unpleasant to touch.
an3.137:1.3	In the same way, the teaching of Makkhali is said to be the worst of all the doctrines of the various ascetics and brahmins.
an3.137:2.1	Makkhali, that silly man, has this doctrine and view:
an3.137:2.2	‘There is no power in deeds, action, or energy.’
an3.137:2.3	Now, all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past taught the efficacy of deeds, action, and energy.
an3.137:2.4	But Makkhali opposes them by saying:
an3.137:2.5	‘There is no power in deeds, action, or energy.’
an3.137:2.6	All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future will teach the efficacy of deeds, action, and energy.
an3.137:2.7	But Makkhali opposes them by saying:
an3.137:2.8	‘There is no power in deeds, action, or energy.’
an3.137:2.9	I too, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha in the present, teach the efficacy of deeds, action, and energy.
an3.137:2.10	But Makkhali opposes me by saying:
an3.137:2.11	‘There is no power in deeds, action, or energy.’
an3.137:3.1	It’s like a trap set at the mouth of a river, which would bring harm, suffering, calamity, and disaster for many fish.
an3.137:3.2	In the same way that silly man Makkhali is a trap for humans, it seems to me. He has come into the world for the harm, suffering, calamity, and disaster of many beings.”

an3.156:1.1	“Mendicants, there are three practices.
an3.156:1.2	What three?
an3.156:1.3	The addicted practice, the scorching practice, and the middle practice.
an3.156:1.4	And what’s the addicted practice?
an3.156:1.5	It’s when someone has this doctrine and view:
an3.156:1.6	‘There’s nothing wrong with sensual pleasures’;
an3.156:1.7	so they throw themselves into sensual pleasures.
an3.156:1.8	This is called the addicted practice.
an3.156:2.1	And what’s the scorching practice?
an3.156:2.2	It’s when someone goes naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on purpose for them, or an invitation for a meal.
an3.156:2.3	They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who has a man in her home; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or liquor or wine, and drink no beer.
an3.156:2.4	They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls.
an3.156:2.5	They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day.
an3.156:2.6	They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live pursuing the practice of eating food at set intervals.
an3.156:3.1	They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.
an3.156:4.1	They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings.
an3.156:4.2	They tear out their hair and beard, committed to this practice.
an3.156:4.3	They constantly stand, refusing seats.
an3.156:4.4	They squat, committed to persisting in the squatting position.
an3.156:4.5	They lie on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns their bed.
an3.156:4.6	They pursue the practice of immersion in water three times a day, including the evening.
an3.156:4.7	And so they live pursuing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body.
an3.156:4.8	This is called the scorching practice.
an3.156:5.1	And what’s the middle practice?
an3.156:5.2	It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
an3.156:5.3	They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …
an3.156:5.4	They meditate observing an aspect of the mind …

an4.1:1.1	So I have heard.
an4.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Vajjis at the village of Bhaṇḍa.
an4.1:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
an4.1:1.4	“Mendicants!”
an4.1:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.
an4.1:1.6	The Buddha said this:
an4.1:2.1	“Mendicants, not understanding and not penetrating four things, both you and I have wandered and transmigrated for such a very long time.
an4.1:2.2	What four?
an4.1:2.3	Noble ethics,
an4.1:2.4	immersion,
an4.1:2.5	wisdom,
an4.1:2.6	and freedom.
an4.1:2.7	These noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom have been understood and comprehended. Craving for continued existence has been cut off; the attachment to continued existence is ended; now there’ll be no more future lives.”
an4.1:3.1	That is what the Buddha said.
an4.1:3.2	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:
an4.1:4.1	“Ethics, immersion, and wisdom,
an4.1:4.2	and the supreme freedom:
an4.1:4.3	these things have been understood
an4.1:4.4	by Gotama the renowned.
an4.1:5.1	And so the Buddha, having insight,
an4.1:5.2	explained this teaching to the mendicants.
an4.1:5.3	The teacher made an end of suffering,
an4.1:5.4	seeing clearly, he is extinguished.”

an4.5:1.1	“These four people are found in the world.
an4.5:1.2	What four?
an4.5:1.3	A person who goes with the stream; a person who goes against the stream; a steadfast person; and a brahmin who has crossed over and stands on the far shore.
an4.5:1.4	And who is the person who goes with the stream?
an4.5:1.5	It’s a person who takes part in sensual pleasures and does bad deeds.
an4.5:1.6	This is called a person who goes with the stream.
an4.5:2.1	And who is the person who goes against the stream?
an4.5:2.2	It’s a person who doesn’t take part in sensual pleasures or do bad deeds. They live the full and pure spiritual life in pain and sadness, weeping, with tearful faces.
an4.5:2.3	This is called a person who goes against the stream.
an4.5:3.1	And who is the steadfast person?
an4.5:3.2	It’s a person who, with the ending of the five lower fetters, is reborn spontaneously. They’re extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.
an4.5:3.3	This is called a steadfast person.
an4.5:4.1	And who is a brahmin who has crossed over and stands on the far shore?
an4.5:4.2	It’s a person who realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
an4.5:4.3	This is called a brahmin who has crossed over and stands on the far shore.
an4.5:4.4	These are the four people found in the world.
an4.5:5.1	All those people with unbridled sensuality,
an4.5:5.2	not free of lust, enjoying sensual pleasures in this life:
an4.5:5.3	again and again, they return to birth and old age;
an4.5:5.4	those who go with the stream are sunk in craving.
an4.5:6.1	So a wise one in this life, with mindfulness established,
an4.5:6.2	doesn’t take part in sensual pleasures and bad deeds.
an4.5:6.3	In pain they’d give up sensual pleasures:

an4.6:1.2	What four? A person may have:
an4.6:1.3	Little learning and not get the point of learning.
an4.6:1.4	Little learning but get the point of learning.
an4.6:1.5	Much learning but not get the point of learning.
an4.6:1.6	Much learning and get the point of learning.
an4.6:1.7	And how has a person learned little and not got the point of learning?
an4.6:1.8	It’s when a person has learned little of the
an4.6:1.9	statements, songs, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications.
an4.6:1.10	And with the little they’ve learned, they understand neither the meaning nor the text, nor do they practice in line with the teaching.

an4.6:2.1	And how has a person learned little but has got the point of learning?
an4.6:2.2	It’s when a person has learned little of the
an4.6:2.3	statements, songs, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications.
an4.6:2.4	But with the little they’ve learned, they understand the meaning and the text, and they practice in line with the teaching.
an4.6:2.5	That’s how a person has learned little but has got the point of learning.
an4.6:3.1	And how has a person learned much but hasn't got the point of learning?
an4.6:3.2	It’s when a person has learned much of the
an4.6:3.3	statements, songs, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications.

an4.6:4.3	statements, songs, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications.
an4.6:4.4	And with the large amount they’ve learned, they understand the meaning and the text, and they practice in line with the teaching.
an4.6:4.5	That’s how a person has learned much and has got the point of learning.

an4.6:5.1	If you don’t learn much,
an4.6:5.2	and aren’t steady in ethics,
an4.6:5.3	they’ll criticize you on both counts,
an4.6:5.4	for your ethics and your learning.
an4.6:6.1	If you don’t learn much,
an4.6:6.2	and you are steady in ethics,
an4.6:6.3	they’ll praise your ethical conduct,
an4.6:6.4	since your learning has succeeded.

an4.6:7.2	but aren’t steady in ethics,
an4.6:7.3	they’ll criticize your ethical conduct,
an4.6:7.4	for your learning hasn’t succeeded.
an4.6:8.1	If you learn much,

an4.8:4.1	I see no reason for anyone—whether ascetic, brahmin, god, Māra, or Brahmā, or anyone else in the world—to legitimately scold me, saying: ‘Though you teach that this teaching leads to the goal of the complete ending of suffering, it doesn’t lead there for one who practices it.’
an4.8:4.2	Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.
an4.8:4.3	A Realized One has these four kinds of self-assurance. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.
an4.8:5.1	The various grounds for criticism

an4.14:1.4	And what, mendicants, is the effort to restrain?
an4.14:1.5	When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
an4.14:1.6	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.

an4.14:1.13	This is called the effort to restrain.
an4.14:2.1	And what, mendicants, is the effort to give up?
an4.14:2.2	It’s when a mendicant doesn’t tolerate a sensual,

an4.14:2.6	This is called the effort to give up.
an4.14:3.1	And what, mendicants, is the effort to develop?

an4.14:3.9	This is called the effort to develop.
an4.14:4.1	And what, mendicants, is the effort to preserve?
an4.14:4.2	It’s when a mendicant preserves a meditation subject that’s a fine foundation of immersion: the perception of a skeleton, a worm-infested corpse, a livid corpse, a split open corpse, or a bloated corpse.
an4.14:4.3	This is called the effort to preserve.

an4.21:0.3	21. At Uruvelā (1st)
an4.21:1.1	So I have heard.
an4.21:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an4.21:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
an4.21:1.4	“Mendicants!”
an4.21:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.
an4.21:1.6	The Buddha said this:
an4.21:2.1	“Mendicants, this one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.
an4.21:2.2	As I was in private retreat this thought came to mind:
an4.21:2.3	‘One without respect and reverence lives in suffering.
an4.21:2.4	What ascetic or brahmin should I honor and respect and rely on?’
an4.21:3.1	Then it occurred to me:
an4.21:3.2	‘I would honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of ethics, if it were incomplete.
an4.21:3.3	But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in ethics, who I should honor and respect and rely on.
an4.21:4.1	I would honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of immersion, if it were incomplete.
an4.21:4.2	But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in immersion …
an4.21:5.1	I would honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entrie spectrum of wisdom, if it were incomplete.
an4.21:5.2	But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world … who is more accomplished than myself in wisdom …
an4.21:6.1	I would honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of freedom, if it were incomplete.
an4.21:6.2	But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world … who is more accomplished than myself in freedom …’
an4.21:7.1	Then it occurred to me:
an4.21:7.2	‘Why don’t I honor and respect and rely on the same teaching to which I was awakened?’
an4.21:8.1	And then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what I was thinking, vanished from the Brahmā realm and appeared in front of me, as easily as a strong man would extend or contract his arm.
an4.21:8.2	He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward me, and said:
an4.21:8.3	‘That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!
an4.21:8.4	All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past honored and respected and relied on this same teaching.
an4.21:8.5	All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future will honor and respect and rely on this same teaching.
an4.21:8.6	May the Blessed One, who is the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present, also honor and respect and rely on this same teaching.’
an4.21:8.7	That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said,
an4.21:8.8	Then he went on to say:
an4.21:9.1	‘All Buddhas, whether in the past,
an4.21:9.2	the Buddhas of the future,
an4.21:9.3	and the Buddha at present—
an4.21:9.4	destroyer of the sorrows of many—
an4.21:10.1	respecting the true teaching
an4.21:10.2	they did live, they do live,
an4.21:10.3	and they also will live.
an4.21:10.4	This is the nature of the Buddhas.
an4.21:11.1	Therefore someone who cares for their own welfare,
an4.21:11.2	and wants to become the very best they can be,
an4.21:11.3	should respect the true teaching,
an4.21:11.4	remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.’
an4.21:12.1	That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said.
an4.21:12.2	Then he bowed and respectfully circled me, keeping me on his right side, before vanishing right there.
an4.21:12.3	Then, knowing the request of Brahmā and what was suitable for myself, I honored and respected and relied on the same teaching to which I was awakened.
an4.21:12.4	And since the Saṅgha has also achieved greatness, I also respect the Saṅgha.”

an4.22:0.2	3. At Uruvelā
an4.22:0.3	22. At Uruvelā (2nd)
an4.22:1.1	“Mendicants, this one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.
an4.22:1.2	Then several old brahmins—elderly and senior, who were advanced in years and had reached the final stage of life—came up to me, and exchanged greetings with me.
an4.22:1.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side, and said to me:
an4.22:1.4	‘Master Gotama, we have heard this:
an4.22:1.5	“The ascetic Gotama does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat.”
an4.22:1.6	And this is indeed the case,
an4.22:1.7	for Master Gotama does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat.
an4.22:1.8	This is not appropriate, Master Gotama.’
an4.22:2.1	Then it occurred to me,
an4.22:2.2	‘These venerables don’t know what a senior is, or what qualities make you a senior.’
an4.22:2.3	Mendicants, suppose you’re eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old.
an4.22:2.4	But your speech is untimely, false, meaningless, and against the teaching or training. You say things at the wrong time which are worthless, unreasonable, rambling, and unbeneficial.
an4.22:2.5	Then you’ll be considered a ‘childish senior’.
an4.22:3.1	Now suppose you’re a youth, young, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life.
an4.22:3.2	But your speech is timely, true, meaningful, and in line with the teaching and training. You say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.
an4.22:3.3	Then you’ll be considered an ‘astute senior’.
an4.22:4.1	There are these four qualities that make a senior.
an4.22:4.2	What four?
an4.22:4.3	A mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
an4.22:4.4	They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.
an4.22:4.5	They get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.
an4.22:4.6	They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
an4.22:4.7	These are the four qualities that make a senior.
an4.22:5.1	The creature with a restless mind
an4.22:5.2	speaks a lot of nonsense.
an4.22:5.3	Their thoughts are unsettled,
an4.22:5.4	and they don’t like the true teaching.
an4.22:5.5	They’re far from seniority, with their bad views
an4.22:5.6	and their lack of regard for others.
an4.22:6.1	But one accomplished in ethics,
an4.22:6.2	learned and eloquent, that wise one
an4.22:6.3	is restrained when experiencing phenomena,
an4.22:6.4	discerning the meaning with wisdom.
an4.22:7.1	Gone beyond all things,
an4.22:7.2	kind, eloquent,
an4.22:7.3	they’ve given up birth and death,
an4.22:7.4	and have completed the spiritual journey.
an4.22:8.1	That’s who I call a senior,
an4.22:8.2	who has no defilements.
an4.22:8.3	With the ending of defilements, a mendicant
an4.22:8.4	is declared a ‘senior’.”

an4.23:0.3	23. The World
an4.23:1.1	“Mendicants, the world has been understood by the Realized One;
an4.23:1.2	and he is detached from the world.
an4.23:1.3	The origin of the world has been understood by the Realized One;
an4.23:1.4	and he has given up the origin of the world.
an4.23:1.5	The cessation of the world has been understood by the Realized One;
an4.23:1.6	and he has realized the cessation of the world.
an4.23:1.7	The practice that leads to the cessation of the world has been understood by the Realized One;
an4.23:1.8	and he has developed the practice that leads to the cessation of the world.
an4.23:2.1	In this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, sought, and explored by the mind, all that has been understood by the Realized One.
an4.23:2.2	That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.
an4.23:3.1	From the night when the Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening until the night he becomes fully extinguished—through the natural principle of extinguishment, without anything left over—everything he speaks, says, and expresses is real, not otherwise.
an4.23:3.2	That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.
an4.23:4.1	The Realized One does as he says, and says as he does.
an4.23:4.2	Since this is so,
an4.23:4.3	that’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.
an4.23:5.1	In this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—the Realized One is the undefeated, the champion, the universal seer, the wielder of power.
an4.23:5.2	That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.
an4.23:6.1	Directly knowing the whole world as it is,
an4.23:6.2	and everything in it,
an4.23:6.3	he is detached from the whole world,
an4.23:6.4	disengaged from the whole world.
an4.23:7.1	That wise one is the champion
an4.23:7.2	who is released from all ties.
an4.23:7.3	He has reached ultimate peace:
an4.23:7.4	extinguishment, fearing nothing from any quarter.
an4.23:8.1	He is the Buddha, with defilements ended,
an4.23:8.2	untroubled, with doubts cut off.
an4.23:8.3	He has attained the end of all deeds,
an4.23:8.4	freed with the end of attachments.
an4.23:9.1	That Blessed One is the Buddha,
an4.23:9.2	he is the supreme lion,
an4.23:9.3	in all the world with its gods,
an4.23:9.4	he turns the holy wheel.
an4.23:10.1	And so those gods and humans,
an4.23:10.2	who have gone to the Buddha for refuge,
an4.23:10.3	come together and revere him,
an4.23:10.4	great of heart and rid of naivety:
an4.23:11.1	‘Tamed, he is the best of tamers,
an4.23:11.2	peaceful, he is the hermit among the peaceful,
an4.23:11.3	liberated, he is the foremost of liberators,
an4.23:11.4	crossed over, he is the most excellent of guides across.’
an4.23:12.1	And so they revere him,
an4.23:12.2	great of heart and rid of naivety.
an4.23:12.3	In the world with its gods,
an4.23:12.4	he has no counterpart.”

an4.24:0.3	24. At Kāḷaka’s Monastery
an4.24:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāketa, in Kāḷaka’s monastery.
an4.24:1.2	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
an4.24:1.3	“Mendicants!”
an4.24:1.4	“Venerable sir,” they replied.
an4.24:1.5	The Buddha said this:
an4.24:2.1	“In this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, sought, and explored by the mind: that I know.
an4.24:3.1	In this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, sought, and explored by the mind: that I have insight into.
an4.24:3.2	That has been known by a Realized One, but a Realized One is not subject to it.
an4.24:4.1	If I were to say that ‘I do not know … the world with its gods’, I would be lying.
an4.24:5.1	If I were to say that ‘I both know and do not know … the world with its gods’, that would be just the same.
an4.24:6.1	If I were to say that ‘I neither know nor do not know … the world with its gods’, that would be my fault.
an4.24:7.1	So a Realized One sees what is to be seen, but does not identify with what is seen, does not identify with what is unseen, does not identify with what is to be seen, and does not identify with a seer.
an4.24:7.2	He hears what is to be heard, but does not identify with what is heard, does not identify with what is unheard, does not identify with what is to be heard, and does not identify with a hearer.
an4.24:7.3	He thinks what is to be thought, but does not identify with what is thought, does not identify with what is not thought, does not identify with what is to be thought, and does not identify with a thinker.
an4.24:7.4	He knows what is to be known, but does not identify with what is known, does not identify with what is unknown, does not identify with what is to be known, and does not identify with a knower.
an4.24:7.5	Since a Realized One is poised in the midst of things seen, heard, thought, and known, he is the poised one.
an4.24:7.6	And I say that there is no better or finer poise than this.
an4.24:8.1	Such a one does not take anything
an4.24:8.2	seen, heard, or thought to be ultimately true or false.
an4.24:8.3	But others get attached, thinking it’s the truth,
an4.24:8.4	limited by their preconceptions.
an4.24:9.1	Since they’ve seen this dart
an4.24:9.2	to which people are attached and cling,
an4.24:9.3	saying, ‘I know, I see, that’s how it is’,
an4.24:9.4	the Realized Ones have no attachments.”

an4.25:1.2	This spiritual life is lived for the sake of restraint, giving up, fading away, and cessation.
an4.25:2.1	The Buddha taught the spiritual life
an4.25:2.2	not because of tradition,
an4.25:2.3	but for the sake of restraint and giving up,
an4.25:2.4	and because it culminates in extinguishment.
an4.25:2.5	This is the path followed by the great souls,

an4.27:1.7	These four trifles are easy to find and are blameless.
an4.27:1.8	When a mendicant is content with trifles that are easy to find, they have one of the factors of the ascetic life, I say.

an4.27:2.3	you don’t get upset

an4.28:1.1	“Mendicants, these four noble traditions are primordial, long-standing, traditional, and ancient. They are uncorrupted, as they have been since the beginning. They’re not being corrupted now, nor will they be. Sensible ascetics and brahmins don’t look down on them.
an4.28:1.2	What four?
an4.28:1.3	Firstly, a mendicant is content with any kind of robe, and praises such contentment. They don’t try to get hold of a robe in an improper way. They don’t get upset if they don’t get a robe. And if they do get a robe, they use it untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawback, and understanding the escape.
an4.28:1.4	But they don’t glorify themselves or put others down on account of their contentment.
an4.28:1.5	A mendicant who is deft, tireless, aware, and mindful in this is said to stand in the ancient, primordial noble tradition.
an4.28:2.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is content with any kind of almsfood …

an4.28:3.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is content with any kind of lodgings …
an4.28:3.2	NA
an4.28:3.3	NA
an4.28:4.1	Furthermore, a mendicant enjoys meditation and loves to meditate. They enjoy giving up and love to give up.
an4.28:4.2	But they don’t glorify themselves or put down others on account of their love for meditation and giving up.
an4.28:4.3	A mendicant who is deft, tireless, aware, and mindful in this is said to stand in the ancient, primordial noble tradition.

an4.28:5.2	If they live in the west …

an4.28:5.4	the south, they prevail over discontent, and discontent doesn’t prevail over them.
an4.28:5.5	Why is that?
an4.28:5.6	Because a wise one prevails over desire and discontent.
an4.28:6.1	Discontent doesn’t prevail over a wise one;
an4.28:6.2	for the wise one is not beaten by discontent.

an4.30:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
an4.30:1.2	Now at that time several very well-known wanderers were residing in the monastery of the wanderers on the bank of the Sappinī river. They included Annabhāra, Varadhara, Sakuludāyī, and other very well-known wanderers.
an4.30:1.3	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the wanderer’s monastery on the banks of the Sappinī river, He sat down on the seat spread out, and said to the wanderers:
an4.30:2.1	“Wanderers, these four basic principles are primordial, long-standing, traditional, and ancient. They are uncorrupted, as they have been since the beginning. They’re not being corrupted now nor will they be. Sensible ascetics and brahmins don’t look down on them.
an4.30:2.2	What four?
an4.30:2.3	Contentment …
an4.30:2.4	Good will … Right mindfulness … Right immersion …
an4.30:2.5	These four basic principles are primordial, long-standing, traditional, and ancient. They are uncorrupted, as they have been since the beginning. They’re not being corrupted now nor will they be. Sensible ascetics and brahmins don’t look down on them.
an4.30:3.1	Wanderers, if someone should say:
an4.30:3.2	‘I’ll reject this basic principle of contentment, and describe a true ascetic or brahmin who covets sensual pleasures with acute lust.’ Then I’d say to them:
an4.30:3.3	‘Let them come, speak, and discuss. We’ll see how powerful they are.’
an4.30:3.4	It’s simply impossible to reject this basic principle of contentment, and point out a true ascetic or brahmin who covets sensual pleasures with acute lust.
an4.30:4.1	If someone should say:
an4.30:4.2	‘I’ll reject this basic principle of good will, and describe a true ascetic or brahmin who has ill will and malicious intent.’ Then I’d say to them:
an4.30:4.3	‘Let them come, speak, and discuss. We’ll see how powerful they are.’
an4.30:4.4	It’s simply impossible to reject this basic principle of good will, and point out a true ascetic or brahmin who has ill will and malicious intent.
an4.30:5.1	If someone should say:
an4.30:5.2	‘I’ll reject this basic principle of right mindfulness, and describe a true ascetic or brahmin who is unmindful, with no situational awareness.’ Then I’d say to them:
an4.30:5.3	‘Let them come, speak, and discuss. We’ll see how powerful they are.’
an4.30:5.4	It’s simply impossible to reject this basic principle of right mindfulness, and point out a true ascetic or brahmin who is unmindful, with no situational awareness.
an4.30:6.1	If someone should say:
an4.30:6.2	‘I’ll reject this basic principle of right immersion, and describe a true ascetic or brahmin who is scattered, with straying mind.’ Then I’d say to them:
an4.30:6.3	‘Let them come, speak, and discuss. We’ll see how powerful they are.’
an4.30:6.4	It’s simply impossible to reject this basic principle of right immersion, and point out a true ascetic or brahmin who is scattered, with straying mind.
an4.30:7.1	If anyone imagines they can criticize and reject these four basic principles, they deserve rebuke and criticism on four legitimate grounds in the present life.
an4.30:7.2	What four?
an4.30:7.3	If you reject the basic principle of contentment, then you must honor and praise those ascetics and brahmins who covet sensual pleasures with acute lust.
an4.30:7.4	If you reject the basic principle of good will, you must honor and praise those ascetics and brahmins who have ill will and malicious intent.
an4.30:7.5	If you reject the basic principle of right mindfulness, then you must honor and praise those ascetics and brahmins who are unmindful, with no situational awareness.

an4.30:8.1	If anyone imagines they can criticize and reject these four basic principles, they deserve rebuke and criticism on four legitimate grounds in the present life.
an4.30:8.2	Even those wanderers of the past, Vassa and Bhañña of Ukkalā, who taught the doctrines of no-cause, inaction, and nihilism, didn’t imagine that these four basic principles should be criticized or rejected.
an4.30:8.3	Why is that?
an4.30:8.4	For fear of being blamed, criticized, and faulted.

an4.33:1.2	yawns,
an4.33:1.3	looks all around the four directions,
an4.33:1.4	and roars his lion’s roar three times.
an4.33:1.5	Then he sets out on the hunt.
an4.33:1.6	And the animals who hear the roar of the lion, king of beasts, are typically filled with fear, awe, and terror.
an4.33:1.7	They return to their lairs, be they in a hole, the water, or a wood; and the birds take to the air.
an4.33:1.8	Even the royal elephants, bound with strong harnesses in the villages, towns, and capital cities, break apart their bonds, and urinate and defecate in terror as they flee here and there.
an4.33:1.9	That’s how powerful is the lion, king of beasts, among animals, how illustrious and mighty.
an4.33:2.1	In the same way, when a Realized One arises in the world—perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed—he teaches the Dhamma:
an4.33:2.2	‘Such is identity, such is the origin of identity, such is the cessation of identity, such is the practice that leads to the cessation of identity.’
an4.33:2.3	Now, there are gods who are long-lived, beautiful, and very happy, lasting long in their divine palaces. When they hear this teaching by the Realized One, they’re typically filled with fear, awe, and terror.
an4.33:2.4	‘Oh no! It turns out we’re impermanent, though we thought we were permanent!
an4.33:2.5	It turns out we don’t last, though we thought we were everlasting!
an4.33:2.6	It turns out we’re transient, though we thought we were eternal!
an4.33:2.7	It turns out that we’re impermanent, not lasting, transient, and included within identity.’
an4.33:2.8	That’s how powerful is the Realized One in the world with its gods, how illustrious and mighty.

an4.33:4.3	and the noble eightfold path
an4.33:4.4	that leads to the stilling of suffering.

an4.33:5.3	are afraid and full of terror,
an4.33:5.4	like the other beasts when they hear a lion.

an4.34:1.2	What four?
an4.34:1.3	The Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, is said to be the best of all sentient beings—be they footless, with two feet, four feet, or many feet; with form or formless; with perception or without perception or with neither perception nor non-perception.
an4.34:1.4	Those who have confidence in the Buddha have confidence in the best.
an4.34:1.5	Having confidence in the best, the result is the best.

an4.34:2.3	Having confidence in the best, the result is the best.
an4.34:3.1	Fading away is said to be the best of all things whether conditioned or unconditioned. That is, the quelling of vanity, the removing of thirst, the abolishing of clinging, the breaking of the round, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.
an4.34:3.2	Those who have confidence in the teaching of fading away have confidence in the best.
an4.34:3.3	Having confidence in the best, the result is the best.
an4.34:4.1	The Saṅgha of the Realized One’s disciples is said to be the best of all communities and groups. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.
an4.34:4.2	Those who have confidence in the Saṅgha have confidence in the best.
an4.34:4.3	Having confidence in the best, the result is the best.
an4.34:4.4	These are the four best kinds of confidence.
an4.34:5.1	For those who, knowing the best teaching,
an4.34:5.2	base their confidence on the best—
an4.34:5.3	confident in the best Awakened One,
an4.34:5.4	supremely worthy of a religious donation;
an4.34:6.1	confident in the best teaching,
an4.34:6.2	the bliss of fading and stilling;
an4.34:6.3	confident in the best Saṅgha,
an4.34:6.4	the supreme field of merit—
an4.34:7.1	giving gifts to the best,
an4.34:7.2	the best of merit grows:
an4.34:7.3	the best lifespan, beauty,
an4.34:7.4	fame, reputation, happiness, and strength.
an4.34:8.1	An intelligent person gives to the best,
an4.34:8.2	settled on the best teaching.

an4.35:1.2	Then Vassakāra the brahmin, a chief minister of Magadha, went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
an4.35:1.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
an4.35:2.1	“Master Gotama, when someone has four qualities we describe him as a great man with great wisdom.
an4.35:2.2	What four?
an4.35:2.3	They are very learned in diverse fields of learning.
an4.35:2.4	They understand the meaning of diverse statements, saying: ‘This is what that statement means; that is what this statement means.’
an4.35:2.5	They are mindful, able to remember and recollect what was said and done long ago.
an4.35:2.6	They are deft and tireless in household duties, understanding how to go about things in order to complete and organize the work.
an4.35:2.7	When someone has these four qualities we describe him as a great man with great wisdom.
an4.35:2.8	If Master Gotama agrees with me, please say so.

an4.35:3.8	Thus they have achieved mental mastery of the paths of thought.
an4.35:3.9	They get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.
an4.35:3.10	They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.

an4.35:3.12	but when someone has these four qualities I describe him as a great man with great wisdom.”

an4.35:4.2	How well said this was by Master Gotama!
an4.35:4.3	And we will remember Master Gotama as someone who has these four qualities.

an4.36:1.3	Doṇa saw that the Buddha’s footprints had thousand-spoked wheels, with rims and hubs, complete in every detail.
an4.36:1.4	It occurred to him,
an4.36:1.5	“It’s incredible, it’s amazing!
an4.36:1.6	Surely these couldn’t be the footprints of a human being?”
an4.36:1.7	The Buddha had left the road and sat at the root of a tree cross-legged, with his body straight and his mindfulness established right there.
an4.36:1.8	Then Doṇa, following the Buddha’s footprints, saw him sitting at the tree root—impressive and inspiring, with peaceful faculties and mind, attained to the highest self-control and serenity, like an elephant with tamed, guarded, and controlled faculties.

an4.36:4.2	NA
an4.36:4.3	Suppose there was a blue water lily, or a pink or white lotus. Though it sprouted and grew in the water, it would rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to it.
an4.36:4.4	In the same way, though I was born and grew up in the world, I live having mastered the world, unsullied by the world.
an4.36:4.5	Remember me, brahmin, as a Buddha.
an4.36:5.1	I could have been reborn as a god,

an4.37:1.2	What four?
an4.37:1.3	A mendicant is accomplished in ethics, guards the sense doors, eats in moderation, and is dedicated to wakefulness.
an4.37:2.1	And how is a mendicant accomplished in ethics?
an4.37:2.2	It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
an4.37:2.3	That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics.
an4.37:3.1	And how does a mendicant guard the sense doors?
an4.37:3.2	When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
an4.37:3.3	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving restraint over it.

an4.37:3.6	Tasting a flavor with their tongue …

an4.37:3.10	That’s how a mendicant guards the sense doors.
an4.37:4.1	And how does a mendicant eat in moderation?
an4.37:4.2	It’s when a mendicant reflects properly on the food that they eat:
an4.37:4.3	‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’
an4.37:4.4	That’s how a mendicant eats in moderation.
an4.37:5.1	And how is a mendicant dedicated to wakefulness?
an4.37:5.2	It’s when a mendicant practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind from obstacles.
an4.37:5.3	In the evening, they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation.
an4.37:5.4	In the middle of the night, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.
an4.37:5.5	In the last part of the night, they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying their mind from obstacles.

an4.38:1.1	“Mendicants, a mendicant has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth, has totally given up searching, has stilled the physical process, and is said to be ‘withdrawn’.
an4.38:1.2	And how has a mendicant eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth?
an4.38:1.3	Different ascetics and brahmins have different idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth. For example:
an4.38:1.4	the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.
an4.38:1.5	A mendicant has dispelled, eliminated, thrown out, rejected, let go of, given up, and relinquished all these.
an4.38:1.6	That’s how a mendicant has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth.
an4.38:2.1	And how has a mendicant totally given up searching?
an4.38:2.2	It’s when they’ve given up searching for sensual pleasures, for continued existence, and for a spiritual path.
an4.38:2.3	That’s how a mendicant has totally given up searching.
an4.38:3.1	And how has a mendicant stilled the physical process?
an4.38:3.2	It’s when, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
an4.38:3.3	That’s how a mendicant has stilled the physical process.
an4.38:4.1	And how is a mendicant withdrawn?
an4.38:4.2	It’s when they’ve given up the conceit ‘I am’, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future.
an4.38:4.3	That’s how a mendicant is withdrawn.
an4.38:4.4	A mendicant has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth, has totally given up searching, has stilled the physical process, and is said to be ‘withdrawn’.
an4.38:5.1	The search for sensual pleasures, for a good rebirth,
an4.38:5.2	and the search for a spiritual path;
an4.38:5.3	the holding tight to the notion ‘this is the truth’,
an4.38:5.4	and the mass of grounds for views—
an4.38:6.1	for one detached from all lusts,
an4.38:6.2	freed by the ending of craving,
an4.38:6.3	that searching has been relinquished,
an4.38:6.4	and those viewpoints eradicated.
an4.38:7.1	That mendicant is peaceful and mindful,
an4.38:7.2	a tranquil champion.
an4.38:7.3	And when they’re awakened by comprehending conceit,
an4.38:7.4	they’re called ‘withdrawn’.”

an4.39:1.7	I criticize that kind of violent sacrifice.

an4.41:1.1	“Mendicants, there are these four ways of developing immersion further.
an4.41:1.2	What four?
an4.41:1.3	There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in the present life.
an4.41:1.4	There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision.
an4.41:1.5	There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness.
an4.41:1.6	There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to the ending of defilements.
an4.41:2.1	And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in the present life?
an4.41:2.2	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.
an4.41:2.3	This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in the present life.
an4.41:3.1	And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision?
an4.41:3.2	It’s when a mendicant focuses on the perception of light, concentrating on the perception of day,
an4.41:3.3	regardless of whether it’s night or day.
an4.41:3.4	And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance.
an4.41:3.5	This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision.
an4.41:4.1	And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness?
an4.41:4.2	It’s when a mendicant knows feelings as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away.
an4.41:4.3	They know perceptions as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. They know thoughts as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away.
an4.41:4.4	This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness.
an4.41:5.1	And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to the ending of defilements?
an4.41:5.2	It’s when a mendicant meditates observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates.
an4.41:5.3	‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.
an4.41:5.4	Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling.
an4.41:5.5	Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is the ending of perception.
an4.41:5.6	Such are choices, such is the origin of choices, such is the ending of choices.
an4.41:5.7	Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’
an4.41:5.8	This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to the ending of defilements.
an4.41:5.9	These are the four ways of developing immersion further.
an4.41:5.10	And it was in this connection that I said in ‘The Way to the Beyond’, in ‘The Questions of Puṇṇaka’:
an4.41:6.1	‘Having assessed the world high and low,
an4.41:6.2	there is nothing in the world that disturbs them.
an4.41:6.3	Peaceful, unclouded, untroubled, with no need for hope,
an4.41:6.4	they’ve crossed over rebirth and old age, I declare.’”

an4.42:1.1	“Mendicants, there are these four ways of answering questions.
an4.42:1.2	What four?
an4.42:1.3	There is a question that should be answered definitively.
an4.42:1.4	There is a question that should be answered analytically.
an4.42:1.5	There is a question that should be answered with a counter-question.
an4.42:1.6	There is a question that should be set aside.
an4.42:1.7	These are the four ways of answering questions.
an4.42:2.1	One is stated definitively,
an4.42:2.2	another analytically,
an4.42:2.3	a third with a counter-question,
an4.42:2.4	while a fourth is set aside.
an4.42:3.1	A mendicant who knows each of these,
an4.42:3.2	in line with good principles,
an4.42:3.3	is said to be skilled
an4.42:3.4	in the four kinds of questions.
an4.42:4.1	They’re intimidating, hard to defeat,
an4.42:4.2	deep, and hard to crush.
an4.42:4.3	They’re expert in both
an4.42:4.4	what the meaning is and what it isn’t.

It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.
an4.51:6.1	It’s like trying to grasp how much water is in the ocean. It’s not easy to say how many gallons, how many hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of gallons there are. It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water.

This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’
an4.52:3.3	This is the third kind of overflowing merit …

an4.53:1.3	The Buddha left the road and sat at the root of a tree,

an4.53:1.5	They went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them:

an4.53:3.1	And how does a male zombie live with a female zombie?
an4.53:3.2	It’s when the husband kills living creatures, steals, commits sexual misconduct, lies, and uses alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. He’s unethical, of bad character, living at home with his heart full of the stain of stinginess, abusing and insulting ascetics and brahmins.

an4.61:5.1	The fourth thing, having got wealth, fame, and long life, is the wish: ‘When my body breaks up, after death, may I be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm!’
an4.61:5.2	These are the four things that are likable, desirable, and agreeable, but hard to get in the world.
an4.61:6.1	These next four things lead to the getting of those four things.
an4.61:6.2	What four?
an4.61:6.3	Accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom.
an4.61:7.1	And what is accomplishment in faith?
an4.61:7.2	It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:
an4.61:7.3	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
an4.61:7.4	This is called accomplishment in faith.
an4.61:8.1	And what is accomplishment in ethics?
an4.61:8.2	It’s when a noble disciple doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
an4.61:8.3	This is called accomplishment in ethics.
an4.61:9.1	And what is accomplishment in generosity?
an4.61:9.2	It’s when a noble disciple lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.
an4.61:9.3	This is called accomplishment in generosity.
an4.61:10.1	And what is accomplishment in wisdom?
an4.61:10.2	When your heart is mastered by covetousness and immoral greed, you do what you shouldn’t, and fail to do what you should.

an4.61:10.11	Your fame and happiness fall to dust.
an4.61:11.1	Knowing that ‘covetousness and immoral greed are corruptions of the mind’, that noble disciple gives them up.
an4.61:11.2	Knowing that ‘ill will …’ …
an4.61:11.3	‘dullness and drowsiness …’ …
an4.61:11.4	‘restlessness and remorse …’ …

an4.61:12.7	This is called accomplishment in wisdom.
an4.61:12.8	These are the four things that lead to the getting of the four things that are likable, desirable, and agreeable, but hard to get in the world.
an4.61:13.1	There are four deeds of substance that a noble disciple does with the legitimate wealth he has earned by his efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow.
an4.61:13.2	What four?
an4.61:13.3	To start with, with his legitimate wealth he makes himself happy and pleased, keeping himself properly happy.
an4.61:13.4	He makes his mother and father happy …
an4.61:13.5	He makes his children, partners, bondservants, workers, and staff happy …
an4.61:13.6	He makes his friends and colleagues happy …
an4.61:13.7	This is his first solid and substantive investment, used in the appropriate sphere.
an4.61:14.1	Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he defends himself against threats from such things as fire, flood, rulers, bandits, or unloved heirs.
an4.61:14.2	He keeps himself safe.
an4.61:14.3	This is his second solid and substantive investment, used in the appropriate sphere.
an4.61:15.1	Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he makes five spirit-offerings:
an4.61:15.2	to relatives, guests, ancestors, king, and deities.
an4.61:15.3	This is his third solid and substantive investment, used in the appropriate sphere.
an4.61:16.1	Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he establishes an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins—those who avoid intoxication and negligence, are settled in patience and gentleness, and who tame, calm, and extinguish themselves—that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven.
an4.61:16.2	This is his fourth solid and substantive investment, used in the appropriate sphere.
an4.61:17.1	These are the four deeds of substance that a noble disciple does with the legitimate wealth he has earned by his efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow.
an4.61:17.2	Whatever wealth is spent on something other than these four deeds of substance is said to be not a solid or substantive investment, and not used in the appropriate sphere.
an4.61:17.3	But whatever wealth is spent on these four deeds of substance is said to be a solid and substantive investment, used in the appropriate sphere.
an4.61:18.1	‘I’ve enjoyed my wealth, supporting those who depend on me;
an4.61:18.2	I’ve overcome losses;
an4.61:18.3	I’ve given uplifting religious donations;
an4.61:18.4	and made the five spirit-offerings.
an4.61:18.5	I have served the ethical and
an4.61:18.6	disciplined spiritual practitioners.
an4.61:19.1	I’ve achieved the purpose
an4.61:19.2	for which an astute lay person
an4.61:19.3	wishes to gain wealth.
an4.61:19.4	I don’t regret what I’ve done.’
an4.61:20.1	A mortal person who recollects this
an4.61:20.2	stands firm in the teaching of the noble ones.
an4.61:20.3	They’re praised in this life,

an4.62:1.1	Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
an4.62:2.1	“Householder, these four kinds of happiness can be earned by a layperson who enjoys sensual pleasures, depending on time and occasion.
an4.62:2.2	What four?
an4.62:2.3	The happiness of ownership, using wealth, debtlessness, and blamelessness.
an4.62:3.1	And what is the happiness of ownership?
an4.62:3.2	It’s when a gentleman owns legitimate wealth that he has earned by his own efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow.
an4.62:3.3	When he reflects on this, he’s filled with pleasure and happiness.
an4.62:3.4	This is called ‘the happiness of ownership’.
an4.62:4.1	And what is the happiness of using wealth?
an4.62:4.2	It’s when a gentleman uses his legitimate wealth, and makes merit with it.
an4.62:4.3	When he reflects on this, he’s filled with pleasure and happiness.
an4.62:4.4	This is called ‘the happiness of using wealth’.
an4.62:5.1	And what is the happiness of debtlessness?
an4.62:5.2	It’s when a gentleman owes no debt, large or small, to anyone.
an4.62:5.3	When he reflects on this, he’s filled with pleasure and happiness.
an4.62:5.4	This is called ‘the happiness of debtlessness’.
an4.62:6.1	And what is the happiness of blamelessness?
an4.62:6.2	It’s when a noble disciple has blameless conduct by way of body, speech, and mind.
an4.62:6.3	When he reflects on this, he’s filled with pleasure and happiness.
an4.62:6.4	This is called ‘the happiness of blamelessness’.
an4.62:6.5	These four kinds of happiness can be earned by a layperson who enjoys sensual pleasures, depending on time and occasion.
an4.62:7.1	Knowing the happiness of debtlessness,
an4.62:7.2	and the extra happiness of possession,
an4.62:7.3	a mortal enjoying the happiness of using wealth,
an4.62:7.4	then sees clearly with wisdom.
an4.62:8.1	Seeing clearly, a clever person knows
an4.62:8.2	both kinds of happiness:
an4.62:8.3	the other kind is not worth a sixteenth part
an4.62:8.4	of the happiness of blamelessness.”

an4.63:1.1	“Mendicants, a family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to live with Brahmā.
an4.63:1.2	A family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to live with the first teachers.

an4.63:1.4	A family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to live with those worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods.
an4.63:2.1	‘Brahmā’ is a term for your parents.
an4.63:2.2	‘First teachers’ is a term for your parents.
an4.63:2.3	‘Old deities’ is a term for your parents.
an4.63:2.4	‘Worthy of an offering dedicated to the gods’ is a term for your parents.
an4.63:2.5	Why is that?
an4.63:2.6	Parents are very helpful to their children, they raise them, nurture them, and show them the world.
an4.63:3.1	Parents are said to be ‘Brahmā’
an4.63:3.2	and ‘first teachers’.
an4.63:3.3	They’re worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods from their children,
an4.63:3.4	for they love their offspring.
an4.63:4.1	Therefore an astute person
an4.63:4.2	would revere them and honor them
an4.63:4.3	with food and drink,
an4.63:4.4	clothes and bedding,
an4.63:4.5	by anointing and bathing,

an4.157:1.4	Some sentient beings are seen who can claim to be free of physical illness for a year, or two, or three years … even up to a hundred years or more.

an4.157:2.1	There are four kinds of illness for those gone forth.
an4.157:2.2	What four?
an4.157:2.3	To start with, a mendicant has many wishes, is frustrated, and is not content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.
an4.157:2.4	Because of this, they focus their corrupt wishes on being looked up to, and on getting material possessions, honor, and popularity.
an4.157:2.5	They try hard, strive, and make an effort to get these things.
an4.157:2.6	They have an ulterior motive when they visit families. They have an ulterior motive when they sit down, when they speak on Dhamma, and even when they hold it in when they need to go to the toilet.
an4.157:2.7	These are the four kinds of illness for those gone forth.
an4.157:3.1	So you should train like this:
an4.157:3.2	‘We will not have many wishes or be frustrated. We will be content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. We won’t focus our corrupt wishes on being looked up to, and on getting material possessions, honor, and popularity. We won’t try hard, strive, and make an effort to get these things. We will endure cold, heat, hunger, and thirst. We will endure the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. We will endure rude and unwelcome criticism. We will put up with physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening.’

an4.159:1.4	“Please, mister, go to Venerable Ānanda, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:
an4.159:1.5	‘Sir, the nun named so-and-so is sick, suffering, and gravely ill.
an4.159:1.6	She bows with her head to your feet.’ And then say:

an4.159:3.3	She wrapped herself up from head to foot and laid down on her cot.
an4.159:3.4	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to her, and sat down on the seat spread out. Then Ānanda said to the nun:
an4.159:4.1	“Sister, this body is produced by food. Relying on food,
an4.159:4.2	you should give up food.
an4.159:4.3	This body is produced by craving. Relying on craving,

an4.159:5.5	‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’

an4.159:6.5	‘They say that the mendicant named so-and-so has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’
an4.159:6.6	They think:
an4.159:6.7	‘Oh, when will I too realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. …’
an4.159:6.8	After some time, relying on craving, they give up craving.

an4.159:9.2	“I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to act in that way.
an4.159:9.3	Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I can restrain myself in future.”
an4.159:9.4	“Indeed, sister, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to act in that way.
an4.159:9.5	But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it.

an4.160:4.3	Firstly, the mendicants memorize discourses that they learned incorrectly, with misplaced words and phrases.
an4.160:4.4	When the words and phrases are misplaced, the meaning is misinterpreted.
an4.160:4.5	This is the first thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching.

an4.160:5.2	This is the second thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching.
an4.160:6.1	Furthermore, the mendicants who are very learned—knowledgeable in the scriptures, who have memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the outlines—don’t carefully make others recite the discourses.
an4.160:6.2	When they pass away, the discourses are cut off at the root, with no-one to preserve them.
an4.160:6.3	This is the third thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching.
an4.160:7.1	Furthermore, the senior mendicants are indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, not rousing energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.

an4.160:7.3	They too become indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, not rousing energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.

an4.160:8.4	When the words and phrases are well placed, the meaning is interpreted correctly.
an4.160:8.5	This is the first thing that leads to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching.

an4.160:9.2	This is the second thing that leads to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching.
an4.160:10.1	Furthermore, the mendicants who are very learned—knowledgeable in the scriptures, who have memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the outlines—carefully make others recite the discourses.
an4.160:10.2	When they pass away, the discourses aren’t cut off at the root, and they have someone to preserve them.
an4.160:10.3	This is the third thing that leads to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching.
an4.160:11.1	Furthermore, the senior mendicants are not indulgent or slack, nor are they backsliders; instead, they take the lead in seclusion, rousing energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.
an4.160:11.2	Those who come after them follow their example.
an4.160:11.3	They too aren’t indulgent or slack …

an4.163:4.2	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an4.163:4.3	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an4.163:4.4	And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’

an4.164:3.2	When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
an4.164:3.3	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving restraint over it.

an4.171:5.2	But when ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, there is no body and no voice and no mind, conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself.
an4.171:5.3	There is no field, no ground, no scope, and no basis, conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself.
an4.171:6.1	Mendicants, there are four kinds of reincarnation.
an4.171:6.2	What four?
an4.171:6.3	There is a reincarnation where one’s own intention is effective, not that of others.
an4.171:6.4	There is a reincarnation where the intention of others is effective, not one’s own.
an4.171:6.5	There is a reincarnation where both one’s own and others’ intentions are effective.
an4.171:6.6	There is a reincarnation where neither one’s own nor others’ intentions are effective.
an4.171:6.7	These are the four kinds of reincarnation.”
an4.171:7.1	When he said this, Venerable Sāriputta said to the Buddha:
an4.171:7.2	“Sir, this is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement.
an4.171:7.3	Take the case of the reincarnation where one’s own intention is effective, not that of others. Those sentient beings pass away from that realm due to their own intention.
an4.171:7.4	Take the case of the reincarnation where the intention of others is effective, not one’s own. Those sentient beings pass away from that realm due to the intention of others.
an4.171:7.5	Take the case of the reincarnation where both one’s own and others’ intentions are effective. Those sentient beings pass away from that realm due to both their own and others’ intentions.
an4.171:7.6	But sir, in the case of the reincarnation where neither one’s own nor others’ intentions are effective, what kind of gods does this refer to?”
an4.171:7.7	“Sāriputta, it refers to the gods reborn in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.”
an4.171:8.1	“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why some sentient beings pass away from that realm as returners who come back to this state of existence,
an4.171:8.2	while others are non-returners who don’t come back?”
an4.171:8.3	“Sāriputta, take a person who hasn’t given up the lower fetters. In the present life they enter and abide in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
an4.171:8.4	They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying.
an4.171:8.5	If they abide in that, are committed to it, and meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re reborn in the company of the gods of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
an4.171:8.6	When they pass away from there, they’re a returner, who comes back to this state of existence.
an4.171:9.1	Sāriputta, take a person who has given up the lower fetters. In the present life they enter and abide in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
an4.171:9.2	They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying.
an4.171:9.3	If they abide in that, are committed to it, and meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re reborn in the company of the gods of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
an4.171:9.4	When they pass away from there, they’re a non-returner, not coming back to this state of existence.
an4.171:10.1	This is the cause, this is the reason why some sentient beings pass away from that realm as returners who come back to this state of existence,
an4.171:10.2	while others are non-returners who don’t come back.”

an4.181:4.3	That’s how a mendicant is a marksman.
an4.181:5.1	And how does a mendicant shatter large objects?

an4.185:2.2	“The truths of the brahmins are like this; the truths of the brahmins are like that.”

an4.185:4.1	“Wanderers, I declare these four truths of the brahmins, having realized them with my own insight.
an4.185:4.2	What four?
an4.185:4.3	Take a brahmin who says:
an4.185:4.4	‘No sentient beings should be killed.’
an4.185:4.5	Saying this, a brahmin speaks the truth, not lies.
an4.185:4.6	But they don’t think of themselves as an ‘ascetic’ or ‘brahmin’ because of that. Nor do they think ‘I’m better’ or ‘I’m equal’ or ‘I’m worse’.
an4.185:4.7	Rather, they simply practice out of kindness and compassion for living creatures, having had insight into the truth of that.
an4.185:5.1	Take another brahmin who says:
an4.185:5.2	‘All sensual pleasures are impermanent, suffering, and perishable.’
an4.185:5.3	Saying this, a brahmin speaks the truth, not lies.
an4.185:5.4	But they don’t think of themselves as an ‘ascetic’ or ‘brahmin’ because of that. Nor do they think ‘I’m better’ or ‘I’m equal’ or ‘I’m worse’.
an4.185:5.5	Rather, they simply practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding sensual pleasures, having had insight into the truth of that.
an4.185:6.1	Take another brahmin who says:
an4.185:6.2	‘All states of existence are impermanent, suffering, and perishable.’ … They simply practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding future lives, having had insight into the truth of that.
an4.185:7.1	Take another brahmin who says:
an4.185:7.2	‘I don’t belong to anyone anywhere. And nothing belongs to me anywhere.’
an4.185:7.3	Saying this, a brahmin speaks the truth, not lies.
an4.185:7.4	But they don’t think of themselves as an ‘ascetic’ or ‘brahmin’ because of that. Nor do they think ‘I’m better’ or ‘I’m equal’ or ‘I’m worse’.
an4.185:7.5	Rather, they simply practice the path of nothingness, having had insight into the truth of that.

an4.187:4.1	Once, members of the brahmin Todeyya’s assembly were going on complaining about others:
an4.187:4.2	‘This King Eḷeyya is a fool to be so devoted to Rāmaputta. He even shows him the utmost deference by bowing down to him, rising up for him, greeting him with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for him.
an4.187:4.3	And these king’s men are fools too—
an4.187:4.4	Yamaka, Moggalla, Ugga, Nāvindakī, Gandhabba, and Aggivessa—for they show the same kind of deference to Rāmaputta.’
an4.187:4.5	Then the brahmin Todeyya reasoned with them like this:
an4.187:4.6	‘What do you think, sirs?
an4.187:4.7	When it comes to the various duties and speeches, isn’t King Eḷeyya astute, even better than the experts?’
an4.187:4.8	‘That’s true, sir.’
an4.187:5.1	‘It’s because Rāmaputta is even more astute and expert than King Eḷeyya that the king is so devoted to him. That’s why he even shows Rāmaputta the utmost deference by bowing down to him, rising up for him, greeting him with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for him.
an4.187:6.1	What do you think, sirs?
an4.187:6.2	NA
an4.187:6.3	When it comes to the various duties and speeches, aren’t the king’s men—Yamaka, Moggalla, Ugga, Nāvindakī, Gandhabba, and Aggivessa—astute, even better than the experts?’
an4.187:6.4	‘That’s true, sir.’
an4.187:6.5	NA
an4.187:7.1	‘It’s because Rāmaputta is even more astute and expert than the king’s men that they have such devotion to him. …

an4.187:8.1	It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing,
an4.187:8.2	how well said this was by Master Gotama:
an4.187:8.3	‘It’s impossible, it can’t happen, that a bad person could know …
an4.187:8.4	NA
an4.187:8.5	NA

an4.187:8.11	Well, now, Master Gotama, I must go.
an4.187:8.12	I have many duties, and much to do.”
an4.187:8.13	“Please, brahmin, go at your convenience.”
an4.187:9.1	Then Vassakāra the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got up from his seat and left.

an4.188:0.3	188. With Upaka
an4.188:1.1	Once the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
an4.188:1.2	Then Upaka the son of Maṇḍikā went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an4.188:2.1	“Sir, this is my doctrine and view:
an4.188:2.2	‘Whoever goes on complaining about others without giving any reasons
an4.188:2.3	is reprehensible and at fault.’”
an4.188:2.4	“Upaka, if someone goes on complaining about others without giving a reason, they’re reprehensible and at fault.
an4.188:2.5	But that’s what you do, so you’re reprehensible and at fault!”
an4.188:2.6	“Sir, like a fish caught in a big trap just as it rises,
an4.188:2.7	so the Buddha caught me in a big trap of words just as I rose up.”
an4.188:3.1	“Upaka, I’ve declared: ‘This is unskillful.’
an4.188:3.2	And there are limitless words, phrases, and teachings of the Realized One about that:
an4.188:3.3	‘This is another way of saying that this is unskillful.’
an4.188:3.4	I’ve declared: ‘The unskillful should be given up.’
an4.188:3.5	And there are limitless words, phrases, and teachings of the Realized One about that:
an4.188:3.6	‘This is another way of saying that the unskillful should be given up.’
an4.188:4.1	I’ve declared that: ‘This is skillful.’
an4.188:4.2	And there are limitless words, phrases, and teachings of the Realized One about that:
an4.188:4.3	‘This is another way of saying that this is skillful.’
an4.188:4.4	I’ve declared: ‘The skillful should be developed.’
an4.188:4.5	And there are limitless words, phrases, and teachings of the Realized One about that:
an4.188:4.6	‘This is another way of saying that the skillful should be developed.’”
an4.188:5.1	And then Upaka the son of Maṇḍikā approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went up to King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha. He told the King of all they had discussed.
an4.188:5.2	But Ajātasattu became angry and upset, and said to Upaka,
an4.188:5.3	“How rude of this salt-maker’s boy! How scurrilous and impudent of him to imagine he could attack the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!
an4.188:5.4	Get out, Upaka, go away! Don’t let me see you again.”

an4.190:0.3	190. Sabbath
an4.190:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.
an4.190:1.2	Now, at that time it was the sabbath, and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.
an4.190:1.3	Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were so very silent. He addressed them:
an4.190:2.1	“This assembly has no nonsense, mendicants, it’s free of nonsense. It consists purely of the essential core.
an4.190:2.2	Such is this Saṅgha of monks, such is this assembly!
an4.190:2.3	An assembly such as this is rarely seen in the world.
an4.190:2.4	An assembly such as this is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.
an4.190:2.5	Even a small gift to an assembly such as this is plentiful, while giving more is even more plentiful.
an4.190:2.6	An assembly such as this is worth traveling many leagues to see, even if you have to carry your own provisions in a shoulder bag.
an4.190:3.1	There are monks staying in this Saṅgha who have attained to the gods.
an4.190:3.2	There are monks staying in this Saṅgha who have attained to Brahmā.
an4.190:3.3	There are monks staying in this Saṅgha who have attained to the imperturbable.
an4.190:3.4	There are monks staying in this Saṅgha who have attained to nobility.
an4.190:4.1	And how has a monk attained to the gods?
an4.190:4.2	It’s when a monk, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption …
an4.190:4.3	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption …
an4.190:4.4	That’s how a monk has attained to the gods.
an4.190:5.1	And how has a monk attained to Brahmā?
an4.190:5.2	Firstly, a monk meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
an4.190:5.3	Furthermore, a monk meditates spreading a heart full of compassion …
an4.190:5.4	rejoicing …
an4.190:5.5	equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
an4.190:5.6	That’s how a monk has attained to Brahmā.
an4.190:6.1	And how has a monk attained to the imperturbable?
an4.190:6.2	It’s when a monk—going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity—aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.
an4.190:6.3	Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, he enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness.
an4.190:6.4	Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, he enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.
an4.190:6.5	Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, he enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
an4.190:6.6	That’s how a monk has attained to the imperturbable.
an4.190:7.1	And how has a monk attained to nobility?
an4.190:7.2	It’s when they truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
an4.190:7.3	That’s how a monk has attained to nobility.”

an4.192:11.5	‘Judging by this venerable’s approach, by what they’re getting at, and by how they articulate a question, they’re wise, not witless. …’

an4.192:11.7	NA
an4.192:11.8	NA
an4.192:11.9	NA
an4.192:12.1	That’s why I said that you can get to know a person’s wisdom by discussion. But only after a long time, not casually; only when paying attention, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless.
an4.192:12.2	These are the four things that can be known in four situations.”

an4.193:0.3	193. With Bhaddiya
an4.193:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
an4.193:1.2	Then Bhaddiya the Licchavi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an4.193:2.1	“Sir, I have heard this:
an4.193:2.2	‘The ascetic Gotama is a magician. He knows a conversion magic, and uses it to convert the disciples of those who follow other paths.’
an4.193:2.3	NA
an4.193:2.4	I trust that those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and do not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?”
an4.193:3.1	“Please, Bhaddiya, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’
an4.193:3.2	But when you know for yourselves:
an4.193:3.3	‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering’, then you should give them up.
an4.193:4.1	What do you think, Bhaddiya?
an4.193:4.2	Does greed come up in a person for their welfare or harm?”
an4.193:4.3	“Harm, sir.”
an4.193:4.4	“A greedy individual—overcome by greed—kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”
an4.193:4.5	“Yes, sir.”
an4.193:5.1	“What do you think, Bhaddiya?
an4.193:5.2	Does hate … or delusion … or aggression come up in a person for their welfare or harm?”
an4.193:5.3	“Harm, sir.”
an4.193:5.4	“An aggressive individual kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”
an4.193:5.5	“Yes, sir.”
an4.193:6.1	“What do you think, Bhaddiya, are these things skillful or unskillful?”
an4.193:6.2	“Unskillful, sir.”
an4.193:6.3	“Blameworthy or blameless?”
an4.193:6.4	“Blameworthy, sir.”
an4.193:6.5	“Criticized or praised by sensible people?”
an4.193:6.6	“Criticized by sensible people, sir.”
an4.193:6.7	“When you undertake them, do they lead to harm and suffering, or not?
an4.193:6.8	Or how do you see this?”
an4.193:6.9	“When you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering.
an4.193:6.10	That’s how we see it.”
an4.193:7.1	“So, Bhaddiya, when we said:

an4.193:8.1	Please, Bhaddiya, don’t rely on oral transmission …
an4.193:8.2	But when you know for yourselves:
an4.193:8.3	‘These things are skillful, blameless, praised by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness’, then you should acquire them and keep them.
an4.193:9.1	What do you think, Bhaddiya?
an4.193:9.2	Does contentment … love … understanding … benevolence come up in a person for their welfare or harm?”
an4.193:9.3	NA
an4.193:9.4	NA
an4.193:9.5	NA
an4.193:10.1	NA
an4.193:10.2	“Welfare, sir.”

an4.193:10.4	“Yes, sir.”
an4.193:11.1	“What do you think, Bhaddiya, are these things skillful or unskillful?”
an4.193:11.2	“Skillful, sir.”
an4.193:11.3	“Blameworthy or blameless?”
an4.193:11.4	“Blameless, sir.”
an4.193:11.5	“Criticized or praised by sensible people?”
an4.193:11.6	“Praised by sensible people, sir.”
an4.193:11.7	“When you undertake them, do they lead to welfare and happiness, or not?
an4.193:11.8	Or how do you see this?”
an4.193:11.9	“When you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness.
an4.193:11.10	That’s how we see it.”
an4.193:12.1	“So, Bhaddiya, when we said:

an4.193:13.1	The good people in the world encourage their disciples:
an4.193:13.2	‘Please, mister, live rid of greed.
an4.193:13.3	Then you won’t act out of greed by way of body, speech, or mind.

an4.193:15.1	“Well, Bhaddiya, did I say to you:
an4.193:15.2	‘Please, Bhaddiya, be my disciple,

an4.193:15.4	“No, sir.”

an4.194:0.3	194. At Sāpūga
an4.194:1.1	At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where they have a town named Sāpūga.
an4.194:1.2	Then several Koliyans from Sāpūga went up to Ānanda, bowed, and sat down to one side. Then Venerable Ānanda said to them:
an4.194:2.1	“Byagghapajjas, these four factors of trying to be pure have been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.
an4.194:2.2	What four?
an4.194:2.3	The factors of trying to be pure in ethics, mind, view, and freedom.
an4.194:3.1	And what is the factor of trying to be pure in ethics?
an4.194:3.2	It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the code of conduct, with good behavior and supporters. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
an4.194:3.3	This is called purity of ethics.
an4.194:3.4	They think: ‘I will fulfill such purity of ethics, or, if it’s already fulfilled, I’ll support it in every situation by wisdom.’ Their enthusiasm for that—their effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness—is called the factor of trying to be pure in ethics.
an4.194:4.1	And what is the factor of trying to be pure in mind?
an4.194:4.2	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.
an4.194:4.3	This is called purity of mind.
an4.194:4.4	They think: ‘I will fulfill such purity of mind, or, if it’s already fulfilled, I’ll support it in every situation by wisdom.’ Their enthusiasm for that—their effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness—is called the factor of trying to be pure in mind.
an4.194:5.1	And what is the factor of trying to be pure in view?
an4.194:5.2	Take a mendicant who truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
an4.194:5.3	This is called purity of view.
an4.194:5.4	They think: ‘I will fulfill such purity of view, or, if it’s already fulfilled, I’ll support it in every situation by wisdom.’ Their enthusiasm for that—their effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness—is called the factor of trying to be pure in view.
an4.194:6.1	And what is the factor of trying to be pure in freedom?
an4.194:6.2	That noble disciple—who has these factors of trying to be pure in ethics, mind, and view—detaches their mind from things that arouse greed, and frees their mind from things that it should be freed from.
an4.194:6.3	Doing so, they experience perfect freedom.
an4.194:6.4	This is called purity of freedom.
an4.194:6.5	They think: ‘I will fulfill such purity of freedom, or, if it’s already fulfilled, I’ll support it in every situation by wisdom.’ Their enthusiasm for that—their effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness—is called the factor of trying to be pure in freedom.
an4.194:7.1	These four factors of trying to be pure have been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.”

an4.195:0.2	20. The Great Chapter
an4.195:0.3	195. With Vappa
an4.195:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.
an4.195:1.2	Then Vappa of the Sakyans, a disciple of the Jains, went up to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, bowed, and sat down to one side. Mahāmoggallāna said to him:
an4.195:2.1	“Vappa, take a person who is restrained in body, speech, and mind. When ignorance fades away and knowledge arises,
an4.195:2.2	do you see any reason why defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next life?”
an4.195:2.3	“Sir, I do see such a case.
an4.195:2.4	Take a person who did bad deeds in a past life. But the result of that has not yet ripened.
an4.195:2.5	For this reason defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next life.”
an4.195:2.6	But this conversation between Mahāmoggallāna and Vappa was left unfinished.
an4.195:3.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall. He sat down on the seat spread out, and said to Mahāmoggallāna,
an4.195:4.1	“Moggallāna, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was unfinished?”
an4.195:4.2	Moggallāna repeated the entire conversation to the Buddha, and concluded:

an4.195:4.9	“This was my conversation with Vappa that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.”
an4.195:5.1	Then the Buddha said to Vappa,
an4.195:5.2	“Vappa, we can discuss this. But only if you allow what should be allowed, and reject what should be rejected. And if you ask me the meaning of anything you don’t understand, saying:
an4.195:5.3	‘Sir, why is this? What’s the meaning of that?’”
an4.195:5.4	“Sir, let us discuss this. I will do as you say.”
an4.195:5.5	NA
an4.195:5.6	NA
an4.195:6.1	“What do you think, Vappa?
an4.195:6.2	There are distressing and feverish defilements that arise because of instigating bodily activity. These don’t occur in someone who avoids such bodily activity.
an4.195:6.3	They don’t perform any new deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little. This wearing away is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.
an4.195:6.4	Do you see any reason why defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next life?”
an4.195:6.5	“No, sir.”
an4.195:7.1	“What do you think, Vappa?
an4.195:7.2	There are distressing and feverish defilements that arise because of instigating verbal activity. These don’t occur in someone who avoids such verbal activity.
an4.195:7.3	They don’t perform any new deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little.
an4.195:7.4	This wearing away is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.
an4.195:7.5	Do you see any reason why defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next life?”

an4.195:8.2	There are distressing and feverish defilements that arise because of instigating mental activity. These don’t occur in someone who avoids such mental activity.
an4.195:8.3	They don’t perform any new deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little.
an4.195:8.4	This wearing away is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.
an4.195:8.5	Do you see any reason why defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next life?”
an4.195:8.6	“No, sir.”
an4.195:9.1	“What do you think, Vappa?
an4.195:9.2	There are distressing and feverish defilements that arise because of ignorance. These don’t occur when ignorance fades away and knowledge arises.

an4.195:9.6	“No, sir.”
an4.195:10.1	“A mendicant whose mind is rightly freed like this has achieved six consistent responses.
an4.195:10.2	Seeing a sight with the eye, they’re neither happy nor sad, but remain equanimous, mindful and aware.
an4.195:10.3	Hearing a sound with the ears …
an4.195:10.4	Smelling an odor with the nose …
an4.195:10.5	Tasting a flavor with the tongue …
an4.195:10.6	Feeling a touch with the body …
an4.195:10.7	Knowing a thought with the mind, they’re neither happy nor sad, but remain equanimous, mindful and aware.
an4.195:10.8	Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’
an4.195:10.9	They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, being no longer relished, will become cool right here.’
an4.195:11.1	Suppose there was a shadow cast by a sacrificial post.
an4.195:11.2	Then along comes a person with a spade and basket.
an4.195:11.3	They cut down the sacrificial post at its base,
an4.195:11.4	dig it up,
an4.195:11.5	and pull it out by its roots, right down to the fibers and stems.
an4.195:11.6	Then they split it apart,
an4.195:11.7	cut up the parts,
an4.195:11.8	and chop them into splinters.
an4.195:11.9	Next they dry the splinters in the wind and sun,
an4.195:11.10	burn them with fire,
an4.195:11.11	and reduce them to ashes.
an4.195:11.12	Then they sweep away the ashes in a strong wind, or float them away down a swift stream.
an4.195:11.13	And so the shadow cast by the post is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
an4.195:12.1	In the same way, a mendicant whose mind is rightly freed like this has achieved six consistent responses.
an4.195:12.2	Seeing a sight with the eye, they’re neither happy nor sad, but remain equanimous, mindful and aware.
an4.195:12.3	Hearing a sound with the ears …
an4.195:12.4	Smelling an odor with the nose …

an4.195:12.7	Knowing a thought with the mind, they’re neither happy nor sad, but remain equanimous, mindful and aware.
an4.195:12.8	Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’
an4.195:12.9	They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, being no longer relished, will become cool right here.’”
an4.195:13.1	When he said this, Vappa the Sakyan, the disciple of the Jains, said to the Buddha:
an4.195:13.2	“Sir, suppose there was a man who raised commercial horses for profit.
an4.195:13.3	But he never made any profit, and instead just got weary and frustrated.
an4.195:13.4	In the same way, I paid homage to those Jain fools for profit.
an4.195:13.5	But I never made any profit, and instead just got weary and frustrated.
an4.195:13.6	From this day forth, any confidence I had in those Jain fools I sweep away as in a strong wind, or float away as down a swift stream.
an4.195:13.7	Excellent, sir! … From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

an4.196:0.3	196. With Sāḷha
an4.196:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
an4.196:1.2	Then Sāḷha and Abhaya the Licchavis went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an4.196:2.1	“There are, sir, some ascetics and brahmins who advocate crossing the flood by means of two things:
an4.196:2.2	purification of ethics, and mortification in disgust of sin.
an4.196:2.3	What does the Buddha say about this?”
an4.196:3.1	“Sāḷha, purification of ethics is one of the factors of the ascetic life, I say.
an4.196:3.2	But those ascetics and brahmins who teach mortification in disgust of sin—regarding it as essential and clinging to it—are incapable of crossing the flood.
an4.196:3.3	And those ascetics and brahmins whose livelihood and behavior by way of body, speech, and mind, is not pure are also incapable of knowing and seeing, of supreme awakening.
an4.196:4.1	Suppose a man who wanted to cross a river took a sharp axe into a wood.
an4.196:4.2	There he’d see a large green sal tree, straight and young and grown free of defects.
an4.196:4.3	He’d cut it down at the base,
an4.196:4.4	cut off the top,
an4.196:4.5	and completely strip off the branches and foliage.
an4.196:4.6	Then he’d trim it with axes and
an4.196:4.7	machetes,
an4.196:4.8	plane it,
an4.196:4.9	and sand it with a rock.
an4.196:4.10	Finally, he’d launch out on the river.
an4.196:5.1	What do you think, Sāḷha?
an4.196:5.2	Is that man capable of crossing the river?”
an4.196:5.3	“No, sir.
an4.196:5.4	Why not?
an4.196:5.5	Because that green sal tree is well worked on the outside, but inside it’s still not cleared out.
an4.196:5.6	I’d expect that green sal tree to sink, and the man to come to ruin.”
an4.196:6.1	“In the same way, Sāḷha, those ascetics and brahmins who teach mortification in disgust of sin—regarding it as essential and clinging to it—are incapable of crossing the flood.
an4.196:6.2	And those ascetics and brahmins whose livelihood and behavior by way of body, speech, and mind is not pure are also incapable of knowing and seeing, of supreme awakening.

an4.196:8.4	cut off the top,
an4.196:8.5	and completely strip off the branches and foliage.
an4.196:8.6	Then he’d trim it with axes and
an4.196:8.7	machetes.
an4.196:8.8	Then he’d take a chisel and completely clear it out inside.
an4.196:8.9	Then he’d plane it,
an4.196:8.10	sand it with a rock,
an4.196:8.11	and make it into a boat.
an4.196:8.12	Finally he’d fix it with oars and rudder,
an4.196:8.13	and launch out on the river.
an4.196:9.1	What do you think, Sāḷha?
an4.196:9.2	Is that man capable of crossing the river?”
an4.196:9.3	“Yes, sir.
an4.196:9.4	Why is that?
an4.196:9.5	Because that green sal tree is well worked on the outside, cleared out on the inside, made into a boat, and fixed with oars and rudder.
an4.196:9.6	I’d expect
an4.196:9.7	that boat to not sink, and the man to safely make it to the far shore.”
an4.196:10.1	“In the same way, Sāḷha, those ascetics and brahmins who don’t teach mortification in disgust of sin—not regarding it as essential or clinging to it—are capable of crossing the flood.
an4.196:10.2	And those ascetics and brahmins whose behavior by way of body, speech, and mind is pure are also capable of knowing and seeing, of supreme awakening.
an4.196:10.3	Suppose there was a warrior who knew lots of fancy archery tricks.
an4.196:10.4	It is only with these three factors that he becomes worthy of a king, fit to serve a king, and is considered a factor of kingship.
an4.196:10.5	What three?
an4.196:10.6	He’s a long-distance shooter, a marksman, and one who shatters large objects.
an4.196:11.1	Just as a warrior is a long-distance shooter,
an4.196:11.2	a noble disciple has right immersion.
an4.196:11.3	A noble disciple with right immersion truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
an4.196:11.4	They truly see any kind of feeling …
an4.196:11.5	perception …
an4.196:11.6	choices …
an4.196:11.7	consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near, *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
an4.196:12.1	Just as a warrior is a marksman,
an4.196:12.2	a noble disciple has right view.
an4.196:12.3	A noble disciple with right view truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
an4.196:13.1	Just as a warrior shatters large objects,
an4.196:13.2	a noble disciple has right freedom.
an4.196:13.3	A noble disciple with right freedom shatters the great mass of ignorance.”

an4.197:0.3	197. Queen Mallikā
an4.197:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an4.197:1.2	Then Queen Mallikā went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an4.197:2.1	“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why in this life some females are ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking;
an4.197:2.2	and poor, with few assets and possessions; and insignificant?
an4.197:3.1	And why are some females ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking;
an4.197:3.2	but rich, affluent, wealthy, and illustrious?
an4.197:4.1	And why are some females attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty;
an4.197:4.2	but poor, with few assets and possessions; and insignificant?
an4.197:5.1	And why are some females attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty; and rich, affluent, wealthy, and illustrious?”
an4.197:6.1	“Take a female who is irritable and bad-tempered.
an4.197:6.2	Even when criticized a little bit she loses her temper, becoming annoyed, hostile, and hard-hearted, and displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness.
an4.197:6.3	She doesn’t give to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting.
an4.197:6.4	And she’s jealous,
an4.197:6.5	envying, resenting, and begrudging the possessions, honor, respect, reverence, homage, and veneration given to others.
an4.197:6.6	If she comes back to this state of existence after passing away, wherever she is reborn she’s ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking;
an4.197:6.7	and poor, with few assets and possessions; and insignificant.
an4.197:7.1	Take another female who is irritable and bad-tempered. …
an4.197:7.2	NA
an4.197:7.3	But she does give to ascetics or brahmins …
an4.197:7.4	And she’s not jealous …
an4.197:7.5	NA
an4.197:7.6	If she comes back to this state of existence after passing away, wherever she is reborn she’s ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking;
an4.197:7.7	but rich, affluent, wealthy, and illustrious.
an4.197:8.1	Take another female who isn’t irritable and bad-tempered. …
an4.197:8.2	NA
an4.197:8.3	But she doesn’t give to ascetics or brahmins …
an4.197:8.4	And she’s jealous …
an4.197:8.5	NA
an4.197:8.6	If she comes back to this state of existence after passing away, wherever she is reborn she’s attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty;
an4.197:8.7	but poor, with few assets and possessions; and insignificant.
an4.197:9.1	Take another female who isn’t irritable and bad-tempered. …
an4.197:9.2	NA
an4.197:9.3	She gives to ascetics and brahmins …
an4.197:9.4	And she’s not jealous …
an4.197:9.5	NA
an4.197:9.6	If she comes back to this state of existence after passing away, wherever she is reborn she’s attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty;
an4.197:9.7	and rich, affluent, wealthy, and illustrious.
an4.197:10.1	This is why are some females are ugly …
an4.197:10.2	and poor … and insignificant.
an4.197:10.3	And some females are ugly …
an4.197:10.4	but rich … and illustrious.
an4.197:10.5	And some females are attractive …
an4.197:10.6	but poor … and insignificant.
an4.197:10.7	And some females are attractive …
an4.197:10.8	and rich … and illustrious.”
an4.197:11.1	When this was said, Queen Mallikā said to the Buddha:
an4.197:11.2	“Sir, in another life I must have been irritable and bad-tempered.
an4.197:11.3	Even when lightly criticized I must have lost my temper, becoming annoyed, hostile, and hard-hearted, and displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness.
an4.197:11.4	For now I am ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking.
an4.197:12.1	In another life I must have given to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. For now I am rich, affluent, and wealthy.
an4.197:13.1	In another life, I must not have been jealous, envying, resenting, and begrudging the possessions, honor, respect, reverence, homage, and veneration given to others. For now I am illustrious.
an4.197:13.2	In this royal court I command maidens of the aristocrats, brahmins, and householders.
an4.197:13.3	So, sir, from this day forth I will not be irritable and bad-tempered.
an4.197:13.4	Even when heavily criticized I won’t lose my temper, become annoyed, hostile, and hard-hearted, or display annoyance, hate, and bitterness.
an4.197:13.5	I will give to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting.
an4.197:13.6	I will not be jealous, envying, resenting, and begrudging the possessions, honor, respect, reverence, homage, and veneration given to others.
an4.197:13.7	Excellent, sir! … From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

an4.198:0.2	20. The Great Chapter
an4.198:0.3	198. Self-mortification
an4.198:1.1	“Mendicants, these four people are found in the world.
an4.198:1.2	What four?
an4.198:1.3	One person mortifies themselves, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves.
an4.198:1.4	One person mortifies others, pursuing the practice of mortifying others.
an4.198:1.5	One person mortifies themselves and others, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves and others.
an4.198:1.6	One person neither mortifies themselves nor others, pursuing the practice of not mortifying themselves or others.
an4.198:1.7	They live without wishes in the present life, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, having become holy in themselves.
an4.198:2.1	And how does one person mortify themselves, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves?
an4.198:2.2	It’s when someone goes naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on purpose for them, or an invitation for a meal.
an4.198:2.3	They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who has a man in her home; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or liquor or wine, and drink no beer.
an4.198:2.4	They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls.
an4.198:2.5	They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day.
an4.198:2.6	They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live pursuing the practice of eating food at set intervals.
an4.198:3.1	They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.
an4.198:4.1	They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings.
an4.198:4.2	They tear out hair and beard, pursuing this practice.
an4.198:4.3	They constantly stand, refusing seats.
an4.198:4.4	They squat, committed to the endeavor of squatting.
an4.198:4.5	They lie on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns their bed.
an4.198:4.6	They pursue the practice of immersion in water three times a day, including the evening.
an4.198:4.7	And so they live pursuing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body.
an4.198:4.8	That’s how one person mortifies themselves, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves.
an4.198:5.1	And how does one person mortify others, pursuing the practice of mortifying others?
an4.198:5.2	It’s when a person is a slaughterer of sheep, pigs, poultry, or deer, a hunter or fisher, a bandit, an executioner, a butcher of cattle, a jailer, or has some other cruel livelihood.
an4.198:5.3	That’s how one person mortifies others, pursuing the practice of mortifying others.
an4.198:6.1	And how does one person mortify themselves and others, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves and others?
an4.198:6.2	It’s when a person is an anointed aristocratic king or a well-to-do brahmin.
an4.198:6.3	He has a new temple built to the east of the city. He shaves off his hair and beard, dresses in a rough antelope hide, and smears his body with ghee and oil. Scratching his back with antlers, he enters the temple with his chief queen and the brahmin high priest.
an4.198:6.4	There he lies on the bare ground strewn with grass.
an4.198:6.5	The king feeds on the milk from one teat of a cow that has a calf of the same color. The chief queen feeds on the milk from the second teat. The brahmin high priest feeds on the milk from the third teat. The milk from the fourth teat is served to the sacred flame. The calf feeds on the remainder.
an4.198:6.6	He says:
an4.198:6.7	‘Slaughter this many bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, rams, and horses for the sacrifice! Fell this many trees and reap this much grass for the sacrificial equipment!’
an4.198:6.8	His bondservants, workers, and staff do their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping, with tearful faces.
an4.198:6.9	That’s how one person mortifies themselves and others, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves and others.
an4.198:7.1	And how does one person neither mortify themselves nor others, pursuing the practice of not mortifying themselves or others,
an4.198:7.2	living without wishes in the present life, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, having become holy in themselves?
an4.198:7.3	It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.
an4.198:7.4	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.
an4.198:7.5	He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
an4.198:7.6	A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in some good family.
an4.198:7.7	They gain faith in the Realized One,
an4.198:7.8	and reflect:
an4.198:7.9	‘Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open.
an4.198:7.10	It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.
an4.198:7.11	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’
an4.198:7.12	After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
an4.198:8.1	Once they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings.
an4.198:8.2	They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving.
an4.198:8.3	They give up unchastity. They are celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex.
an4.198:8.4	They give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and trustworthy, and don’t trick the world with their words.
an4.198:8.5	They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.
an4.198:8.6	They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable, and agreeable to the people.
an4.198:8.7	They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.
an4.198:9.1	They refrain from injuring plants and seeds.
an4.198:9.2	They eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time.
an4.198:9.3	They refrain from dancing, singing, music, and seeing shows.
an4.198:9.4	They refrain from beautifying and adorning themselves with garlands, fragrance, and makeup.
an4.198:9.5	They refrain from high and luxurious beds.
an4.198:9.6	They refrain from receiving gold and money,
an4.198:9.7	raw grains,
an4.198:9.8	raw meat,
an4.198:9.9	women and girls,
an4.198:9.10	male and female bondservants,
an4.198:9.11	goats and sheep,
an4.198:9.12	chickens and pigs,
an4.198:9.13	elephants, cows, horses, and mares,
an4.198:9.14	and fields and land.
an4.198:9.15	They refrain from running errands and messages;
an4.198:9.16	buying and selling;
an4.198:9.17	falsifying weights, metals, or measures;
an4.198:9.18	bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity;
an4.198:9.19	mutilation, murder, abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence.
an4.198:10.1	They’re content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.
an4.198:10.2	They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden.
an4.198:10.3	In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.
an4.198:10.4	When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves.
an4.198:11.1	Seeing a sight with the eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
an4.198:11.2	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving restraint over it.
an4.198:11.3	Hearing a sound with the ears …
an4.198:11.4	Smelling an odor with the nose …
an4.198:11.5	Tasting a flavor with the tongue …
an4.198:11.6	Feeling a touch with the body …
an4.198:11.7	Knowing a thought with the mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
an4.198:11.8	If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving restraint over it.
an4.198:11.9	When they have this noble sense restraint, they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves.
an4.198:12.1	They act with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.
an4.198:13.1	When they have this noble spectrum of ethics, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness,
an4.198:13.2	they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.
an4.198:13.3	After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there.
an4.198:13.4	Giving up desire for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of desire, cleansing the mind of desire.
an4.198:13.5	Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will.
an4.198:13.6	Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness.
an4.198:13.7	Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.
an4.198:13.8	Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.
an4.198:13.9	They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.
an4.198:13.10	Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.
an4.198:14.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives …
an4.198:14.2	knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings …
an4.198:14.3	knowledge of the ending of defilements.
an4.198:14.4	They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
an4.198:14.5	They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.
an4.198:15.1	Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.
an4.198:15.2	When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
an4.198:15.3	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’
an4.198:15.4	That’s how one person neither mortifies themselves nor others, pursuing the practice of not mortifying themselves or others,
an4.198:15.5	living without wishes in the present life, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, having become holy in themselves.
an4.198:15.6	These are the four people found in the world.”

an4.199:0.2	20. The Great Chapter
an4.199:0.3	199. Craving, the Weaver
an4.199:1.1	The Buddha said this:
an4.199:1.2	“Mendicants, I will teach you about craving—the weaver, the migrant, the creeping, the clinging. This world is choked by it, engulfed by it. It makes the world tangled like yarn, knotted like a ball of thread, and matted like rushes and reeds, not escaping the places of loss, the bad places, the underworld, transmigration.
an4.199:1.3	Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an4.199:1.4	“Yes, sir,” they replied.
an4.199:1.5	The Buddha said this:
an4.199:2.1	“And what is that craving …?
an4.199:2.2	There are eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior, and eighteen that derive from the exterior.
an4.199:3.1	What are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior?
an4.199:3.2	When there is the concept ‘I am’, there are the concepts ‘I am such’, ‘I am thus’, ‘I am otherwise’; ‘I am fleeting’, ‘I am lasting’; ‘mine’, ‘such is mine’, ‘thus is mine’, ‘otherwise is mine’; ‘also mine’, ‘such is also mine’, ‘thus is also mine’, ‘otherwise is also mine’; ‘I will be’, ‘I will be such’, ‘I will be thus’, ‘I will be otherwise’.
an4.199:3.3	These are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior.
an4.199:4.1	What are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the exterior?
an4.199:4.2	When there is the concept ‘I am because of this’, there are the concepts ‘I am such because of this’, ‘I am thus because of this’, ‘I am otherwise because of this’; ‘I am fleeting because of this’, ‘I am lasting because of this’; ‘mine because of this’, ‘such is mine because of this’, ‘thus is mine because of this’, ‘otherwise is mine because of this’; ‘also mine because of this’, ‘such is also mine because of this’, ‘thus is also mine because of this’, ‘otherwise is also mine because of this’; ‘I will be because of this’, ‘I will be such because of this’, ‘I will be thus because of this’, ‘I will be otherwise because of this’.
an4.199:4.3	These are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the exterior.
an4.199:5.1	So there are eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior, and eighteen that derive from the exterior.
an4.199:5.2	These are called the thirty-six currents of craving.
an4.199:5.3	Each of these pertain to the past, future, and present,
an4.199:5.4	making one hundred and eight currents of craving.
an4.199:6.1	This is that craving—the weaver, the migrant, the creeping, the clinging. This world is choked by it, engulfed by it. It makes the world tangled like yarn, knotted like a ball of thread, and matted like rushes and reeds, not escaping the places of loss, the bad places, the underworld, transmigration.”

an4.200:1.2	What four?
an4.200:1.3	Love is born of love,
an4.200:1.4	hate is born of love,
an4.200:1.5	love is born of hate, and
an4.200:1.6	hate is born of hate.
an4.200:2.1	And how is love born of love?
an4.200:2.2	It’s when someone likes, loves, and cares for a person.
an4.200:2.3	Others treat that person with liking, love, and care.
an4.200:2.4	They think:
an4.200:2.5	‘These others like the person I like.’
an4.200:2.6	And so love for them springs up.
an4.200:2.7	That’s how love is born of love.
an4.200:3.1	And how is hate born of love?
an4.200:3.2	It’s when someone likes, loves, and cares for a person.
an4.200:3.3	Others treat that person with disliking, loathing, and detestation.
an4.200:3.4	They think:
an4.200:3.5	‘These others dislike the person I like.’
an4.200:3.6	And so hate for them springs up.
an4.200:3.7	That’s how hate is born of love.
an4.200:4.1	And how is love born of hate?
an4.200:4.2	It’s when someone dislikes, loathes, and detests a person.
an4.200:4.3	Others treat that person with disliking, loathing, and detestation.
an4.200:4.4	They think:
an4.200:4.5	‘These others dislike the person I dislike.’

an4.200:5.1	And how is hate born of hate?
an4.200:5.2	It’s when someone dislikes, loathes, and detests a person.
an4.200:5.3	Others treat that person with liking, love, and care.
an4.200:5.4	They think:
an4.200:5.5	‘These others like the person I dislike.’
an4.200:5.6	And so hate for them springs up.
an4.200:5.7	That’s how hate is born of hate.
an4.200:5.8	These are the four things that are born of love and hate.
an4.200:6.1	A time comes when a mendicant … enters and remains in the first absorption.
an4.200:6.2	At that time they have no love born of love, hate born of love, love born of hate, or hate born of hate.
an4.200:7.1	A time comes when a mendicant … enters and remains in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.
an4.200:7.2	At that time they have no love born of love, hate born of love, love born of hate, or hate born of hate.
an4.200:8.1	A time comes when a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
an4.200:8.2	At that time any love born of love, hate born of love, love born of hate, or hate born of hate is given up, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
an4.200:8.3	This is called a mendicant who doesn’t draw close or push back or fume or ignite or burn up.
an4.200:9.1	And how does a mendicant draw close?
an4.200:9.2	It’s when a mendicant regards form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.
an4.200:9.3	They regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in feeling.
an4.200:9.4	They regard perception as self, self as having perception, perception in self, or self in perception.
an4.200:9.5	They regard choices as self, self as having choices, choices in self, or self in choices.
an4.200:9.6	They regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.
an4.200:9.7	That’s how a mendicant draws close.
an4.200:10.1	And how does a mendicant not draw close?
an4.200:10.2	It’s when a mendicant doesn’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.
an4.200:10.3	They don’t regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in feeling.
an4.200:10.4	They don’t regard perception as self, self as having perception, perception in self, or self in perception.
an4.200:10.5	They don’t regard choices as self, self as having choices, choices in self, or self in choices.
an4.200:10.6	They don’t regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.
an4.200:10.7	That’s how a mendicant doesn’t draw close.
an4.200:11.1	And how does a mendicant push back?
an4.200:11.2	It’s when someone abuses, annoys, or argues with a mendicant, and the mendicant abuses, annoys, or argues back at them.
an4.200:11.3	That’s how a mendicant pushes back.
an4.200:12.1	And how does a mendicant not push back?
an4.200:12.2	It’s when someone abuses, annoys, or argues with a mendicant, and the mendicant doesn’t abuse, annoy, or argue back at them.
an4.200:12.3	That’s how a mendicant doesn’t push back.
an4.200:13.1	And how does a mendicant fume?
an4.200:13.2	When there is the concept ‘I am’, there are the concepts ‘I am such’, ‘I am thus’, ‘I am otherwise’; ‘I am fleeting’, ‘I am lasting’; ‘mine’, ‘such is mine’, ‘thus is mine’, ‘otherwise is mine’; ‘also mine’, ‘such is also mine’, ‘thus is also mine’, ‘otherwise is also mine’; ‘I will be’, ‘I will be such’, ‘I will be thus’, ‘I will be otherwise’.
an4.200:13.3	That’s how a mendicant fumes.
an4.200:14.1	And how does a mendicant not fume?
an4.200:14.2	When there is no concept ‘I am’, there are no concepts ‘I am such’, ‘I am thus’, ‘I am otherwise’; ‘I am fleeting’, ‘I am lasting’; ‘mine’, ‘such is mine’, ‘thus is mine’, ‘otherwise is mine’; ‘also mine’, ‘such is also mine’, ‘thus is also mine’, ‘otherwise is also mine’; ‘I will be’, ‘I will be such’, ‘I will be thus’, ‘I will be otherwise’.
an4.200:14.3	That’s how a mendicant doesn’t fume.
an4.200:15.1	And how is a mendicant ignited?
an4.200:15.2	When there is the concept ‘I am because of this’, there are the concepts ‘I am such because of this’, ‘I am thus because of this’, ‘I am otherwise because of this’; ‘I am fleeting because of this’, ‘I am lasting because of this’; ‘mine because of this’, ‘such is mine because of this’, ‘thus is mine because of this’, ‘otherwise is mine because of this’; ‘also mine because of this’, ‘such is also mine because of this’, ‘thus is also mine because of this’, ‘otherwise is also mine because of this’; ‘I will be because of this’, ‘I will be such because of this’, ‘I will be thus because of this’, ‘I will be otherwise because of this’.
an4.200:15.3	That’s how a mendicant is ignited.
an4.200:16.1	And how is a mendicant not ignited?
an4.200:16.2	When there is no concept ‘I am because of this’, there are no concepts ‘I am such because of this’, ‘I am thus because of this’, ‘I am otherwise because of this’; ‘I am fleeting because of this’, ‘I am lasting because of this’; ‘mine because of this’, ‘such is mine because of this’, ‘thus is mine because of this’, ‘otherwise is mine because of this’; ‘also mine because of this’, ‘such is also mine because of this’, ‘thus is also mine because of this’, ‘otherwise is also mine because of this’; ‘I will be because of this’, ‘I will be such because of this’, ‘I will be thus because of this’, ‘I will be otherwise because of this’.
an4.200:16.3	That’s how a mendicant is not ignited.
an4.200:17.1	And how does a mendicant burn up?
an4.200:17.2	It’s when a mendicant hasn’t given up the conceit ‘I am’, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future.
an4.200:17.3	That’s how a mendicant is burned up.

an4.241:2.1	And who is the first ascetic?
an4.241:2.2	It’s a mendicant who—with the ending of three fetters—is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.
an4.241:2.3	This is the first ascetic.
an4.241:3.1	And who is the second ascetic?
an4.241:3.2	It’s a mendicant who—with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion—is a once-returner. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.
an4.241:3.3	This is the second ascetic.
an4.241:4.1	And who is the third ascetic?
an4.241:4.2	It’s a mendicant who—with the ending of the five lower fetters—is reborn spontaneously. They’re extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.

an4.243:1.2	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,
an4.243:1.3	“Well, Ānanda, has that disciplinary issue been settled yet?”
an4.243:1.4	“How could it be, sir?
an4.243:1.5	Venerable Anuruddha’s pupil Bāhiya remains entirely committed to creating a schism in the Saṅgha.
an4.243:1.6	But Anuruddha doesn’t think to say a single word about it.”

an4.243:3.1	A bad monk sees four reasons to relish schism in the Saṅgha.

an4.243:3.4	He thinks:
an4.243:3.5	‘Suppose the monks know that I’m a bad monk …
an4.243:3.6	If they’re in harmony, they’ll expel me,
an4.243:3.7	but if they’re divided they won’t.’
an4.243:3.8	A bad monk sees this as the first reason to relish schism in the Saṅgha.
an4.243:4.1	Furthermore, a bad monk has wrong view, he’s attached to an extremist view.
an4.243:4.2	He thinks:
an4.243:4.3	‘Suppose the monks know that I have wrong view …
an4.243:4.4	If they’re in harmony they’ll expel me,

an4.245:1.1	“Mendicants, this spiritual life is lived with training as its benefit, with wisdom as its overseer, with freedom as its core, and with mindfulness as its ruler.
an4.245:1.2	And how is training its benefit?
an4.245:1.3	Firstly, I laid down for my disciples the training that deals with supplementary regulations in order to inspire confidence in those without it and to increase confidence in those who have it.
an4.245:1.4	They undertake whatever supplementary regulations I have laid down, keeping them unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred.
an4.245:2.1	Furthermore, I laid down for my disciples the training that deals with the fundamentals of the spiritual life in order to rightly end suffering in every way.
an4.245:2.2	They undertake whatever training that deals with the fundamentals of the spiritual life I have laid down, keeping it unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred.
an4.245:2.3	That’s how training is its benefit.
an4.245:3.1	And how is wisdom its overseer?
an4.245:3.2	I taught the Dhamma to my disciples in order to rightly end suffering in every way.
an4.245:3.3	They examine with wisdom any teachings I taught them.
an4.245:3.4	That’s how wisdom is its overseer.
an4.245:4.1	And how is freedom its core?
an4.245:4.2	I taught the Dhamma to my disciples in order to rightly end suffering in every way.
an4.245:4.3	They experience through freedom any teachings I taught them.
an4.245:4.4	That’s how freedom is its core.
an4.245:5.1	And how is mindfulness its ruler?
an4.245:5.2	Mindfulness is well established in oneself: ‘In this way I’ll fulfill the training dealing with supplementary regulations, or support with wisdom in every situation the training dealing with supplementary regulations I’ve already fulfilled.’
an4.245:5.3	Mindfulness is well established in oneself: ‘In this way I’ll fulfill the training dealing with the fundamentals of the spiritual life, or support with wisdom in every situation the training dealing with the fundamentals of the spiritual life I’ve already fulfilled.’
an4.245:5.4	Mindfulness is well established in oneself: ‘In this way I’ll examine with wisdom the teaching that I haven’t yet examined, or support with wisdom in every situation the teaching I’ve already examined.’
an4.245:5.5	Mindfulness is well established in oneself: ‘In this way I’ll experience through freedom the teaching that I haven’t yet experienced, or support with wisdom in every situation the teaching I’ve already experienced.’
an4.245:5.6	That’s how mindfulness is its ruler.
an4.245:5.7	‘This spiritual life is lived with training as its benefit, with wisdom as its overseer, with freedom as its core, and with mindfulness as its ruler.’
an4.245:5.8	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.”

an4.246:1.2	What four?
an4.246:1.3	The ways a corpse, a pleasure seeker, a lion, and a Realized One lie down.
an4.246:1.4	And how does a corpse lie down?
an4.246:1.5	Corpses usually lie flat on their backs.
an4.246:1.6	This is called the way a corpse lies down.
an4.246:2.1	And how does a pleasure seeker lie down?
an4.246:2.2	Pleasure seekers usually lie down on their left side.
an4.246:2.3	This is called the way a pleasure seeker lies down.
an4.246:3.1	And how does a lion lie down?
an4.246:3.2	The lion, king of beasts, lies down on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other, with his tail tucked between his thighs.
an4.246:3.3	When he wakes, he lifts his front quarters and checks his hind quarters.
an4.246:3.4	If he sees that any part of his body is disordered or displaced, he is displeased.
an4.246:3.5	But if he sees that no part of his body is disordered or displaced, he is pleased.
an4.246:3.6	This is called the way a lion lies down.
an4.246:4.1	And how does a Realized One lie down?
an4.246:4.2	It’s when a Realized One, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.
an4.246:4.3	This is called the way a Realized One lies down.

an4.257:1.1	Then Venerable Māluṅkyaputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an4.257:2.1	“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.”
an4.257:2.2	“Well now, Māluṅkyaputta, what are we to say to the young monks,
an4.257:2.3	when even an old man like you, elderly and senior, asks the Realized One for brief advice?”
an4.257:2.4	“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief! May the Holy One teach me the Dhamma in brief! Hopefully I can understand the meaning of what the Buddha says! Hopefully I can be an heir of the Buddha’s teaching!”
an4.257:3.1	“Māluṅkyaputta, there are four things that give rise to craving in a mendicant.
an4.257:3.2	What four?
an4.257:3.3	For the sake of robes,
an4.257:3.4	almsfood,
an4.257:3.5	lodgings,
an4.257:3.6	or rebirth in this or that state.
an4.257:3.7	These are the four things that give rise to craving in a mendicant.
an4.257:3.8	That craving is given up by a mendicant, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. Then they’re called a mendicant who has cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of suffering.”
an4.257:4.1	When Māluṅkyaputta had been given this advice by the Buddha, he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
an4.257:4.2	Then Māluṅkyaputta, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
an4.257:4.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”

an5.1:0.3	1. In Brief
an5.1:1.1	So I have heard.
an5.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an5.1:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
an5.1:1.4	“Mendicants!”
an5.1:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.
an5.1:1.6	The Buddha said this:
an5.1:2.1	“Mendicants, there are these five powers of a trainee.
an5.1:2.2	What five?
an5.1:2.3	The powers of faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom.
an5.1:2.4	These are the five powers of a trainee.
an5.1:3.1	So you should train like this:
an5.1:3.2	‘We will have the trainee’s powers of faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom.’
an5.1:3.3	That’s how you should train.”
an5.1:3.4	That is what the Buddha said.
an5.1:3.5	Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.

an5.2:1.1	“Mendicants, there are these five powers of a trainee.
an5.2:1.2	What five?
an5.2:1.3	The powers of faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom.
an5.2:2.1	And what is the power of faith?
an5.2:2.2	It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:
an5.2:2.3	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
an5.2:2.4	This is called the power of faith.
an5.2:3.1	And what is the power of conscience?
an5.2:3.2	It’s when a noble disciple has a conscience. They’re conscientious about bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and conscientious about having any bad, unskillful qualities.
an5.2:3.3	This is called the power of conscience.
an5.2:4.1	And what is the power of prudence?
an5.2:4.2	It’s when a noble disciple is prudent. They’re prudent when it comes to bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and prudent when it comes to acquiring any bad, unskillful qualities.
an5.2:4.3	This is called the power of prudence.
an5.2:5.1	And what is the power of energy?
an5.2:5.2	It’s when a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.
an5.2:5.3	This is called the power of energy.
an5.2:6.1	And what is the power of wisdom?
an5.2:6.2	It’s when a noble disciple is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.
an5.2:6.3	This is called the power of wisdom.
an5.2:6.4	These are the five powers of a trainee.
an5.2:7.1	So you should train like this:
an5.2:7.2	‘We will have the trainee’s powers of faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom.’

an5.7:1.1	“Mendicants, sentient beings are mostly charmed by sensual pleasures.
an5.7:1.2	When a gentleman has abandoned the scythe and flail and gone forth from the lay life to homelessness, they’re qualified to be called ‘a faithful renunciate from a good family’.
an5.7:1.3	Why is that?
an5.7:1.4	Because a youth can get sensual pleasures of this kind or that.
an5.7:1.5	Now, all sensual pleasures are just reckoned as ‘sensual pleasures’, regardless of whether they’re inferior, average, or superior.
an5.7:1.6	Suppose there was a little baby boy who, because of his nurse’s negligence, puts a stick or stone in his mouth.
an5.7:1.7	The nurse would very quickly notice
an5.7:1.8	and try to take it out.
an5.7:1.9	If that didn’t work, she’d cradle his head with her left hand, and take it out using a hooked finger of her right hand, even if it drew blood.
an5.7:1.10	Why is that?
an5.7:1.11	I admit she’d know, ‘This will distress the child,
an5.7:1.12	there’s no denying.’
an5.7:1.13	Still, it should be done by a nurse who wants what’s best for him, out of kindness and compassion.
an5.7:1.14	And when the boy has grown up and has enough sense, his nurse would not worry about him, thinking:
an5.7:1.15	‘The boy can look after himself. He won’t be negligent.’
an5.7:2.1	In the same way, I still need to look after a mendicant who hasn’t finished developing faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom regarding skillful qualities.
an5.7:2.2	But when a mendicant has finished developing faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom regarding skillful qualities, I need not be concerned, thinking:

an5.28:1.1	“Mendicants, I will teach you how to develop noble right immersion with five factors.
an5.28:1.2	Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an5.28:1.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.
an5.28:1.4	The Buddha said this:
an5.28:2.1	“And how do you develop noble right immersion with five factors?
an5.28:2.2	Firstly, a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption. It has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an5.28:2.3	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.
an5.28:2.4	It’s like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out.
an5.28:2.5	In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.
an5.28:2.6	There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.
an5.28:2.7	This is the first way to develop noble right immersion with five factors.
an5.28:3.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption. It has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an5.28:3.2	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion.
an5.28:3.3	There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion.
an5.28:3.4	It’s like a deep lake fed by spring water. There’s no inlet to the east, west, north, or south, and no rainfall to replenish it from time to time.
an5.28:3.5	But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads throughout the lake. There’s no part of the lake that’s not spread through with cool water.
an5.28:3.6	In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion.
an5.28:3.7	There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion.
an5.28:3.8	This is the second way to develop noble right immersion with five factors.
an5.28:4.1	Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption. They meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
an5.28:4.2	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with bliss free of rapture.
an5.28:4.3	There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture.
an5.28:4.4	It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater.
an5.28:4.5	From the tip to the root they’re drenched, steeped, filled, and soaked with cool water.
an5.28:4.6	There’s no part of them that’s not spread through with cool water.
an5.28:4.7	In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture.
an5.28:4.8	There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture.
an5.28:4.9	This is the third way to develop noble right immersion with five factors.
an5.28:5.1	Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption. It is without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
an5.28:5.2	They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind.
an5.28:5.3	There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind.
an5.28:5.4	It’s like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth.
an5.28:5.5	There’s no part of the body that’s not spread over with white cloth.
an5.28:5.6	In the same way, they sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind.
an5.28:5.7	There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind.
an5.28:5.8	This is the fourth way to develop noble right immersion with five factors.
an5.28:6.1	Furthermore, the meditation that is a foundation for reviewing is properly grasped, attended, borne in mind, and comprehended with wisdom by a mendicant.
an5.28:6.2	It’s like when someone views someone else. Someone standing might view someone sitting, or someone sitting might view someone lying down.
an5.28:6.3	In the same way, the meditation that is a foundation for reviewing is properly grasped, attended, borne in mind, and comprehended with wisdom by a mendicant.
an5.28:6.4	This is the fifth way to develop noble right immersion with five factors.
an5.28:7.1	When the noble right immersion with five factors is cultivated in this way, a mendicant becomes capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind, in each and every case.
an5.28:8.1	Suppose a water jar was placed on a stand, full to the brim so a crow could drink from it.
an5.28:8.2	If a strong man was to tip it any which way, would water pour out?”
an5.28:8.3	“Yes, sir.”
an5.28:8.4	“In the same way, when noble right immersion with five factors is cultivated in this way, a mendicant becomes capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind, in each and every case.
an5.28:9.1	Suppose there was a square, walled lotus pond on level ground, full to the brim so a crow could drink from it.
an5.28:9.2	If a strong man was to open the wall on any side, would water pour out?”
an5.28:9.3	“Yes, sir.”
an5.28:9.4	“In the same way, when noble right immersion with five factors is cultivated in this way, a mendicant becomes capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind, in each and every case.
an5.28:10.1	Suppose a chariot stood harnessed to thoroughbreds at a level crossroads, with a goad ready.
an5.28:10.2	Then a deft horse trainer, a master charioteer, might mount the chariot, taking the reins in his right hand and goad in the left. He’d drive out and back wherever he wishes, whenever he wishes.
an5.28:10.3	In the same way, when noble right immersion with five factors is cultivated in this way,
an5.28:10.4	a mendicant becomes capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind, in each and every case.
an5.28:11.1	If you wish: ‘May I wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying myself and becoming one again … controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm.’
an5.28:11.2	You’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case.
an5.28:12.1	If you wish: ‘With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, may I hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.’
an5.28:12.2	You’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case.

an5.28:13.17	and unfreed mind as “unfreed mind”.’
an5.28:13.18	You’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case.
an5.28:14.1	If you wish: ‘May I recollect many kinds of past lives, with features and details.’
an5.28:14.2	You’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case.
an5.28:15.1	If you wish: ‘With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, may I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn according to their deeds.’
an5.28:15.2	You’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case.
an5.28:16.1	If you wish: ‘May I realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.’

an5.30:1.1	So I have heard.
an5.30:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Icchānaṅgala.
an5.30:1.3	He stayed in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.
an5.30:1.4	The brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala heard:
an5.30:1.5	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala. He is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.
an5.30:1.6	He has this good reputation:
an5.30:1.7	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
an5.30:1.8	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.
an5.30:1.9	He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
an5.30:1.10	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”
an5.30:1.11	Then, when the night had passed, they took many different foods and went to the forest near Icchānaṅgala, where they stood outside the gates making a dreadful racket.
an5.30:2.1	Now, at that time Venerable Nāgita was the Buddha’s attendant.
an5.30:2.2	Then the Buddha said to Nāgita,
an5.30:2.3	“Nāgita, who’s making that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”
an5.30:2.4	“Sir, it’s these brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala. They’ve brought many different foods, and they’re standing outside the gates wanting to offer it specially to the Buddha and the mendicant Saṅgha.”
an5.30:2.5	“Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to me.
an5.30:2.6	There are those who can’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can.
an5.30:2.7	Let them enjoy the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity.”
an5.30:3.1	“Sir, may the Blessed One please relent now! May the Holy One relent!
an5.30:3.2	Now is the time for the Buddha to relent.
an5.30:3.3	Wherever the Buddha now goes, the brahmins and householders will incline the same way, as will the people of town and country.
an5.30:3.4	It’s like when it rains heavily and the water flows downhill.
an5.30:3.5	In the same way, wherever the Buddha now goes, the brahmins and householders will incline the same way, as will the people of town and country.
an5.30:3.6	Why is that?
an5.30:3.7	Because of the Buddha’s ethics and wisdom.”
an5.30:4.1	“Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to me.
an5.30:4.2	There are those who can’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can.
an5.30:4.3	Let them enjoy the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity.
an5.30:4.4	What you eat, drink, chew, and taste ends up as excrement and urine.
an5.30:4.5	This is its outcome.
an5.30:4.6	When loved ones decay and perish, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress arise.
an5.30:4.7	This is its outcome.
an5.30:4.8	When you pursue meditation on the feature of ugliness, revulsion at the feature of beauty becomes stabilized.
an5.30:4.9	This is its outcome.
an5.30:4.10	When you meditate observing impermanence in the six fields of contact, revulsion at contact becomes stabilized.
an5.30:4.11	This is its outcome.
an5.30:4.12	When you meditate observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates, revulsion at grasping becomes stabilized.

an5.31:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an5.31:1.2	Then Princess Sumanā, escorted by five hundred chariots and five hundred royal maidens, went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an5.31:2.1	“Sir, suppose there were two disciples equal in faith, ethics, and wisdom.
an5.31:2.2	One is a giver, one is not.
an5.31:2.3	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
an5.31:2.4	When they have become gods, would there be any distinction or difference between them?”
an5.31:3.1	“There would be, Sumanā,” said the Buddha.
an5.31:3.2	“As a god, the one who was a giver would surpass the other in five respects:
an5.31:3.3	divine lifespan, beauty, happiness, fame, and sovereignty.
an5.31:3.4	As a god, the one who was a giver would surpass the other in these five respects.”
an5.31:4.1	“But sir, if they pass away from there and come back to this state of existence as human beings, would there still be any distinction or difference between them?”
an5.31:4.2	“There would be, Sumanā,” said the Buddha.
an5.31:4.3	“As a human being, the one who was a giver would surpass the other in five respects:
an5.31:4.4	human lifespan, beauty, happiness, fame, and sovereignty.
an5.31:4.5	As a human being, the one who was a giver would surpass the other in these five respects.”
an5.31:5.1	“But sir, if they both go forth from the lay life to homelessness, would there still be any distinction or difference between them?”
an5.31:5.2	“There would be, Sumanā,” said the Buddha.
an5.31:5.3	“As a renunciate, the one who was a giver would surpass the other in five respects.
an5.31:5.4	They’d usually use only what they’ve been invited to accept—robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—rarely using them without invitation.
an5.31:5.5	When living with other spiritual practitioners, they usually treat them agreeably by way of body, speech, and mind, rarely disagreeably.
an5.31:5.6	As a renunciate, the one who was a giver would surpass the other in these five respects.”
an5.31:6.1	“But sir, if they both attain perfection, as perfected ones would there still be any distinction or difference between them?”
an5.31:6.2	“In that case, I say there is no difference between the freedom of one and the freedom of the other.”
an5.31:7.1	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!
an5.31:7.2	Just this much is quite enough to justify giving gifts and making merit.
an5.31:7.3	For merit is helpful for those who have become gods, human beings, and renunciates.”
an5.31:7.4	“That’s so true, Sumanā.
an5.31:7.5	It’s quite enough to justify giving gifts and making merit.
an5.31:7.6	For merit is helpful for those who have become gods, human beings, and renunciates.”
an5.31:8.1	That is what the Buddha said.
an5.31:8.2	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:
an5.31:9.1	“The moon so immaculate,
an5.31:9.2	journeying across the dimension of space;
an5.31:9.3	outshines with its radiance
an5.31:9.4	all the world’s stars.
an5.31:10.1	So too, a faithful individual,
an5.31:10.2	perfect in ethics,
an5.31:10.3	outshines with their generosity
an5.31:10.4	all the world’s stingy people.
an5.31:11.1	The thundering rain cloud,
an5.31:11.2	its hundred peaks wreathed in lightning,
an5.31:11.3	pours down over the rich earth,
an5.31:11.4	soaking the uplands and valleys.
an5.31:12.1	Even so, an astute person accomplished in vision,
an5.31:12.2	a disciple of the fully awakened Buddha,
an5.31:12.3	surpasses a stingy person
an5.31:12.4	in five respects:
an5.31:13.1	long life and fame,
an5.31:13.2	beauty and happiness.
an5.31:13.3	Lavished with riches,
an5.31:13.4	they depart to rejoice in heaven.”

an5.32:0.3	32. With Cundī
an5.32:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
an5.32:1.2	Then Princess Cundī, escorted by five hundred chariots and five hundred royal maidens, went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an5.32:2.1	“Sir, my brother, Prince Cunda, says this:
an5.32:2.2	‘Take a woman or man who goes for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. Only then do they get reborn in a good place, not a bad place, when their body breaks up, after death.’
an5.32:2.3	And so I ask the Buddha:
an5.32:2.4	Sir, what kind of teacher should you have confidence in so as to be reborn in a good place, not a bad place, when the body breaks up, after death?
an5.32:2.5	Sir, what kind of teaching should you have confidence in so as to be reborn in a good place, not a bad place, when the body breaks up, after death?
an5.32:2.6	Sir, what kind of Saṅgha should you have confidence in so as to be reborn in a good place, not a bad place, when the body breaks up, after death?
an5.32:2.7	Sir, what kind of ethics should you fulfill so as to be reborn in a good place, not a bad place, when the body breaks up, after death?”
an5.32:3.1	“Cundī, the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, is said to be the best of all sentient beings—be they footless, with two feet, four feet, or many feet; with form or formless; with perception or without perception or with neither perception nor non-perception.
an5.32:3.2	Those who have confidence in the Buddha have confidence in the best.
an5.32:3.3	Having confidence in the best, the result is the best.
an5.32:4.1	The noble eightfold path is said to be the best of all conditioned things.
an5.32:4.2	Those who have confidence in the noble eightfold path have confidence in the best. Having confidence in the best, the result is the best.
an5.32:5.1	Fading away is said to be the best of all things whether conditioned or unconditioned.
an5.32:5.2	That is, the quelling of vanity, the removing of thirst, the uprooting of clinging, the breaking of the round, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.
an5.32:5.3	Those who have confidence in the teaching of fading away have confidence in the best.
an5.32:5.4	Having confidence in the best, the result is the best.
an5.32:6.1	The Saṅgha of the Realized One’s disciples is said to be the best of all communities and groups.
an5.32:6.2	It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.
an5.32:6.3	Those who have confidence in the Saṅgha have confidence in the best.
an5.32:6.4	Having confidence in the best, the result is the best.
an5.32:7.1	The ethical conduct loved by the noble ones is said to be the best of all ethics.
an5.32:7.2	It is unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.
an5.32:7.3	Those who fulfill the ethics loved by the noble ones fulfill the best.
an5.32:7.4	Fulfilling the best, the result is the best.
an5.32:8.1	For those who, knowing the best teaching,
an5.32:8.2	base their confidence on the best—
an5.32:8.3	confident in the best Awakened One,
an5.32:8.4	supremely worthy of a religious donation;
an5.32:9.1	confident in the best teaching,

an5.32:9.3	confident in the best Saṅgha,
an5.32:9.4	the supreme field of merit—
an5.32:10.1	giving gifts to the best,

an5.33:0.1	Numbered Discourses 5
an5.33:0.2	4. With Sumanā
an5.33:0.3	33. With Uggaha
an5.33:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Bhaddiya, in Jātiyā Wood.
an5.33:1.2	Then Uggaha, Meṇḍaka’s grandson, went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
an5.33:2.1	“Sir, may the Buddha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me, together with three other monks.”
an5.33:2.2	The Buddha consented in silence.
an5.33:2.3	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Uggaha got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
an5.33:3.1	Then when the night had passed, the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Uggaha’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out.
an5.33:3.2	Then Uggaha served and satisfied the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods.
an5.33:3.3	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Uggaha sat down to one side,
an5.33:3.4	and said to him,
an5.33:3.5	“Sir, these girls of mine will be going to their husbands’ families.
an5.33:3.6	May the Buddha please advise
an5.33:3.7	and instruct them. It will be for their lasting welfare and happiness.”
an5.33:4.1	Then the Buddha said to those girls:
an5.33:4.2	“So, girls, you should train like this:
an5.33:4.3	‘Our parents will give us to a husband wanting what’s best, out of kindness and compassion. We will get up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely.’
an5.33:4.4	That’s how you should train.
an5.33:5.1	So, girls, you should train like this:
an5.33:5.2	‘Those our husband respects—mother and father, ascetics and brahmins—we will honor, respect, revere, and venerate, and serve with a seat and a drink when they come as guests.’
an5.33:5.3	That’s how you should train.
an5.33:6.1	So, girls, you should train like this:
an5.33:6.2	‘We will be skilled and tireless in doing domestic duties for our husband, such as knitting and sewing. We will have an understanding of how to go about things in order to complete and organize the work.’
an5.33:6.3	That’s how you should train.
an5.33:7.1	So, girls, you should train like this:
an5.33:7.2	‘We will know what work our husband’s domestic bondservants, workers, and staff have completed, and what they’ve left incomplete. We will know who is sick, and who is fit or unwell. We will distribute to each a fair portion of various foods.’
an5.33:7.3	That’s how you should train.
an5.33:8.1	So, girls, you should train like this:
an5.33:8.2	‘We will ensure that any income our husbands earn is guarded and protected, whether money, grain, silver, or gold. We will not overspend, steal, waste, or lose it.’
an5.33:8.3	That’s how you should train.
an5.33:8.4	When they have these five qualities, females—when their body breaks up, after death—are reborn in company with the Gods of the Lovable Host.
an5.33:9.1	She’d never look down on her husband,
an5.33:9.2	who’s always eager to work hard,
an5.33:9.3	always looking after her,
an5.33:9.4	and bringing whatever she wants.
an5.33:10.1	And a good woman never scolds her husband
an5.33:10.2	with jealous words.
an5.33:10.3	Being astute, she reveres
an5.33:10.4	those respected by her husband.
an5.33:11.1	She gets up early, works tirelessly,
an5.33:11.2	and manages the domestic help.
an5.33:11.3	She’s loveable to her husband,
an5.33:11.4	and preserves his wealth.
an5.33:12.1	A lady who fulfills these duties
an5.33:12.2	according to her husband’s desire,
an5.33:12.3	is reborn among the gods
an5.33:12.4	called ‘Loveable’.”

an5.34:0.3	34. With General Sīha
an5.34:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
an5.34:1.2	Then General Sīha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and asked him,
an5.34:1.3	“Sir, can you point out a fruit of giving that’s apparent in the present life?”
an5.34:2.1	“I can, Sīha,” said the Buddha.
an5.34:2.2	“A giver, a donor is dear and beloved to many people.
an5.34:2.3	This is a fruit of giving that’s apparent in the present life.
an5.34:3.1	Furthermore, good people associate with a giver.
an5.34:3.2	This is another fruit of giving that’s apparent in the present life.
an5.34:4.1	Furthermore, a giver gains a good reputation.
an5.34:4.2	This is another fruit of giving that’s apparent in the present life.
an5.34:5.1	Furthermore, a giver enters any kind of assembly bold and assured, whether it’s an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics.
an5.34:5.2	This is another fruit of giving that’s apparent in the present life.
an5.34:6.1	Furthermore, when a giver’s body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
an5.34:6.2	This is a fruit of giving to do with lives to come.”
an5.34:7.1	When he said this, General Sīha said to the Buddha,
an5.34:7.2	“When it comes to those four fruits of giving that are apparent in the present life, I don’t have to rely on faith in the Buddha, for I know them too.
an5.34:7.3	I’m a giver, a donor, and am dear and beloved to many people.
an5.34:7.4	I’m a giver, and good people associate with me.
an5.34:7.5	I’m a giver, and I have this good reputation: ‘General Sīha gives, serves, and attends on the Saṅgha.’
an5.34:7.6	I’m a giver, and I enter any kind of assembly bold and assured, whether it’s an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics.
an5.34:7.7	When it comes to these four fruits of giving that are apparent in the present life, I don’t have to rely on faith in the Buddha, for I know them too.
an5.34:7.8	But when the Buddha says:
an5.34:7.9	‘When a giver’s body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ I don’t know this, so I have to rely on faith in the Buddha.”
an5.34:7.10	“That’s so true, Sīha! That’s so true!
an5.34:7.11	When a giver’s body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
an5.34:8.1	Giving, you’re loved and befriended by many people.
an5.34:8.2	You get a good reputation, and your fame grows.
an5.34:8.3	A generous man enters an assembly
an5.34:8.4	bold and assured.
an5.34:9.1	So an astute person, seeking happiness, would give gifts,
an5.34:9.2	having driven out the stain of stinginess.
an5.34:9.3	They live long in the heaven of the Three and Thirty,
an5.34:9.4	enjoying the company of the gods.
an5.34:10.1	Having taken the opportunity to do good, when they pass from here
an5.34:10.2	they wander radiant in the Garden of Delight.
an5.34:10.3	There they delight, rejoice, and enjoy themselves,
an5.34:10.4	provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
an5.34:10.5	Having practiced the word of the unattached, the poised,
an5.34:10.6	disciples of the Holy One rejoice in heaven.”

an5.41:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an5.41:1.2	Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
an5.41:1.3	“Householder, there are these five reasons to get rich.
an5.41:1.4	What five?
an5.41:1.5	Firstly, with his legitimate wealth—earned by his efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow—a noble disciple makes himself happy and pleased, keeping himself properly happy.
an5.41:1.6	He makes his mother and father happy …
an5.41:1.7	He makes his children, partners, bondservants, workers, and staff happy …
an5.41:1.8	This is the first reason to get rich.
an5.41:2.1	Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he makes his friends and colleagues happy …
an5.41:2.2	This is the second reason to get rich.
an5.41:3.1	Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he protects himself against losses from such things as fire, water, kings, bandits, or unloved heirs.
an5.41:3.2	NA
an5.41:3.3	He keeps himself safe.
an5.41:3.4	This is the third reason to get rich.
an5.41:4.1	Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he makes five spirit-offerings:
an5.41:4.2	to relatives, guests, ancestors, king, and deities.
an5.41:4.3	This is the fourth reason to get rich.
an5.41:5.1	Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he establishes an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins—those who avoid intoxication and negligence, are settled in patience and gentleness, and who tame, calm, and extinguish themselves—that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven.
an5.41:5.2	This is the fifth reason to get rich.
an5.41:5.3	These are the five reasons to get rich.
an5.41:6.1	Now if the riches a noble disciple gets for these five reasons run out, he thinks:
an5.41:6.2	‘So, the riches I have obtained for these reasons are running out.’
an5.41:6.3	And so he has no regrets.
an5.41:6.4	But if the riches a noble disciple gets for these five reasons increase, he thinks:
an5.41:6.5	‘So, the riches I have obtained for these reasons are increasing.’
an5.41:6.6	And so he has no regrets in both cases.
an5.41:7.1	‘I’ve enjoyed my wealth, supporting those who depend on me;
an5.41:7.2	I’ve overcome losses;
an5.41:7.3	I’ve given uplifting religious donations;
an5.41:7.4	and made the five spirit-offerings.
an5.41:7.5	I have looked after the ethical and
an5.41:7.6	disciplined spiritual practitioners.
an5.41:8.1	I’ve achieved the purpose
an5.41:8.2	for which an astute lay person
an5.41:8.3	wishes to gain wealth.
an5.41:8.4	I don’t regret what I’ve done.’
an5.41:9.1	A mortal person who recollects this
an5.41:9.2	stands firm in the teaching of the noble ones.
an5.41:9.3	They’re praised in this life by the astute,

an5.43:6.3	For by practicing that way they gain happiness
an5.43:6.4	as a god or a human being.
an5.43:7.1	A noble disciple who wants to be famous ought not pray for it, or hope for it, or pine for it.

an5.43:8.1	A noble disciple who wants to go to heaven ought not pray for it, or hope for it, or pine for it.
an5.43:8.2	Instead, they should practice the way that leads to heaven.
an5.43:8.3	For by practicing that way they gain heaven,
an5.43:8.4	they are one who gains the heavens.
an5.43:9.1	For one who desires a continuous flow

an5.43:10.3	Being diligent, an astute person
an5.43:10.4	secures both benefits:
an5.43:11.1	the benefit in this life,
an5.43:11.2	and in lives to come.
an5.43:11.3	A wise one, comprehending the meaning,
an5.43:11.4	is called ‘astute’.”
an5.44:0.1	Numbered Discourses 5
an5.44:0.2	5. With King Muṇḍa
an5.44:0.3	44. Agreeable
an5.44:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
an5.44:1.2	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the householder Ugga of Vesālī, where he sat on the seat spread out.
an5.44:1.3	Then Ugga went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
an5.44:2.1	“Sir, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
an5.44:2.2	‘The giver of the agreeable gets the agreeable.’
an5.44:2.3	My sal flower porridge is agreeable:
an5.44:2.4	may the Buddha please accept it from me out of compassion.”
an5.44:2.5	So the Buddha accepted it out of compassion.
an5.44:3.1	“Sir, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
an5.44:3.2	‘The giver of the agreeable gets the agreeable.’
an5.44:3.3	My pork with jujube is agreeable:
an5.44:3.4	may the Buddha please accept it from me out of compassion.”
an5.44:3.5	So the Buddha accepted it out of compassion.
an5.44:4.1	NA
an5.44:4.2	NA
an5.44:4.3	“… My fried vegetable stalks are agreeable:
an5.44:4.4	may the Buddha please accept them from me out of compassion.”
an5.44:4.5	So the Buddha accepted them out of compassion.
an5.44:5.1	NA
an5.44:5.2	NA
an5.44:5.3	“… My boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out, served with many soups and sauces is agreeable:
an5.44:5.4	may the Buddha please accept it from me out of compassion.”
an5.44:5.5	So the Buddha accepted it out of compassion.
an5.44:6.1	NA
an5.44:6.2	NA
an5.44:6.3	“… My cloths imported from Kāsī are agreeable:
an5.44:6.4	may the Buddha please accept them from me out of compassion.”
an5.44:6.5	So the Buddha accepted them out of compassion.
an5.44:7.1	NA
an5.44:7.2	NA
an5.44:7.3	“… My couch spread with woolen covers—shag-piled or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red pillows at both ends is agreeable.
an5.44:7.4	But, sir, I know that
an5.44:7.5	this is not proper for the Buddha.
an5.44:7.6	However, this plank of sandalwood is worth over a thousand dollars.
an5.44:7.7	May the Buddha please accept it from me out of compassion.”
an5.44:7.8	So the Buddha accepted it out of compassion.
an5.44:7.9	And then the Buddha rejoiced with Ugga with these verses of appreciation:
an5.44:8.1	“The giver of the agreeable gets the agreeable,
an5.44:8.2	enthusiastically giving clothing, bedding,
an5.44:8.3	food and drink, and various requisites
an5.44:8.4	to those of upright conduct.
an5.44:9.1	Knowing the perfected ones to be like a field
an5.44:9.2	for what’s given, offered and not held back,
an5.44:9.3	a good person gives what’s hard to give:
an5.44:9.4	the giver of the agreeable gets the agreeable.”
an5.44:10.1	And then the Buddha, having rejoiced with Ugga with these verses of appreciation, got up from his seat and left.
an5.44:11.1	Then after some time Ugga passed away,
an5.44:11.2	and was reborn in a host of mind-made gods.
an5.44:11.3	At that time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an5.44:11.4	Then, late at night, the glorious god Ugga, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. The Buddha said to him,
an5.44:11.5	“Ugga, I trust it is all you wished?”
an5.44:11.6	“Sir, it is indeed just as I wished.”
an5.44:11.7	Then the Buddha addressed Ugga in verse:
an5.44:12.1	“The giver of the agreeable gets the agreeable,
an5.44:12.2	the giver of the foremost gets the foremost,
an5.44:12.3	the giver of the excellent gets the excellent,
an5.44:12.4	the giver of the best gets the best.
an5.44:13.1	A person who gives the foremost,
an5.44:13.2	the excellent, the best:
an5.44:13.3	they’re long-lived and famous
an5.44:13.4	wherever they’re reborn.”
an5.45:0.1	Numbered Discourses 5
an5.45:0.2	5. With King Muṇḍa
an5.45:0.3	45. Overflowing Merit
an5.45:1.1	“Mendicants, there are these five kinds of overflowing merit, overflowing goodness. They nurture happiness and are conducive to heaven, ripening in happiness and leading to heaven. They lead to what is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness.
an5.45:2.1	What five?
an5.45:2.2	When a mendicant enters and remains in a limitless immersion of heart while using a robe …
an5.45:3.1	almsfood … lodging … bed and chair …
an5.45:4.1	medicines and supplies for the sick, the overflowing of merit for the donor is limitless …
an5.45:4.2	These are the five kinds of overflowing merit, overflowing goodness. They nurture happiness, and are conducive to heaven, ripening in happiness, and leading to heaven. They lead to what is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness.
an5.45:5.1	When a noble disciple has these five kinds of overflowing merit and goodness, it’s not easy to grasp how much merit they have by saying that
an5.45:5.2	this is the extent of their overflowing merit … that leads to happiness.
an5.45:5.3	It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.
an5.45:6.1	It’s like trying to grasp how much water is in the ocean. It’s not easy to say:
an5.45:6.2	‘This is how many gallons, how many hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of gallons there are.’
an5.45:6.3	It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water.
an5.45:6.4	In the same way, when a noble disciple has these five kinds of overflowing merit and goodness, it’s not easy to grasp how much merit they have:
an5.45:6.5	‘This is how much this overflowing merit … leads to happiness.’
an5.45:6.6	It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.
an5.45:7.1	Hosts of people use the rivers,
an5.45:7.2	and though the rivers are many,
an5.45:7.3	all reach the great deep, the boundless ocean,
an5.45:7.4	the cruel sea that’s home to precious gems.
an5.45:8.1	So too, when a person gives food, drink, and clothes;
an5.45:8.2	and they’re a giver of beds, seats, and mats—
an5.45:8.3	the streams of merit reach that astute person,
an5.45:8.4	as the rivers bring their waters to the sea.”

an5.46:0.3	46. Success
an5.46:1.1	“Mendicants, there are five accomplishments.
an5.46:1.2	What five?

an5.47:0.3	47. Wealth
an5.47:1.1	“Mendicants, there are these five kinds of wealth.
an5.47:1.2	What five?
an5.47:1.3	The wealth of faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.
an5.47:2.1	And what is the wealth of faith?
an5.47:2.2	It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:
an5.47:2.3	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
an5.47:2.4	This is called the wealth of faith.
an5.47:3.1	And what is the wealth of ethics?
an5.47:3.2	It’s when a noble disciple doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
an5.47:3.3	This is called the wealth of ethics.
an5.47:4.1	And what is the wealth of learning?
an5.47:4.2	It’s when a noble disciple is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s totally full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reciting them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.
an5.47:4.3	This is called the wealth of learning.
an5.47:5.1	And what is the wealth of generosity?
an5.47:5.2	It’s when a noble disciple lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.
an5.47:5.3	This is called the wealth of generosity.
an5.47:6.1	And what is the wealth of wisdom?
an5.47:6.2	It’s when a noble disciple is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.
an5.47:6.3	This is called the wealth of wisdom.
an5.47:6.4	These are the five kinds of wealth.
an5.47:7.1	Whoever has faith in the Realized One,
an5.47:7.2	unwavering and well grounded;
an5.47:7.3	whose ethical conduct is good,
an5.47:7.4	praised and loved by the noble ones;
an5.47:8.1	who has confidence in the Saṅgha,
an5.47:8.2	and correct view:
an5.47:8.3	they’re said to be prosperous,
an5.47:8.4	their life is not in vain.
an5.47:9.1	So let the wise devote themselves
an5.47:9.2	to faith, ethical behavior,
an5.47:9.3	confidence, and insight into the teaching,
an5.47:9.4	remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.”

an5.48:0.3	48. Things That Cannot Be Had
an5.48:1.1	“Mendicants, there are five things that cannot be had by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.
an5.48:1.2	What five?
an5.48:1.3	That someone liable to old age should not grow old.
an5.48:1.4	That someone liable to sickness should not get sick. … That someone liable to death should not die. … That someone liable to ending should not end. … That someone liable to perishing should not perish. …
an5.48:2.1	An uneducated ordinary person has someone liable to old age who grows old.
an5.48:2.2	But they don’t reflect on old age:
an5.48:2.3	‘It’s not just me who has someone liable to old age who grows old. For as long as sentient beings come and go, pass away and are reborn, they all have someone liable to old age who grows old.
an5.48:2.4	If I were to sorrow and wail and lament, beating my breast and falling into confusion, just because someone liable to old age grows old, I’d lose my appetite and my physical appearance would deteriorate. My work wouldn’t get done, my enemies would be encouraged, and my friends would be dispirited.’
an5.48:2.5	And so, when someone liable to old age grows old, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
an5.48:2.6	This is called
an5.48:2.7	an uneducated ordinary person struck by sorrow’s poisoned arrow, who only mortifies themselves.
an5.48:3.1	Furthermore, an uneducated ordinary person has someone liable to sickness … death … ending … perishing.
an5.48:3.2	But they don’t reflect on perishing:
an5.48:3.3	‘It’s not just me who has someone liable to perishing who perishes. For as long as sentient beings come and go, pass away and are reborn, they all have someone liable to perishing who perishes.
an5.48:3.4	If I were to sorrow and wail and lament, beating my breast and falling into confusion, just because someone liable to perishing perishes, I’d lose my appetite and my physical appearance would deteriorate. My work wouldn’t get done, my enemies would be encouraged, and my friends would be dispirited.’
an5.48:3.5	And so, when someone liable to perishing perishes, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
an5.48:3.6	This is called
an5.48:3.7	an uneducated ordinary person struck by sorrow’s poisoned arrow, who only mortifies themselves.
an5.48:4.1	An educated noble disciple has someone liable to old age who grows old.
an5.48:4.2	So they reflect on old age:
an5.48:4.3	‘It’s not just me who has someone liable to old age who grows old. For as long as sentient beings come and go, pass away and are reborn, they all have someone liable to old age who grows old.

My work wouldn’t get done, my enemies would be encouraged, and my friends would be dispirited.’
an5.48:4.5	And so, when someone liable to old age grows old, they don’t sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
an5.48:4.6	This is called
an5.48:4.7	an educated noble disciple who has drawn out sorrow’s poisoned arrow, struck by which uneducated ordinary people only mortify themselves.
an5.48:4.8	Sorrowless, free of thorns, that noble disciple only extinguishes themselves.
an5.48:5.1	Furthermore, an educated noble disciple has someone liable to sickness … death … ending … perishing.
an5.48:5.2	So they reflect on perishing:
an5.48:5.3	‘It’s not just me who has someone liable to perishing who perishes. For as long as sentient beings come and go, pass away and are reborn, they all have someone liable to perishing who perishes.
an5.48:5.4	If I were to sorrow and wail and lament, beating my breast and falling into confusion, just because someone liable to perishing perishes, I’d lose my appetite and my physical appearance would deteriorate.

an5.48:5.8	Sorrowless, free of thorns, that noble disciple only extinguishes themselves.
an5.48:6.1	These are the five things that cannot be had by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.
an5.48:7.1	Sorrowing and lamenting
an5.48:7.2	doesn’t do even a little bit of good.
an5.48:7.3	When they know that you’re sad,
an5.48:7.4	your enemies are encouraged.
an5.48:8.1	When an astute person doesn’t waver in the face of adversity,
an5.48:8.2	as they’re able to assess what’s beneficial,
an5.48:8.3	their enemies suffer,
an5.48:8.4	seeing that their normal expression doesn’t change.
an5.48:9.1	Chants, recitations, fine sayings,
an5.48:9.2	charity or traditions:
an5.48:9.3	if by means of any such things you benefit,
an5.48:9.4	then by all means keep doing them.
an5.48:10.1	But if you understand that ‘this good thing
an5.48:10.2	can’t be had by me or by anyone else’,
an5.48:10.3	you should accept it without sorrowing, thinking:
an5.48:10.4	‘The karma is strong. What can I do now?’”

an5.49:2.1	NA
an5.49:2.2	Then a man went up to the king and whispered in his ear,
an5.49:2.3	“Your Majesty, Queen Mallikā has passed away.”
an5.49:2.4	When this was said, King Pasenadi was miserable and sad. He sat with his shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.
an5.49:3.1	Knowing this, the Buddha said to him,
an5.49:3.2	“Great king, there are five things that cannot be had by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.
an5.49:3.3	What five?

an5.50:1.1	At one time Venerable Nārada was staying near Pāṭaliputta, in the Chicken Monastery.
an5.50:1.2	Now at that time King Muṇḍa’s dear and beloved Queen Bhaddā had just passed away.
an5.50:1.3	And since that time, the king did not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or apply himself to his work.
an5.50:1.4	Day and night he brooded over Queen Bhaddā’s corpse.
an5.50:1.5	Then King Muṇḍa addressed his treasurer, Piyaka,
an5.50:1.6	“So, my good Piyaka, please place Queen Bhaddā’s corpse in an iron case filled with oil. Then close it up with another case, so that we can view Queen Bhaddā’s body even longer.”
an5.50:1.7	“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Piyaka the treasurer, and he did as the king instructed.
an5.50:2.1	Then it occurred to Piyaka,
an5.50:2.2	“King Muṇḍa’s dear and beloved Queen Bhaddā has passed away.
an5.50:2.3	Since then the king does not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or apply himself to his work.
an5.50:2.4	Day and night he broods over Queen Bhaddā’s corpse.
an5.50:2.5	Now, what ascetic or brahmin might the king pay homage to, whose teaching could help the king give up sorrow’s arrow?”
an5.50:3.1	Then it occurred to Piyaka,
an5.50:3.2	“This Venerable Nārada is staying in the Chicken Monastery at Pāṭaliputta.
an5.50:3.3	He has this good reputation:
an5.50:3.4	‘He is astute, competent, intelligent, learned, a brilliant speaker, eloquent, mature, a perfected one.’
an5.50:3.5	What if King Muṇḍa was to pay homage to Venerable Nārada? Hopefully when he hears Nārada’s teaching, the king could give up sorrow’s arrow.”
an5.50:4.1	Then Piyaka went to the king and said to him,
an5.50:4.2	“Sire, this Venerable Nārada is staying in the Chicken Monastery at Pāṭaliputta.
an5.50:4.3	He has this good reputation:
an5.50:4.4	‘He is astute, competent, intelligent, learned, a brilliant speaker, eloquent, mature, a perfected one.’
an5.50:4.5	What if Your Majesty was to pay homage to Venerable Nārada? Hopefully when you hear Nārada’s teaching, you could give up sorrow’s arrow.”
an5.50:4.6	“Well then, my good Piyaka, let Nārada know.
an5.50:4.7	For how could one such as I presume to visit an ascetic or brahmin in my realm without first letting them know?”
an5.50:4.8	“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Piyaka the treasurer. He went to Nārada, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
an5.50:5.1	“Sir, King Muṇḍa’s dear and beloved Queen Bhaddā has passed away.
an5.50:5.2	And since she passed away, the king has not bathed, anointed himself, eaten his meals, or got his business done.
an5.50:5.3	Day and night he broods over Queen Bhaddā’s corpse.
an5.50:5.4	Sir, please teach the king so that, when he hears your teaching, he can give up sorrow’s arrow.”
an5.50:5.5	“Please, Piyaka, let the king come when he likes.”
an5.50:6.1	Then Piyaka got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Venerable Nārada, keeping him on his right, before going to the king and saying,
an5.50:6.2	“Sire, the request for an audience with Venerable Nārada has been granted.
an5.50:6.3	Please, Your Majesty, go at your convenience.”
an5.50:6.4	“Well then, my good Piyaka, harness the finest chariots.”
an5.50:6.5	“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Piyaka the treasurer. He did so, then told the king:
an5.50:6.6	“Sire, the finest chariots are harnessed.
an5.50:6.7	Please, Your Majesty, go at your convenience.”
an5.50:7.1	Then King Muṇḍa mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp to see Venerable Nārada at the Chicken Monastery.
an5.50:7.2	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot.
an5.50:7.3	Then the king went up to Nārada, bowed, and sat down to one side. Then Nārada said to him:
an5.50:8.1	“Great king, there are five things that cannot be had by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.
an5.50:8.2	What five?
an5.50:8.3	That someone liable to old age should not grow old. …

an5.50:9.1	An uneducated ordinary person has someone liable to old age who grows old.
an5.50:9.2	But they don’t reflect on old age:

an5.50:9.4	If I were to sorrow and wail and lament, beating my breast and falling into confusion, just because someone liable to old age grows old, I’d lose my appetite and my physical appearance would deteriorate. My work wouldn’t get done, my enemies would be encouraged, and my friends would be dispirited.’
an5.50:9.5	And so, when someone liable to old age grows old, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
an5.50:9.6	This is called
an5.50:9.7	an uneducated ordinary person struck by sorrow’s poisoned arrow, who only mortifies themselves.
an5.50:10.1	Furthermore, an uneducated ordinary person has someone liable to sickness … death … ending … perishing.
an5.50:10.2	But they don’t reflect on perishing:
an5.50:10.3	‘It’s not just me who has someone liable to perishing who perishes. For all sentient beings have someone liable to perishing who perishes, as long as sentient beings come and go, pass away and are reborn.
an5.50:10.4	If I were to sorrow and wail and lament, beating my breast and falling into confusion, just because someone liable to perishing perishes, I’d lose my appetite and my physical appearance would deteriorate. My work wouldn’t get done, my enemies would be encouraged, and my friends would be dispirited.’
an5.50:10.5	And so, when someone liable to perishing perishes, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
an5.50:10.6	This is called

an5.50:11.1	An educated noble disciple has someone liable to old age who grows old.
an5.50:11.2	So they reflect on old age:
an5.50:11.3	‘It’s not just me who has someone liable to old age who grows old. For all sentient beings have someone liable to old age who grows old, as long as sentient beings come and go, pass away and are reborn.

My work wouldn’t get done, my enemies would be encouraged, and my friends would be dispirited.’
an5.50:11.5	And so, when someone liable to old age grows old, they don’t sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
an5.50:11.6	This is called
an5.50:11.7	an educated noble disciple who has drawn out sorrow’s poisoned arrow, struck by which uneducated ordinary people only mortify themselves.
an5.50:11.8	Sorrowless, free of thorns, that noble disciple only extinguishes themselves.
an5.50:12.1	Furthermore, an educated noble disciple has someone liable to sickness … death … ending … perishing.
an5.50:12.2	So they reflect on perishing:
an5.50:12.3	‘It’s not just me who has someone liable to perishing who perishes. For all sentient beings have someone liable to perishing who perishes, as long as sentient beings come and go, pass away and are reborn.
an5.50:12.4	If I were to sorrow and wail and lament, beating my breast and falling into confusion, just because someone liable to perishing perishes, I’d lose my appetite and my physical appearance would deteriorate. My work wouldn’t get done, my enemies would be encouraged, and my friends would be dispirited.’
an5.50:12.5	And so, when someone liable to perishing perishes, they don’t sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
an5.50:12.6	This is called
an5.50:12.7	an educated noble disciple who has drawn out sorrow’s poisoned arrow, struck by which uneducated ordinary people only mortify themselves.
an5.50:12.8	Sorrowless, free of thorns, that noble disciple only extinguishes themselves.
an5.50:13.1	These are the five things that cannot be had by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.
an5.50:14.1	Sorrowing and lamenting
an5.50:14.2	doesn’t do even a little bit of good.
an5.50:14.3	When they know that you’re sad,
an5.50:14.4	your enemies are encouraged.
an5.50:15.1	When an astute person doesn’t waver in the face of adversity,
an5.50:15.2	as they’re able to assess what’s beneficial,
an5.50:15.3	their enemies suffer,
an5.50:15.4	seeing that their normal expression doesn’t change.
an5.50:16.1	Chants, recitations, fine sayings,
an5.50:16.2	charity or traditions:
an5.50:16.3	if by means of any such things you benefit,
an5.50:16.4	then by all means keep doing them.
an5.50:17.1	But if you understand that ‘this good thing
an5.50:17.2	can’t be had by me or by anyone else’,
an5.50:17.3	you should accept it without sorrowing, thinking:
an5.50:17.4	‘The karma is strong. What can I do now?’”
an5.50:18.1	When he said this, King Muṇḍa said to Venerable Nārada,
an5.50:18.2	“Sir, what is the name of this exposition of the teaching?”
an5.50:18.3	“Great king, this exposition of the teaching is called ‘Pulling Out Sorrow’s Arrow’.”
an5.50:18.4	“Indeed, sir, this is the pulling out of sorrow’s arrow!
an5.50:18.5	Hearing this exposition of the teaching, I’ve given up sorrow’s arrow.”
an5.50:19.1	Then King Muṇḍa addressed his treasurer, Piyaka,
an5.50:19.2	“Well then, my good Piyaka, cremate Queen Bhaddā’s corpse and build a monument.
an5.50:19.3	From this day forth, I will bathe, anoint myself, eat my meals, and apply myself to my work.”

an5.51:1.1	So I have heard.
an5.51:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an5.51:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
an5.51:1.4	“Mendicants!”
an5.51:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.
an5.51:1.6	The Buddha said this:
an5.51:2.1	“Mendicants, there are these five obstacles and hindrances, parasites of the mind that weaken wisdom.
an5.51:2.2	What five?
an5.51:2.3	Sensual desire …
an5.51:2.4	Ill will …
an5.51:2.5	Dullness and drowsiness …
an5.51:2.6	Restlessness and remorse …
an5.51:2.7	Doubt …
an5.51:2.8	These are the five obstacles and hindrances, parasites of the mind that weaken wisdom.
an5.51:3.1	Take a mendicant who has feeble and weak wisdom, not having given up these five obstacles and hindrances, parasites of the mind that weaken wisdom. It’s simply impossible that they would know what’s for their own good, the good of another, or the good of both; or that they would realize any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.
an5.51:3.2	Suppose there was a mountain river that flowed swiftly, going far, carrying all before it.
an5.51:3.3	But then a man would open channels on both sides,
an5.51:3.4	so the mid-river current would be dispersed, spread out, and separated. The river would no longer flow swiftly, going far, carrying all before it.
an5.51:3.5	In the same way, take a mendicant who has feeble and weak wisdom, not having given up these five obstacles and hindrances, parasites of the mind that weaken wisdom. It’s simply impossible that they would know what’s for their own good, the good of another, or the good of both; or that they would realize any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.
an5.51:4.1	Take a mendicant who has powerful wisdom, having given up these five obstacles and hindrances, parasites of the mind that weaken wisdom. It’s quite possible that they would know what’s for their own good, the good of another, or the good of both; or that they would realize any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.
an5.51:4.2	Suppose there was a mountain river that flowed swiftly, going far, carrying all before it.
an5.51:4.3	But then a man would close up the channels on both sides,
an5.51:4.4	so the mid-river current would not be dispersed, spread out, and separated. The river would keep flowing swiftly for a long way, carrying all before it.
an5.51:4.5	In the same way, take a mendicant who has powerful wisdom, having given up these five obstacles and hindrances, parasites of the mind that weaken wisdom. It’s quite possible that they would know what’s for their own good, the good of another, or the good of both; or that they would realize any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.”

an5.53:1.7	They’re not devious or deceitful.
an5.53:1.8	They reveal themselves honestly to the Teacher or sensible spiritual companions.
an5.53:1.9	They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.
an5.53:1.10	They’re wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.

an5.54:1.1	“Mendicants, there are five times that are not good for meditation.
an5.54:1.2	What five?
an5.54:1.3	Firstly, a mendicant is old, overcome with old age.
an5.54:1.4	This is the first time that’s not good for meditation.
an5.54:2.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is sick, overcome by sickness.
an5.54:2.2	This is the second time that’s not good for meditation.
an5.54:3.1	Furthermore, there’s a famine, a bad harvest, so it’s hard to get almsfood, and not easy to keep going by collecting alms.
an5.54:3.2	This is the third time that’s not good for meditation.
an5.54:4.1	Furthermore, there’s peril from wild savages, and the countryfolk mount their vehicles and flee everywhere.
an5.54:4.2	This is the fourth time that’s not good for meditation.
an5.54:5.1	Furthermore, there’s a schism in the Saṅgha.
an5.54:5.2	When the Saṅgha is split, they abuse, insult, block, and reject each other.
an5.54:5.3	This doesn’t inspire confidence in those without it, and it causes some with confidence to change their minds.
an5.54:5.4	This is the fifth time that’s not good for meditation.
an5.54:5.5	These are the five times that are not good for meditation.
an5.54:6.1	There are five times that are good for meditation.
an5.54:6.2	What five?
an5.54:6.3	Firstly, a mendicant is a youth, young, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life.
an5.54:6.4	This is the first time that’s good for meditation.
an5.54:7.1	Furthermore, they are rarely ill or unwell. Their stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and fit for meditation.
an5.54:7.2	This is the second time that’s good for meditation.
an5.54:8.1	Furthermore, there’s plenty of food, a good harvest, so it’s easy to get almsfood, and easy to keep going by collecting alms.
an5.54:8.2	This is the third time that’s good for meditation.
an5.54:9.1	Furthermore, people live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes.
an5.54:9.2	This is the fourth time that’s good for meditation.
an5.54:10.1	Furthermore, the Saṅgha lives comfortably, in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, with one recitation.
an5.54:10.2	When the Saṅgha is in harmony, they don’t abuse, insult, block, or reject each other.
an5.54:10.3	This inspires confidence in those without it, and increases confidence in those who have it.
an5.54:10.4	This is the fifth time that’s good for meditation.
an5.54:10.5	These are the five times that are good for meditation.”

an5.55:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an5.55:1.2	Now, at that time a mother and son had both entered the rainy season residence at Sāvatthī,
an5.55:1.3	as a monk and a nun.
an5.55:1.4	They wanted to see each other often.
an5.55:1.5	The mother wanted to see her son often,
an5.55:1.6	and the son his mother.
an5.55:1.7	Seeing each other often, they became close.
an5.55:1.8	Being so close, they became intimate.
an5.55:1.9	And being intimate, lust overcame them.
an5.55:1.10	With their minds swamped by lust, without resigning the training and declaring their inability to continue, they had sex.

an5.55:3.2	a mother cannot lust for her son, or that a son cannot lust for his mother?
an5.55:3.3	Compared to the sight of a woman, I do not see a single sight that is so arousing, sensuous, intoxicating, captivating, and infatuating, and such an obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary.
an5.55:3.4	Sentient beings are lustful, greedy, tied, infatuated, and attached to the sight of a woman.
an5.55:3.5	They sorrow for a long time under the sway of a woman’s sight.
an5.55:4.1	Compared to the sound … smell … taste … touch of a woman, I do not see a single touch that is so arousing, sensuous, intoxicating, captivating, and infatuating, and such an obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary.
an5.55:4.2	Sentient beings are lustful, greedy, tied, infatuated, and attached to the touch of a woman.
an5.55:4.3	They sorrow for a long time under the sway of a woman’s touch.
an5.55:5.1	When a woman walks, she occupies a man’s mind.
an5.55:5.2	When a woman stands … sits … lies down … laughs … speaks … sings … cries … is injured, she occupies a man’s mind. Even when a woman is dead, she occupies a man’s mind.

an5.55:6.2	You might even chat with a goblin.
an5.55:6.3	You might sit close by a viper,
an5.55:6.4	whose bite would take your life.
an5.55:6.5	But never should you chat
an5.55:6.6	one on one with a female.
an5.55:7.1	They captivate the unmindful
an5.55:7.2	with a glance and a smile.
an5.55:7.3	Or scantily clad,
an5.55:7.4	they speak charming words.
an5.55:7.5	It’s not good to sit with such a person,
an5.55:7.6	even if she’s injured or dead.
an5.55:8.1	These five kinds of sensual stimulation
an5.55:8.2	are apparent in a woman’s body:
an5.55:8.3	sights, sounds, tastes, smells,
an5.55:8.4	and touches so delightful.
an5.55:9.1	Those swept away by the flood of sensual pleasures,
an5.55:9.2	not comprehending them,
an5.55:9.3	are governed by transmigration—
an5.55:9.4	time and destination, and life after life.
an5.55:10.1	But those who completely understand sensual pleasures
an5.55:10.2	live fearing nothing from any quarter.
an5.55:10.3	They are those in the world who’ve crossed over,
an5.55:10.4	having reached the ending of defilements.”

an5.56:0.3	56. Mentor
an5.56:1.1	Then a mendicant went up to his own mentor, and said,
an5.56:1.2	“Now, sir, my body feels like it’s drugged. I’m disorientated, the teachings don’t spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness fill my mind. I lead the spiritual life dissatisfied, and have doubts about the teachings.”
an5.56:2.1	Then that mendicant took his pupil to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
an5.56:2.2	“Sir, this mendicant says this:
an5.56:2.3	‘Now, sir, my body feels like it’s drugged. I’m disorientated, the teachings don’t spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness fill my mind. I lead the spiritual life dissatisfied, and have doubts about the teachings.’”
an5.56:3.1	“That’s how it is, mendicant, when your sense doors are unguarded, you eat too much, you’re not dedicated to wakefulness, you’re unable to discern skillful qualities, and you don’t pursue the development of the qualities that lead to awakening in the evening and toward dawn. Your body feels like it’s drugged. You’re disorientated, the teachings don’t spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness fill your mind. You lead the spiritual life dissatisfied, and have doubts about the teachings.
an5.56:3.2	So you should train like this:
an5.56:3.3	‘I will guard my sense doors, eat in moderation, be dedicated to wakefulness, discern skillful qualities, and pursue the development of the qualities that lead to awakening in the evening and toward dawn.’
an5.56:3.4	That’s how you should train.”
an5.56:4.1	When that mendicant had been given this advice by the Buddha, he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
an5.56:4.2	Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
an5.56:4.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
an5.56:4.4	And that mendicant became one of the perfected.
an5.56:5.1	When that mendicant had attained perfection, he went up to his own mentor, and said,
an5.56:5.2	“Now, sir, my body doesn’t feel like it’s drugged. I’m not disorientated, the teachings spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness don’t fill my mind. I lead the spiritual life satisfied, and have no doubts about the teachings.”
an5.56:5.3	Then that mendicant took his pupil to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,

an5.56:6.1	“That’s how it is, mendicant, when your sense doors are guarded, you’re moderate in eating, you’re dedicated to wakefulness, you’re able to discern skillful qualities, and you pursue the development of the qualities that lead to awakening in the evening and toward dawn. Your body doesn’t feel like it’s drugged. You’re not disorientated, the teachings spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness don’t fill your mind. You lead the spiritual life satisfied, and have no doubts about the teachings.
an5.56:6.2	So you should train like this:

an5.58:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
an5.58:1.2	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.
an5.58:1.3	Then after the meal, on his return from almsround, he plunged deep into the Great Wood and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation.
an5.58:2.1	Now at that time several Licchavi youths took strung bows and, escorted by a pack of hounds, were going for a walk in the Great Wood when they saw the Buddha seated at the root of a tree.
an5.58:2.2	When they saw him, they put down their strung bows, tied their hounds up to one side, and went up to him. They bowed and silently paid homage to the Buddha with joined palms.
an5.58:3.1	Now at that time Mahānāma the Licchavi was going for a walk in the Great Wood when he saw those Licchavi youths silently paying homage to the Buddha with joined palms.
an5.58:3.2	Seeing this, he went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,
an5.58:3.3	and expressed this heartfelt sentiment,
an5.58:3.4	“They will make it as Vajjis! They will make it as Vajjis!”
an5.58:4.1	“But Mahānāma, why do you say that they will make it as Vajjis?”

an5.58:4.4	Whenever sweets are left out for families—sugar-cane, jujube fruits, pancakes, pies, or fritters—they filch them and eat them up.

an5.58:6.1	What five?
an5.58:6.2	Firstly, a gentleman uses his legitimate wealth—earned by his efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow—to honor, respect, esteem, and venerate his mother and father.
an5.58:6.3	Honored in this way, his mother and father love him with a good heart, wishing:

an5.58:8.1	Furthermore, a gentleman uses his legitimate wealth to honor, respect, esteem, and venerate those who work the neighboring fields, and those he does business with.
an5.58:8.2	Honored in this way, those who work the neighboring fields, and those he does business with love him with a good heart, wishing:
an5.58:8.3	‘Live long! Stay alive for a long time!’
an5.58:8.4	When a gentleman is loved by those who work the neighboring fields, and those he does business with, you can expect only growth, not decline.
an5.58:9.1	Furthermore, a gentleman uses his legitimate wealth to honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the deities who receive spirit-offerings.
an5.58:9.2	Honored in this way, the deities who receive spirit-offerings love him with a good heart, wishing:
an5.58:9.3	‘Live long! Stay alive for a long time!’
an5.58:9.4	When a gentleman is loved by the deities, you can expect only growth, not decline.
an5.58:10.1	Furthermore, a gentleman uses his legitimate wealth to honor, respect, esteem, and venerate ascetics and brahmins.
an5.58:10.2	Honored in this way, ascetics and brahmins love him with a good heart, wishing:

an5.58:10.4	When a gentleman is loved by ascetics and brahmins, you can expect only growth, not decline.
an5.58:11.1	You can expect only growth, not decline, when you find these five qualities in any gentleman—
an5.58:11.2	whether he’s an anointed aristocratic king, an appointed or hereditary official, an army general, a village chief, a guild chief, or a ruler of his own clan.
an5.58:12.1	He’s always dutiful to his mother and father,
an5.58:12.2	and for the good of his wives and children.
an5.58:12.3	He looks after those in his household,
an5.58:12.4	and those dependent on him for their livelihood.
an5.58:13.1	A kind and ethical person
an5.58:13.2	looks after the welfare of relatives—
an5.58:13.3	both those who have passed away,
an5.58:13.4	and those alive at present.
an5.58:14.1	While living at home, an astute person
an5.58:14.2	uses legitimate means to give rise to joy
an5.58:14.3	for ascetics, brahmins,
an5.58:14.4	and also the gods.
an5.58:15.1	Having done good,
an5.58:15.2	he’s venerable and praiseworthy.
an5.58:15.3	They praise him in this life,
an5.58:15.4	and he departs to rejoice in heaven.”

an5.74:7.2	Out of compassion, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples.
an5.74:7.3	Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, mendicant! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.”

an5.75:6.5	What is his ‘cloud of dust’?
an5.75:6.6	It’s when a monk hears:
an5.75:6.7	‘In such and such a village or town there’s a women or a girl who is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty.’

an5.75:15.8	Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, he enters and remains in the first absorption …
an5.75:15.9	second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.

an5.76:6.2	What five?
an5.76:6.3	Firstly, a mendicant lives supported by a town or village.
an5.76:6.4	He robes up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, enters a village or town for alms without guarding body, speech, and mind, without establishing mindfulness, and without restraining the sense faculties.
an5.76:6.5	There he sees a female scantily clad, with revealing clothes.
an5.76:6.6	Lust infects his mind,
an5.76:6.7	and, without resigning the training and declaring his inability to continue, he has sex.

an5.76:7.2	This is the first person similar to a warrior found among the monks.

an5.76:8.3	There he sees a female scantily clad, with revealing clothes.
an5.76:8.4	Lust infects his mind,
an5.76:8.5	and his body and mind burn with it.
an5.76:8.6	He thinks:
an5.76:8.7	‘Why don’t I go to the monastery and tell the monks:
an5.76:8.8	“Reverends, I am overcome with lust, mired in lust. I am unable to keep up the spiritual life.
an5.76:8.9	I declare my inability to continue training. I reject it and will return to a lesser life.”’
an5.76:8.10	But while traveling on the road, before he reaches the monastery he declares his inability to continue training. He rejects it and returns to a lesser life.

an5.76:10.12	I declare my inability to continue training. I reject it and will return to a lesser life.’
an5.76:11.1	His spiritual companions advise and instruct him:
an5.76:11.2	‘Reverend, the Buddha says that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.

an5.76:11.14	Venerable, please don’t declare your inability to continue training, reject it and return to a lesser life.’

an5.76:12.2	‘Reverends, even though the Buddha says that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks,
an5.76:12.3	I am unable to keep up the spiritual life. I declare my inability to continue training. I reject it and will return to a lesser life.’

an5.76:18.2	He robes up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, enters a village or town, guarding body, speech, and mind, establishing mindfulness, and restraining the sense faculties.
an5.76:18.3	Seeing a sight with his eyes, he doesn’t get caught up in the features and details.
an5.76:18.4	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, he practices restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving restraint over it.
an5.76:18.5	Hearing a sound with his ears …
an5.76:18.6	Smelling an odor with his nose …
an5.76:18.7	Tasting a flavor with his tongue …

an5.76:18.11	Then after the meal, on his return from almsround,
an5.76:18.12	he frequents a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.
an5.76:18.13	Gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, he sits down cross-legged, with his body straight, and establishes mindfulness right there.

an5.77:1.1	“Mendicants, seeing these five future perils is quite enough for a wilderness mendicant to meditate diligently, keenly, and resolutely for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.
an5.77:2.1	What five?
an5.77:2.2	Firstly, a wilderness mendicant reflects:
an5.77:2.3	‘Currently I’m living alone in a wilderness.
an5.77:2.4	While living here alone
an5.77:2.5	I might get bitten by a snake, a scorpion, or a centipede.
an5.77:2.6	And if I died from that it would stop my practice.
an5.77:2.7	I’d better rouse up energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.’

an5.77:3.2	‘Currently I’m living alone in a wilderness.
an5.77:3.3	While living here alone
an5.77:3.4	I might stumble and fall, or get food poisoning, or my bile or phlegm or stabbing wind might get upset.
an5.77:3.5	And if I died from that it would stop my practice.
an5.77:3.6	I’d better rouse up energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.’
an5.77:3.7	This is the second future peril …
an5.77:4.1	Furthermore, a wilderness mendicant reflects:
an5.77:4.2	‘Currently I’m living alone in a wilderness.
an5.77:4.3	While living here alone
an5.77:4.4	I might encounter wild beasts—a lion, a tiger, a leopard, a bear, or a hyena—which might take my life.
an5.77:4.5	And if I died from that it would stop my practice.
an5.77:4.6	I’d better rouse up energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.’
an5.77:4.7	This is the third future peril …
an5.77:5.1	Furthermore, a wilderness mendicant reflects:
an5.77:5.2	‘Currently I’m living alone in a wilderness.
an5.77:5.3	While living here alone
an5.77:5.4	I might encounter youths escaping a crime or on their way to commit one, and they might take my life.

an5.78:1.4	‘Currently I’m a youth, young, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life.
an5.78:1.5	But there will come a time when this body is struck with old age.
an5.78:1.6	When you’re old, overcome by old age, it’s not easy to focus on the instructions of the Buddhas, and it’s not easy to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.

an5.78:3.4	In a time of famine, people move to where there’s plenty of food,
an5.78:3.5	where they live crowded and cramped together.

an5.78:4.3	But there will come a time of peril from wild savages, when the countryfolk mount their vehicles and flee everywhere.
an5.78:4.4	In a time of peril, people move to where there’s sanctuary,
an5.78:4.5	where they live crowded and cramped together.

an5.78:5.2	‘Currently, the Saṅgha lives comfortably, in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, with one recitation.
an5.78:5.3	But there will come a time of schism in the Saṅgha.
an5.78:5.4	When there is schism in the Saṅgha, it’s not easy to focus on the instructions of the Buddhas, and it’s not easy to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.

an5.100:1.1	So I have heard.
an5.100:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery.
an5.100:1.3	At that time the Koliyan named Kakudha—Venerable Mahāmoggallāna’s supporter—had recently passed away and been reborn in a certain host of mind-made gods.
an5.100:1.4	He was reincarnated in a life-form that was two or three times the size of a Magadhan village with its fields.
an5.100:1.5	But with that life-form he didn’t obstruct himself or others.
an5.100:2.1	Then the god Kakudha went up to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,
an5.100:2.2	“Sir, this fixed desire arose in Devadatta:
an5.100:2.3	‘I will lead the mendicant Saṅgha.’
an5.100:2.4	And as that thought arose, Devadatta lost that psychic power.”
an5.100:2.5	That’s what the god Kakudha said.
an5.100:2.6	Then he bowed and respectfully circled Mahāmoggallāna, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there.
an5.100:3.1	Then Mahāmoggallāna went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.

an5.100:5.7	Now that silly man Devadatta will expose himself by his own deeds.
an5.100:6.1	Moggallāna, there are these five teachers found in the world.
an5.100:6.2	What five?
an5.100:6.3	Firstly, some teacher with impure conduct claims: ‘I am pure in ethics. My ethical conduct is pure, bright, uncorrupted.’
an5.100:6.4	But their disciples know:
an5.100:6.5	‘This teacher has impure ethical conduct, but claims to be ethically pure.

an5.100:6.10	The disciples of such a teacher cover up their teacher’s conduct,
an5.100:6.11	and the teacher expects them to do so.
an5.100:7.1	Furthermore, some teacher with impure livelihood claims: ‘I am pure in livelihood. My livelihood is pure, bright, uncorrupted.’

an5.100:9.8	The disciples of such a teacher cover up their teacher’s answers,
an5.100:9.9	and the teacher expects them to do so.
an5.100:10.1	Furthermore, some teacher with impure knowledge and vision claims: ‘I am pure in knowledge and vision. My knowledge and vision are pure, bright, uncorrupted.’

an5.103:6.1	And how does a master thief act alone?

an5.103:7.1	A master thief with these five factors breaks into houses, plunders wealth, steals from isolated buildings, and commits highway robbery.

an5.104:2.3	When living with other spiritual practitioners, they usually treat them agreeably by way of body, speech, and mind, and rarely disagreeably.
an5.104:2.4	And they usually present them with agreeable things, rarely with disagreeable ones.
an5.104:2.5	They’re healthy, so the various unpleasant feelings—stemming from disorders of bile, phlegm, wind, or their conjunction; or caused by change in weather, by not taking care of themselves, by overexertion, or as the result of past deeds—usually don’t come up.
an5.104:2.6	They get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.
an5.104:2.7	And they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
an5.104:2.8	A mendicant with these five qualities is an exquisite ascetic of ascetics.
an5.104:3.1	And if anyone should be rightly called an exquisite ascetic of ascetics, it’s me.
an5.104:3.2	For I usually use only what I’ve been invited to accept.
an5.104:3.3	When living with other spiritual practitioners, I usually treat them agreeably.
an5.104:3.4	And I usually present them with agreeable things.
an5.104:3.5	I’m healthy.

an5.162:1.2	“Reverends, mendicants!”
an5.162:1.3	“Reverend,” they replied.
an5.162:1.4	Sāriputta said this:

an5.162:2.2	What five?
an5.162:2.3	In the case of a person whose behavior by way of body is impure, but whose behavior by way of speech is pure,
an5.162:2.4	you should get rid of resentment for that kind of person.

an5.162:3.1	How should you get rid of resentment for a person whose behavior by way of body is impure, but whose behavior by way of speech is pure?
an5.162:3.2	Suppose a mendicant wearing rag robes sees a rag by the side of the road. They’d hold it down with the left foot, spread it out with the right foot, tear out what was intact, and take it away with them.
an5.162:3.3	In the same way, at that time you should ignore that person’s impure behavior by way of body and focus on their pure behavior by way of speech.
an5.162:3.4	That’s how to get rid of resentment for that person.
an5.162:4.1	How should you get rid of resentment for a person whose behavior by way of speech is impure, but whose behavior by way of body is pure?
an5.162:4.2	Suppose there was a lotus pond covered with moss and aquatic plants.
an5.162:4.3	Then along comes a person struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched.
an5.162:4.4	They’d plunge into the lotus pond, sweep apart the moss and aquatic plants, drink from their cupped hands, and be on their way.
an5.162:4.5	In the same way, at that time you should ignore that person’s impure behavior by way of speech and focus on their pure behavior by way of body.
an5.162:4.6	That’s how to get rid of resentment for that person.
an5.162:5.1	How should you get rid of resentment for a person whose behavior by way of body and speech is impure, but who gets an openness and clarity of heart from time to time?
an5.162:5.2	Suppose there was a little water in a cow’s hoofprint.
an5.162:5.3	Then along comes a person struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched.
an5.162:5.4	They might think:
an5.162:5.5	‘This little bit of water is in a cow’s hoofprint.
an5.162:5.6	If I drink it with my cupped hands or a bowl, I’ll stir it and disturb it, making it undrinkable.
an5.162:5.7	Why don’t I get down on all fours and drink it up like a cow, then be on my way?’
an5.162:5.8	So that’s what they do.
an5.162:5.9	In the same way, at that time you should ignore that person’s impure behavior by way of speech and body,
an5.162:5.10	NA
an5.162:5.11	and focus on the fact that they get an openness and clarity of heart from time to time.
an5.162:5.12	That’s how to get rid of resentment for that person.
an5.162:6.1	How should you get rid of resentment for a person whose behavior by way of body and speech is impure, and who doesn’t get an openness and clarity of heart from time to time?
an5.162:6.2	Suppose a person was traveling along a road, and they were sick, suffering, gravely ill.
an5.162:6.3	And it was a long way to a village, whether ahead or behind.
an5.162:6.4	And they didn’t have any suitable food or medicine, or a competent carer, or someone to bring them within a village.
an5.162:6.5	Then another person traveling along the road sees them,
an5.162:6.6	and thinks of them with nothing but compassion, kindness, and sympathy:
an5.162:6.7	‘Oh, may this person get suitable food or medicine, or a competent carer, or someone to bring them within a village.
an5.162:6.8	Why is that?
an5.162:6.9	So that they don’t come to ruin right here.’
an5.162:6.10	In the same way, at that time you should ignore that person’s impure behavior by way of speech and body, and the fact that they don’t get an openness and clarity of heart from time to time, and think of them with nothing but compassion, kindness, and sympathy:
an5.162:6.11	‘Oh, may this person give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind.
an5.162:6.12	Why is that?
an5.162:6.13	So that, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re not reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’
an5.162:6.14	That’s how to get rid of resentment for that person.
an5.162:7.1	How should you get rid of resentment for a person whose behavior by way of body and speech is pure, and who gets an openness and clarity of heart from time to time?
an5.162:7.2	Suppose there was a lotus pond with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful, and shaded by many trees.
an5.162:7.3	Then along comes a person struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched.
an5.162:7.4	They’d plunge into the lotus pond to bathe and drink. And after emerging they’d sit or lie down right there in the shade of the trees.
an5.162:8.1	In the same way, at that time you should focus on that person’s pure behavior by way of body and speech, and on the fact that they get an openness and clarity of heart from time to time.
an5.162:8.2	NA
an5.162:8.3	NA
an5.162:8.4	That’s how to get rid of resentment for that person.

an5.166:1.1	There Venerable Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:
an5.166:1.2	“Reverends, take a mendicant who is accomplished in ethics, immersion, and wisdom. They might enter into and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling.
an5.166:1.3	That is possible.
an5.166:1.4	If they don’t reach enlightenment in this very life, then, surpassing the company of gods that consume solid food, they’re reborn in a certain host of mind-made gods. There they might enter into and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling.
an5.166:1.5	That is possible.”
an5.166:2.1	When he said this, Venerable Udāyī said to him,
an5.166:2.2	“This is not possible, Reverend Sāriputta, it cannot happen!”

an5.166:5.1	Then Venerable Sāriputta thought,

an5.166:5.3	Why don’t I go to see the Buddha?”
an5.166:5.4	Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,
an5.166:5.5	and said to the mendicants:
an5.166:5.6	“Reverends, take a mendicant who is accomplished in ethics, immersion, and wisdom. They might enter into and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling.
an5.166:5.7	There is such a possibility.
an5.166:5.8	If they don’t reach enlightenment in this very life, they’re reborn in the company of a certain host of mind-made gods, who surpass the gods that consume solid food. There they might enter into and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling.
an5.166:5.9	That is possible.”
an5.166:6.1	When he said this, Udāyī said to him,
an5.166:6.2	“This is not possible, Reverend Sāriputta, it cannot happen!”

an5.166:9.2	“Even in front of the Buddha Venerable Udāyī disagrees with me three times, and not one mendicant agrees with me.
an5.166:9.3	I’d better stay silent.”
an5.166:9.4	Then Sāriputta fell silent.
an5.166:10.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Udāyī,
an5.166:10.2	“But Udāyī, do you believe in a mind-made body?”
an5.166:10.3	“For those gods, sir, who are formless, made of perception.”
an5.166:10.4	“Udāyī, what has an incompetent fool like you got to say?
an5.166:10.5	How on earth could you imagine you’ve got something worth saying!”
an5.166:11.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,
an5.166:11.2	“Ānanda! There’s a senior mendicant being harassed, and you just watch it happening.
an5.166:11.3	Don’t you have any compassion for a senior mendicant who is being harassed?”
an5.166:12.1	Then the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
an5.166:12.2	“Mendicants, take a mendicant who is accomplished in ethics, immersion, and wisdom. They might enter into and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling.
an5.166:12.3	That is possible.
an5.166:12.4	If they don’t reach enlightenment in this very life, they’re reborn in the company of a certain host of mind-made gods, who surpass the gods that consume solid food. There they might enter into and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling.
an5.166:12.5	That is possible.”
an5.166:12.6	That is what the Buddha said.
an5.166:12.7	When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.
an5.166:13.1	Then, not long after the Buddha had left, Venerable Ānanda went to Venerable Upavāṇa and said to him,
an5.166:13.2	“Reverend Upavāṇa, they’ve been harassing other senior mendicants,
an5.166:13.3	but I didn’t question them.
an5.166:13.4	I wouldn’t be surprised if the Buddha makes a statement about this when he comes out of retreat later this afternoon. He might even call upon Venerable Upavāṇa himself.
an5.166:13.5	And right now I feel timid.”
an5.166:13.6	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall, where he sat on the seat spread out, and said to Upavāṇa,
an5.166:14.1	“Upavāṇa, how many qualities should a senior mendicant have to be dear and beloved to their spiritual companions, respected and admired?”
an5.166:14.2	“Sir, a senior mendicant with five qualities is dear and beloved to their spiritual companions, respected and admired.
an5.166:14.3	What five?
an5.166:14.4	It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the code of conduct, with good behavior and supporters. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
an5.166:14.5	They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s totally full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reciting them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.
an5.166:14.6	They’re a good speaker, with a polished, clear, and articulate voice that expresses the meaning.
an5.166:14.7	They get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.
an5.166:14.8	They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
an5.166:14.9	A senior mendicant with these five qualities is dear and beloved to their spiritual companions, respected and admired.”
an5.166:15.1	“Good, good, Upavāṇa!
an5.166:15.2	A senior mendicant with these five qualities is dear and beloved to their spiritual companions, respected and admired.
an5.166:15.3	If these five qualities are not found in a senior mendicant, why would their spiritual companions honor, respect, revere, or venerate them? Because of their broken teeth, gray hair, and wrinkled skin?
an5.166:15.4	But since these five qualities are found in a senior mendicant, their spiritual companions honor, respect, revere, or venerate them.”

an5.167:1.1	There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:
an5.167:1.2	“Reverends, a mendicant who wants to accuse another should first establish five things in themselves.
an5.167:2.1	What five?
an5.167:2.2	I will speak at the right time, not at the wrong time.
an5.167:2.3	I will speak truthfully, not falsely.
an5.167:2.4	I will speak gently, not harshly.
an5.167:2.5	I will speak beneficially, not harmfully.
an5.167:2.6	I will speak lovingly, not from secret hate.
an5.167:2.7	A mendicant who wants to accuse another should first establish these five things in themselves.
an5.167:3.1	Take a case where I see a certain person being accused at the wrong time, not being disturbed at the right time. They’re accused falsely, not disturbed truthfully. They’re accused harshly, not disturbed gently. They’re accused harmfully, not disturbed beneficially. They’re accused with secret hate, not disturbed lovingly.
an5.167:4.1	The mendicant who is accused improperly should be reassured in five ways.
an5.167:4.2	‘Venerable, you were accused at the wrong time, not at the right time. There’s no need for you to feel remorse.
an5.167:4.3	You were accused falsely, not truthfully. …
an5.167:4.4	You were accused harshly, not gently. …
an5.167:4.5	You were accused harmfully, not beneficially. …
an5.167:4.6	You were accused with secret hate, not lovingly. There’s no need for you to feel remorse.’
an5.167:4.7	A mendicant who is accused improperly should be reassured in these five ways.
an5.167:5.1	The mendicant who makes improper accusations should be chastened in five ways.
an5.167:5.2	‘Reverend, you made an accusation at the wrong time, not at the right time. There’s a reason for you to feel remorse.
an5.167:5.3	You made an accusation falsely, not truthfully. …
an5.167:5.4	You made an accusation harshly, not gently. …
an5.167:5.5	You made an accusation harmfully, not beneficially. …
an5.167:5.6	You made an accusation with secret hate, not lovingly. There’s a reason for you to feel remorse.’
an5.167:5.7	The mendicant who makes improper accusations should be chastened in these five ways.
an5.167:5.8	Why is that?
an5.167:5.9	So that another mendicant wouldn’t think to make a false accusation.
an5.167:6.1	Take a case where I see a certain person being accused at the right time, not being disturbed at the wrong time. They’re accused truthfully, not disturbed falsely. They’re accused gently, not disturbed harshly. They’re accused beneficially, not disturbed harmfully. They’re accused lovingly, not disturbed with secret hate.
an5.167:7.1	The mendicant who is accused properly should be chastened in five ways.

an5.167:8.6	You made an accusation lovingly, not with secret hate. There’s no need for you to feel remorse.’
an5.167:8.7	The mendicant who makes proper accusations should be reassured in these five ways.
an5.167:8.8	Why is that?
an5.167:8.9	So that another mendicant would think to make a true accusation.
an5.167:9.1	A person who is accused should ground themselves in two things:
an5.167:9.2	truth and an even temper.
an5.167:9.3	Even if others accuse me—at the right time or the wrong time, truthfully or falsely, gently or harshly, beneficially or harmfully, lovingly or with secret hate—I will still ground myself in two things:
an5.167:9.4	truth and an even temper.
an5.167:9.5	If I know that

They’re restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They do not guard their sense doors or eat in moderation, and they are not dedicated to wakefulness. They don’t care about the ascetic life, and don’t keenly respect the training. They’re indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, lazy, and lacking energy. They’re unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds, witless and stupid. When I speak to them like this, they don’t respectfully take it up.

an5.168:1.5	When there is no disillusionment and dispassion, one who lacks disillusionment and dispassion has destroyed a vital condition for knowledge and vision of freedom.
an5.168:1.6	Suppose there was a tree that lacked branches and foliage.
an5.168:1.7	Its shoots, bark, softwood, and heartwood would not grow to fullness.

an5.168:2.1	An ethical person, who has fulfilled ethics, has fulfilled a vital condition for right immersion.
an5.168:2.2	When there is right immersion, one who has fulfilled right immersion has fulfilled a vital condition for true knowledge and vision.
an5.168:2.3	When there is true knowledge and vision, one who has fulfilled true knowledge and vision has fulfilled a vital condition for disillusionment and dispassion.
an5.168:2.4	When there is disillusionment and dispassion, one who has fulfilled disillusionment and dispassion has fulfilled a vital condition for knowledge and vision of freedom.
an5.168:2.5	Suppose there was a tree that was complete with branches and foliage. Its shoots, bark, softwood, and heartwood would grow to fullness.

an5.169:2.1	“Reverend Sāriputta, how are we to define a mendicant who is quick-witted when it comes to skillful teachings, who learns well, learns much, and does not forget what they’ve learned?”
an5.169:2.2	“Well, Venerable Ānanda, you’re very learned.
an5.169:2.3	Why don’t you clarify this yourself?”
an5.169:2.4	“Well then, Reverend Sāriputta, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an5.169:2.5	“Yes, reverend,” Sāriputta replied.
an5.169:2.6	Venerable Ānanda said this:
an5.169:3.1	“It’s when a mendicant is skilled in the meaning, skilled in the teaching, skilled in terminology, skilled in phrasing, and skilled in sequence.

an5.170:1.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and Venerable Ānanda said to him:
an5.170:1.4	“Reverend Bhaddaji, what is the best sight, the best sound, the best happiness, the best perception, and the best state of existence?”
an5.170:2.1	“Reverend, there is this Brahmā, the undefeated, the champion, the universal seer, the wielder of power. When you see Brahmā, that’s the best sight.
an5.170:2.2	There are the gods called ‘of streaming radiance’, who are drenched and steeped in pleasure.
an5.170:2.3	Every so often they feel inspired to exclaim:
an5.170:2.4	‘Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!’
an5.170:2.5	When you hear that, it’s the best sound.
an5.170:2.6	There are the gods called ‘replete with glory’.
an5.170:2.7	Since they’re truly content, they experience pleasure. This is the best happiness.
an5.170:2.8	There are the gods reborn in the dimension of nothingness. This is the best perception.
an5.170:2.9	There are the gods reborn in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. This is the best state of existence.”
an5.170:2.10	“So, Venerable Bhaddaji, do you agree with what most people say about this?”
an5.170:3.1	“Well, Venerable Ānanda, you’re very learned.

an5.170:4.2	What you hear when the defilements end in the present life is the best sound.
an5.170:4.3	The happiness you feel when the defilements end in the present life is the best happiness.

an5.174:1.1	Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
an5.174:2.1	“Householder, unless these five dangers and threats are given up, one is said to be unethical, and is reborn in hell.

an5.174:2.3	Killing living creatures, stealing, committing sexual misconduct, lying, and using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.

an5.174:3.4	Once these five dangers and threats are given up, one is said to be ethical, and is reborn in heaven.
an5.174:4.1	Anyone who kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. Anyone who refrains from killing living creatures creates no dangers and threats either in the present life or in lives to come, and doesn’t experience mental pain and sadness.
an5.174:4.2	So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from killing living creatures.

an5.174:6.1	Anyone who commits sexual misconduct …
an5.174:7.1	Anyone who lies …

Anyone who refrains from using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates no dangers and threats either in the present life or in lives to come, and doesn’t experience mental pain and sadness.
an5.174:8.2	So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.

an5.179:1.2	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta:
an5.179:1.3	“You should know this, Sāriputta, about those white-clothed laypeople whose actions are restrained in the five precepts, and who get four blissful meditations in the present life belonging to the higher mind when they want, without trouble or difficulty. They may, if they wish, declare of themselves:
an5.179:1.4	‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’
an5.179:2.1	And what are the five precepts in which their actions are restrained?
an5.179:2.2	It’s when a noble disciple doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or use alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
an5.179:2.3	These are the five precepts in which their actions are restrained.
an5.179:3.1	And what are the four blissful meditations in the present life belonging to the higher mind that they get when they want, without trouble or difficulty?
an5.179:3.2	It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha:
an5.179:3.3	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
an5.179:3.4	This is the first blissful meditation in the present life belonging to the higher mind, which they achieve in order to purify the unpurified mind and cleanse the unclean mind.
an5.179:4.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the teaching:
an5.179:4.2	‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’
an5.179:4.3	This is the second blissful meditation …
an5.179:5.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Saṅgha:
an5.179:5.2	‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’
an5.179:5.3	This is the third blissful meditation …
an5.179:6.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.
an5.179:6.2	This is the fourth blissful meditation in the present life belonging to the higher mind, which they achieve in order to purify the unpurified mind and cleanse the unclean mind.
an5.179:6.3	These are the four blissful meditations in the present life belonging to the higher mind that they get when they want, without trouble or difficulty.
an5.179:7.1	You should know this, Sāriputta, about those white-clothed laypeople whose actions are restrained in the five precepts, and who get four blissful meditations in the present life belonging to the higher mind when they want, without trouble or difficulty. They may, if they wish, declare of themselves:
an5.179:7.2	‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’
an5.179:8.1	Seeing the peril in the hells,
an5.179:8.2	you should shun bad deeds.
an5.179:8.3	Taking up the teaching of the noble ones,
an5.179:8.4	an astute person should shun them.
an5.179:9.1	You shouldn’t harm living beings,
an5.179:9.2	so long as strength is found.
an5.179:9.3	Nor should you knowingly speak falsehood,
an5.179:9.4	or take what is not given.
an5.179:10.1	Content with your own partners,
an5.179:10.2	you should stay away from the partners of others.
an5.179:10.3	A man shouldn’t drink liquor or wine,
an5.179:10.4	as they confuse the mind.
an5.179:11.1	You should recollect the Buddha,
an5.179:11.2	and reflect on the teaching.
an5.179:11.3	You should develop a harmless mind of welfare,
an5.179:11.4	which leads to the realms of gods.
an5.179:12.1	When suitable gifts to give are available
an5.179:12.2	to someone who seeks and needs merit,
an5.179:12.3	a religious donation is abundant
an5.179:12.4	if given first to the peaceful ones.
an5.179:13.1	I will tell of the peaceful ones,
an5.179:13.2	Sāriputta, listen to me.
an5.179:13.3	Cows may be black or white,
an5.179:13.4	red or tawny,
an5.179:14.1	mottled or uniform,
an5.179:14.2	or pigeon-colored.
an5.179:14.3	But when one is born among them,
an5.179:14.4	the bull that’s tamed,
an5.179:15.1	—a behemoth, powerful,
an5.179:15.2	well-paced in pulling forward—
an5.179:15.3	they yoke the load just to him,
an5.179:15.4	regardless of his color.
an5.179:16.1	So it is for humans,
an5.179:16.2	wherever they may be born,
an5.179:16.3	—among aristocrats, brahmins, merchants,
an5.179:16.4	workers, or outcastes and scavengers—
an5.179:17.1	but when one is born among them,
an5.179:17.2	tamed, true to their vows.
an5.179:17.3	Firm in principle, accomplished in ethical conduct,
an5.179:17.4	truthful, conscientious,
an5.179:18.1	they’ve given up birth and death,
an5.179:18.2	and have completed the spiritual journey.
an5.179:18.3	With burden put down, detached,
an5.179:18.4	they’ve completed the task and are free of defilements.
an5.179:19.1	Gone beyond all things,
an5.179:19.2	they’re extinguished by not grasping.
an5.179:19.3	In that flawless field,
an5.179:19.4	a religious donation is abundant.
an5.179:20.1	Fools who don’t understand
an5.179:20.2	—stupid, uneducated—
an5.179:20.3	give their gifts to those outside,
an5.179:20.4	and don’t attend the peaceful ones.
an5.179:21.1	But those who do attend the peaceful ones
an5.179:21.2	—wise, esteemed as sages—
an5.179:21.3	and whose faith in the Holy One
an5.179:21.4	has roots planted deep,
an5.179:22.1	they go to the realm of the gods,
an5.179:22.2	or are born here in a good family.
an5.179:22.3	Gradually those astute ones
an5.179:22.4	reach extinguishment.”

an5.180:0.2	18. A Lay Follower
an5.180:0.3	180. About Gavesī
an5.180:1.1	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.
an5.180:1.2	While traveling along a road the Buddha saw a large sal grove in a certain spot.
an5.180:1.3	He left the road, went to the sal grove, and plunged deep into it. And at a certain spot he smiled.
an5.180:2.1	Then Venerable Ānanda thought,
an5.180:2.2	“What is the cause, what is the reason why the Buddha smiled?
an5.180:2.3	Realized Ones do not smile for no reason.”
an5.180:2.4	So Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,
an5.180:2.5	“What is the cause, what is the reason why the Buddha smiled?
an5.180:2.6	Realized Ones do not smile for no reason.”
an5.180:3.1	“Once upon a time, Ānanda, there was a city in this spot that was successful and prosperous and full of people.
an5.180:3.2	And Kassapa, a blessed one, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, lived supported by that city.
an5.180:3.3	He had a lay follower called Gavesī who had not fulfilled all the precepts.
an5.180:3.4	And the five hundred lay followers who were taught and advised by Gavesī also had not fulfilled all the precepts.
an5.180:3.5	Then Gavesī thought:
an5.180:3.6	‘I’m the helper, leader, and adviser of these five hundred lay followers, yet neither I nor they have fulfilled the precepts.
an5.180:3.7	We’re the same, I’m in no way better.
an5.180:3.8	So let me do better.’
an5.180:4.1	Then Gavesī went to those five hundred lay followers and said to them:
an5.180:4.2	‘From this day forth may the venerables remember me as one who has fulfilled the precepts.’
an5.180:4.3	Then those five hundred lay followers thought:
an5.180:4.4	‘The venerable Gavesī is our helper, leader, and adviser,
an5.180:4.5	and now he will fulfill the precepts.
an5.180:4.6	Why don’t we do the same?’
an5.180:4.7	Then those five hundred lay followers went to Gavesī and said to him:
an5.180:4.8	‘From this day forth may Venerable Gavesī remember these five hundred lay followers as having fulfilled the precepts.’
an5.180:4.9	Then Gavesī thought:
an5.180:4.10	‘I’m the helper, leader, and adviser of these five hundred lay followers, and both I and they have fulfilled the precepts.
an5.180:4.11	We’re the same, I’m in no way better.
an5.180:4.12	So let me do better.’
an5.180:5.1	Then Gavesī went to those five hundred lay followers and said to them:
an5.180:5.2	‘From this day forth may the venerables remember me as one who is celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex.’
an5.180:5.3	Then those five hundred lay followers did the same. …

an5.180:5.12	NA
an5.180:5.13	NA
an5.180:5.14	are celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex.
an5.180:5.15	We’re the same, I’m in no way better.
an5.180:5.16	So let me do better.’
an5.180:6.1	Then Gavesī went to those five hundred lay followers and said to them:
an5.180:6.2	‘From this day forth may the venerables remember me as one who eats in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night, and from food at the wrong time.’
an5.180:6.3	Then those five hundred lay followers did the same. …

an5.180:6.18	So let me do better.’
an5.180:7.1	Then the lay follower Gavesī went up to the blessed one Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha and said to him:
an5.180:7.2	‘Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?’
an5.180:7.3	And he received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.
an5.180:7.4	Not long after his ordination, the mendicant Gavesī, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
an5.180:7.5	He understood: ‘Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.’
an5.180:7.6	And the mendicant Gavesī became one of the perfected.
an5.180:8.1	Then those five hundred lay followers thought:
an5.180:8.2	‘Venerable Gavesī is our helper, leader, and adviser,
an5.180:8.3	He has shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and gone forth from the lay life to homelessness.
an5.180:8.4	Why don’t we do the same?’
an5.180:8.5	Then those five hundred lay followers went up to the blessed one Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha and said to him:
an5.180:8.6	‘Sir, may we receive the going forth and ordination in the Buddha’s presence?’
an5.180:8.7	And they did receive the going forth and ordination in the Buddha’s presence.
an5.180:9.1	Then the mendicant Gavesī thought:
an5.180:9.2	‘I get the supreme bliss of freedom whenever I want, without trouble or difficulty.
an5.180:9.3	Oh, may these five hundred mendicants do the same!’
an5.180:9.4	Then those five hundred mendicants, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. They lived having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
an5.180:9.5	NA
an5.180:9.6	They understood: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’
an5.180:10.1	And so, Ānanda, those five hundred mendicants headed by Gavesī, trying to go higher and higher, better and better, realized the supreme bliss of freedom.
an5.180:10.2	So you should train like this:
an5.180:10.3	‘Trying to go higher and higher, better and better, we will realize the supreme bliss of freedom.’
an5.180:10.4	That’s how you should train.”

an5.192:0.3	192. With the Brahmin Doṇa
an5.192:1.1	Then Doṇa the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
an5.192:1.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, Doṇa sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:
an5.192:2.1	“Master Gotama, I have heard that
an5.192:2.2	the ascetic Gotama doesn’t bow to old brahmins, the elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat.
an5.192:2.3	And this is indeed the case,
an5.192:2.4	for Master Gotama does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat.
an5.192:2.5	This is not appropriate, Master Gotama.”
an5.192:2.6	“Doṇa, do you too claim to be a brahmin?”
an5.192:2.7	“Master Gotama, if anyone should be rightly called
an5.192:2.8	a brahmin, it’s me.
an5.192:2.9	NA
an5.192:2.10	NA
an5.192:2.11	For I am well born on both my mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation. I recite and remember the hymns, and have mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. I know philology and grammar, and am well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.”
an5.192:3.1	“Doṇa, the ancient brahmin hermits were Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu. They were the authors and propagators of the hymns, whose hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times. These days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it. They continue chanting what was chanted, reciting what was recited, and teaching what was taught.
an5.192:3.2	Those seers described five kinds of brahmins.
an5.192:3.3	A brahmin who is equal to Brahmā, one who is equal to a god, one who toes the line, one who crosses the line, and the fifth is a brahmin outcaste.
an5.192:3.4	Which one of these are you, Doṇa?”
an5.192:4.1	“Master Gotama, we don’t know about these five kinds of brahmins. We just know the word ‘brahmin’.
an5.192:4.2	Master Gotama, please teach me this matter so I can learn about these five brahmins.”
an5.192:4.3	“Well then, brahmin, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an5.192:4.4	“Yes sir,” Doṇa replied.
an5.192:4.5	The Buddha said this:
an5.192:5.1	“Doṇa, how is a brahmin equal to Brahmā?
an5.192:5.2	It’s when a brahmin is well born on both the mother’s and the father’s sides, coming from a clean womb back to the seventh paternal generation, incontestable and irreproachable in discussions about ancestry.
an5.192:5.3	NA
an5.192:5.4	For forty-eight years he leads the virginal spiritual life studying the hymns.
an5.192:5.5	Then he seeks a fee for his teacher, but only by legitimate means, not illegitimate.
an5.192:6.1	In this context, Doṇa, what is legitimate?
an5.192:6.2	Not by farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions, but solely by living on alms, not scorning the alms bowl.
an5.192:6.3	Having offered the fee to his teacher, he shaves off his hair and beard, dresses in ocher robes, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness.
an5.192:6.4	Then they meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
an5.192:6.5	They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion …
an5.192:6.6	rejoicing …
an5.192:6.7	equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
an5.192:6.8	Having developed these four Brahmā meditations, when the body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a Brahmā realm.
an5.192:6.9	That’s how a brahmin is equal to Brahmā.
an5.192:7.1	And how is a brahmin equal to a god?

an5.192:7.8	Having offered the fee to his teacher, he seeks a wife, but only by legitimate means, not illegitimate.
an5.192:8.1	In this context, Doṇa, what is legitimate?
an5.192:8.2	Not by buying or selling, he only accepts a brahmin woman by the pouring of water.
an5.192:8.3	He has sex only with a brahmin woman. He does not have sex with a woman from a caste of aristocrats, merchants, workers, outcastes, hunters, bamboo workers, chariot-makers, or waste-collectors. Nor does he have sex with women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or outside the fertile half of the month that starts with menstruation.
an5.192:8.4	And why does the brahmin not have sex with a pregnant woman?
an5.192:8.5	If a brahmin had sex with a pregnant woman, the boy or girl would be born in too much filth.
an5.192:8.6	That’s why the brahmin doesn’t have sex with a pregnant woman.
an5.192:8.7	And why does the brahmin not have sex with a breastfeeding woman?
an5.192:8.8	If a brahmin had sex with a breastfeeding woman, the boy or girl would drink back the semen.
an5.192:8.9	That’s why the brahmin doesn’t have sex with a breastfeeding woman.
an5.192:8.10	And why does the brahmin not have sex outside the fertile half of the month that starts with menstruation? Because his brahmin wife is not there for sensual pleasure, fun, and enjoyment, but only for procreation.
an5.192:8.11	Having ensured his progeny through sex, he shaves off his hair and beard, dresses in ocher robes, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness.
an5.192:8.12	When he has gone forth, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, he enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.
an5.192:8.13	Having developed these four absorptions, when the body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
an5.192:8.14	That’s how a brahmin is equal to god.
an5.192:9.1	And how does a brahmin toe the line?

an5.192:10.12	As far as the line of the ancient brahmins extends, he doesn’t cross over it.
an5.192:10.13	That’s why he’s called a brahmin who toes the line.
an5.192:10.14	That’s how a brahmin toes the line.

an5.192:14.3	His brahmin wife is there for sensual pleasure, fun, and enjoyment, as well as for procreation.
an5.192:14.4	He earns a living by any kind of work.
an5.192:14.5	The brahmins say to him,
an5.192:14.6	‘My good man, why is it that you claim to be a brahmin, but you earn a living by any kind of work?’
an5.192:14.7	He says,
an5.192:14.8	‘It’s like a fire that burns both pure and filthy substances, but doesn’t become corrupted by them.
an5.192:14.9	In the same way, my good man, if a brahmin earns a living by any kind of work, he is not corrupted by that.’
an5.192:14.10	A brahmin is called a brahmin outcaste because he earns a living by any kind of work.
an5.192:14.11	That’s how a brahmin is a brahmin outcaste.
an5.192:15.1	Doṇa, the ancient brahmin hermits were Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu. They were the authors and propagators of the hymns, whose hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times. These days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it. They continue chanting what was chanted, reciting what was recited, and teaching what was taught.
an5.192:15.2	Those hermits described five kinds of brahmins.
an5.192:15.3	A brahmin who is equal to Brahmā, one who is equal to a god, one who toes the line, one who crosses the line, and the fifth is a brahmin outcaste.
an5.192:15.4	Which one of these are you, Doṇa?”
an5.192:16.1	“This being so, Master Gotama, I don’t even qualify as a brahmin outcaste.
an5.192:16.2	Excellent, Master Gotama! … From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

an5.194:0.3	194. With Kāraṇapālī
an5.194:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
an5.194:1.2	Now at that time the brahmin Kāraṇapālī was working for the Licchavis.
an5.194:1.3	He saw the brahmin Piṅgiyānī coming off in the distance
an5.194:1.4	and said to him,
an5.194:2.1	“So, Piṅgiyānī, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”
an5.194:2.2	“I’m coming, my good man, from the presence of the ascetic Gotama.”
an5.194:2.3	“What do you think of the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom? Do you think he’s astute?”
an5.194:2.4	“My good man, who am I to judge the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom?
an5.194:2.5	You’d really have to be on the same level to judge his lucidity of wisdom.”
an5.194:2.6	“Master Piṅgiyānī praises the ascetic Gotama with magnificent praise indeed.”
an5.194:2.7	“Who am I to praise the ascetic Gotama?
an5.194:2.8	He is praised by the praised as the first among gods and humans.”
an5.194:2.9	“But for what reason are you so devoted to the ascetic Gotama?”
an5.194:3.1	“Suppose a person was completely satisfied by the best tasting food. They wouldn’t be attracted to anything that tasted inferior.
an5.194:3.2	In the same way, when you hear the ascetic Gotama’s teaching—
an5.194:3.3	whatever it may be, whether statements, songs, discussions, or amazing stories—
an5.194:3.4	then you’re not attracted to the doctrines of the various ascetics and brahmins.
an5.194:4.1	Suppose a person who was weak with hunger was to obtain a honey-cake.
an5.194:4.2	Wherever they taste it, they would enjoy a sweet, delicious flavor.

an5.194:4.4	whatever it may be, whether statements, songs, discussions, or amazing stories—
an5.194:4.5	then you get a sense of uplift, a confidence of the heart.
an5.194:5.1	Suppose a person were to obtain a piece of sandalwood,
an5.194:5.2	whether yellow or red.
an5.194:5.3	Wherever they smelled it—
an5.194:5.4	whether at the root, the middle, or the top—
an5.194:5.5	they’d enjoy a delicious fragrance.
an5.194:5.6	In the same way, when you hear the ascetic Gotama’s teaching—
an5.194:5.7	whatever it may be, whether statements, songs, discussions, or amazing stories—
an5.194:5.8	then you become filled with joy and happiness.
an5.194:6.1	Suppose there was a person who was sick, suffering, gravely ill.
an5.194:6.2	A good doctor would cure them on the spot.
an5.194:6.3	In the same way, when you hear the ascetic Gotama’s teaching—
an5.194:6.4	whatever it may be, whether statements, songs, discussions, or amazing stories—
an5.194:6.5	then you make an end of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
an5.194:7.1	Suppose there was a lotus pond with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful.
an5.194:7.2	Then along comes a person struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched.
an5.194:7.3	They’d plunge into the lotus pond to bathe and drink. And all their stress, weariness, and heat exhaustion would die down.
an5.194:7.4	In the same way, when you hear the ascetic Gotama’s teaching—
an5.194:7.5	whatever it may be, whether statements, songs, discussions, or amazing stories—
an5.194:7.6	then all your stress, weariness, and exhaustion die down.”
an5.194:8.1	When this was said, the brahmin Kāraṇapālī got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times:
an5.194:9.1	“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!
an5.194:10.1	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!
an5.194:11.1	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!
an5.194:12.1	Excellent, Master Piṅgiyānī! Excellent!
an5.194:12.2	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Piṅgiyānī has made the teaching clear in many ways.
an5.194:12.3	I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
an5.194:12.4	From this day forth, may Master Piṅgiyānī remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

an5.195:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
an5.195:1.2	Now at that time around five hundred Licchavis were visiting the Buddha.
an5.195:1.3	Some of the Licchavis were in blue, of blue color, clad in blue, adorned with blue. And some were similarly colored in yellow, red, or white.
an5.195:1.4	But the Buddha outshone them all in beauty and glory.
an5.195:2.1	Then the brahmin Piṅgīyānī got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,
an5.195:2.2	“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!”
an5.195:2.3	“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha.
an5.195:2.4	So the brahmin Piṅgīyānī extolled the Buddha in his presence with a fitting verse.
an5.195:3.1	“Like a fragrant pink lotus
an5.195:3.2	that blooms in the morning, its fragrance unfaded—
an5.195:3.3	see Aṅgīrasa shine,
an5.195:3.4	bright as the sun in the sky!”
an5.195:4.1	Then those Licchavis clothed Piṅgiyānī with five hundred upper robes.
an5.195:4.2	And Piṅgiyānī clothed the Buddha with them.
an5.195:5.1	Then the Buddha said to the Licchavis:
an5.195:5.2	“Licchavis, the appearance of five treasures is rare in the world.
an5.195:5.3	What five?
an5.195:5.4	A Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha.
an5.195:5.5	A person who explains the teaching and training proclaimed by a Realized One.
an5.195:5.6	A person who understands the teaching and training proclaimed by a Realized One.
an5.195:5.7	A person who practices in line with the teaching.

an5.196:1.1	“Mendicants, before his awakening five great dreams appeared to the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, when he was still not awake but intent on awakening.
an5.196:1.2	What five?
an5.196:1.3	This great earth was his bed. Himalaya, king of mountains, was his pillow. His left hand was laid down in the eastern sea. His right hand was laid down in the western sea. And both his feet were laid down in the southern sea.
an5.196:1.4	This is the first great dream that appeared to the Realized One before his awakening.
an5.196:2.1	Next, a kind of grass called ‘the crosser’ grew up from his navel and stood pressing against the cloudy sky.
an5.196:2.2	This is the second great dream that appeared to the Realized One before his awakening.
an5.196:3.1	Next, white caterpillars with black heads crawled up from his feet and covered his knees.

an6.1:1.1	So I have heard.
an6.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an6.1:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
an6.1:1.4	“Mendicants!”
an6.1:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.
an6.1:1.6	The Buddha said this:
an6.1:2.1	“Mendicants, a mendicant with six qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.
an6.1:2.2	What six?
an6.1:2.3	It’s a mendicant who, when they see a sight with their eyes, is neither happy nor sad. They remain equanimous, mindful and aware.
an6.1:2.4	When they hear a sound with their ears …
an6.1:2.5	When they smell an odor with their nose …
an6.1:2.6	When they taste a flavor with their tongue …
an6.1:2.7	When they feel a touch with their body …
an6.1:2.8	When they know a thought with their mind, they’re neither happy nor sad. They remain equanimous, mindful and aware.
an6.1:2.9	A mendicant with these six qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”
an6.1:3.1	That is what the Buddha said.
an6.1:3.2	Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.

an6.2:1.1	“Mendicants, a mendicant with six qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.
an6.2:1.2	What six?
an6.2:1.3	It’s a mendicant who wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. They control the body as far as the Brahmā realm.
an6.2:2.1	With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.
an6.2:3.1	They understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind.
an6.2:3.2	They understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’,
an6.2:3.3	and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’.
an6.2:3.4	They understand mind with hate …
an6.2:3.5	mind without hate …
an6.2:3.6	mind with delusion …
an6.2:3.7	mind without delusion …
an6.2:3.8	constricted mind …
an6.2:3.9	scattered mind …

an6.2:3.14	mind immersed in samādhi …
an6.2:3.15	mind not immersed in samādhi …
an6.2:3.16	freed mind …
an6.2:3.17	They understand unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’.
an6.2:4.1	They recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
an6.2:5.1	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
an6.2:6.1	They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.

an6.10:0.3	10. With Mahānāma
an6.10:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.
an6.10:1.2	Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an6.10:1.3	“Sir, when a noble disciple has reached the fruit and understood the instructions, what kind of meditation do they frequently practice?”
an6.10:2.1	“Mahānāma, when a noble disciple has reached the fruit and understood the instructions they frequently practice this kind of meditation.
an6.10:2.2	Firstly, a noble disciple recollects the Realized One:
an6.10:2.3	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
an6.10:2.4	When a noble disciple recollects the Realized One their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion.
an6.10:2.5	At that time their mind is unswerving, based on the Realized One.
an6.10:2.6	A noble disciple whose mind is unswerving finds inspiration in the meaning and the teaching, and finds joy connected with the teaching.
an6.10:2.7	When they’re joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when they’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.

an6.10:4.2	‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’

an6.13:6.5	It’s impossible, reverend, it cannot happen that the conceit “I am” has been done away with, and nothing is regarded as “I am this”,
an6.13:6.6	yet somehow the dart of doubt and indecision still occupies the mind.

an6.16:8.4	Soon after recovering, leaning on a staff he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

an6.17:1.13	The Buddha spent most of the night sitting meditation, then got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.
an6.17:1.14	And soon after the Buddha left those venerables each went to their own dwelling.
an6.17:1.15	But those mendicants who were junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training slept until the sun came up, snoring.
an6.17:1.16	The Buddha saw them doing this, with his clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman.
an6.17:1.17	He went to the assembly hall, sat down on the seat spread out,
an6.17:1.18	and addressed the mendicants:

Their sense doors are unguarded, they eat too much, they’re not dedicated to wakefulness, they’re unable to discern skillful qualities, and they don’t pursue the development of the qualities that lead to awakening in the evening and toward dawn. Yet they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.”

an6.18:4.9	I too have never seen or heard of such a thing.
an6.18:4.10	NA
an6.18:4.11	Why is that?
an6.18:4.12	Because when the deer are led to the slaughter he regards them with bad intentions.
an6.18:4.13	By regarding even animals led to the slaughter with bad intentions you don’t get to travel by elephant, horse, chariot, or vehicle, or to enjoy wealth, or to live off a large fortune.
an6.18:4.14	How much worse is someone who regards human beings brought to the slaughter with bad intentions!
an6.18:4.15	This will be for their lasting harm and suffering.

an6.19:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house.
an6.19:1.2	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
an6.19:1.3	“Mendicants!”
an6.19:1.4	“Venerable sir,” they replied.
an6.19:1.5	The Buddha said this:
an6.19:1.6	“Mendicants, when mindfulness of death is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless.
an6.19:1.7	But do you develop mindfulness of death?”
an6.19:2.1	When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha,
an6.19:2.2	“Sir, I develop mindfulness of death.”
an6.19:2.3	“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”
an6.19:2.4	“In this case, sir, I think:
an6.19:2.5	‘Oh, if I’d only live for another day and night, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’
an6.19:2.6	That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”

an6.19:3.2	“Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”
an6.19:3.3	“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”

an6.19:4.6	That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”
an6.19:5.1	Another mendicant said to the Buddha,
an6.19:5.2	“Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”
an6.19:5.3	“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”
an6.19:5.4	“In this case, sir, I think:
an6.19:5.5	‘Oh, if I’d only live as long as it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’
an6.19:5.6	That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”
an6.19:6.1	Another mendicant said to the Buddha,
an6.19:6.2	“Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”
an6.19:6.3	“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”
an6.19:6.4	“In this case, sir, I think:
an6.19:6.5	‘Oh, if I’d only live as long as it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’
an6.19:6.6	That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”
an6.19:7.1	Another mendicant said to the Buddha,
an6.19:7.2	“Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”
an6.19:7.3	“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”
an6.19:7.4	“In this case, sir, I think:
an6.19:7.5	‘Oh, if I’d only live as long as it takes to breathe out after breathing in, or to breathe in after breathing out, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’
an6.19:7.6	That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”
an6.19:8.1	When this was said, the Buddha said to those mendicants:
an6.19:8.2	“As to the mendicants who develop mindfulness of death by wishing
an6.19:8.3	to live for a day and night …
an6.19:9.1	NA
an6.19:9.2	or to live for a day …
an6.19:10.1	NA

an6.19:11.1	NA
an6.19:11.2	or to live as long as it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls—
an6.19:12.1	these are called mendicants who live negligently. They slackly develop mindfulness of death for the ending of defilements.
an6.19:13.1	But as to the mendicants who develop mindfulness of death by wishing
an6.19:13.2	to live as long as it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful …
an6.19:14.1	NA
an6.19:14.2	or to live as long as it takes to breathe out after breathing in, or to breathe in after breathing out—
an6.19:15.1	these are called mendicants who live diligently. They keenly develop mindfulness of death for the ending of defilements.
an6.19:16.1	So you should train like this:
an6.19:16.2	‘We will live diligently. We will keenly develop mindfulness of death for the ending of defilements.’
an6.19:16.3	That’s how you should train.”

an6.20:1.3	“Mendicants, when mindfulness of death is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless.
an6.20:1.4	And how is mindfulness of death developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial, to culminate in the deathless and end with the deathless?
an6.20:2.1	As day passes by and night draws close, a mendicant reflects:
an6.20:2.2	‘I might die of many causes.
an6.20:2.3	A snake might bite me, or a scorpion or centipede might sting me.
an6.20:2.4	And if I died from that it would be an obstacle to me.
an6.20:2.5	Or I might stumble off a cliff, or get food poisoning, or suffer a disturbance of bile, phlegm, or piercing winds.
an6.20:2.6	And if I died from that it would stop my practice. ’
an6.20:2.7	That mendicant should reflect:
an6.20:2.8	‘Are there any bad, unskillful qualities that I haven’t given up, which might be an obstacle to me if I die tonight?’
an6.20:3.1	Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that
an6.20:3.2	there are such bad, unskillful qualities. Then in order to give them up they should apply outstanding enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness.
an6.20:3.3	Suppose your clothes or head were on fire. In order to extinguish it, you’d apply intense enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness.
an6.20:3.4	In the same way, in order to give up those bad, unskillful qualities, that mendicant should apply outstanding enthusiasm …
an6.20:4.1	But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that
an6.20:4.2	there are no such bad, unskillful qualities. Then that mendicant should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.

an6.21:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying among the Sakyans near the little village of Sāma, by a lotus pond.
an6.21:1.2	Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire lotus pond, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,
an6.21:2.1	“Sir, three qualities lead to the decline of a mendicant.
an6.21:2.2	What three?
an6.21:2.3	Relishing work, talk, and sleep.
an6.21:2.4	These three qualities lead to the decline of a mendicant.”

an6.21:4.2	Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an6.21:4.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.
an6.21:4.4	The Buddha said this:
an6.21:4.5	“And what, mendicants, are three qualities that lead to decline?
an6.21:4.6	Enjoyment of company, being hard to admonish, and having bad friends.
an6.21:4.7	These three qualities lead to decline.

an6.29:0.3	29. With Udāyī
an6.29:1.1	Then the Buddha said to Udāyī,
an6.29:1.2	“Udāyī, how many topics for recollection are there?”
an6.29:1.3	When he said this, Udāyī kept silent.
an6.29:1.4	And a second time …
an6.29:1.5	NA
an6.29:1.6	NA
an6.29:1.7	and a third time, the Buddha said to him,
an6.29:1.8	“Udāyī, how many topics for recollection are there?”
an6.29:1.9	And a second time and a third time Udāyī kept silent.
an6.29:2.1	Then Venerable Ānanda said to Venerable Udāyī,
an6.29:2.2	“Reverend Udāyī, the teacher is addressing you.”
an6.29:2.3	“Reverend Ānanda, I hear the Buddha.
an6.29:2.4	It’s when a mendicant recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
an6.29:2.5	This is a topic for recollection.”
an6.29:3.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda:
an6.29:3.2	“Ānanda, I know that
an6.29:3.3	this silly man Udāyī is not committed to the higher mind.
an6.29:3.4	Ānanda, how many topics for recollection are there?”
an6.29:4.1	“Sir, there are five topics for recollection.
an6.29:4.2	What five?
an6.29:4.3	Firstly, a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption.
an6.29:4.4	When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to blissful meditation in this very life.
an6.29:5.1	Furthermore, a mendicant focuses on the perception of light, concentrating on the perception of day regardless of whether it’s night or day.
an6.29:5.2	And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance.
an6.29:5.3	When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to knowledge and vision.
an6.29:6.1	Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth.
an6.29:6.2	‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’
an6.29:6.3	When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to giving up sensual desire.
an6.29:7.1	Furthermore, suppose a mendicant were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground. And it had been dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering.
an6.29:7.2	They’d compare it with their own body:
an6.29:7.3	‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’
an6.29:8.1	Or suppose they were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, herons, dogs, tigers, leopards, jackals, and many kinds of little creatures.
an6.29:8.2	They’d compare it with their own body:
an6.29:8.3	‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’
an6.29:9.1	Furthermore, suppose they were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together by sinews …
an6.29:9.2	A skeleton without flesh but smeared with blood, and held together by sinews …
an6.29:9.3	A skeleton rid of flesh and blood, held together by sinews …
an6.29:9.4	Bones rid of sinews scattered in every direction. Here a hand-bone, there a foot-bone, here a shin-bone, there a thigh-bone, here a hip-bone, there a rib-bone, here a back-bone, there an arm-bone, here a neck-bone, there a jaw-bone, here a tooth, there the skull … White bones, the color of shells … Decrepit bones, heaped in a pile … Bones rotted and crumbled to powder.
an6.29:9.5	They’d compare it with their own body:
an6.29:9.6	‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’
an6.29:9.7	When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to uprooting the conceit ‘I am’.
an6.29:10.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
an6.29:10.2	When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to the penetration of many elements.
an6.29:10.3	These are the five topics for recollection.”
an6.29:11.1	“Good, good, Ānanda.
an6.29:11.2	Well then, Ānanda, you should also remember this sixth topic for recollection.
an6.29:11.3	In this case, a mendicant goes out mindfully, returns mindfully, stands mindfully, sits mindfully, lies down mindfully, and applies themselves to work mindfully.
an6.29:11.4	When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to mindfulness and situational awareness.”

an6.30:1.1	“Mendicants, these six things are unsurpassable.
an6.30:1.2	What six?
an6.30:1.3	The unsurpassable seeing, listening, acquisition, training, service, and recollection.
an6.30:2.1	And what is the unsurpassable seeing?
an6.30:2.2	Some people go to see an elephant-treasure, a horse-treasure, a jewel-treasure, or a diverse spectrum of sights; or ascetics and brahmins of wrong view and wrong practice.
an6.30:2.3	There is such a seeing, I don’t deny it.
an6.30:2.4	That seeing is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.
an6.30:2.5	The unsurpassable seeing is when someone with settled faith and love, sure and devoted, goes to see a Realized One or their disciple. This is in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.
an6.30:2.6	This is called the unsurpassable seeing.
an6.30:2.7	Such is the unsurpassable seeing.
an6.30:3.1	But what of the unsurpassable hearing?
an6.30:3.2	Some people go to hear the sound of drums, arched harps, singing, or a diverse spectrum of sounds; or ascetics and brahmins of wrong view and wrong practice.
an6.30:3.3	There is such a hearing, I don’t deny it.
an6.30:3.4	That hearing … doesn’t lead to extinguishment.

an6.30:4.2	Some people acquire a child, a wife, wealth, or a diverse spectrum of things; or they acquire faith in an ascetic or brahmin of wrong view and wrong practice.
an6.30:4.3	There is such an acquisition, I don’t deny it.
an6.30:4.4	That acquisition … doesn’t lead to extinguishment.
an6.30:4.5	The unsurpassable acquisition is when someone with settled faith and love, sure and devoted, acquires faith in a Realized One or their disciple. …
an6.30:4.6	This is called the unsurpassable acquisition.
an6.30:4.7	Such is the unsurpassable seeing, hearing, and acquisition.
an6.30:5.1	But what of the unsurpassable training?
an6.30:5.2	Some people train in elephant riding, horse riding, chariot driving, archery, swordsmanship, or a diverse spectrum of things; or they train under an ascetic or brahmin of wrong view and wrong practice.
an6.30:5.3	There is such a training, I don’t deny it.
an6.30:5.4	That training … doesn’t lead to extinguishment.
an6.30:5.5	The unsurpassable training is when someone with settled faith and love, sure and devoted, trains in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom in the teaching and training proclaimed by a Realized One. …
an6.30:5.6	This is called the unsurpassable training.
an6.30:5.7	Such is the unsurpassable seeing, hearing, acquisition, and training.
an6.30:6.1	But what of the unsurpassable service?
an6.30:6.2	Some people serve an aristocrat, a brahmin, a householder, or a diverse spectrum of people; or they serve ascetics and brahmins of wrong view and wrong practice.
an6.30:6.3	There is such service, I don’t deny it.
an6.30:6.4	That service … doesn’t lead to extinguishment.
an6.30:6.5	The unsurpassable service is when someone with settled faith and love, sure and devoted, serves a Realized One or their disciple. …
an6.30:6.6	This is called the unsurpassable service.
an6.30:6.7	Such is the unsurpassable seeing, listening, acquisition, training, and service.
an6.30:7.1	But what of the unsurpassable recollection?
an6.30:7.2	Some people recollect a child, a wife, wealth, or a diverse spectrum of things; or they recollect an ascetic or brahmin of wrong view and wrong practice.
an6.30:7.3	There is such recollection, I don’t deny it.
an6.30:7.4	That recollection is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.
an6.30:7.5	The unsurpassable recollection is when someone with settled faith and love, sure and devoted, recollects a Realized One or their disciple. …
an6.30:7.6	This is called the unsurpassable recollection.
an6.30:8.1	These are the six unsurpassable things.
an6.30:9.1	They’ve gained the unsurpassed seeing,
an6.30:9.2	the unsurpassed hearing,
an6.30:9.3	and the unsurpassable acquisition.
an6.30:9.4	They enjoy the unsurpassable training
an6.30:10.1	and serve with care.
an6.30:10.2	Then they develop recollection
an6.30:10.3	connected with seclusion,
an6.30:10.4	which is safe, and leads to the deathless.
an6.30:11.1	They rejoice in diligence,
an6.30:11.2	alert and ethically restrained.
an6.30:11.3	And in time they arrive
an6.30:11.4	at the place where suffering ceases.”

an6.32:2.2	What six?
an6.32:2.3	Respect for the Teacher, for the teaching, for the Saṅgha, for the training, for diligence, and for hospitality.

an6.34:0.3	34. With Mahāmoggallāna
an6.34:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an6.34:1.2	Then as Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,
an6.34:1.3	“Which gods know that they are
an6.34:1.4	stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?”
an6.34:1.5	Now, at that time a monk called Tissa had recently passed away and been reborn in a Brahmā realm.
an6.34:1.6	There they knew that
an6.34:1.7	Tissa the Brahmā was very mighty and powerful.
an6.34:2.1	And then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm.
an6.34:2.2	Tissa saw Moggallāna coming off in the distance,
an6.34:2.3	and said to him,
an6.34:2.4	“Come, my good Moggallāna! Welcome, my good Moggallāna!
an6.34:2.5	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.
an6.34:2.6	Sit, my good Moggallāna, this seat is for you.”
an6.34:2.7	Moggallāna sat down on the seat spread out.
an6.34:2.8	Then Tissa bowed to Moggallāna and sat to one side.
an6.34:2.9	Moggallāna said to him,
an6.34:3.1	“Tissa, which gods know that they are stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?”
an6.34:3.2	“The gods of the Four Great Kings know this.”
an6.34:4.1	“But do all of them know this?”
an6.34:4.2	“No, my good Moggallāna, not all of them.
an6.34:4.3	Those who lack experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and lack the ethics loved by the noble ones, do not know that they are stream-enterers.
an6.34:4.4	But those who have experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and have the ethics loved by the noble ones, do know that they are stream-enterers.”
an6.34:5.1	“But Tissa, is it only the gods of the Four Great Kings who know that they are stream-enterers, or do the gods of the Thirty-Three …
an6.34:5.2	the Gods of Yama …
an6.34:5.3	the Joyful Gods …
an6.34:5.4	the Gods Who Love to Create …
an6.34:5.5	and the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others know that they are stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?”
an6.34:5.6	“The gods of these various classes know this.”
an6.34:6.1	“But do all of them know this?”
an6.34:6.2	“No, my good Moggallāna, not all of them.
an6.34:6.3	Those who lack experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and lack the ethics loved by the noble ones, do not know that they are stream-enterers.
an6.34:6.4	But those who have experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and have the ethics loved by the noble ones, do know that they are stream-enterers.”
an6.34:7.1	Moggallāna approved and agreed with what Tissa the Brahmā said. Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from that Brahmā realm and reappeared in Jeta’s Grove.

an6.36:1.1	“Mendicants, there are these six roots of arguments.
an6.36:1.2	What six?
an6.36:1.3	Firstly, a mendicant is irritable and hostile.
an6.36:1.4	Such a mendicant lacks respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and they don’t fulfill the training.
an6.36:1.5	They create a dispute in the Saṅgha, which is for the hurt and unhappiness of the people, for the harm, hurt, and suffering of gods and humans.
an6.36:1.6	If you see such a root of arguments in yourselves or others, you should try to give up this bad thing.
an6.36:1.7	If you don’t see it, you should practice so that it doesn’t come up in the future.
an6.36:1.8	That’s how to give up this bad root of arguments, so it doesn’t come up in the future.
an6.36:2.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is offensive and contemptuous …
an6.36:2.2	They’re jealous and stingy …
an6.36:2.3	devious and deceitful …
an6.36:2.4	with wicked desires and wrong view …
an6.36:2.5	They’re attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go.
an6.36:2.6	Such a mendicant lacks respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and they don’t fulfill the training.
an6.36:2.7	They create a dispute in the Saṅgha, which is for the hurt and unhappiness of the people, for the harm, hurt, and suffering of gods and humans.
an6.36:2.8	If you see such a root of arguments in yourselves or others, you should try to give up this bad thing.
an6.36:2.9	If you don’t see it, you should practice so that it doesn’t come up in the future.
an6.36:2.10	That’s how to give up this bad root of arguments, so it doesn’t come up in the future.

an6.37:0.3	37. A Gift With Six Factors
an6.37:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an6.37:1.2	Now at that time Veḷukaṇṭakī, Nanda’s mother, was preparing a religious donation for the mendicant Saṅgha headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna.
an6.37:1.3	The Buddha saw her doing this, with his clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman,
an6.37:1.4	and he addressed the mendicants:
an6.37:1.5	“This Veḷukaṇṭakī, Nanda’s mother, is preparing a religious donation for the mendicant Saṅgha headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna.
an6.37:2.1	And how does a religious donation have six factors?
an6.37:2.2	Three factors apply to the donor and three to the recipients.
an6.37:2.3	What three factors apply to the donor?
an6.37:2.4	It’s when a donor is in a good mood before giving, while giving they feel confident, and after giving they’re uplifted.
an6.37:2.5	These three factors apply to the donor.
an6.37:3.1	What three factors apply to the recipients?
an6.37:3.2	It’s when the recipients are free of greed, hate, and delusion, or practicing to be free of them.
an6.37:3.3	These three factors apply to the recipients.
an6.37:3.4	Thus three factors apply to the donor and three to the recipients.
an6.37:3.5	That’s how a religious donation has six factors.
an6.37:4.1	It’s not easy to grasp the merit of such an offering by saying that
an6.37:4.2	this is the extent of their overflowing merit, overflowing goodness that nurtures happiness and is conducive to heaven, ripening in happiness and leading to heaven. And it leads to what is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness.
an6.37:4.3	It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.
an6.37:5.1	It’s like trying to grasp how much water is in the ocean. It’s not easy to say
an6.37:5.2	how many gallons, how many hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of gallons there are.
an6.37:5.3	It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water.

an6.37:6.1	A good mood before giving,

an6.37:6.4	this is the perfect sacrifice.
an6.37:7.1	Free of greed, free of hate,
an6.37:7.2	free of delusion, undefiled;
an6.37:7.3	this is the field for the perfect sacrifice,
an6.37:7.4	the disciplined spiritual practitioners.
an6.37:8.1	After rinsing,
an6.37:8.2	you give with your own hands.
an6.37:8.3	This sacrifice is very fruitful
an6.37:8.4	for both yourself and others.
an6.37:9.1	When an intelligent, faithful person,
an6.37:9.2	sacrifices like this, with a mind of letting go,
an6.37:9.3	that astute one is reborn

an6.38:1.1	Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
an6.38:1.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
an6.38:1.3	“Master Gotama, this is my doctrine and view:
an6.38:1.4	One does not act of one’s own volition, nor does one act of another’s volition.”
an6.38:1.5	“Well, brahmin, I’ve never seen or heard of anyone holding such a doctrine or view.

an6.38:1.7	one does not act of one’s own volition, nor does one act of another’s volition?
an6.38:2.1	What do you think, brahmin, is there an element of initiative?”
an6.38:2.2	“Yes, sir.”
an6.38:2.3	“Since this is so, do we find sentient beings who initiate activity?”
an6.38:2.4	“Yes, sir.”
an6.38:2.5	“Since there is an element of initiative, and sentient beings who initiate activity are found, sentient beings act of their own volition or that of another.
an6.38:3.1	What do you think, brahmin, is there an element of persistence …

an6.41:1.3	Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, descended the Vulture’s Peak together with several mendicants. At a certain spot he saw a large tree trunk,

an6.41:1.5	“Reverends, do you see this large tree trunk?”
an6.41:1.6	“Yes, reverend.”
an6.41:2.1	“If they wanted to, a mendicant with psychic powers who has mastered their mind could determine this tree trunk to be nothing but earth.

an6.42:0.3	42. With Nāgita
an6.42:1.1	So I have heard.
an6.42:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Icchānaṅgala.
an6.42:1.3	He stayed in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.
an6.42:1.4	The brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala heard:
an6.42:1.5	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala. He is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.
an6.42:1.6	He has this good reputation:
an6.42:1.7	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
an6.42:1.8	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased; and he explains a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.”
an6.42:1.9	Then, when the night had passed, they took many different foods and went to the forest near Icchānaṅgala, where they stood outside the gates making a dreadful racket.
an6.42:2.1	Now, at that time Venerable Nāgita was the Buddha’s attendant.
an6.42:2.2	Then the Buddha said to Nāgita,
an6.42:2.3	“Nāgita, who’s making that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”
an6.42:2.4	“Sir, it’s these brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala. They’ve brought many different foods, and they’re standing outside the gates wanting to offer it specially to the Buddha and the mendicant Saṅgha.”
an6.42:2.5	“Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to me.
an6.42:2.6	There are those who can’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can.
an6.42:2.7	Let them enjoy the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity.”
an6.42:3.1	“Sir, may the Blessed One please relent now! May the Holy One relent!
an6.42:3.2	Now is the time for the Buddha to relent.
an6.42:3.3	Wherever the Buddha now goes, the brahmins and householders will incline the same way, as will the people of town and country.
an6.42:3.4	It’s like when it rains heavily and the water flows downhill.
an6.42:3.5	In the same way, wherever the Buddha now goes, the brahmins and householders will incline the same way, as will the people of town and country.
an6.42:3.6	Why is that?
an6.42:3.7	Because of the Buddha’s ethics and wisdom.”
an6.42:4.1	“Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to me.
an6.42:4.2	There are those who can’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can.
an6.42:4.3	Let them enjoy the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity.
an6.42:5.1	Take a mendicant living within a village who I see sitting immersed in samādhi.
an6.42:5.2	I think to myself:
an6.42:5.3	‘Now a monastery worker, a novice, or a fellow practitioner will make this venerable fall from immersion.’
an6.42:5.4	So I’m not pleased that that mendicant is living within a village.
an6.42:6.1	Take a mendicant in the wilderness who I see sitting nodding in meditation.
an6.42:6.2	I think to myself:
an6.42:6.3	‘Now this venerable, having dispelled that sleepiness and weariness, will focus just on the unified perception of wilderness.’
an6.42:6.4	So I’m pleased that that mendicant is living in the wilderness.
an6.42:7.1	Take a mendicant in the wilderness who I see sitting without being immersed in samādhi.
an6.42:7.2	I think to myself:
an6.42:7.3	‘Now if this venerable’s mind is not immersed in samādhi they will immerse it, or if it is immersed in samādhi, they will preserve it.’
an6.42:7.4	So I’m pleased that that mendicant is living in the wilderness.
an6.42:8.1	Take a mendicant in the wilderness who I see sitting immersed in samādhi.
an6.42:8.2	I think to myself:
an6.42:8.3	‘Now this venerable will free the unfreed mind or preserve the freed mind.’
an6.42:8.4	So I’m pleased that that mendicant is living in the wilderness.
an6.42:9.1	Take a mendicant who I see living within a village receiving robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.
an6.42:9.2	Enjoying possessions, honor, and popularity they neglect retreat, and they neglect remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.
an6.42:9.3	They come down to villages, towns, and capital cities and make their home there.
an6.42:9.4	So I’m not pleased that that mendicant is living within a village.
an6.42:10.1	Take a mendicant who I see in the wilderness receiving robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.
an6.42:10.2	Fending off possessions, honor, and popularity they don’t neglect retreat, and they don’t neglect remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.
an6.42:10.3	So I’m pleased that that mendicant is living in the wilderness.
an6.42:11.1	Nāgita, when I’m walking along a road and I don’t see anyone ahead or behind I feel relaxed, even if I need to urinate or defecate.”

an6.43:0.3	43. The Giant
an6.43:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an6.43:1.2	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
an6.43:1.3	Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Ānanda,
an6.43:1.4	“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother for the day’s meditation.”
an6.43:1.5	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.
an6.43:2.1	So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the Eastern Monastery.
an6.43:2.2	In the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed Ānanda,
an6.43:2.3	“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the eastern gate to bathe.”
an6.43:2.4	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.
an6.43:2.5	So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the eastern gate to bathe.
an6.43:2.6	When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying himself.
an6.43:3.1	Now, at that time King Pasenadi had a giant bull elephant called “White”. It emerged from the eastern gate to the beating and playing of musical instruments.
an6.43:3.2	When people saw it they said,
an6.43:3.3	“The royal giant is so handsome! The royal giant is so good-looking! The royal giant is so lovely! The royal giant has such a huge body!”
an6.43:3.4	When they said this, Venerable Udāyī said to the Buddha,
an6.43:3.5	“Sir, is it only when they see elephants with such a huge, formidable body that people say:
an6.43:3.6	‘A giant, such a giant’? Or do they say it when they see any other creatures with huge, formidable bodies?”
an6.43:3.7	“Udāyī, when they see elephants with such a huge, formidable body people say:
an6.43:3.8	‘A giant, such a giant!’
an6.43:3.9	And also when they see a horse with a huge, formidable body …
an6.43:3.10	When they see a bull with a huge, formidable body …
an6.43:3.11	When they see a snake with a huge, formidable body …
an6.43:3.12	When they see a tree with a huge, formidable body …
an6.43:3.13	And when they see a human being with such a huge, formidable body people say:
an6.43:3.14	‘A giant, such a giant!’
an6.43:3.15	But Udāyī, one who does nothing monstrous by way of body, speech, and mind is who I call a ‘giant’ in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.”
an6.43:4.1	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!
an6.43:4.2	How well said this was by the Buddha:
an6.43:4.3	‘But Udāyī, one who does nothing monstrous by way of body, speech, and mind is who I call a “giant” in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.’
an6.43:4.4	And I celebrate the well-spoken words of the Buddha with these verses:
an6.43:5.1	Awakened as a human being,
an6.43:5.2	self-tamed and immersed in samādhi,
an6.43:5.3	following the spiritual path,
an6.43:5.4	he loves peace of mind.
an6.43:6.1	Revered by people,
an6.43:6.2	gone beyond all things,
an6.43:6.3	even the gods revere him;
an6.43:6.4	so I’ve heard from the perfected one.
an6.43:7.1	He has transcended all fetters
an6.43:7.2	and escaped from entanglements.
an6.43:7.3	Delighting to renounce sensual pleasures,
an6.43:7.4	he’s freed like gold from stone.
an6.43:8.1	That giant outshines all,
an6.43:8.2	like the Himalaya beside other mountains.
an6.43:8.3	Of all those named ‘giant’,
an6.43:8.4	he is truly named, supreme.
an6.43:9.1	I shall extol the giant for you,
an6.43:9.2	for he does nothing monstrous.
an6.43:9.3	Gentleness and harmlessness
an6.43:9.4	are two feet of the giant.
an6.43:10.1	Austerity and celibacy
an6.43:10.2	are his two other feet.
an6.43:10.3	Faith is the giant’s trunk,
an6.43:10.4	and equanimity his white tusks.
an6.43:11.1	Mindfulness is his neck, his head is wisdom—
an6.43:11.2	inquiry and thinking about principles.
an6.43:11.3	His belly is the sacred hearth of the Dhamma,
an6.43:11.4	and his tail is seclusion.
an6.43:12.1	Practicing absorption, enjoying the breath,
an6.43:12.2	he is serene within.
an6.43:12.3	The giant is serene when walking,
an6.43:12.4	the giant is serene when standing,
an6.43:13.1	the giant is serene when lying down,
an6.43:13.2	and when sitting, the giant is serene.
an6.43:13.3	The giant is restrained everywhere:
an6.43:13.4	this is the accomplishment of the giant.
an6.43:14.1	He eats blameless things,
an6.43:14.2	he doesn’t eat blameworthy things.
an6.43:14.3	When he gets food and clothes,
an6.43:14.4	he avoids storing them up.
an6.43:15.1	Having severed all bonds,
an6.43:15.2	fetters large and small,
an6.43:15.3	wherever he goes,
an6.43:15.4	he goes without concern.
an6.43:16.1	A white lotus,
an6.43:16.2	fragrant and delightful,
an6.43:16.3	sprouts in water and grows there,
an6.43:16.4	but water does not stick to it.
an6.43:17.1	Just so the Buddha is born in the world,
an6.43:17.2	and lives in the world,
an6.43:17.3	but the world does not stick to him,
an6.43:17.4	as water does not stick to the lotus.
an6.43:18.1	A great blazing fire
an6.43:18.2	dies down when the fuel runs out.
an6.43:18.3	When the coals have gone out
an6.43:18.4	it’s said to be ‘extinguished’.
an6.43:19.1	This simile is taught by the discerning
an6.43:19.2	to express the meaning clearly.
an6.43:19.3	Great giants will understand
an6.43:19.4	what the giant taught the giant.
an6.43:20.1	Free of greed, free of hate,
an6.43:20.2	free of delusion, undefiled;
an6.43:20.3	the giant, giving up his body,
an6.43:20.4	will become extinguished without defilements.”

an6.44:1.1	Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the laywoman Migasālā, where he sat on the seat spread out.
an6.44:1.2	Then the laywoman Migasālā went up to Ānanda, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
an6.44:2.1	“Sir, Ānanda, how on earth are we supposed to understand the teaching taught by the Buddha, when the chaste and the unchaste are both reborn in exactly the same place in the next life?
an6.44:2.2	My father Purāṇa was celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex.
an6.44:2.3	When he passed away the Buddha declared that he was a once-returner, who was reborn in the host of Joyful Gods.
an6.44:2.4	But my uncle Isidatta was not celibate; he lived content with his wife.
an6.44:2.5	When he passed away the Buddha declared that he was also a once-returner, who was reborn in the host of Joyful Gods.
an6.44:2.6	How on earth are we supposed to understand the teaching taught by the Buddha, when the chaste and the unchaste are both reborn in exactly the same place in the next life?”
an6.44:2.7	“You’re right, sister, but that’s how the Buddha declared it.”
an6.44:3.1	Then Ānanda, after receiving almsfood at Migasālā’s home, rose from his seat and left.

an6.44:18.1	If Isidatta had achieved Purāṇa’s level of ethical conduct, Purāṇa could not have even known Isidatta’s destination.
an6.44:18.2	And if Purāṇa had achieved Isidatta’s level of wisdom, Isidatta could not have even known Purāṇa’s destination.
an6.44:18.3	So both individuals were lacking in one respect.”

an6.45:1.1	“Mendicants, isn’t poverty suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?”
an6.45:1.2	“Yes, sir.”
an6.45:2.1	“When a poor, penniless person falls into debt, isn’t being in debt also suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?”
an6.45:2.2	“Yes, sir.”
an6.45:3.1	“When a poor person who has fallen into debt agrees to pay interest, isn’t the interest also suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?”
an6.45:3.2	“Yes, sir.”
an6.45:4.1	“When a poor person who has fallen into debt and agreed to pay interest fails to pay it when it falls due, they get a warning.
an6.45:4.2	Isn’t being warned suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?”
an6.45:4.3	“Yes, sir.”
an6.45:5.1	“When a poor person fails to pay after getting a warning, they’re prosecuted.
an6.45:5.2	Isn’t being prosecuted suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?”
an6.45:5.3	“Yes, sir.”
an6.45:6.1	“When a poor person fails to pay after being prosecuted, they’re imprisoned.
an6.45:6.2	Isn’t being imprisoned suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?”
an6.45:6.3	“Yes, sir.”
an6.45:7.1	“So mendicants, poverty, debt, interest, warnings, prosecution, and imprisonment are suffering in the world for those who enjoy sensual pleasures.
an6.45:7.2	In the same way, whoever has no faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom when it comes to skillful qualities
an6.45:7.3	is called poor and penniless in the training of the Noble One.
an6.45:8.1	Since they have no faith, conscience, prudence, energy, or wisdom when it comes to skillful qualities, they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.
an6.45:8.2	This is how they’re in debt, I say.
an6.45:9.1	In order to conceal the bad things they do by way of body, speech, and mind they harbour corrupt wishes.
an6.45:9.2	They wish, plan, speak, and act with the thought: ‘May no-one find me out!’
an6.45:9.3	This is how they pay interest, I say.
an6.45:10.1	Good-hearted spiritual companions say this about them:
an6.45:10.2	‘This venerable acts like this, and behaves like that.’
an6.45:10.3	This is how they’re warned, I say.
an6.45:11.1	When they go to a wilderness, the root of a tree, or an empty hut, they’re beset by remorseful, unskillful thoughts.
an6.45:11.2	This is how they’re prosecuted, I say.
an6.45:12.1	That poor, penniless person has done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re trapped in the prison of hell or the animal realm.
an6.45:12.2	I don’t see a single prison that’s as brutal, as vicious, and such an obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary as the prison of hell or the animal realm.
an6.45:13.1	Poverty is said to be suffering in the world,
an6.45:13.2	and so is being in debt.
an6.45:13.3	A poor person who has fallen into debt
an6.45:13.4	frets even when spending the loan.
an6.45:14.1	And then they’re prosecuted,
an6.45:14.2	or even thrown in jail.
an6.45:14.3	Such imprisonment is true suffering
an6.45:14.4	for someone who prays for pleasure and possessions.
an6.45:15.1	In the same way, in the noble one’s training
an6.45:15.2	whoever has no faith,
an6.45:15.3	no conscience or prudence,
an6.45:15.4	contemplates bad deeds.
an6.45:16.1	After doing bad things
an6.45:16.2	by way of body,
an6.45:16.3	speech, and mind,
an6.45:16.4	they wish, ‘May no-one find me out!’
an6.45:17.1	Their behavior is creepy
an6.45:17.2	by body, speech, and mind.
an6.45:17.3	They pile up bad deeds
an6.45:17.4	on and on, life after life.
an6.45:18.1	That stupid evildoer,
an6.45:18.2	knowing their own misdeeds,
an6.45:18.3	is a poor person who has fallen into debt,
an6.45:18.4	and frets even when spending the loan.
an6.45:19.1	And when in village or wilderness
an6.45:19.2	they’re prosecuted
an6.45:19.3	by painful mental plans,
an6.45:19.4	which are born of remorse.
an6.45:20.1	That stupid evildoer,
an6.45:20.2	knowing their own misdeeds,
an6.45:20.3	goes to one of the animal realms,
an6.45:20.4	or is trapped in hell.
an6.45:21.1	Such imprisonment is true suffering,
an6.45:21.2	from which a wise one is released.
an6.45:21.3	With confident heart, they give
an6.45:21.4	with wealth that is properly earned.
an6.45:22.1	That faithful householder
an6.45:22.2	wins both ways:
an6.45:22.3	welfare and benefit in this life,
an6.45:22.4	and happiness in the next.
an6.45:22.5	This is how, for a householder,
an6.45:22.6	merit grows by generosity.
an6.45:23.1	In the same way, in the noble one’s training,
an6.45:23.2	whoever is grounded in faith,
an6.45:23.3	with conscience and prudence,
an6.45:23.4	wise, and ethically restrained,
an6.45:24.1	is said to live happily
an6.45:24.2	in the noble one’s training.
an6.45:24.3	After gaining spiritual bliss,
an6.45:24.4	they concentrate on equanimity.
an6.45:25.1	They give up the five hindrances,
an6.45:25.2	constantly energetic,
an6.45:25.3	and enter the absorptions,
an6.45:25.4	unified, alert, and mindful.
an6.45:26.1	Truly knowing in this way
an6.45:26.2	the end of all fetters,
an6.45:26.3	by not grasping in any way,
an6.45:26.4	their mind is rightly freed.
an6.45:27.1	To that poised one, rightly freed
an6.45:27.2	with the end of the fetters of rebirth,
an6.45:27.3	the knowledge comes:
an6.45:27.4	‘My freedom is unshakable.’
an6.45:28.1	This is the ultimate knowledge.
an6.45:28.2	This is the supreme happiness.
an6.45:28.3	Sorrowless, stainless, secure:
an6.45:28.4	this is the highest freedom from debt.”

an6.46:0.2	5. About Dhammika
an6.46:0.3	46. By Mahācunda
an6.46:1.1	So I have heard.
an6.46:1.2	At one time Venerable Mahācunda was staying in the land of the Cetis at Sahajāti.
an6.46:1.3	There he addressed the mendicants:
an6.46:1.4	“Reverends, mendicants!”
an6.46:1.5	“Reverend,” they replied.
an6.46:1.6	Venerable Mahācunda said this:
an6.46:2.1	“Take a case where mendicants who practice discernment of principles rebuke mendicants who practice absorption meditation:
an6.46:2.2	‘They say, “We practice absorption meditation! We practice absorption meditation!” And they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate.
an6.46:2.3	Why do they practice absorption meditation? In what way do they practice absorption meditation? How do they practice absorption meditation?’
an6.46:2.4	In this case the mendicants who practice discernment of principles are not inspired, and the mendicants who practice absorption meditation are not inspired. And they’re not acting for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.
an6.46:3.1	Now, take a case where mendicants who practice absorption meditation rebuke mendicants who practice discernment of principles:
an6.46:3.2	‘They say, “We practice discernment of principles! We practice discernment of principles!” But they’re restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties.
an6.46:3.3	Why do they practice discernment of principles? In what way do they practice discernment of principles? How do they practice discernment of principles?’
an6.46:3.4	In this case the mendicants who practice absorption meditation are not inspired, and the mendicants who practice discernment of principles are not inspired. And they’re not acting for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.
an6.46:4.1	Now, take a case where mendicants who practice discernment of principles praise only others like them, not mendicants who practice absorption meditation.
an6.46:4.2	In this case the mendicants who practice discernment of principles are not inspired, and the mendicants who practice absorption meditation are not inspired. And they’re not acting for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.
an6.46:5.1	And take a case where mendicants who practice absorption meditation praise only others like them, not mendicants who practice discernment of principles.
an6.46:5.2	In this case the mendicants who practice absorption meditation are not inspired, and the mendicants who practice discernment of principles are not inspired. And they’re not acting for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.
an6.46:6.1	So you should train like this:
an6.46:6.2	‘As mendicants who practice discernment of principles, we will praise mendicants who practice absorption meditation.’
an6.46:6.3	That’s how you should train.
an6.46:6.4	Why is that?
an6.46:6.5	Because it’s incredibly rare to find individuals in the world who have direct meditative experience of the deathless element.
an6.46:7.1	So you should train like this:
an6.46:7.2	‘As mendicants who practice absorption meditation, we will praise mendicants who practice discernment of principles.’
an6.46:7.3	That’s how you should train.
an6.46:7.4	Why is that?
an6.46:7.5	Because it’s incredibly rare to find individuals in the world who see the meaning of a deep saying with penetrating wisdom.”

an6.49:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an6.49:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Khema and Venerable Sumana were staying near Sāvatthī in the Dark Forest.
an6.49:1.3	Then they went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Venerable Khema said to the Buddha:
an6.49:2.1	“Sir, a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—does not think:
an6.49:2.2	‘There is someone better than me, or equal to me, or worse than me.’”
an6.49:2.3	That is what Khema said,

an6.53:3.1	“So what is it?”
an6.53:3.2	“Diligence, brahmin, is one thing that, when developed and cultivated, secures benefits for both the present life and lives to come.
an6.53:4.1	The footprints of all creatures that walk can fit inside an elephant’s footprint. So an elephant’s footprint is said to be the biggest of them all.
an6.53:4.2	In the same way, diligence is one thing that, when developed and cultivated, secures benefits for both the present life and lives to come.
an6.53:5.1	The rafters of a bungalow all lean to the peak, slope to the peak, and meet at the peak, so the peak is said to be the topmost of them all.
an6.53:5.2	In the same way, diligence is one thing …
an6.53:6.1	A reed-cutter, having cut the reeds, grabs them at the top and shakes them down, shakes them about, and shakes them off.
an6.53:6.2	In the same way, diligence is one thing …
an6.53:7.1	When the stalk of a bunch of mangoes is cut, all the mangoes attached to the stalk will follow along.
an6.53:7.2	In the same way, diligence is one thing …
an6.53:8.1	All lesser rulers are vassals of a wheel-turning monarch, so the wheel-turning monarch is said to be the foremost of them all.
an6.53:8.2	In the same way, diligence is one thing …
an6.53:9.1	The radiance of all the stars is not worth a sixteenth part of the moon’s radiance, so the moon’s radiance is said to be the best of them all.
an6.53:9.2	In the same way, diligence is one thing that, when developed and cultivated, secures benefits for both the present life and lives to come.
an6.53:10.1	This is the one thing that, when developed and cultivated, secures benefits for both the present life and lives to come.”
an6.53:11.1	“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! …
an6.53:11.2	From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

an6.54:0.2	5. About Dhammika
an6.54:0.3	54. About Dhammika
an6.54:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
an6.54:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Dhammika was a resident in all seven monasteries of his native land.
an6.54:1.3	There he abused visiting mendicants; he insulted, harmed, attacked, and harassed them.
an6.54:1.4	The visiting mendicants who were treated in this way did not stay. They left, abandoning the monastery.
an6.54:2.1	Then the local lay followers thought to themselves,
an6.54:2.2	“We have supplied the mendicant Saṅgha with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.
an6.54:2.3	But the visiting mendicants don’t stay. They leave, abandoning the monastery.
an6.54:2.4	What is the cause, what is the reason for this?”
an6.54:2.5	Then the local lay followers thought to themselves,
an6.54:2.6	“This Venerable Dhammika abuses visiting mendicants; he insults, harms, attacks, and harasses them.
an6.54:2.7	The visiting mendicants who were treated in this way do not stay. They leave, abandoning the monastery.
an6.54:2.8	Why don’t we banish Venerable Dhammika?”
an6.54:3.1	Then the local lay followers went up to Venerable Dhammika and said to him,
an6.54:3.2	“Sir, please leave this monastery.
an6.54:3.3	You’ve stayed here long enough.”
an6.54:3.4	Then Venerable Dhammika left and went to another monastery.
an6.54:3.5	There he abused visiting mendicants; he insulted, harmed, attacked, and harassed them.
an6.54:3.6	The visiting mendicants who were treated in this way did not stay. They left, abandoning the monastery.

an6.54:6.8	“Sir, please leave all seven monasteries in our native land.”
an6.54:6.9	Then Venerable Dhammika thought,
an6.54:6.10	“I’ve been banished by the local lay followers from all seven monasteries in my native land.
an6.54:6.11	Where am I to go now?”
an6.54:6.12	He thought,
an6.54:6.13	“Why don’t I go to see the Buddha?”
an6.54:7.1	Then Venerable Dhammika took his bowl and robe and set out for Rājagaha.
an6.54:7.2	Eventually he came to Rājagaha and the Vulture’s Peak. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,
an6.54:7.3	“So, Brahmin Dhammika, where have you come from?”
an6.54:7.4	“Sir, I’ve been banished by the local lay followers from all seven monasteries in my native land.”
an6.54:7.5	“Enough, Brahmin Dhammika, what’s that to you? Now that you’ve been banished from all of those places, you have come to me.
an6.54:8.1	Once upon a time, some sea-merchants set sail for the ocean deeps, taking with them a land-spotting bird.
an6.54:8.2	When their ship was out of sight of land, they released the bird.
an6.54:8.3	It flew right away to the east, the west, the north, the south, upwards, and in-between.
an6.54:8.4	If it saw land on any side, it went there and stayed.
an6.54:8.5	But if it saw no land on any side it returned to the ship.
an6.54:8.6	In the same way, now that you’ve been banished from all of those places, you have come to me.
an6.54:9.1	Once upon a time, King Koravya had a royal banyan tree with five trunks called ‘Well Planted’. It was shady and lovely.
an6.54:9.2	Its canopy spread over twelve leagues, while the network of roots spread for five leagues.
an6.54:9.3	Its fruits were as large as
an6.54:9.4	a rice pot.
an6.54:9.5	And they were as sweet as
an6.54:9.6	pure wild honey.
an6.54:9.7	The king and harem made use of one trunk, the troops another, the people of town and country another, ascetics and brahmins another, and beasts and birds another.
an6.54:9.8	No-one guarded the fruit, yet no-one damaged another’s fruits.
an6.54:10.1	Then a certain person ate as much as he liked of the fruit, then broke off a branch and left.
an6.54:10.2	Then the deity haunting the royal banyan tree thought,
an6.54:10.3	‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing!
an6.54:10.4	How wicked this person is, to eat as much as they like, then break off a branch and leave! Why don’t I make sure that the royal banyan tree gives no fruit in future?’
an6.54:10.5	Then the royal banyan tree gave no more fruit.
an6.54:11.1	Then King Koravya went up to Sakka, lord of gods, and said to him,
an6.54:11.2	‘Please sir, you should know that the royal banyan tree called Well Planted gives no fruit.’
an6.54:11.3	Then Sakka used his psychic powers to will that a violent storm come. And it felled and uprooted the royal banyan tree.
an6.54:11.4	Then the deity haunting the tree stood to one side, miserable and sad, weeping, with a tearful face.
an6.54:12.1	Then Sakka went up to that deity, and said,
an6.54:12.2	‘Why, god, are you standing to one side, miserable and sad, weeping, with a tearful face?’
an6.54:12.3	‘Because, my good sir, a violent storm came and felled and uprooted my home.’
an6.54:12.4	‘Well, did you stand by your tree’s duty when the storm came?’
an6.54:12.5	‘But my good sir, how does a tree stand by its duty?’
an6.54:12.6	‘It’s when those who need the tree’s roots, bark, leaves, flowers, or fruit take what they need.
an6.54:12.7	Yet the deity is not displeased or upset because of this.
an6.54:12.8	This is how a tree stands by its duty.’
an6.54:12.9	‘I was not standing by a tree’s duty when the storm came and felled and uprooted my home.’
an6.54:12.10	‘God, if you were to stand by a tree’s duty, your home may be as it was before.’
an6.54:12.11	‘I will stand by a tree’s duty! May my home be as it was before!’
an6.54:13.1	Then Sakka used his psychic power to will that a violent storm come. And it raised up that mighty banyan tree and the bark of the roots was healed.
an6.54:13.2	In the same way, Brahmin Dhammika, were you standing by an ascetic’s duty when the local lay followers banished you from all seven of the monasteries in your native land?”
an6.54:13.3	“But sir, how do I stand by an ascetic’s duty?”
an6.54:13.4	“When someone abuses, annoys, or argues with an ascetic, the ascetic doesn’t abuse, annoy, or argue back at them.
an6.54:13.5	That’s how an ascetic stands by an ascetic’s duty.”
an6.54:13.6	“I was not standing by an ascetic’s duty when the local lay followers banished me from all seven of the monasteries in my native land.”
an6.54:13.7	“Once upon a time, there was a Teacher called Sunetta. He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire.
an6.54:13.8	He had many hundreds of disciples.
an6.54:13.9	He taught them the path to rebirth in the company of Brahmā.
an6.54:13.10	Those lacking confidence in Sunetta were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
an6.54:13.11	Those full of confidence in Sunetta were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
an6.54:14.1	Once upon a time there was a teacher called Mūgapakkha …
an6.54:15.1	Aranemi …
an6.54:16.1	Kuddālaka …
an6.54:17.1	Hatthipāla …
an6.54:18.1	Jotipāla. He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire.
an6.54:18.2	He had many hundreds of disciples.
an6.54:18.3	He taught them the way to rebirth in the company of Brahmā.
an6.54:18.4	Those lacking confidence in Jotipāla were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
an6.54:18.5	Those full of confidence in Jotipāla were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
an6.54:19.1	What do you think, Brahmin Dhammika?
an6.54:19.2	If someone with malicious intent were to abuse and insult these six teachers with their hundreds of followers, would they not make much bad karma?”
an6.54:19.3	“Yes, sir.”
an6.54:19.4	“They would indeed.
an6.54:19.5	But someone who abuses and insults a single person accomplished in view with malicious intent makes even more bad karma.
an6.54:19.6	Why is that?
an6.54:19.7	Brahmin Dhammika, I say that any injury done by those outside of the Buddhist community does not compare with what is done to one’s own spiritual companions.
an6.54:19.8	So you should train like this:
an6.54:19.9	‘We will have no malicious intent for those who we want to have as our spiritual companions.’
an6.54:19.10	That is how you should train.
an6.54:20.1	Sunetta and Mūgapakkha,
an6.54:20.2	and Aranemi the brahmin,
an6.54:20.3	Hatthipāla the student,
an6.54:20.4	and Kuddālaka were Teachers.
an6.54:21.1	And Jotipāla Govinda
an6.54:21.2	was priest for seven kings.
an6.54:21.3	These six famous teachers,
an6.54:21.4	harmless ones of the past,
an6.54:22.1	were free of carrion-stench, compassionate,
an6.54:22.2	gone beyond the fetter of sensuality.
an6.54:22.3	Detached from sensual desire,
an6.54:22.4	they were reborn in the Brahmā realm.
an6.54:23.1	Many hundreds of
an6.54:23.2	their disciples were also
an6.54:23.3	free of carrion-stench, compassionate,
an6.54:23.4	gone beyond the fetter of sensuality.
an6.54:23.5	Detached from sensual desire,

an6.54:24.3	these outside hermits,
an6.54:24.4	free of desire, immersed in samādhi,
an6.54:24.5	makes much bad karma.

an6.54:25.3	a single person accomplished in view,

an6.54:25.5	makes even more bad karma.
an6.54:25.6	NA
an6.54:26.1	You shouldn’t attack a holy person,
an6.54:26.2	who has given up the grounds for views.
an6.54:26.3	This person is called
an6.54:26.4	the seventh of the noble Saṅgha.
an6.54:27.1	They’re not free of desire for sensual pleasures,
an6.54:27.2	and their faculties are still immature:
an6.54:27.3	faith, mindfulness, and energy,
an6.54:27.4	serenity and discernment.
an6.54:28.1	If you attack such a mendicant,
an6.54:28.2	you first hurt yourself.
an6.54:28.3	Having hurt yourself,
an6.54:28.4	you harm the other.
an6.54:29.1	But if you protect yourself,
an6.54:29.2	the other is also protected.

an6.55:0.2	6. The Great Chapter
an6.55:0.3	55. With Soṇa
an6.55:1.1	So I have heard.
an6.55:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
an6.55:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Soṇa was staying near Rājagaha in the Cool Grove.
an6.55:1.4	Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,
an6.55:1.5	“I am one of the Buddha’s most energetic disciples.
an6.55:1.6	Yet my mind is not freed from defilements by not grasping. But my family has wealth. I could enjoy that wealth and make merit.
an6.55:1.7	Why don’t I resign the training and return to a lesser life, so I can enjoy my wealth and make merit?”
an6.55:2.1	Then the Buddha knew what Venerable Soṇa was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Vulture’s Peak and reappeared in the Cool Grove in front of Soṇa,
an6.55:2.2	and sat on the seat spread out.
an6.55:2.3	Soṇa bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.
an6.55:2.4	The Buddha said to him,
an6.55:3.1	“Soṇa, as you were in private retreat didn’t this thought come to your mind:
an6.55:3.2	‘I am one of the Buddha’s most energetic disciples.
an6.55:3.3	Yet my mind is not freed from defilements by not grasping. But my family has wealth. I could enjoy that wealth and make merit.
an6.55:3.4	Why don’t I resign the training and return to a lesser life, so I can enjoy my wealth and make merit?’”
an6.55:3.5	“Yes, sir.”
an6.55:4.1	“What do you think, Soṇa?
an6.55:4.2	When you were still a layman, weren’t you a good harp player?”
an6.55:4.3	“Yes, sir.”
an6.55:4.4	“When your harp’s strings were tuned too tight, was it resonant and playable?”
an6.55:4.5	“No, sir.”
an6.55:5.1	“When your harp’s strings were tuned too slack, was it resonant and playable?”
an6.55:5.2	“No, sir.”
an6.55:6.1	“But when your harp’s strings were tuned neither too tight nor too slack, but fixed at an even tension, was it resonant and playable?”
an6.55:6.2	“Yes, sir.”
an6.55:7.1	“In the same way, Soṇa, when energy is too forceful it leads to restlessness. When energy is too slack it leads to laziness.
an6.55:7.2	So, Soṇa, you should apply yourself to energy and serenity, find a balance of the faculties, and learn the pattern of this situation.”
an6.55:7.3	“Yes, sir,” Soṇa replied.
an6.55:7.4	After advising Soṇa like this, the Buddha, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Cool Grove and reappeared on the Vulture’s Peak.
an6.55:8.1	After some time Soṇa applied himself to energy and serenity, found a balance of the faculties, and learned the pattern of this situation.
an6.55:8.2	Then Soṇa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
an6.55:8.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
an6.55:8.4	And Venerable Soṇa became one of the perfected.
an6.55:9.1	Then, when Soṇa had attained perfection, he thought,
an6.55:9.2	“Why don’t I go to the Buddha and declare my enlightenment in his presence?”
an6.55:9.3	Then Soṇa went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an6.55:10.1	“Sir, a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—is dedicated to six things.
an6.55:10.2	They are dedicated to renunciation, seclusion, kindness, the ending of craving, the ending of grasping, and mental clarity.
an6.55:11.1	It may be, sir, that one of the venerables here thinks:
an6.55:11.2	‘Maybe this venerable is dedicated to renunciation solely out of mere faith.’
an6.55:11.3	But it should not be seen like this.
an6.55:11.4	A mendicant with defilements ended does not see in themselves anything more to do, or anything that needs improvement. They’re dedicated to renunciation because they’re free of greed, hate, and delusion with the end of greed, hate, and delusion.
an6.55:12.1	It may be, sir, that one of the venerables here thinks:
an6.55:12.2	‘Maybe this venerable is dedicated to seclusion because they enjoy possessions, honor, and popularity.’
an6.55:12.3	But it should not be seen like this. …
an6.55:12.4	NA
an6.55:13.1	It may be, sir, that one of the venerables here thinks:

an6.55:13.3	But it should not be seen like this. …

an6.55:16.1	They’re dedicated to clarity of mind because they’re free of greed, hate, and delusion with the end of greed, hate, and delusion.
an6.55:17.1	When a mendicant’s mind is rightly freed like this, even if compelling sights come into the range of vision they don’t overcome their mind.

an6.56:0.2	6. The Great Chapter
an6.56:0.3	56. With Phagguṇa
an6.56:1.1	Now at that time Venerable Phagguṇa was sick, suffering, gravely ill.
an6.56:1.2	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an6.56:1.3	“Sir, Venerable Phagguṇa is sick.
an6.56:1.4	Sir, please go to Venerable Phagguṇa out of compassion.”
an6.56:1.5	The Buddha consented in silence.
an6.56:1.6	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to Venerable Phagguṇa.
an6.56:1.7	Venerable Phagguṇa saw the Buddha coming off in the distance
an6.56:1.8	and tried to rise on his cot.
an6.56:1.9	The Buddha said to him,
an6.56:1.10	“It’s all right, Phagguṇa, don’t get up.
an6.56:1.11	There are some seats spread out by others, I will sit there.”
an6.56:1.12	He sat on the seat spread out
an6.56:1.13	and said to Venerable Phagguṇa:
an6.56:2.1	“I hope you’re keeping well, Phagguṇa; I hope you’re alright. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”
an6.56:2.2	“Sir, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.
an6.56:3.1	The winds piercing my head are so severe, it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp point.
an6.56:3.2	I’m not keeping well.
an6.56:4.1	The pain in my head is so severe, it feels like a strong man tightening a tough leather strap around my head.
an6.56:4.2	I’m not keeping well.
an6.56:5.1	The winds piercing my belly are so severe, it feels like a deft butcher or their apprentice is slicing my belly open with a meat cleaver.
an6.56:5.2	I’m not keeping well.
an6.56:6.1	The burning in my body is so severe, it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals.
an6.56:6.2	I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.”
an6.56:6.3	Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Venerable Phagguṇa with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.
an6.56:7.1	Not long after the Buddha left, Venerable Phagguṇa passed away.
an6.56:7.2	At the time of his death, his faculties were bright and clear.
an6.56:7.3	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
an6.56:7.4	“Sir, soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Phagguṇa died.
an6.56:7.5	At the time of his death, his faculties were bright and clear.”
an6.56:8.1	“And why shouldn’t his faculties be bright and clear?
an6.56:8.2	The mendicant Phagguṇa’s mind was not freed from the five lower fetters.
an6.56:8.3	But when he heard that teaching his mind was freed from them.
an6.56:9.1	Ānanda, there are these six benefits to hearing the teaching at the right time and examining the meaning at the right time.
an6.56:9.2	What six?
an6.56:9.3	Firstly, take the case of a mendicant whose mind is not freed from the five lower fetters.
an6.56:9.4	At the time of death they get to see the Realized One.
an6.56:9.5	The Realized One teaches them Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
an6.56:9.6	When they hear that teaching their mind is freed from the five lower fetters.
an6.56:9.7	This is the first benefit of listening to the teaching.
an6.56:10.1	Next, take the case of another mendicant whose mind is not freed from the five lower fetters.
an6.56:10.2	At the time of death they don’t get to see the Realized One, but they get to see a Realized One’s disciple.
an6.56:10.3	The Realized One’s disciple teaches them Dhamma …
an6.56:10.4	When they hear that teaching their mind is freed from the five lower fetters.
an6.56:10.5	This is the second benefit of listening to the teaching.
an6.56:11.1	Next, take the case of another mendicant whose mind is not freed from the five lower fetters.
an6.56:11.2	At the time of death they don’t get to see the Realized One, or to see a Realized One’s disciple.
an6.56:11.3	But they think about and consider the teaching in their heart, examining it with the mind as they learned and memorized it.
an6.56:11.4	As they do so their mind is freed from the five lower fetters.
an6.56:11.5	This is the third benefit of listening to the teaching.
an6.56:12.1	Next, take the case of a mendicant whose mind is freed from the five lower fetters, but not with the supreme ending of attachments.
an6.56:12.2	At the time of death they get to see the Realized One.
an6.56:12.3	The Realized One teaches them Dhamma …
an6.56:12.4	When they hear that teaching their mind is freed with the supreme ending of attachments.
an6.56:12.5	This is the fourth benefit of listening to the teaching.
an6.56:13.1	Next, take the case of another mendicant whose mind is freed from the five lower fetters, but not with the supreme ending of attachments.
an6.56:13.2	At the time of death they don’t get to see the Realized One, but they get to see a Realized One’s disciple.
an6.56:13.3	The Realized One’s disciple teaches them Dhamma …
an6.56:13.4	When they hear that teaching their mind is freed with the supreme ending of attachments.
an6.56:13.5	This is the fifth benefit of listening to the teaching.
an6.56:14.1	Next, take the case of another mendicant whose mind is freed from the five lower fetters, but not with the supreme ending of attachments.
an6.56:14.2	At the time of death they don’t get to see the Realized One, or to see a Realized One’s disciple.
an6.56:14.3	But they think about and consider the teaching in their heart, examining it with the mind as they learned and memorized it.
an6.56:14.4	As they do so their mind is freed with the supreme ending of attachments.
an6.56:14.5	This is the sixth benefit of listening to the teaching.
an6.56:15.1	These are the six benefits to hearing the teaching at the right time and examining the meaning at the right time.”

an6.57:0.3	57. The Six Classes of Rebirth
an6.57:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
an6.57:1.2	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an6.57:1.3	“Sir, Pūraṇa Kassapa describes six classes of rebirth:
an6.57:1.4	black, blue, red, yellow, white, and ultimate white.
an6.57:2.1	The black class of rebirth consists of slaughterers of sheep, pigs, poultry, or deer, hunters or fishers, bandits, executioners, butchers of cattle, jailers, and any others with a cruel livelihood.
an6.57:3.1	The blue class of rebirth consists of mendicants who live on thorns, and any others who teach the efficacy of deeds and action.
an6.57:4.1	The red class of rebirth consists of the Jain ascetics who wear one cloth.
an6.57:5.1	The yellow class of rebirth consists of the lay people dressed in white who are disciples of the naked ascetics.
an6.57:6.1	The white class of rebirth consists of male and female Ājīvaka ascetics.
an6.57:7.1	And the ultimate white class of rebirth consists of Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saṅkicca, and Makkhali Gosāla.
an6.57:8.1	These are the six classes of rebirth that Pūraṇa Kassapa describes.”
an6.57:9.1	“But Ānanda, did the whole world authorize Pūraṇa Kassapa to describe these six classes of rebirth?”
an6.57:9.2	“No, sir.”
an6.57:9.3	“It’s as if they were to force a steak on a poor, penniless person, telling them they must eat it and then pay for it.
an6.57:9.4	In the same way, Pūraṇa Kassapa has described these six classes of rebirth without the consent of those ascetics and brahmins. And he has done so in a foolish, incompetent, unskilled way, lacking common sense.
an6.57:10.1	I, however, also describe six classes of rebirth.
an6.57:10.2	Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an6.57:10.3	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.
an6.57:10.4	The Buddha said this:
an6.57:10.5	“And what, Ānanda, are the six classes of rebirth?
an6.57:10.6	Someone born into a dark class gives rise to a dark result.
an6.57:10.7	Someone born into a dark class gives rise to a bright result.
an6.57:10.8	Someone born into a dark class gives rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright.
an6.57:10.9	Someone born into a bright class gives rise to a dark result.
an6.57:10.10	Someone born into a bright class gives rise to a bright result.
an6.57:10.11	Someone born into a bright class gives rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright.
an6.57:11.1	And how does someone born into a dark class give rise to a dark result?
an6.57:11.2	It’s when someone is reborn in a low family—a family of outcastes, bamboo-workers, hunters, chariot-makers, or waste-collectors—poor, with little to eat or drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find.
an6.57:11.3	And they’re ugly, unsightly, deformed, chronically ill—one-eyed, crippled, lame, or half-paralyzed. They don’t get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting.
an6.57:11.4	And they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.
an6.57:11.5	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
an6.57:11.6	That’s how someone born into a dark class gives rise to a dark result.
an6.57:12.1	And how does someone born into a dark class give rise to a bright result?
an6.57:12.2	It’s when some person is reborn in a low family …
an6.57:12.3	NA
an6.57:12.4	But they do good things by way of body, speech, and mind.
an6.57:12.5	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
an6.57:12.6	That’s how someone born into a dark class gives rise to a bright result.
an6.57:13.1	And how does someone born into a dark class give rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright?
an6.57:13.2	It’s when some person is reborn in a low family …
an6.57:13.3	NA
an6.57:13.4	They shave off their hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
an6.57:13.5	They give up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. They firmly establish their mind in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They truly develop the seven awakening factors. And then they give rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright.
an6.57:13.6	That’s how someone born in a dark class gives rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright.
an6.57:14.1	And how does someone born into a bright class give rise to a dark result?
an6.57:14.2	It’s when some person is reborn in an eminent family—a well-to-do family of aristocrats, brahmins, or householders—rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain.
an6.57:14.3	And they’re attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. They get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting.
an6.57:14.4	But they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.
an6.57:14.5	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
an6.57:14.6	That’s how someone born into a bright class gives rise to a dark result.
an6.57:15.1	And how does someone born into a bright class give rise to a bright result?
an6.57:15.2	It’s when some person is reborn in an eminent family …
an6.57:15.3	NA
an6.57:15.4	And they do good things by way of body, speech, and mind.
an6.57:15.5	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
an6.57:15.6	That’s how someone born into a bright class give rise to a bright result.
an6.57:16.1	And how does someone born into a bright class give rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright?
an6.57:16.2	It’s when some person is reborn in an eminent family …
an6.57:16.3	NA
an6.57:16.4	They shave off their hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

an6.57:16.6	That’s how someone born into a bright class gives rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright.
an6.57:17.1	These are the six classes of rebirth.”

an6.58:1.1	“Mendicants, a mendicant with six qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.
an6.58:2.1	What six?
an6.58:2.2	It’s a mendicant who, by restraint, has given up the defilements that should be given up by restraint.
an6.58:2.3	By using, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by using.
an6.58:2.4	By enduring, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by enduring.

an6.58:2.6	By getting rid, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by getting rid.
an6.58:2.7	By developing, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by developing.
an6.58:3.1	And what are the defilements that should be given up by restraint?
an6.58:3.2	Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, lives restraining the eye faculty.
an6.58:3.3	For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without restraint of the eye faculty do not arise when there is such restraint.
an6.58:3.4	Reflecting properly, they live restraining the ear faculty …
an6.58:3.5	the nose faculty …
an6.58:3.6	the tongue faculty …
an6.58:3.7	the body faculty …
an6.58:3.8	the mind faculty.
an6.58:3.9	For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without restraint of the mind faculty do not arise when there is such restraint.
an6.58:3.10	These are called the defilements that should be given up by restraint.
an6.58:4.1	And what are the defilements that should be given up by using?
an6.58:4.2	Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, makes use of robes:
an6.58:4.3	‘Only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; and for covering up the private parts.’
an6.58:4.4	Reflecting properly, they make use of almsfood:
an6.58:4.5	‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’
an6.58:4.6	Reflecting properly, they make use of lodgings:
an6.58:4.7	‘Only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; to shelter from harsh weather and to enjoy retreat.’
an6.58:4.8	Reflecting properly, they make use of medicines and supplies for the sick:
an6.58:4.9	‘Only for the sake of warding off the pains of illness and to promote good health.’
an6.58:4.10	For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without using these things do not arise when they are used.
an6.58:4.11	These are called the defilements that should be given up by using.
an6.58:5.1	And what are the defilements that should be given up by enduring?
an6.58:5.2	Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, endures cold, heat, hunger, and thirst. They endure the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. They endure rude and unwelcome criticism. And they put up with physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening.
an6.58:5.3	For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without enduring these things do not arise when they are endured.
an6.58:5.4	These are called the defilements that should be given up by enduring.
an6.58:6.1	And what are the defilements that should be given up by avoiding?
an6.58:6.2	Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, avoids a wild elephant, a wild horse, a wild ox, a wild dog, a snake, a stump, thorny ground, a pit, a cliff, a swamp, and a sewer. Reflecting properly, they avoid sitting on inappropriate seats, walking in inappropriate neighborhoods, and mixing with bad friends—whatever sensible spiritual companions would believe to be a bad setting.
an6.58:6.3	For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without avoiding these things do not arise when they are avoided.
an6.58:6.4	These are called the defilements that should be given up by avoiding.
an6.58:7.1	And what are the defilements that should be given up by getting rid?
an6.58:7.2	Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, doesn’t tolerate a sensual,
an6.58:7.3	malicious,
an6.58:7.4	or cruel thought that has arisen.
an6.58:7.5	They don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them.
an6.58:7.6	For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without getting rid of these things do not arise when they are gotten rid of.
an6.58:7.7	These are called the defilements that should be given up by getting rid.
an6.58:8.1	And what are the defilements that should be given up by developing?
an6.58:8.2	Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, develops the awakening factors of mindfulness,
an6.58:8.3	investigation of principles,
an6.58:8.4	energy,
an6.58:8.5	rapture,
an6.58:8.6	tranquility,

an6.58:8.8	and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
an6.58:8.9	For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without developing these things do not arise when they are developed.
an6.58:8.10	These are called the defilements that should be given up by developing.

an6.59:0.3	59. With Dārukammika
an6.59:1.1	So I have heard.
an6.59:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house.
an6.59:1.3	Then the householder Dārukammika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,
an6.59:1.4	“Householder, I wonder whether your family gives gifts?”
an6.59:1.5	“It does, sir.
an6.59:1.6	Gifts are given to those mendicants who are perfected or on the path to perfection; they live in the wilderness, eat only almsfood, and wear rag robes.”
an6.59:2.1	“Householder, as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures, living at home with your children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, fragrance, and makeup, and accepting gold and money, it’s hard for you to know who is perfected or on the path to perfection.
an6.59:3.1	If a mendicant living in the wilderness is restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying mind and undisciplined faculties,
an6.59:3.2	then in this respect they’re reprehensible.
an6.59:3.3	If a mendicant living in the wilderness is not restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, or loose-tongued, but has established mindfulness, situational awareness and immersion, with unified mind and restrained faculties,
an6.59:3.4	then in this respect they’re praiseworthy.
an6.59:4.1	If a mendicant who lives within a village is restless …
an6.59:4.2	then in this respect they’re reprehensible.
an6.59:4.3	If a mendicant who lives within a village is not restless …
an6.59:4.4	then in this respect they’re praiseworthy.
an6.59:5.1	If a mendicant who eats only almsfood is restless …
an6.59:5.2	then in this respect they’re reprehensible.
an6.59:5.3	If a mendicant who eats only almsfood is not restless …
an6.59:5.4	then in this respect they’re praiseworthy.
an6.59:6.1	If a mendicant who accepts invitations is restless …
an6.59:6.2	then in this respect they’re reprehensible.
an6.59:6.3	If a mendicant who accepts invitations is not restless …
an6.59:6.4	then in this respect they’re praiseworthy.
an6.59:7.1	If a mendicant who wears rag robes is restless …
an6.59:7.2	then in this respect they’re reprehensible.
an6.59:7.3	If a mendicant who wears rag robes is not restless …
an6.59:7.4	then in this respect they’re praiseworthy.
an6.59:8.1	If a mendicant who wears robes offered by householders is restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying mind and undisciplined faculties,
an6.59:8.2	then in this respect they’re reprehensible.
an6.59:8.3	If a mendicant who wears robes offered by householders is not restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, or loose-tongued, but has established mindfulness, situational awareness and immersion, with unified mind and restrained faculties,
an6.59:8.4	then in this respect they’re praiseworthy.
an6.59:9.1	Go ahead, householder, give gifts to the Saṅgha.
an6.59:9.2	Your mind will become bright and clear,
an6.59:9.3	and when your body breaks up, after death, you’ll be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”
an6.59:9.4	“Sir, from this day forth I will give gifts to the Saṅgha.”
an6.60:0.1	Numbered Discourses 6
an6.60:0.2	6. The Great Chapter
an6.60:0.3	60. With Hatthisāriputta
an6.60:1.1	So I have heard.
an6.60:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana.
an6.60:1.3	Now at that time several senior mendicants, after the meal, on their return from almsround, sat together in the pavilion talking about the teachings.
an6.60:1.4	Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta interrupted them while they were talking.
an6.60:1.5	Then Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita said to Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta,
an6.60:1.6	“Venerable, please don’t interrupt the senior mendicants while they’re talking about the teachings. Wait until the end of the discussion.”
an6.60:1.7	When he said this, Citta Hatthisāriputta’s companions said to Mahākoṭṭhita,
an6.60:1.8	“Venerable, please don’t rebuke Citta Hatthisāriputta. He is astute,
an6.60:1.9	and quite capable of talking about the teachings with the senior mendicants.”
an6.60:2.1	“It’s not easy to know this, reverends, for those who don’t comprehend another’s mind.
an6.60:2.2	Take a person who is the sweetest of the sweet, the most even-tempered of the even-tempered, the calmest of the calm, so long as they live relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role.
an6.60:2.3	But when they’re separated from the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role, they mix closely with monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; with rulers and their ministers, and with teachers of other paths and their followers.
an6.60:2.4	As they mix closely, they become intimate and loose, spending time chatting, and so lust infects their mind.
an6.60:2.5	They resign the training and return to a lesser life.
an6.60:3.1	Suppose an ox fond of crops was tied up or shut in a pen.
an6.60:3.2	Would it be right to say that that ox will never again invade the crops?”
an6.60:3.3	“No it would not, reverend.
an6.60:3.4	For it’s quite possible that that ox will snap the ropes or break out of the pen, and then invade the crops.”
an6.60:3.5	“In the same way, take a person who is the sweetest of the sweet …
an6.60:3.6	NA
an6.60:3.7	As they mix closely, they become intimate and loose, spending time chatting, and so lust infects their mind.
an6.60:3.8	They resign the training and return to a lesser life.
an6.60:4.1	Take the case of a person who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures … enters and remains in the first absorption.
an6.60:4.2	Thinking, ‘I get the first absorption!’ they mix closely with monks …
an6.60:4.3	They resign the training and return to a lesser life.
an6.60:4.4	Suppose it was raining heavily at the crossroads so that the dust vanished and mud appeared.
an6.60:4.5	Would it be right to say that now dust will never appear at this crossroad again?”
an6.60:4.6	“No it would not, reverend.
an6.60:4.7	For it is quite possible that people or cattle and so on will cross over the crossroad, or that the wind and sun will evaporate the moisture so that the dust appears again.”
an6.60:4.8	“In the same way, take the case of a person who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures … enters and remains in the first absorption.
an6.60:4.9	Thinking, ‘I get the first absorption!’ they mix closely with monks …
an6.60:4.10	They resign the training and return to a lesser life.
an6.60:5.1	Take another case of a person who, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled … enters and remains in the second absorption.
an6.60:5.2	Thinking, ‘I get the second absorption!’ they mix closely with monks …
an6.60:5.3	They resign the training and return to a lesser life.
an6.60:5.4	Suppose there was a large pond not far from a town or village.
an6.60:5.5	After it rained heavily there the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel would vanish.
an6.60:5.6	Would it be right to say that now the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel will never appear here again?”
an6.60:5.7	“No it would not, reverend.
an6.60:5.8	For it’s quite possible that people or cattle and so on will drink from the pond, or that the wind and sun will evaporate it so that the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel appear again.”
an6.60:5.9	“In the same way, take another case of a person who, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled … enters and remains in the second absorption.
an6.60:5.10	Thinking, ‘I get the second absorption!’ they mix closely with monks …
an6.60:5.11	They resign the training and return to a lesser life.
an6.60:6.1	Take the case of another person who, with the fading away of rapture … enters and remains in the third absorption.
an6.60:6.2	Thinking, ‘I get the third absorption!’ they mix closely with monks …
an6.60:6.3	They resign the training and return to a lesser life.
an6.60:6.4	Suppose a person had finished a delicious meal. They’d have no appetite for leftovers.
an6.60:6.5	Would it be right to say that now food will never appeal to this person again?”
an6.60:6.6	“No it would not, reverend.
an6.60:6.7	For it’s quite possible that other food won’t appeal to that person as long as the nourishment is still present.
an6.60:6.8	But when the nourishment vanishes food will appeal again.”
an6.60:6.9	“In the same way, take the case of a person who, with the fading away of rapture … enters and remains in the third absorption.
an6.60:6.10	Thinking, ‘I get the third absorption!’ they mix closely with monks …
an6.60:6.11	They resign the training and return to a lesser life.
an6.60:7.1	Take the case of another person who, giving up pleasure and pain … enters and remains in the fourth absorption.
an6.60:7.2	Thinking, ‘I get the fourth absorption!’ they mix closely with monks …
an6.60:7.3	They resign the training and return to a lesser life.
an6.60:7.4	Suppose that in a mountain glen there was a lake, unruffled and free of waves.
an6.60:7.5	Would it be right to say that now waves will never appear in this lake again?”
an6.60:7.6	“No it would not, reverend.
an6.60:7.7	For it is quite possible that a violent storm could blow up out of the east, west, north, or south, and stir up waves in that lake.”
an6.60:7.8	“In the same way, take the case of a person who, giving up pleasure and pain … enters and remains in the fourth absorption.
an6.60:7.9	Thinking, ‘I get the fourth absorption!’ they mix closely with monks …
an6.60:7.10	They resign the training and return to a lesser life.
an6.60:8.1	Take the case of another person who, not focusing on any signs, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart.
an6.60:8.2	Thinking, ‘I get the signless immersion of the heart!’ they mix closely with monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; with rulers and their ministers, and with teachers of other paths and their followers.
an6.60:8.3	As they mix closely, they become intimate and loose, spending time chatting, and so lust infects their mind.
an6.60:8.4	They resign the training and return to a lesser life.
an6.60:8.5	Suppose a ruler or their minister, while walking along the road with an army of four divisions, was to arrive at a forest grove where they set up camp for the night.
an6.60:8.6	There, because of the noise of the elephants, horses, chariots, soldiers, and the drums, kettledrums, horns, and cymbals, the chirping of crickets would vanish.
an6.60:8.7	Would it be right to say that now the chirping of crickets will never be heard in this woodland grove again?”
an6.60:8.8	“No it would not, reverend.
an6.60:8.9	For it is quite possible that the ruler or their minister will depart from that woodland grove so that the chirping of crickets will be heard there again.”
an6.60:8.10	“In the same way, take the case of a person who, not focusing on any signs, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart …
an6.60:8.11	NA
an6.60:8.12	NA
an6.60:8.13	They resign the training and return to a lesser life.”
an6.60:9.1	Then after some time Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta resigned the training and returned to a lesser life.
an6.60:9.2	Then the mendicants who were his companions went up to Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita and said,
an6.60:9.3	“Did Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita comprehend Citta Hatthisāriputta’s mind and know that
an6.60:9.4	he had gained such and such meditative attainments, yet he would still resign the training and return to a lesser life?
an6.60:9.5	Or did deities tell you about it?”
an6.60:9.6	NA
an6.60:9.7	“Reverends, I comprehended his mind and knew this.
an6.60:9.8	NA
an6.60:9.9	And deities also told me.”
an6.60:9.10	NA
an6.60:10.1	Then the mendicants who were Citta Hatthisāriputta’s companions went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
an6.60:10.2	“Sir, Citta Hatthisāriputta, who had gained such and such meditative attainments, has still resigned the training and returned to a lesser life.”
an6.60:10.3	“Mendicants, soon Citta will remember renunciation.”
an6.60:11.1	And not long after Citta Hatthisāriputta shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.
an6.60:11.2	Then Citta Hatthisāriputta, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
an6.60:11.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
an6.60:11.4	And Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta became one of the perfected.
an6.61:0.1	Numbered Discourses 6
an6.61:0.2	6. The Great Chapter
an6.61:0.3	61. In the Middle
an6.61:1.1	So I have heard.
an6.61:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana.
an6.61:1.3	Now at that time, after the meal, on return from almsround, several senior mendicants sat together in the pavilion and this discussion came up among them,
an6.61:1.4	“Reverends, this was said by the Buddha in ‘The Way to the Beyond’, in ‘The Questions of Metteyya’:
an6.61:2.1	‘The sage has known both ends,
an6.61:2.2	and is not stuck in the middle.
an6.61:2.3	He is a great man, I declare,
an6.61:2.4	he has escaped the seamstress here.’
an6.61:3.1	But what is one end? What’s the second end? What’s the middle? And who is the seamstress?”
an6.61:3.2	When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:
an6.61:3.3	“Contact, reverends, is one end. The origin of contact is the second end. The cessation of contact is the middle. And craving is the seamstress,
an6.61:3.4	for craving weaves one to being reborn in one state of existence or another.
an6.61:3.5	That’s how a mendicant directly knows what should be directly known and completely understands what should be completely understood. Knowing and understanding thus they make an end of suffering in this very life.”
an6.61:4.1	When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:
an6.61:4.2	“The past, reverends, is one end. The future is the second end. The present is the middle. And craving is the seamstress …
an6.61:4.3	NA
an6.61:4.4	That’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.”
an6.61:5.1	When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:
an6.61:5.2	“Pleasant feeling, reverends, is one end. Painful feeling is the second end. Neutral feeling is the middle. And craving is the seamstress …
an6.61:5.3	NA
an6.61:5.4	That’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.”
an6.61:6.1	When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:
an6.61:6.2	“Name, reverends, is one end. Form is the second end. Consciousness is the middle. And craving is the seamstress …
an6.61:6.3	NA
an6.61:6.4	That’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.”
an6.61:7.1	When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:
an6.61:7.2	“The six interior sense fields, reverends, are one end. The six exterior sense fields are the second end. Consciousness is the middle. And craving is the seamstress …
an6.61:7.3	NA
an6.61:7.4	That’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.”
an6.61:8.1	When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:
an6.61:8.2	“Identity, reverends, is one end. The origin of identity is the second end. The cessation of identity is the middle. And craving is the seamstress,
an6.61:8.3	for craving weaves one to being reborn in one state of existence or another.
an6.61:8.4	That’s how a mendicant directly knows what should be directly known and completely understands what should be completely understood. Knowing and understanding thus they make an end of suffering in this very life.”
an6.61:9.1	When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:
an6.61:9.2	“Each of us has spoken from the heart.
an6.61:9.3	Come, reverends, let’s go to the Buddha, and inform him about this.
an6.61:9.4	As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”
an6.61:10.1	“Yes, reverend,” those senior mendicants replied.
an6.61:10.2	Then those senior mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,
an6.61:10.3	and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed. They asked,
an6.61:10.4	“Sir, who has spoken well?”
an6.61:10.5	“Mendicants, you’ve all spoken well in a way. However, this is what I was referring to in ‘The Way to the Beyond’, in ‘The Questions of Metteyya’ when I said:
an6.61:11.1	‘The sage has known both ends,
an6.61:11.2	and is not stuck in the middle.
an6.61:11.3	He is a great man, I declare,
an6.61:11.4	he has escaped the seamstress here.’
an6.61:12.1	Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an6.61:12.2	“Yes, sir,” they replied.
an6.61:12.3	The Buddha said this:
an6.61:12.4	“Contact, mendicants, is one end. The origin of contact is the second end. The cessation of contact is the middle. And craving is the seamstress,
an6.61:12.5	for craving weaves one to being reborn in one state of existence or another.
an6.61:12.6	That’s how a mendicant directly knows what should be directly known and completely understands what should be completely understood. Knowing and understanding thus they make an end of suffering in this very life.”

an6.62:0.2	6. The Great Chapter
an6.62:0.3	62. Knowledge of the Faculties of Persons
an6.62:1.1	So I have heard.
an6.62:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Kosalans named Daṇḍakappaka.
an6.62:1.3	The Buddha left the road and sat at the root of a tree on the seat spread out.
an6.62:1.4	The mendicants entered Daṇḍakappaka to look for a guest house.
an6.62:2.1	Then Venerable Ānanda together with several mendicants went to the Aciravati River to bathe.
an6.62:2.2	When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying himself.
an6.62:2.3	Then a certain mendicant went up to Venerable Ānanda, and said to him,
an6.62:2.4	“Reverend Ānanda, when the Buddha declared that Devadatta was
an6.62:2.5	going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable, did he do so after wholeheartedly deliberating, or was this just a way of speaking?”
an6.62:2.6	“You’re right, reverend, that’s how the Buddha declared it.”
an6.62:3.1	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.
an6.62:3.2	NA

an6.62:3.5	NA
an6.62:3.6	NA
an6.62:3.7	NA
an6.62:3.8	NA
an6.62:4.1	“Ānanda, that mendicant must be junior, recently gone forth, or else a foolish, incompetent senior mendicant.
an6.62:4.2	How on earth can he take something that I have declared definitively to be ambiguous?
an6.62:4.3	I do not see a single other person about whom I have given such whole-hearted deliberation before making a declaration as I did in the case of Devadatta.
an6.62:4.4	As long as I saw even a fraction of a hair’s tip of goodness in Devadatta
an6.62:4.5	I did not declare that he was
an6.62:4.6	going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable.
an6.62:4.7	But when I saw that there was not even a fraction of a hair’s tip of goodness in Devadatta
an6.62:4.8	I declared that he was
an6.62:4.9	going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable.
an6.62:5.1	Suppose there was a sewer deeper than a man’s height, full to the brim with feces,
an6.62:5.2	and someone was sunk into it over their head.
an6.62:5.3	Then along comes a person who wants to help make them safe, who wants to lift them out of that sewer.
an6.62:5.4	But circling all around the sewer they couldn’t see even a fraction of a hair’s tip of that person that was not smeared with feces.
an6.62:5.5	In the same way, when I saw that there was not even a fraction of a hair’s tip of goodness in Devadatta
an6.62:5.6	I declared that he was
an6.62:5.7	going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable.
an6.62:5.8	Ānanda, if only you would all listen to the Realized One’s analysis of the knowledges of the faculties of individuals.”
an6.62:6.1	“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!
an6.62:6.2	Let the Buddha analyze the faculties of persons. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
an6.62:6.3	“Well then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an6.62:6.4	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.
an6.62:6.5	The Buddha said this:
an6.62:7.1	“Ānanda, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand:
an6.62:7.2	‘Both skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.’
an6.62:7.3	After some time I comprehend their mind and understand:
an6.62:7.4	‘The skillful qualities of this person have vanished, but the unskillful qualities are still present.
an6.62:7.5	Nevertheless, their skillful root is unbroken, and from that the skillful will appear.
an6.62:7.6	So this person is not liable to decline in the future.’
an6.62:7.7	Suppose some seeds were intact, unspoiled, not weather-damaged, fertile, and well-kept. They’re sown in a well-prepared, productive field.
an6.62:7.8	Wouldn’t you know that those seeds would grow, increase, and mature?”
an6.62:7.9	“Yes, sir.”

an6.62:8.7	Suppose some seeds were intact, unspoiled, not weather-damaged, fertile, and well-kept. And they were sown on a broad rock.

an6.63:0.1	Numbered Discourses 6
an6.63:0.2	6. The Great Chapter
an6.63:0.3	63. Penetrative
an6.63:1.1	“Mendicants, I will teach you a penetrative exposition of the teaching.
an6.63:1.2	Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an6.63:1.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.
an6.63:1.4	The Buddha said this:
an6.63:2.1	“Mendicants, what is the penetrative exposition of the teaching?
an6.63:2.2	Sensual pleasures should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.
an6.63:3.1	Feelings should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.
an6.63:4.1	Perceptions should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.
an6.63:5.1	Defilements should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.
an6.63:6.1	Deeds should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.
an6.63:7.1	Suffering should be known. And its source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation should be known.
an6.63:8.1	‘Sensual pleasures should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said,
an6.63:8.2	but why did I say it?
an6.63:8.3	There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.
an6.63:8.4	Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
an6.63:8.5	Sounds known by the ear …
an6.63:8.6	Smells known by the nose …
an6.63:8.7	Tastes known by the tongue …
an6.63:8.8	Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
an6.63:8.9	However, these are not sensual pleasures. In the training of the Noble One they’re called ‘kinds of sensual stimulation’.
an6.63:8.10	Greedy intention is a person’s sensual pleasure.
an6.63:8.11	The world’s pretty things aren’t sensual pleasures.
an6.63:8.12	Greedy intention is a person’s sensual pleasure.
an6.63:8.13	The world’s pretty things stay just as they are,
an6.63:8.14	but a wise one removes desire for them.
an6.63:9.1	And what is the source of sensual pleasures?
an6.63:10.2	Contact is their source.
an6.63:11.1	And what is the diversity of sensual pleasures?
an6.63:11.2	The sensual desire for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches are all different.
an6.63:11.3	This is called the diversity of sensual pleasures.
an6.63:12.1	And what is the result of sensual pleasures?
an6.63:12.2	When one who desires sensual pleasures creates a corresponding life-form, with the attributes of either good or bad deeds—this is called the result of sensual pleasures.
an6.63:13.1	And what is the cessation of sensual pleasures?
an6.63:13.2	When contact ceases, sensual pleasures cease.
an6.63:13.3	The practice that leads to the cessation of sensual pleasures is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
an6.63:13.4	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
an6.63:14.1	When a noble disciple understands sensual pleasures in this way—and understands their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation—they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of sensual pleasures.
an6.63:14.2	‘Sensual pleasures should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’
an6.63:14.3	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
an6.63:15.1	‘Feelings should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’
an6.63:15.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
an6.63:15.3	There are these three feelings:
an6.63:15.4	pleasant, painful, and neutral.
an6.63:16.1	And what is the source of feelings?
an6.63:16.2	Contact is their source.
an6.63:17.1	And what is the diversity of feelings?
an6.63:17.2	There are material pleasant feelings, spiritual pleasant feelings, material painful feelings, spiritual painful feelings, material neutral feelings, and spiritual neutral feelings.
an6.63:17.3	This is called the diversity of feelings.
an6.63:18.1	And what is the result of feelings?
an6.63:18.2	When one who feels creates a corresponding life-form, with the attributes of either good or bad deeds—
an6.63:18.3	this is called the result of feelings.
an6.63:19.1	And what is the cessation of feelings?
an6.63:19.2	When contact ceases, feelings cease.
an6.63:19.3	The practice that leads to the cessation of feelings is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
an6.63:19.4	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
an6.63:20.1	When a noble disciple understands feelings in this way … they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of feelings.
an6.63:20.2	‘Feelings should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’
an6.63:20.3	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
an6.63:21.1	‘Perceptions should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’
an6.63:21.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
an6.63:21.3	There are these six perceptions:
an6.63:21.4	perceptions of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts.
an6.63:22.1	And what is the source of perceptions?
an6.63:22.2	Contact is their source.
an6.63:23.1	And what is the diversity of perceptions?
an6.63:23.2	The perceptions of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts are all different.
an6.63:23.3	This is called the diversity of perceptions.
an6.63:24.1	And what is the result of perceptions?
an6.63:24.2	Communication is the result of perception, I say.
an6.63:24.3	You communicate something in whatever manner you perceive it, saying ‘That’s what I perceived.’
an6.63:24.4	This is called the result of perceptions.
an6.63:25.1	And what is the cessation of perception?
an6.63:25.2	When contact ceases, perception ceases.
an6.63:25.3	The practice that leads to the cessation of perceptions is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
an6.63:25.4	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
an6.63:26.1	When a noble disciple understands perception in this way … they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of perception.
an6.63:26.2	‘Perceptions should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’
an6.63:26.3	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
an6.63:27.1	‘Defilements should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’
an6.63:27.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
an6.63:27.3	There are these three defilements:
an6.63:27.4	the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.
an6.63:28.1	And what is the source of defilements?
an6.63:28.2	Ignorance is the source of defilements.
an6.63:29.1	And what is the diversity of defilements?
an6.63:29.2	There are defilements that lead to rebirth in hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, the human world, and the world of the gods.
an6.63:29.3	This is called the diversity of defilements.
an6.63:30.1	And what is the result of defilements?
an6.63:30.2	When one who is ignorant creates a corresponding life-form, with the attributes of either good or bad deeds—this is called the result of defilements.
an6.63:31.1	And what is the cessation of defilements?
an6.63:31.2	When ignorance ceases, defilements cease.
an6.63:31.3	The practice that leads to the cessation of defilements is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
an6.63:31.4	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
an6.63:32.1	When a noble disciple understands defilements in this way … they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of defilements.
an6.63:32.2	‘Defilements should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’
an6.63:32.3	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
an6.63:33.1	‘Deeds should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said,
an6.63:33.2	but why did I say it?
an6.63:33.3	It is intention that I call deeds.
an6.63:33.4	For after making a choice one acts
an6.63:33.5	by way of body, speech, and mind.
an6.63:34.1	And what is the source of deeds?
an6.63:34.2	Contact is their source.
an6.63:35.1	And what is the diversity of deeds?
an6.63:35.2	There are deeds that lead to rebirth in hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, the human world, and the world of the gods.
an6.63:35.3	This is called the diversity of deeds.
an6.63:36.1	And what is the result of deeds?
an6.63:36.2	The result of deeds is threefold, I say:
an6.63:36.3	in this very life, on rebirth in the next life, or at some later time.
an6.63:36.4	This is called the result of deeds.
an6.63:37.1	And what is the cessation of deeds?
an6.63:37.2	When contact ceases, deeds cease.
an6.63:37.3	The practice that leads to the cessation of deeds is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
an6.63:37.4	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
an6.63:38.1	When a noble disciple understands deeds in this way … they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of deeds.
an6.63:38.2	‘Deeds should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’
an6.63:38.3	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
an6.63:39.1	‘Suffering should be known. And its source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation should be known.’
an6.63:39.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
an6.63:39.3	Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; illness is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering.
an6.63:40.1	And what is the source of suffering?
an6.63:40.2	Craving is the source of suffering.
an6.63:41.1	And what is the diversity of suffering?
an6.63:41.2	There is suffering that is severe, mild, slow to fade, and quick to fade.
an6.63:41.3	This is called the diversity of suffering.
an6.63:42.1	And what is the result of suffering?
an6.63:42.2	It’s when someone who is overcome and overwhelmed by suffering sorrows and wails and laments, beating their breast and falling into confusion. Or else, overcome by that suffering, they begin an external search, wondering:
an6.63:42.3	‘Who knows one or two phrases to stop this suffering?’
an6.63:42.4	The result of suffering is either confusion or a search, I say.
an6.63:42.5	This is called the result of suffering.
an6.63:43.1	And what is the cessation of suffering?
an6.63:43.2	When craving ceases, suffering ceases.
an6.63:43.3	The practice that leads to the cessation of suffering is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
an6.63:43.4	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
an6.63:44.1	When a noble disciple understands suffering in this way … they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of suffering.
an6.63:44.2	‘Suffering should be known. And its source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation should be known.’
an6.63:44.3	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
an6.63:45.1	This is the penetrative exposition of the teaching.”

an6.64:0.2	6. The Great Chapter
an6.64:0.3	64. The Lion’s Roar
an6.64:1.1	“Mendicants, the Realized One possesses six powers of a Realized One. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.
an6.64:1.2	What six?
an6.64:1.3	Firstly, the Realized One truly understands the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible.
an6.64:1.4	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.
an6.64:2.1	Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of causes and reasons.
an6.64:2.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
an6.64:3.1	Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments.
an6.64:3.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
an6.64:4.1	Furthermore, the Realized One recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. He remembers: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so he recollects his many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
an6.64:4.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
an6.64:5.1	Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Realized One sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
an6.64:5.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
an6.64:6.1	Furthermore, the Realized One has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And he lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.
an6.64:6.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.
an6.64:6.3	These are the six powers of a Realized One that the Realized One possesses. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.
an6.64:7.1	If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible,
an6.64:7.2	the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.
an6.64:8.1	If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of causes and reasons,
an6.64:8.2	the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.
an6.64:9.1	If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments,
an6.64:9.2	the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.
an6.64:10.1	If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of recollection of past lives,
an6.64:10.2	the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.
an6.64:11.1	If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of passing away and rebirth of sentient beings,
an6.64:11.2	the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.
an6.64:12.1	If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of the ending of defilements,
an6.64:12.2	the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.
an6.64:13.1	And I say that true knowledge of the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion.
an6.64:13.2	And true knowledge of the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of causes and reasons is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion.
an6.64:13.3	And true knowledge of corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion.
an6.64:13.4	And true knowledge of the recollection of past lives is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion.
an6.64:13.5	And true knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of sentient beings is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion.
an6.64:13.6	And true knowledge of the ending of defilements is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion.
an6.64:13.7	And so, mendicants, immersion is the path. No immersion is the wrong path.”

an6.69:1.1	Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:
an6.69:1.2	“Sir, these six things don’t lead to the decline of a mendicant.
an6.69:1.3	What six?
an6.69:1.4	Respect for the Teacher, for the teaching, for the Saṅgha, for the training; being easy to admonish, and good friendship.

an6.69:1.8	Then that deity, knowing that the teacher approved, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.
an6.69:2.1	Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
an6.69:2.2	“Tonight, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, came to me, bowed, stood to one side, and said to me:

an7.21:0.2	3. The Vajji Seven
an7.21:0.3	21. At Sārandada
an7.21:1.1	So I have heard.
an7.21:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Sārandada Tree-shrine.
an7.21:1.3	Then several Licchavis went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and the Buddha said to these Licchavis:
an7.21:1.4	“Licchavis, I will teach you these seven principles that prevent decline.
an7.21:1.5	Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an7.21:1.6	“Yes, sir,” they replied.
an7.21:1.7	The Buddha said this:
an7.21:2.1	“And what are the seven principles that prevent decline?
an7.21:2.2	As long as the Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings,
an7.21:2.3	they can expect growth, not decline.
an7.21:3.1	As long as the Vajjis meet in harmony, leave in harmony, and carry on their business in harmony,
an7.21:3.2	they can expect growth, not decline.
an7.21:4.1	As long as the Vajjis don’t make new decrees or abolish existing decrees, but undertake and follow the traditional Vajjian principles as they have been decreed,
an7.21:4.2	they can expect growth, not decline.
an7.21:5.1	As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate Vajjian elders, and think them worth listening to,
an7.21:5.2	they can expect growth, not decline.
an7.21:6.1	As long as the Vajjis don’t rape or abduct women or girls from their families and force them to live with them,
an7.21:6.2	they can expect growth, not decline.
an7.21:7.1	As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajjian shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the proper spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past,
an7.21:7.2	they can expect growth, not decline.
an7.21:8.1	As long as the Vajjis organize proper protection, shelter, and security for perfected ones, so that
an7.21:8.2	more perfected ones might come to the realm and those already here may live in comfort,
an7.21:8.3	they can expect growth, not decline.
an7.21:9.1	As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the Vajjis, and as long as the Vajjis are seen following them,
an7.21:9.2	they can expect growth, not decline.”
an7.22:0.1	Numbered Discourses 7
an7.22:0.2	3. The Vajji Seven
an7.22:0.3	22. With Vassakāra
an7.22:1.1	So I have heard.
an7.22:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
an7.22:1.3	Now at that time King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Māgadha wanted to invade the Vajjis.
an7.22:1.4	He declared:
an7.22:1.5	“I shall wipe out these Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy them, and lay ruin and devastation upon them!”
an7.22:2.1	And then King Ajātasattu addressed Vassakāra the brahmin minister of Māgadha,
an7.22:2.2	“Please, brahmin, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.
an7.22:2.3	NA
an7.22:2.4	And then say:
an7.22:2.5	‘Sir, King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Māgadha wants to invade the Vajjis.
an7.22:2.6	He has declared:
an7.22:2.7	“I shall wipe out these Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy them, and lay ruin and devastation upon them!”’
an7.22:2.8	Remember well how the Buddha answers and tell it to me.
an7.22:2.9	For Realized Ones say nothing that is not so.”
an7.22:3.1	“Yes, sir,” Vassakāra replied. He went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.
an7.22:3.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
an7.22:3.3	“Master Gotama, King Ajātasattu bows with his head to your feet. He asks if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.
an7.22:3.4	King Ajātasattu wants to invade the Vajjis.
an7.22:3.5	He has declared:
an7.22:3.6	‘I shall wipe out these Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy them, and lay ruin and devastation upon them!’”
an7.22:4.1	Now at that time Venerable Ānanda was standing behind the Buddha fanning him.
an7.22:4.2	Then the Buddha said to him:
an7.22:4.3	“Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings?”
an7.22:4.4	“I have heard that, sir.”
an7.22:4.5	“As long as the Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings, they can expect growth, not decline.
an7.22:5.1	Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis meet in harmony, leave in harmony, and carry on their business in harmony?”
an7.22:5.2	“I have heard that, sir.”
an7.22:5.3	“As long as the Vajjis meet in harmony, leave in harmony, and carry on their business in harmony, they can expect growth, not decline.
an7.22:6.1	Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis don’t make new decrees or abolish existing decrees, but proceed having undertaken the ancient Vajjian principles as they have been decreed?”
an7.22:6.2	“I have heard that, sir.”
an7.22:6.3	“As long as the Vajjis don’t make new decrees or abolish existing decrees, but proceed having undertaken the traditional Vajjian principles as they have been decreed, they can expect growth, not decline.
an7.22:7.1	Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate Vajjian elders, and think them worth listening to?”
an7.22:7.2	“I have heard that, sir.”
an7.22:7.3	“As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate Vajjian elders, and think them worth listening to, they can expect growth, not decline.
an7.22:8.1	Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis don’t rape or abduct women or girls from their families and force them to live with them?”
an7.22:8.2	“I have heard that, sir.”
an7.22:8.3	“As long as the Vajjis don’t rape or abduct women or girls from their families and force them to live with them, they can expect growth, not decline.
an7.22:9.1	Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajjian shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the proper spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past?”
an7.22:9.2	“I have heard that, sir.”
an7.22:9.3	“As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajjian shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the proper spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past, they can expect growth, not decline.
an7.22:10.1	Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis organize proper protection, shelter, and security for perfected ones, so that more perfected ones might come to the realm and those already here may live in comfort?”
an7.22:10.2	“I have heard that, sir.”
an7.22:10.3	“As long as the Vajjis organize proper protection, shelter, and security for perfected ones, so that more perfected ones might come to the realm and those already here may live in comfort, they can expect growth, not decline.”
an7.22:11.1	Then the Buddha said to Vassakāra:
an7.22:11.2	“Brahmin, one time I was staying near Vesālī at the Sārandada woodland shrine.
an7.22:11.3	There I taught the Vajjis these principles that prevent decline.
an7.22:11.4	As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the Vajjis, and as long as the Vajjis are seen following them, they can expect growth, not decline.”
an7.22:12.1	When the Buddha had spoken, Vassakāra said to him: “Master Gotama, if the Vajjis follow even a single one of these principles they can expect growth, not decline.
an7.22:12.2	How much more so all seven!
an7.22:12.3	King Ajātasattu cannot defeat the Vajjis in war, unless by diplomacy or by sowing dissension.
an7.22:12.4	Well, now, Master Gotama, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.”
an7.22:12.5	“Please, brahmin, go at your convenience.”
an7.22:12.6	Then Vassakāra the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got up from his seat and left.

an7.23:5.1	As long as the mendicants honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the senior mendicants—of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha—and think them worth listening to, they can expect growth, not decline.
an7.23:6.1	As long as the mendicants don’t fall under the sway of arisen craving for future lives, they can expect growth, not decline.

an7.28:1.1	So I have heard.
an7.28:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an7.28:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
an7.28:1.4	“These seven things lead to the decline of a mendicant trainee.
an7.28:1.5	What seven?
an7.28:1.6	They relish work, talk, sleep, and company. They don’t guard the sense doors and they eat too much. And when there is Saṅgha business to be carried out, they don’t reflect:
an7.28:1.7	‘There are senior mendicants in the Saṅgha of long standing, long gone forth, responsible. They’ll be known for taking care of this.’ So they try to do it themselves.

an7.29:1.3	They miss out on seeing the mendicants.
an7.29:1.4	They neglect listening to the true teaching.
an7.29:1.5	They don’t train in higher ethical conduct.
an7.29:1.6	They’re very suspicious about mendicants, whether senior, junior, or middle.
an7.29:1.7	They listen to the teaching with a hostile, fault-finding mind.
an7.29:1.8	They seek outside of the Buddhist community for those worthy of religious donations.

an7.29:2.10	These seven things don’t lead to the decline of a lay follower.”
an7.29:2.11	That is what the Buddha said.
an7.29:2.12	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:
an7.29:3.1	“A lay follower misses out on seeing
an7.29:3.2	those who are evolved

an7.29:3.4	They don’t train in higher ethical conduct,

an7.47:5.4	Even before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post one gives rise to the thought:
an7.47:5.5	‘May this many bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, and rams be slaughtered for the sacrifice!’
an7.47:5.6	Thinking, ‘May I make merit’, one makes bad karma. Thinking, ‘May I do good’, one does bad. Thinking, ‘May I seek the path to a good rebirth’, one seeks the path to a bad rebirth.
an7.47:5.7	Even before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post one raises this first unskillful mental knife which ripens and results in suffering.
an7.47:6.1	Furthermore, even before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post, one says such things as:

an7.47:6.3	Thinking, ‘May I make merit’, one makes bad karma. Thinking, ‘May I do good’, one does bad. Thinking, ‘May I seek the path to a good rebirth’, one seeks the path to a bad rebirth.
an7.47:6.4	Even before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post one raises this second unskillful verbal knife which ripens and results in suffering.
an7.47:7.1	Furthermore, even before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post one first personally undertakes preparations for the sacrificial slaughter of bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, and rams.
an7.47:7.2	Thinking, ‘May I make merit’, one makes bad karma. Thinking, ‘May I do good’, one does bad. Thinking, ‘May I seek the path to a good rebirth’, one seeks the path to a bad rebirth.

an7.47:8.3	The fires of greed, hate, and delusion.
an7.47:9.1	And why should the fire of greed be given up and rejected, not cultivated?

an7.47:9.3	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.

an7.47:10.3	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
an7.47:10.4	That’s why the fire of hate should be given up and rejected, not cultivated.

an7.47:11.3	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.

an7.47:13.2	Your mother and father are called the fire of those worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods.
an7.47:13.3	Why is that?
an7.47:13.4	Since it is from them that you’ve been incubated and produced. So you should properly and happily take care of this fire, honoring, respecting, esteeming, and venerating it.
an7.47:14.1	And what is the fire of a householder?
an7.47:14.2	Your children, partners, bondservants, workers, and staff are called a householder’s fire.
an7.47:14.3	So you should properly and happily take care of this fire, honoring, respecting, esteeming, and venerating it.

an7.47:15.2	The ascetics and brahmins who avoid intoxication and negligence, are settled in patience and gentleness, and who tame, calm, and extinguish themselves are called the fire of those worthy of a religious donation.
an7.47:15.3	So you should properly and happily take care of this fire, honoring, respecting, esteeming, and venerating it.
an7.47:15.4	You should properly and happily take care of these three fires, honoring, respecting, esteeming, and venerating them.
an7.47:16.1	But the wood fire, brahmin, should, from time to time, be fanned, watched over with equanimity, extinguished, or put aside.”
an7.47:17.1	When he said this, the brahmin Uggatasarīra said to the Buddha,
an7.47:17.2	“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! …
an7.47:17.3	From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.
an7.47:17.4	Master Gotama, I now set free these five hundred bulls, five hundred bullocks, five hundred heifers, five hundred goats, and five hundred rams. I give them life!

an7.49:2.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
an7.49:2.3	When a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of ugliness, their mind draws back from sexual intercourse. They shrink away, turn aside, and don’t get drawn into it. And either equanimity or revulsion become stabilized.
an7.49:2.4	It’s like a chicken’s feather or a strip of sinew thrown in a fire. It shrivels up, shrinks, rolls up, and doesn’t stretch out.

an7.50:1.1	Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
an7.50:1.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,
an7.50:1.3	“Does Master Gotama claim to be celibate?”
an7.50:1.4	“Brahmin, if anyone should be rightly said to
an7.50:1.5	live the celibate life unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, full and pure, it’s me.”

an7.50:1.7	“But what, Master Gotama, is a break, taint, stain, or mar in celibacy?”
an7.50:2.1	“Firstly, an ascetic or brahmin who claims to be perfectly celibate does not mutually engage in sex with a female.
an7.50:2.2	However, they consent to being anointed, massaged, bathed, and rubbed by a female.
an7.50:2.3	They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying.
an7.50:2.4	This is a break, taint, stain, or mar in celibacy.
an7.50:2.5	This is called one who lives the celibate life impurely, tied to the fetter of sex. They’re not freed from rebirth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They’re not freed from suffering, I say.
an7.50:3.1	Furthermore, an ascetic or brahmin who claims to be perfectly celibate does not mutually engage in sex with a female. Nor do they consent to massage and bathing.

an7.50:8.1	They don’t see a householder or their child amusing themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
an7.50:8.2	However, they live the celibate life wishing to be reborn in one of the orders of gods. They think: ‘By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life, may I become one of the gods!’

an7.50:9.1	As long as I saw that these seven sexual fetters—or even one of them—had not been given up in me, I didn’t announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.

an7.52:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond.

an7.53:1.1	So I have heard.
an7.53:1.2	At one time the venerables Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna were wandering in the Southern Hills together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.
an7.53:1.3	Now at that time the laywoman Veḷukaṇṭakī, Nanda’s mother, rose at the crack of dawn and recited the verses of “The Way to the Beyond”.
an7.53:2.1	And at that time the great king Vessavaṇa was on his way from the north to the south on some business.
an7.53:2.2	He heard Nanda’s Mother reciting, and stood waiting for her to finish.
an7.53:3.1	Then when her recital was over she fell silent.
an7.53:3.2	Then, knowing she had finished, Vessavaṇa applauded, saying,
an7.53:3.3	“Good, sister! Good, sister!”
an7.53:3.4	“But who might you be, my dear?”
an7.53:3.5	“Sister, I am your brother Vessavaṇa, the great king.”
an7.53:3.6	“Good, my dear! Then may my recital of the teaching be my offering to you as my guest.”
an7.53:3.7	‘Good, sister! And let this also be your offering to me as your guest.
an7.53:3.8	Tomorrow, the mendicant Saṅgha headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna will arrive at Veḷukaṇṭa before breakfast. When you’ve served the Saṅgha, please dedicate the religious donation to me.

an7.53:4.1	And when the night had passed the lay woman Nanda’s Mother had a variety of delicious foods prepared in her own home.
an7.53:4.2	Then the Saṅgha of mendicants headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna arrived at Veḷukaṇṭa.

an7.53:4.4	“Please, mister, go to the monastery and announce the time to the Saṅgha, saying:
an7.53:4.5	‘Sirs, it’s time. The meal is ready in the home of the lady Nanda’s Mother.’”

an7.53:4.8	And then the Saṅgha of mendicants headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, went to the home of Nanda’s Mother, where they sat on the seats spread out.
an7.53:4.9	Then Nanda’s Mother served and satisfied them with her own hands with a variety of delicious foods.
an7.53:5.1	When Sāriputta had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Nanda’s Mother sat down to one side.

an7.53:6.1	“Sir, last night I rose at the crack of dawn and recited the verses of ‘The Way to the Beyond’, and then I fell silent.
an7.53:6.2	Then the great king Vessavaṇa, knowing I had finished, applauded me,
an7.53:6.3	‘Good, sister! Good, sister!’
an7.53:6.4	I asked: ‘But who might you be, my dear?’
an7.53:6.5	‘Sister, I am your brother Vessavaṇa, the great king.’
an7.53:6.6	‘Good, my dear! Then may my recital of the teaching be my offering to you as my guest.’
an7.53:6.7	‘Good, sister! And let this also be your offering to me as your guest.
an7.53:6.8	Tomorrow, the mendicant Saṅgha headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna will arrive at Veḷukaṇṭa before breakfast. When you’ve served the Saṅgha, please dedicate the religious donation to me.
an7.53:6.9	Then that will also be your offering to me as your guest.’
an7.53:6.10	And so, sir, may the merit and the growth of merit in this gift be for the happiness of the great king Vessavaṇa.”
an7.53:7.1	“It’s incredible, Nanda’s Mother, it’s amazing
an7.53:7.2	that you converse face to face with a mighty and illustrious god like the great king Vessavaṇa.”
an7.53:8.1	“Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality;
an7.53:8.2	there is another.
an7.53:8.3	I had an only son called Nanda who I loved dearly.
an7.53:8.4	The rulers forcibly abducted him on some pretext and had him executed.
an7.53:8.5	But I can’t recall getting upset when my boy was under arrest or being arrested, imprisoned or being put in prison, killed or being killed.”
an7.53:8.6	“It’s incredible, Nanda’s Mother, it’s amazing
an7.53:8.7	that you purify even the arising of a thought.”
an7.53:9.1	“Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality;
an7.53:9.2	there is another.
an7.53:9.3	When my husband passed away he was reborn in one of the realms of spirits.
an7.53:9.4	He revealed to me his previous life-form.
an7.53:9.5	But I can’t recall getting upset on that account.”
an7.53:9.6	“It’s incredible, Nanda’s Mother, it’s amazing
an7.53:9.7	that you purify even the arising of a thought.”
an7.53:10.1	“Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality;
an7.53:10.2	there is another.
an7.53:10.3	Ever since we were both young, and I was given in marriage to my husband, I can’t recall betraying him even in thought, still less in deed.”
an7.53:10.4	“It’s incredible, Nanda’s Mother, it’s amazing
an7.53:10.5	that you purify even the arising of a thought.”
an7.53:11.1	“Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality;
an7.53:11.2	there is another.
an7.53:11.3	Ever since I declared myself a lay follower, I can’t recall deliberately breaking any precept.”
an7.53:11.4	“It’s incredible, Nanda’s Mother, it’s amazing!”
an7.53:12.1	“Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality;
an7.53:12.2	there is another.
an7.53:12.3	Whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an7.53:12.4	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, I enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an7.53:12.5	And with the fading away of rapture, I enter and remain in the third absorption, where I meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
an7.53:12.6	With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.”
an7.53:12.7	“It’s incredible, Nanda’s Mother, it’s amazing!”
an7.53:13.1	“Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality;
an7.53:13.2	there is another.
an7.53:13.3	Of the five lower fetters taught by the Buddha, I don’t see any that I haven’t given up.”
an7.53:13.4	“It’s incredible, Nanda’s Mother, it’s amazing!”
an7.53:14.1	Then Venerable Sāriputta educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Nanda’s Mother with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.

an7.57:9.1	“When their body breaks up, after death, which do you think would be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?”
an7.57:9.2	NA
an7.57:9.3	“Why would the person who is faithless, stingy, miserly, and abusive be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?
an7.57:9.4	The faithful donor who loves charity would, when their body breaks up, after death, be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
an7.57:10.1	When it comes to these fruits of giving that are apparent in the present life, I don’t have to rely on faith in the Buddha,
an7.57:10.2	for I know them too.
an7.57:10.3	I’m a giver, a donor, and the perfected ones show compassion for me first.
an7.57:10.4	I’m a giver, and the perfected ones approach me first.
an7.57:10.5	I’m a giver, and the perfected ones receive alms from me first.
an7.57:10.6	I’m a giver, and the perfected ones teach me Dhamma first.
an7.57:10.7	I’m a giver, and I have this good reputation:
an7.57:10.8	‘General Sīha gives, serves, and attends on the Saṅgha.’
an7.57:10.9	I’m a giver, I enter any kind of assembly bold and assured, whether it’s an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics.
an7.57:10.10	When it comes to these fruits of giving that are apparent in the present life, I don’t have to rely on faith in the Buddha,
an7.57:10.11	for I know them too.
an7.57:10.12	But when the Buddha says:
an7.57:10.13	‘When a giver’s body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ I don’t know this,
an7.57:10.14	so I have to rely on faith in the Buddha.”
an7.57:10.15	“That’s so true, Sīha! That’s so true!
an7.57:10.16	When a giver’s body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”

an7.58:1.1	“Mendicants, there are four areas where the Realized One has nothing to hide, and three ways he is irreproachable.
an7.58:1.2	What are the four areas where the Realized One has nothing to hide?
an7.58:1.3	His bodily behavior is pure.
an7.58:1.4	So the Realized One has no bodily misconduct to hide, thinking:
an7.58:1.5	‘Don’t let others find this out about me!’
an7.58:2.1	His verbal behavior is pure.
an7.58:2.2	So the Realized One has no verbal misconduct to hide, thinking:
an7.58:2.3	‘Don’t let others find this out about me!’
an7.58:3.1	His mental behavior is pure.
an7.58:3.2	So the Realized One has no mental misconduct to hide, thinking:
an7.58:3.3	‘Don’t let others find this out about me!’
an7.58:4.1	His livelihood is pure.
an7.58:4.2	So the Realized One has no wrong livelihood to hide, thinking:
an7.58:4.3	‘Don’t let others find this out about me!’
an7.58:5.1	These are the four areas where the Realized One has nothing to hide.
an7.58:6.1	What are the three ways the Realized One is irreproachable?
an7.58:6.2	The Realized One has explained the teaching well.
an7.58:6.3	I see no reason for anyone—whether ascetic, brahmin, god, Māra, or Brahmā, or anyone else in the world—to legitimately scold me, saying:
an7.58:6.4	‘For such and such reasons you haven’t explained the teaching well.’
an7.58:6.5	NA
an7.58:6.6	Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.
an7.58:7.1	I have clearly described the practice that leads to extinguishment for my disciples.
an7.58:7.2	Practicing in accordance with this, my disciples realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
an7.58:7.3	I see no reason for anyone—whether ascetic, brahmin, god, Māra, or Brahmā, or anyone else in the world—to legitimately scold me, saying:

an7.58:7.5	NA
an7.58:7.6	Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.
an7.58:8.1	Many hundreds in my assembly of disciples have realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
an7.58:8.2	I see no reason for anyone—whether ascetic, brahmin, god, Māra, or Brahmā, or anyone else in the world—to legitimately scold me, saying:

an7.59:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kimbilā in the Freshwater Mangrove Wood.
an7.59:1.3	Then Venerable Kimbila went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an7.59:1.4	“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why the true teaching does not last long after the final extinguishment of the Realized One?”
an7.59:2.1	“Kimbila, it’s when the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen lack respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the training, immersion, diligence, and hospitality after the final extinguishment of the Realized One.
an7.59:2.2	This is the cause, this is the reason why the true teaching does not last long after the final extinguishment of the Realized One.”
an7.59:3.1	“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why the true teaching does last long after the final extinguishment of the Realized One?”

an7.60:1.2	What seven?
an7.60:1.3	It’s when a mendicant is faithful, ethical, learned, secluded, energetic, mindful, and wise.
an7.60:1.4	A mendicant with these seven qualities soon realizes the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. They live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.”
an7.61:0.1	Numbered Discourses 7
an7.61:0.2	6. The Undeclared Points
an7.61:0.3	61. Nodding Off
an7.61:1.1	So I have heard.
an7.61:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.
an7.61:1.3	Now at that time, in the land of the Magadhans near Kallavāḷamutta Village, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was nodding off while meditating.
an7.61:1.4	The Buddha saw him with his clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman.
an7.61:1.5	NA
an7.61:1.6	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood in the land of the Bhaggas and reappeared in front of Mahāmoggallāna near Kallavāḷamutta Village in the land of the Magadhans.
an7.61:1.7	He sat on the seat spread out
an7.61:1.8	and said to Mahāmoggallāna,
an7.61:2.1	“Are you nodding off, Moggallāna? Are you nodding off?”
an7.61:2.2	“Yes, sir.”
an7.61:2.3	“So, Moggallāna, don’t focus on or cultivate the perception that you were meditating on when you fell drowsy.
an7.61:2.4	It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way.
an7.61:3.1	But what if that doesn’t work? Then think about and consider the teaching as you’ve learned and memorized it, examining it with your mind.
an7.61:3.2	It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way.
an7.61:4.1	But what if that doesn’t work? Then recite in detail the teaching as you’ve learned and memorized it.
an7.61:4.2	It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way.
an7.61:5.1	But what if that doesn’t work? Then pinch your ears and rub your limbs.
an7.61:5.2	It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way.
an7.61:6.1	But what if that doesn’t work? Then get up from your seat, flush your eyes with water, look around in every direction, and look up at the stars and constellations.
an7.61:6.2	It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way.
an7.61:7.1	But what if that doesn’t work? Then focus on the perception of light, concentrating on the perception of day,
an7.61:7.2	regardless of whether it’s night or day.
an7.61:7.3	And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, develop a mind that’s full of radiance.
an7.61:7.4	It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way.
an7.61:8.1	But what if that doesn’t work? Then walk mindfully, concentrating on the perception of continuity, your faculties directed inwards and your mind not scattered outside.
an7.61:8.2	It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way.
an7.61:9.1	But what if that doesn’t work? Then lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.
an7.61:9.2	When you wake, you should get up quickly, thinking:
an7.61:9.3	‘I will not live indulging in the pleasures of sleeping, lying down, and drowsing.’
an7.61:9.4	That’s how you should train.
an7.61:10.1	So you should train like this:
an7.61:10.2	‘I will not approach families with my head swollen with vanity.’
an7.61:10.3	That’s how you should train.
an7.61:10.4	What happens if a mendicant approaches families with a head swollen with vanity? Well, families have business to attend to,
an7.61:10.5	so people might not notice when a mendicant arrives. In that case the mendicant thinks:
an7.61:10.6	‘Who on earth has turned this family against me? It seems they don’t like me any more.’
an7.61:10.7	And so, because they don’t get anything they feel dismayed. Being dismayed, they become restless. Being restless, they lose restraint. And without restraint the mind is far from immersion.
an7.61:11.1	So you should train like this:
an7.61:11.2	‘I won’t get into arguments.’
an7.61:11.3	That’s how you should train.
an7.61:11.4	When there’s an argument, you can expect there’ll be lots of talking. When there’s lots of talking, people become restless. Being restless, they lose restraint. And without restraint the mind is far from immersion.
an7.61:11.5	Moggallāna, I don’t praise all kinds of closeness.
an7.61:11.6	Nor do I criticize all kinds of closeness.
an7.61:11.7	I don’t praise closeness with laypeople and renunciates.
an7.61:11.8	I do praise closeness with those lodgings that are quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat.”
an7.61:12.1	When he said this, Venerable Moggallāna asked the Buddha,
an7.61:12.2	“Sir, how do you briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans?”
an7.61:13.1	“It’s when a mendicant has heard:
an7.61:13.2	‘Nothing is worth insisting on.’
an7.61:13.3	When a mendicant has heard that
an7.61:13.4	nothing is worth insisting on,
an7.61:13.5	they directly know all things. Directly knowing all things, they completely understand all things. Having completely understood all things, when they experience any kind of feeling—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—
an7.61:13.6	they meditate observing impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in those feelings.
an7.61:13.7	Meditating in this way, they don’t grasp at anything in the world.
an7.61:13.8	Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.
an7.61:13.9	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’
an7.61:13.10	That’s how I briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans.”

an7.62:0.2	6. The Undeclared Points
an7.62:0.3	62. Don’t Fear Good Deeds
an7.62:1.1	“Mendicants, don’t fear good deeds.
an7.62:1.2	For ‘good deeds’ is a term for happiness.
an7.62:1.3	I recall undergoing for a long time the likable, desirable, and agreeable results of good deeds performed over a long time.
an7.62:1.4	I developed a mind of love for seven years.
an7.62:1.5	As a result, for seven eons of the cosmos contracting and expanding I didn’t return to this world again.
an7.62:1.6	As the cosmos contracted I went to the realm of streaming radiance.
an7.62:1.7	As it expanded I was reborn in an empty mansion of Brahmā.
an7.62:2.1	There I was Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the undefeated, the champion, the universal seer, the wielder of power.
an7.62:2.2	I was Sakka, lord of gods, thirty-six times.
an7.62:2.3	Many hundreds of times I was a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. My dominion extended to all four sides, I achieved stability in the country, and I possessed the seven treasures.
an7.62:2.4	These were my seven treasures:
an7.62:2.5	the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure.
an7.62:2.6	I had over a thousand sons who were valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of my enemies.
an7.62:2.7	After conquering this land girt by sea, I reigned by principle, without rod or sword.
an7.62:3.1	See the result of good deeds,
an7.62:3.2	of skillful deeds, for one seeking happiness.
an7.62:3.3	I developed a mind of love
an7.62:3.4	for seven years, mendicants.
an7.62:3.5	For seven eons of expansion and contraction
an7.62:3.6	I didn’t return to this world again.
an7.62:4.1	As the world contracted
an7.62:4.2	I went to the realm of streaming radiance.
an7.62:4.3	And when it expanded
an7.62:4.4	I went to an empty mansion of Brahmā.
an7.62:5.1	Seven times I was a Great Brahmā,
an7.62:5.2	and at that time I was the wielder of power.
an7.62:5.3	Thirty-six times I was lord of gods,
an7.62:5.4	acting as ruler of the gods.
an7.62:6.1	Then I was king, a wheel-turning monarch,
an7.62:6.2	ruler of all India.
an7.62:6.3	An anointed aristocrat,
an7.62:6.4	I was sovereign of all humans.
an7.62:7.1	Without rod or sword,
an7.62:7.2	I conquered this land.
an7.62:7.3	Through non-violent action
an7.62:7.4	I guided it justly.
an7.62:8.1	After ruling this vast territory
an7.62:8.2	by means of principle,
an7.62:8.3	I was born in a rich family,
an7.62:8.4	affluent and wealthy.
an7.62:9.1	It was replete with all sense pleasures,
an7.62:9.2	and the seven treasures.
an7.62:9.3	This was well taught by the Buddhas,
an7.62:9.4	who bring the world together.
an7.62:10.1	This is the cause of greatness
an7.62:10.2	by which one is called a lord of the land.
an7.62:10.3	I was a majestic king,
an7.62:10.4	with lots of property and assets.
an7.62:11.1	Successful and glorious,
an7.62:11.2	I was lord of India.
an7.62:11.3	Who would not be inspired by this,
an7.62:11.4	even someone of dark birth.
an7.62:12.1	Therefore someone who cares for their own welfare,
an7.62:12.2	and wants to become the very best they can be,
an7.62:12.3	should respect the true teaching,
an7.62:12.4	remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.”

an7.63:0.2	6. The Undeclared Points
an7.63:0.3	63. Kinds of Wives
an7.63:1.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, where he sat on the seat spread out.
an7.63:1.2	Now at that time people in Anāthapiṇḍika’s home were making a dreadful racket.
an7.63:1.3	Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,
an7.63:2.1	“Householder, what’s with the people making that dreadful racket in your home? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”
an7.63:2.2	“Sir, that’s my daughter-in-law Sujātā. She’s been brought here from a wealthy family.
an7.63:2.3	She doesn’t obey her mother-in-law or father-in-law or her husband. And she does not honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Buddha.”
an7.63:3.1	Then the Buddha addressed Sujātā, saying,
an7.63:3.2	“Come, Sujātā.”
an7.63:3.3	“Yes, sir,” she replied. She went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to her:
an7.63:4.1	“Sujātā, a man can have seven kinds of wife.
an7.63:4.2	What seven?
an7.63:4.3	A wife like a killer, a wife like a thief, a wife like a lord, a wife like a mother, a wife like a sister, a wife like a friend, and a wife like a bondservant.
an7.63:4.4	These are the kinds of wife that a man can have.
an7.63:4.5	Which one of these are you?”
an7.63:4.6	“Sir, I don’t understand the detailed meaning of what the Buddha has said in brief.
an7.63:4.7	Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.”
an7.63:4.8	“Well then, Sujātā, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an7.63:4.9	“Yes, sir,” she replied.
an7.63:4.10	The Buddha said this:
an7.63:5.1	“With a mind full of hate and no kindness,
an7.63:5.2	lusting for others, looking down on her husband,
an7.63:5.3	she longs to murder the one who paid the price for her.
an7.63:5.4	A man’s wife of this sort
an7.63:5.5	is called a wife and a killer.
an7.63:6.1	A woman’s husband earns his wealth
an7.63:6.2	by applying oneself to a profession, trade, or farming.
an7.63:6.3	And even if it’s only a little, she wants to take it.
an7.63:6.4	A man’s wife of this sort
an7.63:6.5	is called a wife and a thief.
an7.63:7.1	She’s an idle glutton who doesn’t want to work.
an7.63:7.2	Her words are harsh, fierce, and rude.
an7.63:7.3	She rules over him, though he rises early.
an7.63:7.4	A man’s wife of this sort
an7.63:7.5	is called a wife and a lord.
an7.63:8.1	She’s always caring and kind,
an7.63:8.2	looking after her husband like a mother her child.
an7.63:8.3	She keeps the wealth that he has earned secure.
an7.63:8.4	A man’s wife of this sort
an7.63:8.5	is called a wife and a mother.
an7.63:9.1	She respects her husband
an7.63:9.2	as a younger sister respects her elder.
an7.63:9.3	Conscientious, she does what her husband says.
an7.63:9.4	A man’s wife of this sort
an7.63:9.5	is called a wife and a sister.
an7.63:10.1	She’s delighted to see him,
an7.63:10.2	like one reunited with a long-lost friend.
an7.63:10.3	She’s well-raised, virtuous, and devoted.
an7.63:10.4	A man’s wife of this sort
an7.63:10.5	is called a wife and a friend.
an7.63:11.1	She has no anger when threatened with violence by the rod.
an7.63:11.2	Without hate or anger,
an7.63:11.3	she endures her husband and does what he says.
an7.63:11.4	A man’s wife of this sort
an7.63:11.5	is called a wife and a bondservant.
an7.63:12.1	The kinds of wives here called
an7.63:12.2	killer, thief, and lord;
an7.63:12.3	immoral, harsh, and lacking regard for others,
an7.63:12.4	when their body breaks up they set course for hell.
an7.63:13.1	But the kinds of wives here called
an7.63:13.2	mother, sister, friend, and bondservant;
an7.63:13.3	steadfast in their own morality, restrained for a long time,
an7.63:13.4	when their body breaks up they set course for a good place.
an7.63:14.1	Sujātā, these are the seven kinds of wife that a man can have.
an7.63:14.2	Which one of these are you?”
an7.63:14.3	“Sir, from this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a wife like a bondservant.”

an7.64:1.1	“Mendicants, these seven things that please and assist an enemy happen to an irritable woman or man.
an7.64:1.2	What seven?
an7.64:1.3	Firstly, an enemy wishes for an enemy:
an7.64:1.4	‘If only they’d become ugly!’
an7.64:1.5	Why is that?
an7.64:1.6	Because an enemy doesn’t like to have a beautiful enemy.
an7.64:1.7	An irritable person, overcome and overwhelmed by anger, is ugly, even though they’re nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed, and wearing white clothes.
an7.64:1.8	NA
an7.64:1.9	This is the first thing that pleases and assists an enemy which happens to an irritable woman or man.
an7.64:2.1	Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy:
an7.64:2.2	‘If only they’d sleep badly!’
an7.64:2.3	Why is that?
an7.64:2.4	Because an enemy doesn’t like to have an enemy who sleeps at ease.
an7.64:2.5	An irritable person, overcome and overwhelmed by anger, sleeps badly, even though they sleep on a couch spread with woolen covers—shag-piled, pure white, or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red pillows at both ends.
an7.64:2.6	NA
an7.64:2.7	This is the second thing …
an7.64:3.1	Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy:
an7.64:3.2	‘If only they don’t get all they need!’
an7.64:3.3	Why is that?
an7.64:3.4	Because an enemy doesn’t like to have an enemy who gets all they need.
an7.64:3.5	When an irritable person, overcome and overwhelmed by anger, gets what they don’t need they think, ‘I’ve got what I need.’ When they get what they need they think, ‘I’ve got what I don’t need.’
an7.64:3.6	When an angry person gets these things that are the exact opposite of what they need, it’s for their lasting harm and suffering.
an7.64:3.7	This is the third thing …
an7.64:4.1	Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy:
an7.64:4.2	‘If only they weren’t wealthy!’
an7.64:4.3	Why is that?
an7.64:4.4	Because an enemy doesn’t like to have an enemy who is wealthy.
an7.64:4.5	When a person is irritable, overcome and overwhelmed by anger, the rulers seize the legitimate wealth they’ve earned by their efforts, built up with their own hands, gathered by the sweat of their brow.
an7.64:4.6	This is the fourth thing …
an7.64:5.1	Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy:
an7.64:5.2	‘If only they weren’t famous!’
an7.64:5.3	Why is that?
an7.64:5.4	Because an enemy doesn’t like to have a famous enemy.
an7.64:5.5	When a person is irritable, overcome and overwhelmed by anger, any fame they have acquired by diligence falls to dust.
an7.64:5.6	This is the fifth thing …
an7.64:6.1	Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy:
an7.64:6.2	‘If only they had no friends!’
an7.64:6.3	Why is that?
an7.64:6.4	Because an enemy doesn’t like to have an enemy with friends.
an7.64:6.5	When a person is irritable, overcome and overwhelmed by anger, their friends and colleagues, relatives and kin avoid them from afar.
an7.64:6.6	This is the sixth thing …
an7.64:7.1	Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy:
an7.64:7.2	‘If only, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell!’
an7.64:7.3	Why is that?
an7.64:7.4	Because an enemy doesn’t like to have an enemy who goes to a good place.
an7.64:7.5	When a person is irritable, overcome and overwhelmed by anger, they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.
an7.64:7.6	NA
an7.64:7.7	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
an7.64:7.8	This is the seventh thing that pleases and assists an enemy which happens to an irritable woman or man.
an7.64:8.1	These are the seven things that please and assist an enemy which happen to an irritable woman or man.
an7.64:9.1	An irritable person is ugly
an7.64:9.2	and they sleep badly.
an7.64:9.3	When they get what they need,
an7.64:9.4	they take it to be what they don’t need.
an7.64:10.1	An angry person
an7.64:10.2	kills with body or speech;
an7.64:10.3	overcome with anger,
an7.64:10.4	they lose their wealth.
an7.64:11.1	Mad with anger,
an7.64:11.2	they fall into disgrace.
an7.64:11.3	Family, friends, and loved ones
an7.64:11.4	avoid an irritable person.
an7.64:12.1	Anger creates harm;
an7.64:12.2	anger upsets the mind.
an7.64:12.3	That person doesn’t recognize
an7.64:12.4	the danger that arises within.
an7.64:13.1	An angry person doesn’t know the good.
an7.64:13.2	An angry person doesn’t see the truth.
an7.64:13.3	When a person is beset by anger,
an7.64:13.4	only blind darkness is left.
an7.64:14.1	An angry person destroys with ease
an7.64:14.2	what was hard to build.
an7.64:14.3	Afterwards, when the anger is spent,
an7.64:14.4	they’re tormented as if burnt by fire.
an7.64:15.1	Their look betrays their sulkiness
an7.64:15.2	like a fire’s smoky plume.
an7.64:15.3	And when their anger flares up,
an7.64:15.4	they make others angry.
an7.64:16.1	They have no conscience or prudence,
an7.64:16.2	nor any respectful speech.
an7.64:16.3	One overcome by anger
an7.64:16.4	has no island refuge anywhere.
an7.64:17.1	The deeds that torment a man
an7.64:17.2	are far from those that are good.
an7.64:17.3	I’ll explain them now;
an7.64:17.4	listen to this, for it is the truth.
an7.64:18.1	An angry person slays their father;
an7.64:18.2	their mother, too, they slay.
an7.64:18.3	An angry person slays a saint;
an7.64:18.4	a normal person, too, they slay.
an7.64:19.1	A man is raised by his mother,
an7.64:19.2	who shows him the world.
an7.64:19.3	But an angry ordinary person slays
an7.64:19.4	even that good woman who gave him life.
an7.64:20.1	Like oneself, all sentient beings
an7.64:20.2	hold themselves most dear.
an7.64:20.3	But angry people kill themselves all kinds of ways,
an7.64:20.4	distraught for many reasons.
an7.64:21.1	Some kill themselves with swords,
an7.64:21.2	some, distraught, take poison.
an7.64:21.3	Some hang themselves with rope,
an7.64:21.4	or fling themselves down a mountain gorge.
an7.64:22.1	When they commit deeds of destroying life
an7.64:22.2	and killing themselves,
an7.64:22.3	they don’t realize what they do,
an7.64:22.4	for anger leads to their downfall.
an7.64:23.1	The snare of death in the form of anger
an7.64:23.2	lies hidden in the heart.
an7.64:23.3	You should cut it out by self-control,
an7.64:23.4	by wisdom, energy, and right ideas.
an7.64:24.1	An astute person should cut out
an7.64:24.2	this unskillful thing.
an7.64:24.3	And they’d train in the teaching in just the same way,
an7.64:24.4	not yielding to sulkiness.
an7.64:25.1	Free of anger, free of despair,
an7.64:25.2	free of greed, with no more longing,
an7.64:25.3	tamed, having given up anger,
an7.64:25.4	they become extinguished without defilements.”

an7.66:0.3	66. The Seven Suns
an7.66:1.1	So I have heard.
an7.66:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, in Ambapālī’s Wood.
an7.66:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
an7.66:1.4	“Mendicants!”
an7.66:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.
an7.66:1.6	The Buddha said this:
an7.66:2.1	“Mendicants, conditions are impermanent.
an7.66:2.2	Conditions are unstable.
an7.66:2.3	Conditions are unreliable.
an7.66:2.4	This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions.
an7.66:3.1	Sineru, the king of mountains, is 84,000 leagues long and 84,000 leagues wide. It sinks 84,000 leagues below the ocean and rises 84,000 leagues above it.
an7.66:3.2	There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, the rain doesn’t fall. For many years, many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of years no rain falls.
an7.66:3.3	When this happens, the plants and seeds, the herbs, grass, and big trees wither away and dry up, and are no more.
an7.66:3.4	So impermanent are conditions,
an7.66:3.5	so unstable, so unreliable.
an7.66:3.6	This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions.
an7.66:4.1	There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a second sun appears.
an7.66:4.2	When this happens, the streams and pools wither away and dry up, and are no more.
an7.66:4.3	So impermanent are conditions …
an7.66:4.4	NA
an7.66:5.1	There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a third sun appears.
an7.66:5.2	When this happens, the great rivers—
an7.66:5.3	the Ganges, Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and Mahī—wither away and dry up, and are no more.
an7.66:5.4	So impermanent are conditions …
an7.66:5.5	NA
an7.66:6.1	There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a fourth sun appears.
an7.66:6.2	When this happens, the great lakes from which the rivers originate—
an7.66:6.3	the Anotattā, Sīhapapātā, Rathakārā, Kaṇṇamuṇḍā, Kuṇālā, Chaddantā, and Mandākinī—wither away and dry up, and are no more.
an7.66:6.4	So impermanent are conditions …
an7.66:6.5	NA
an7.66:7.1	There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a fifth sun appears.
an7.66:7.2	When this happens, the water in the ocean sinks by a hundred leagues. It sinks by two, three, four, five, six, or even seven hundred leagues.
an7.66:7.3	The water that remains in the ocean is only seven palm trees deep. It’s six, five, four, three, two, or even one palm tree deep.
an7.66:7.4	The water that remains in the ocean is only seven fathoms deep. It’s six, five, four, three, two, one or even half a fathom deep. It’s waist high, knee high, or even ankle high.
an7.66:7.5	It’s like the time after the rainy season, when the rain falls heavily and water remains here and there in the cows’ hoofprints.
an7.66:7.6	In the same way, water in the ocean remains here and there in puddles like cows’ hoofprints.
an7.66:7.7	When the fifth sun appears there’s not even enough water in the great ocean to wet a toe-joint.

an7.66:8.1	There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a sixth sun appears.
an7.66:8.2	When this happens, this great earth and Sineru the king of mountains smoke and smolder and give off fumes.
an7.66:8.3	It’s like when a potter’s kiln is first kindled, and it smokes and smolders and gives off fumes.
an7.66:8.4	In the same way, this great earth and Sineru the king of mountains smoke and smolder and give off fumes.
an7.66:8.5	So impermanent are conditions …
an7.66:8.6	NA
an7.66:9.1	There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a seventh sun appears.
an7.66:9.2	When this happens, this great earth and Sineru the king of mountains erupt in one burning mass of fire.
an7.66:9.3	And as they blaze and burn the flames are swept by the wind as far as the Brahmā realm.
an7.66:9.4	Sineru the king of mountains blazes and burns, crumbling as it’s overcome by the great fire. And meanwhile, mountain peaks a hundred leagues high, or two, three, four, or five hundred leagues high disintegrate as they burn.
an7.66:9.5	And when the great earth and Sineru the king of mountains blaze and burn, no soot or ash is found.
an7.66:9.6	It’s like when ghee or oil blaze and burn, and neither ashes nor soot are found.
an7.66:9.7	In the same way, when the great earth and Sineru the king of mountains blaze and burn, no soot or ash is found.
an7.66:9.8	So impermanent are conditions,
an7.66:9.9	so unstable are conditions,
an7.66:9.10	so unreliable are conditions.
an7.66:9.11	This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions.
an7.66:10.1	Mendicants, who would ever think or believe that
an7.66:10.2	this earth and Sineru, king of mountains, will burn and crumble and be no more, except for one who has seen the truth?
an7.66:11.1	Once upon a time, there was a teacher called Sunetta. He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire.
an7.66:11.2	He had many hundreds of disciples.
an7.66:11.3	He taught them the path to rebirth in the company of Brahmā.
an7.66:11.4	Those who totally understood Sunetta’s teachings were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, the company of Brahmā.
an7.66:11.5	Of those who didn’t totally understand Sunetta’s teachings, some—when their body broke up, after death—were reborn in the company of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others. Some were reborn in the company of the Gods Who Love to Create, some with the Joyful Gods, some with the Gods of Yama, some with the Gods of the Thirty-Three, and some with the Gods of the Four Great Kings. Some were reborn in the company of well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders.
an7.66:12.1	Then the teacher Sunetta thought:
an7.66:12.2	‘It’s not proper for me to be reborn in the next life in exactly the same place as my disciples. Why don’t I further develop love?’
an7.66:13.1	Then Sunetta developed love for seven years.
an7.66:13.2	Having done so he did not return to this world for seven eons of cosmic expansion and contraction.
an7.66:13.3	As the cosmos contracted he went to the realm of streaming radiance.
an7.66:13.4	As it expanded he was reborn in an empty mansion of Brahmā.
an7.66:13.5	There he was Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the undefeated, the champion, the universal seer, the wielder of power.
an7.66:13.6	He was Sakka, lord of gods, thirty-six times.
an7.66:13.7	Many hundreds of times he was a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extended to all four sides, he achieved stability in the country, and he possessed the seven treasures.
an7.66:13.8	He had over a thousand sons who were valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.
an7.66:13.9	After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigned by principle, without rod or sword.
an7.66:13.10	Yet even though Sunetta lived so long, he was not exempt from
an7.66:13.11	rebirth, old age, and death. He was not exempt from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress, I say.
an7.66:14.1	Why is that?
an7.66:14.2	Because of not understanding and not penetrating four things.
an7.66:14.3	What four?
an7.66:14.4	Noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom.
an7.66:14.5	These noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom have been understood and comprehended. Craving for continued existence has been cut off; the attachment to continued existence is ended; now there’ll be no more future lives.”
an7.66:14.6	That is what the Buddha said.
an7.66:14.7	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:
an7.66:15.1	“Ethics, immersion, and wisdom,
an7.66:15.2	and the supreme freedom:
an7.66:15.3	these things have been understood
an7.66:15.4	by Gotama the renowned.
an7.66:16.1	And so the Buddha, having insight,
an7.66:16.2	explained this teaching to the mendicants.
an7.66:16.3	The Teacher has made an end of suffering;
an7.66:16.4	seeing clearly, he is extinguished.”

an7.67:0.3	67. The Simile of the Citadel
an7.67:1.1	“Mendicants, when a king’s frontier citadel is well provided with seven essentials and gets four kinds of sustenance when needed, without trouble or difficulty,
an7.67:1.2	it is then called a king’s frontier citadel that cannot be overrun by external foes and enemies.
an7.67:2.1	With what seven essentials is a citadel well provided?
an7.67:2.2	Firstly, a citadel has a pillar with deep foundations, firmly embedded, imperturbable and unshakable.
an7.67:2.3	This is the first essential with which a king’s frontier citadel is well provided, to defend those within and repel those outside.
an7.67:3.1	Furthermore, a citadel has a moat that is deep and wide.
an7.67:3.2	This is the second essential …
an7.67:4.1	Furthermore, a citadel has a patrol path that is high and wide.
an7.67:4.2	This is the third essential …
an7.67:5.1	Furthermore, a citadel has stores of many weapons, both projectile and hand-held.
an7.67:5.2	This is the fourth essential …
an7.67:6.1	Furthermore, many kinds of armed forces reside in a citadel, such as
an7.67:6.2	elephant riders, cavalry, charioteers, archers, bannermen, adjutants, food servers, warrior-chiefs, princes, chargers, great warriors, heroes, leather-clad soldiers, and sons of bondservants.
an7.67:6.3	This is the fifth essential …
an7.67:7.1	Furthermore, a citadel has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and intelligent. He keeps strangers out and lets known people in.
an7.67:7.2	This is the sixth essential …
an7.67:8.1	Furthermore, a citadel has a wall that’s high and wide, covered with plaster.
an7.67:8.2	This is the seventh essential with which a king’s frontier citadel is well provided, to defend those within and repel those outside.
an7.67:8.3	With these seven essentials a citadel is well provided.
an7.67:9.1	What are the four kinds of sustenance it gets when needed, without trouble or difficulty?
an7.67:9.2	Firstly, a king’s frontier citadel has much hay, wood, and water stored up for the enjoyment, relief, and comfort of those within and to repel those outside.
an7.67:10.1	Furthermore, a king’s frontier citadel has much rice and barley stored up for those within.
an7.67:11.1	Furthermore, a king’s frontier citadel has much food such as sesame, green gram, and black gram stored up for those within.
an7.67:12.1	Furthermore, a king’s frontier citadel has much medicine—
an7.67:12.2	ghee, butter, oil, honey, molasses, and salt—stored up for the enjoyment, relief, and comfort of those within and to repel those outside.
an7.67:12.3	These are the four kinds of sustenance it gets when needed, without trouble or difficulty.
an7.67:13.1	When a king’s frontier citadel is well provided with seven essentials and gets four kinds of sustenance when needed, without trouble or difficulty,
an7.67:13.2	it is then called a king’s frontier citadel that cannot be overrun by external foes and enemies.
an7.67:13.3	In the same way, when a noble disciple has seven good qualities, and they get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty,
an7.67:13.4	they are then called a noble disciple who cannot be overrun by Māra, who cannot be overrun by the Wicked One.
an7.67:13.5	What are the seven good qualities that they have?
an7.67:14.1	Just as a king’s frontier citadel has a pillar with deep foundations, firmly embedded, imperturbable and unshakable, to defend those within and repel those outside,
an7.67:14.2	in the same way a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:
an7.67:14.3	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
an7.67:14.4	A noble disciple with faith as their pillar gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful,
an7.67:14.5	they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless,
an7.67:14.6	and they keep themselves pure.
an7.67:14.7	This is the first good quality they have.
an7.67:15.1	Just as a citadel has a moat that is deep and wide,
an7.67:15.2	in the same way a noble disciple has a conscience. They’re conscientious about bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and conscientious about having any bad, unskillful qualities.
an7.67:15.3	A noble disciple with a conscience as their moat gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful,
an7.67:15.4	they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless,
an7.67:15.5	and they keep themselves pure.
an7.67:15.6	This is the second good quality they have.
an7.67:16.1	Just as a citadel has a patrol path that is high and wide,
an7.67:16.2	in the same way a noble disciple is prudent. They’re prudent when it comes to bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and prudent when it comes to acquiring any bad, unskillful qualities.
an7.67:16.3	A noble disciple with prudence as their patrol path gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful,
an7.67:16.4	they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless,
an7.67:16.5	and they keep themselves pure.
an7.67:16.6	This is the third good quality they have.
an7.67:17.1	Just as a citadel has stores of many weapons, both projectile and hand-held,
an7.67:17.2	in the same way a noble disciple is very learned. They remember and keep what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reciting them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.
an7.67:17.3	A noble disciple with learning as their weapon gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful,
an7.67:17.4	they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless,
an7.67:17.5	and they keep themselves pure.
an7.67:17.6	This is the fourth good quality they have.
an7.67:18.1	Just as many kinds of armed forces reside in a citadel …
an7.67:18.2	NA
an7.67:18.3	in the same way a noble disciple is energetic. They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.
an7.67:18.4	A noble disciple with energy as their armed forces gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful,
an7.67:18.5	they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless,
an7.67:18.6	and they keep themselves pure.
an7.67:18.7	This is the fifth good quality they have.
an7.67:19.1	Just as a citadel has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and intelligent, who keeps strangers out and lets known people in,
an7.67:19.2	in the same way a noble disciple is mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago.
an7.67:19.3	A noble disciple with mindfulness as their gatekeeper gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful,
an7.67:19.4	they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless,
an7.67:19.5	and they keep themselves pure.
an7.67:19.6	This is the sixth good quality they have.
an7.67:20.1	Just as a citadel has a wall that’s high and wide, covered with plaster, to defend those within and repel those outside,
an7.67:20.2	in the same way a noble disciple is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.
an7.67:20.3	A noble disciple with wisdom as their wall gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful,
an7.67:20.4	they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless,
an7.67:20.5	and they keep themselves pure.
an7.67:20.6	This is the seventh good quality they have.
an7.67:20.7	These are the seven good qualities that they have.
an7.67:21.1	And what are the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—that they get when they want, without trouble or difficulty?
an7.67:21.2	Just as a king’s frontier citadel has much hay, wood, and water stored up for the enjoyment, relief, and comfort of those within and to repel those outside,
an7.67:21.3	in the same way a noble disciple, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an7.67:21.4	This is for their own enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment.
an7.67:22.1	Just as a king’s frontier citadel has much rice and barley stored up,
an7.67:22.2	in the same way, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a noble disciple enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an7.67:22.3	This is for their own enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment.
an7.67:23.1	Just as a king’s frontier citadel has much food such as sesame, green gram, and black gram stored up,
an7.67:23.2	in the same way with the fading away of rapture, a noble disciple enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
an7.67:23.3	This is for their own enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment.
an7.67:24.1	Just as a king’s frontier citadel has much medicine—
an7.67:24.2	ghee, butter, oil, honey, molasses, and salt—stored up for the enjoyment, relief, and comfort of those within and to repel those outside,
an7.67:24.3	in the same way, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a noble disciple enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
an7.67:24.4	This is for their own enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment.
an7.67:24.5	These are the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—which they get when they want, without trouble or difficulty.
an7.67:25.1	When a noble disciple has seven good qualities, and they get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty,
an7.67:25.2	they are then called a noble disciple who cannot be overrun by Māra, who cannot be overrun by the Wicked One.”

an7.68:0.3	68. One Who Knows the Teachings
an7.68:1.1	“A mendicant with seven qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.
an7.68:1.2	What seven?
an7.68:1.3	It’s when a mendicant knows the teachings, knows the meaning, has self-knowledge, knows moderation, knows the right time, knows assemblies, and knows people high and low.
an7.68:2.1	And how is a mendicant one who knows the teachings?
an7.68:2.2	It’s when a mendicant knows the teachings:
an7.68:2.3	statements, songs, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications.
an7.68:2.4	If a mendicant did not know these teachings,
an7.68:2.5	they would not be called ‘one who knows the teachings’.
an7.68:2.6	But because they do know these teachings,
an7.68:2.7	they are called ‘one who knows the teachings’.
an7.68:2.8	Such is the one who knows the teachings.
an7.68:3.1	And how are they one who knows the meaning?
an7.68:3.2	It’s when a mendicant knows the meaning of this or that statement:
an7.68:3.3	‘This is what that statement means; that is what this statement means.’
an7.68:3.4	If a mendicant did not know the meaning of this or that statement,
an7.68:3.5	they would not be called ‘one who knows the meaning’.
an7.68:3.6	But because they do know the meaning of this or that statement,
an7.68:3.7	they are called ‘one who knows the meaning’.
an7.68:3.8	Such is the one who knows the teachings and the one who knows the meaning.
an7.68:4.1	And how are they one who has self-knowledge?
an7.68:4.2	It’s when a mendicant has self-knowledge:
an7.68:4.3	‘This is the extent of my faith, ethics, learning, generosity, wisdom, and eloquence.’
an7.68:4.4	If a mendicant did not have self-knowledge,
an7.68:4.5	they would not be called ‘one who has self-knowledge’.
an7.68:4.6	But because they do have self-knowledge,
an7.68:4.7	they are called ‘one who has self-knowledge’.
an7.68:4.8	Such is the one who knows the teachings, the one who knows the meaning, and the one who has self-knowledge.
an7.68:5.1	And how are they one who knows moderation?
an7.68:5.2	It’s when a mendicant knows moderation when receiving robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.
an7.68:5.3	If a mendicant did not know moderation, they would not be called ‘one who knows moderation’.
an7.68:5.4	But because they do know moderation, they are called ‘one who knows moderation’.
an7.68:5.5	Such is the one who knows the teachings, the one who knows the meaning, the one who has self-knowledge, and the one who knows moderation.
an7.68:6.1	And how are they one who knows the right time?
an7.68:6.2	It’s when a mendicant knows the right time:
an7.68:6.3	‘This is the time for recitation; this is the time for questioning; this is the time for meditation; this is the time for retreat.’
an7.68:6.4	If a mendicant did not know the right time,
an7.68:6.5	they would not be called ‘one who knows the right time’.
an7.68:6.6	But because they do know the right time,
an7.68:6.7	they are called ‘one who knows the right time’.
an7.68:6.8	Such is the one who knows the teachings, the one who knows the meaning, the one who has self-knowledge, the one who knows moderation, and the one who knows the right time.
an7.68:7.1	And how are they one who knows assemblies?
an7.68:7.2	It’s when a mendicant knows assemblies:
an7.68:7.3	‘This is an assembly of aristocrats, of brahmins, of householders, or of ascetics.
an7.68:7.4	This one should be approached in this way. This is how to stand, to act, to sit, to speak, or to stay silent when there.’
an7.68:7.5	If a mendicant did not know assemblies,
an7.68:7.6	NA
an7.68:7.7	they would not be called ‘one who knows assemblies’.
an7.68:7.8	But because they do know assemblies,
an7.68:7.9	NA
an7.68:7.10	they are called ‘one who knows assemblies’.
an7.68:7.11	Such is the one who knows the teachings, the one who knows the meaning, the one who has self-knowledge, the one who knows moderation, the one who knows the right time, and the one who knows assemblies.
an7.68:8.1	And how are they one who knows people high and low?
an7.68:8.2	It’s when a mendicant understands people in terms of pairs.
an7.68:8.3	Two people:
an7.68:8.4	one likes to see the noble ones, one does not.
an7.68:8.5	The person who doesn’t like to see the noble ones
an7.68:8.6	is reprehensible in that respect.
an7.68:8.7	The person who does like to see the noble ones
an7.68:8.8	is praiseworthy in that respect.
an7.68:9.1	Two people like to see the noble ones:
an7.68:9.2	one likes to hear the true teaching, one does not.
an7.68:9.3	The person who doesn’t like to hear the true teaching
an7.68:9.4	is reprehensible in that respect.
an7.68:9.5	The person who does like to hear the true teaching
an7.68:9.6	is praiseworthy in that respect.
an7.68:10.1	Two people like to hear the true teaching:
an7.68:10.2	one lends an ear to the teaching, one does not.
an7.68:10.3	The person who doesn’t lend an ear to the teaching
an7.68:10.4	is reprehensible in that respect.
an7.68:10.5	The person who does lend an ear to the teaching
an7.68:10.6	is praiseworthy in that respect.
an7.68:11.1	Two people lend an ear to the teaching:
an7.68:11.2	one remembers the teaching they’ve heard, one does not.
an7.68:11.3	The person who doesn’t remember the teaching they’ve heard
an7.68:11.4	is reprehensible in that respect.
an7.68:11.5	The person who does remember the teaching they’ve heard
an7.68:11.6	is praiseworthy in that respect.
an7.68:12.1	Two people remember the teaching they’ve heard:
an7.68:12.2	one reflects on the meaning of the teachings they have remembered, one does not.
an7.68:12.3	The person who does not reflect on the meaning of the teachings they have remembered
an7.68:12.4	is reprehensible in that respect.
an7.68:12.5	The person who does reflect on the meaning of the teachings they have remembered
an7.68:12.6	is praiseworthy in that respect.
an7.68:13.1	Two people reflect on the meaning of the teachings they have remembered:
an7.68:13.2	one understands the meaning and the teaching and practices accordingly, one understands the meaning and the teaching but does not practice accordingly.
an7.68:13.3	The person who understands the meaning and the teaching but does not practice accordingly
an7.68:13.4	is reprehensible in that respect.
an7.68:13.5	The person who understands the meaning and the teaching and practices accordingly
an7.68:13.6	is praiseworthy in that respect.
an7.68:14.1	Two people understand the meaning and the teaching and practice accordingly:
an7.68:14.2	one practices to benefit themselves but not others, and one practices to benefit both themselves and others.
an7.68:14.3	The person who practices to benefit themselves but not others
an7.68:14.4	is reprehensible in that respect.
an7.68:14.5	The person who practices to benefit both themselves and others
an7.68:14.6	is praiseworthy in that respect.
an7.68:15.1	That’s how a mendicant understands people in terms of pairs.
an7.68:16.1	That’s how a mendicant is one who knows people high and low.
an7.68:16.2	A mendicant with these seven qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”

an7.69:0.3	69. The Shady Orchid Tree
an7.69:1.1	“Mendicants, when the leaves on the Shady Orchid Tree belonging to the Gods of the Thirty-Three turn brown, the gods are elated. They think:
an7.69:1.2	‘Now the leaves on the Shady Orchid Tree have turned brown! It won’t be long until they fall.’
an7.69:2.1	When the leaves have fallen, the gods are elated. They think:
an7.69:2.2	‘Now the leaves on the Shady Orchid Tree have fallen. It won’t be long until its foliage starts to regrow.’
an7.69:3.1	When the foliage starts to regrow, the gods are elated. They think:
an7.69:3.2	‘Now the foliage of the Shady Orchid Tree has started to regrow. It won’t be long until it’s ready to grow flowers and leaves separately.’
an7.69:4.1	When it’s ready to grow flowers and leaves separately, the gods are elated. They think:
an7.69:4.2	‘Now the Shady Orchid Tree is ready to grow flowers and leaves separately. It won’t be long until buds start to form.’
an7.69:5.1	When the buds start to form, the gods are elated. They think:
an7.69:5.2	‘Now the buds of the Shady Orchid Tree have started to form. It won’t be long until the buds burst.’
an7.69:6.1	When the buds have burst, the gods are elated. They think:
an7.69:6.2	‘Now the buds of the Shady Orchid Tree have burst. It won’t be long until it fully blossoms.’
an7.69:7.1	When the Shady Orchid Tree of the Gods of the Thirty-Three has fully blossomed, the gods are elated. For four heavenly months they amused themselves at the root of the tree, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. When the Shady Orchid Tree has fully blossomed, its radiance spreads for fifty leagues, while its fragrance wafts for a hundred leagues.
an7.69:7.2	Such is the majesty of the Shady Orchid Tree.
an7.69:8.1	In the same way, when a noble disciple plans to go forth from the lay life to homelessness, they’re like the Shady Orchid Tree when its leaves turn brown.
an7.69:9.1	When a noble disciple shaves off their hair and beard, dresses in ocher robes, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, they’re like the Shady Orchid Tree when its leaves fall.
an7.69:10.1	When a noble disciple, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected,
an7.69:10.2	they’re like the Shady Orchid Tree when its foliage starts to regrow.
an7.69:11.1	When, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a noble disciple enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected,
an7.69:11.2	they’re like the Shady Orchid Tree when it’s ready to grow flowers and leaves separately.
an7.69:12.1	When, with the fading away of rapture, a noble disciple enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss’,
an7.69:12.2	they’re like the Shady Orchid Tree when its buds start to form.
an7.69:13.1	When, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a noble disciple enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness,
an7.69:13.2	they’re like the Shady Orchid Tree when its buds burst.
an7.69:14.1	When a noble disciple realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements,
an7.69:14.2	they’re like the Shady Orchid tree when it fully blossoms.
an7.69:15.1	At that time the earth gods raise the cry:
an7.69:15.2	‘This venerable named so-and-so, from such-and-such village or town, the pupil of the venerable named so-and-so, went forth from the lay life to homelessness. They’ve realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’
an7.69:16.1	Hearing the cry of the Earth Gods, the Gods of the Four Great Kings …
an7.69:16.2	the Gods of the Thirty-Three …
an7.69:16.3	the Gods of Yama …
an7.69:16.4	the Joyful Gods …
an7.69:16.5	the Gods Who Love to Create …
an7.69:16.6	the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others …
an7.69:16.7	the Gods of Brahmā’s Host raise the cry:
an7.69:16.8	‘This venerable named so-and-so, from such-and-such village or town, the pupil of the venerable named so-and-so, went forth from the lay life to homelessness. They’ve realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’
an7.69:16.9	And so at that moment, in that instant, the cry soars up to the Brahmā realm.
an7.69:16.10	Such is the majesty of a mendicant who has ended the defilements.”

an7.70:0.3	70. Honor
an7.70:1.1	Then as Venerable Sāriputta was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,
an7.70:1.2	“What should a mendicant honor and respect and rely on, to give up the unskillful and develop the skillful?”
an7.70:1.3	Then he thought,
an7.70:1.4	“A mendicant should honor and respect and rely on the Teacher …

an7.70:2.1	Then he thought,
an7.70:2.2	“These qualities are pure and bright in me. Why don’t I go and tell them to the Buddha?
an7.70:2.3	Then these qualities will not only be purified in me, but will be better known as purified.
an7.70:2.4	Suppose a man were to acquire a gold coin, pure and bright.
an7.70:2.5	They’d think,
an7.70:2.6	‘My gold coin is pure and bright. Why don’t I take it to show the smiths?
an7.70:2.7	Then it will not only be purified, but will be better known as purified.’
an7.70:2.8	In the same way, these qualities are pure and bright in me. Why don’t I go and tell them to the Buddha?
an7.70:2.9	Then these qualities will not only be purified in me, but will be better known as purified.”
an7.70:3.1	Then in the late afternoon, Sāriputta came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told the Buddha of his thoughts while on retreat.

an7.71:1.3	Even so, their mind is not freed from defilements by not grasping.
an7.71:1.4	Why is that?

an7.71:3.7	The four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path.
an7.71:4.1	Suppose there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs.
an7.71:4.2	And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated.
an7.71:4.3	Even if that chicken doesn’t wish:
an7.71:4.4	‘If only my chicks could break out of the eggshell with their claws and beak and hatch safely!’
an7.71:4.5	Still they can break out and hatch safely.
an7.71:4.6	Why is that?
an7.71:4.7	Because she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated.
an7.71:4.8	In the same way, when a mendicant is committed to development, they might not wish:
an7.71:4.9	‘If only my mind was freed from the defilements by not grasping!’
an7.71:4.10	Even so, their mind is freed from defilements by not grasping.
an7.71:4.11	Why is that?
an7.71:4.12	It’s because they’re developed.

an7.71:5.1	Suppose a carpenter or their apprentice sees the marks of his fingers and thumb on the handle of his adze. They don’t know how much of the handle was worn away today, how much yesterday, and how much previously. They just know what has been worn away.
an7.71:5.2	In the same way, when a mendicant is committed to development, they don’t know how much of the defilements were worn away today, how much yesterday, and how much previously. They just know what has been worn away.
an7.71:6.1	Suppose there was a sea-faring ship bound together with ropes. For six months they deteriorated in the water. Then in the cold season it was hauled up on dry land, where the ropes were weathered by wind and sun. When the clouds soaked it with rain, the ropes would readily collapse and rot away.
an7.71:6.2	In the same way, when a mendicant is committed to development their fetters readily collapse and rot away.”

an7.72:1.1	So I have heard.
an7.72:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.
an7.72:1.3	While walking along the road, at a certain spot he saw a bonfire burning, blazing, and glowing.
an7.72:1.4	Seeing this he left the road, sat at the root of a tree on a seat spread out,
an7.72:1.5	and addressed the mendicants,
an7.72:1.6	“Mendicants, do you see that bonfire burning, blazing, and glowing?”
an7.72:1.7	“Yes, sir.”
an7.72:2.1	“What do you think, mendicants?
an7.72:2.2	Which is better—to sit or lie down embracing that bonfire? Or to sit or lie down embracing a girl of the aristocrats or brahmins or householders with soft and tender hands and feet?”
an7.72:2.3	“Sir, it would be much better to sit or lie down embracing a girl of the aristocrats or brahmins or householders with soft and tender hands and feet. For it would be painful to sit or lie down embracing that bonfire.”
an7.72:3.1	“I declare this to you, mendicants, I announce this to you! It would be better for that unethical man—of bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual practitioner, though claiming to be one, rotten inside, corrupt, and depraved—to sit or lie down embracing that bonfire.
an7.72:3.2	Why is that?
an7.72:3.3	Because that might result in death or deadly pain. But when his body breaks up, after death, it would not cause him to be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
an7.72:4.1	But when such an unethical man sits or lies down embracing a girl of the aristocrats or brahmins or householders with soft and tender hands and feet, that brings him lasting harm and suffering. When his body breaks up, after death, he’s reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
an7.72:5.1	What do you think, mendicants?
an7.72:5.2	Which is better—to have a strong man twist a tough horse-hair rope around both shins and tighten it so that it cuts through your outer skin, your inner skin, your flesh, sinews, and bones, until it reaches your marrow and stays pressing there? Or to consent to well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders bowing down to you?”
an7.72:5.3	“Sir, it would be much better to consent to well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders bowing down.

an7.72:7.2	Which is better—to have a strong man stab you in the chest with a sharp, oiled sword? Or to consent to well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders revering you with joined palms?”

an7.72:9.2	Which is better—to have a strong man wrap you up in a red-hot sheet of iron, burning, blazing, and glowing? Or to enjoy the use of a robe given in faith by well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders?”
an7.72:9.3	“Sir, it would be much better to enjoy the use of a robe given in faith by well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders.

an7.72:15.1	What do you think, mendicants?

an7.72:17.1	So you should train like this:
an7.72:17.2	‘Our use of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick shall be of great fruit and benefit for those who offered them. And our going forth will not be wasted, but will be fruitful and fertile.’
an7.72:17.3	That’s how you should train.
an7.72:17.4	Considering your own good, mendicants, is quite enough for you to persist with diligence.
an7.72:17.5	Considering the good of others is quite enough for you to persist with diligence.
an7.72:17.6	Considering the good of both is quite enough for you to persist with diligence.”
an7.72:18.1	That is what the Buddha said.
an7.72:18.2	And while this discourse was being spoken, sixty monks spewed hot blood from their mouths.
an7.72:18.3	Sixty mendicants resigned the training and returned to a lesser life, saying:
an7.72:18.4	“It’s too hard, Blessed One! It’s just too hard!”
an7.72:18.5	And sixty monks were freed from defilements by not grasping.

an7.73:0.3	73. About Sunetta
an7.73:1.1	“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a Teacher called Sunetta. He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire.
an7.73:1.2	He had many hundreds of disciples.
an7.73:1.3	He taught them the path to rebirth in the company of Brahmā.
an7.73:1.4	Those lacking confidence in Sunetta were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
an7.73:1.5	Those full of confidence in Sunetta were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
an7.73:2.1	Once upon a time there was a teacher called Mūgapakkha …
an7.73:2.2	Aranemi …
an7.73:2.3	Kuddālaka …
an7.73:2.4	Hatthipāla …
an7.73:2.5	Jotipāla …
an7.73:2.6	Araka. He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire.
an7.73:2.7	He had many hundreds of disciples.
an7.73:2.8	He taught them the way to rebirth in the company of Brahmā.
an7.73:2.9	Those lacking confidence in Araka were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
an7.73:2.10	Those full of confidence in Araka were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
an7.73:3.1	What do you think, mendicants?
an7.73:3.2	If someone with malicious intent were to abuse and insult these seven teachers with their hundreds of followers, would they not make much bad karma?”
an7.73:3.3	“Yes, sir.”
an7.73:3.4	“They would indeed.
an7.73:3.5	But someone who abuses and insults a single person accomplished in view with malicious intent makes even more bad karma.
an7.73:3.6	Why is that?
an7.73:3.7	I say that any injury done by those outside of the Buddhist community does not compare with what is done to one’s own spiritual companions.
an7.73:4.1	So you should train like this:
an7.73:4.2	‘We will have no malicious intent for our spiritual companions.’
an7.73:4.3	That’s how you should train.”

an7.74:0.3	74. About Araka
an7.74:1.1	“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a Teacher called Araka. He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire.
an7.74:1.2	He had many hundreds of disciples,
an7.74:1.3	and he taught them like this:
an7.74:1.4	‘Brahmins, life as a human is short, brief, and fleeting, full of suffering and distress. Think about this and wake up! Do what’s good and lead the spiritual life, for no-one born can escape death.
an7.74:2.1	It’s like a drop of dew on a grass tip. When the sun comes up it quickly evaporates and doesn’t last long.
an7.74:2.2	In the same way, life as a human is like a dew-drop. It’s brief and fleeting, full of suffering and distress. Think about this and wake up! Do what’s good and lead the spiritual life, for no-one born can escape death.
an7.74:3.1	It’s like when the rain falls heavily. The bubbles quickly vanish and don’t last long.
an7.74:3.2	In the same way, life as a human is like a bubble. …
an7.74:4.1	It’s like a line drawn in water. It vanishes quickly and doesn’t last long.
an7.74:4.2	In the same way, life as a human is like a line drawn in water. …
an7.74:4.3	NA
an7.74:5.1	It’s like a mountain river traveling far, flowing fast, carrying all before it. It doesn’t turn back—not for a moment, a second, an instant—but runs, rolls, and flows on.
an7.74:5.2	In the same way, life as a human is like a mountain river. …
an7.74:5.3	NA
an7.74:6.1	It’s like a strong man who has formed a glob of spit on the tip of his tongue. He could easily spit it out.
an7.74:6.2	In the same way, life as a human is like a glob of spit. …
an7.74:6.3	NA
an7.74:7.1	Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day. If you tossed a lump of meat in, it would quickly vanish and not last long.
an7.74:7.2	In the same way, life as a human is like a lump of meat. …
an7.74:7.3	NA
an7.74:8.1	It’s like a cow being led to the slaughter. With every step she comes closer to the slaughter, closer to death.
an7.74:8.2	In the same way, life as a human is like a cow being slaughtered. It’s brief and fleeting, full of suffering and distress. Think about this and wake up! Do what’s good and lead the spiritual life, for no-one born can escape death.’
an7.74:9.1	Now, mendicants, at that time human beings had a life span of 60,000 years. Girls could be married at 500 years of age.
an7.74:9.2	And human beings only had six afflictions:
an7.74:9.3	cold, heat, hunger, thirst, and the need to defecate and urinate.
an7.74:9.4	But even though humans were so long-lived with so few afflictions, Araka still taught in this way:
an7.74:9.5	‘Life as a human is short, brief, and fleeting, full of suffering and distress. Think about this and wake up! Do what’s good and lead the spiritual life, for no-one born can escape death.’
an7.74:10.1	These days it’d be right to say:
an7.74:10.2	‘Life as a human is short, brief, and fleeting, full of suffering and distress. Think about this and wake up! Do what’s good and lead the spiritual life, for no-one born can escape death.’
an7.74:10.3	For these days a long life is a hundred years or a little more.
an7.74:10.4	Living for a hundred years, there are just three hundred seasons,
an7.74:10.5	a hundred each of the winter, summer, and rains.
an7.74:10.6	Living for three hundred seasons, there are just twelve hundred months,
an7.74:10.7	four hundred in each of the winter, summer, and rains.
an7.74:10.8	Living for twelve hundred months, there are just twenty-four hundred fortnights,
an7.74:10.9	eight hundred in each of the winter, summer, and rains.
an7.74:10.10	Living for 2,400 fortnights, there are just 36,000 days,
an7.74:10.11	12,000 in each of the summer, winter, and rains.
an7.74:10.12	Living for 36,000 days, you just eat 72,000 meals,
an7.74:10.13	24,000 in each of the summer, winter, and rains, including when you’re suckling at the breast, and when you’re prevented from eating.
an7.74:11.1	Things that prevent you from eating include anger, pain, sickness, sabbath, or being unable to get food.
an7.74:11.2	So mendicants, for a human being with a hundred years life span I have counted the life span, the limit of the life span, the seasons, the years, the months, the fortnights, the nights, the days, the meals, and the things that prevent them from eating.
an7.74:11.3	Out of compassion, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples.
an7.74:11.4	Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, mendicants! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.”

an8.1:1.1	So I have heard.
an8.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an8.1:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
an8.1:1.4	“Mendicants!”
an8.1:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.
an8.1:1.6	The Buddha said this:
an8.1:2.1	“Mendicants, you can expect eight benefits when the heart’s release by love has been cultivated, developed, and practiced, made a vehicle and a basis, kept up, consolidated, and properly implemented.
an8.1:2.2	What eight?
an8.1:2.3	You sleep at ease. You wake happily. You don’t see bad dreams. Humans love you. Non-humans love you. Deities protect you. You can’t be harmed by fire, poison, or blade. If you don’t reach any higher, you’ll be reborn in a Brahmā realm.
an8.1:2.4	You can expect these eight benefits when the heart’s release by love has been cultivated, developed, and practiced, made a vehicle and a basis, kept up, consolidated, and properly implemented.
an8.1:3.1	A mindful one who develops
an8.1:3.2	limitless love
an8.1:3.3	weakens the fetters,
an8.1:3.4	seeing the ending of attachments.
an8.1:4.1	Loving just one creature with a hateless heart
an8.1:4.2	makes you a good person.
an8.1:4.3	Compassionate for all creatures,
an8.1:4.4	a noble one creates abundant merit.

an8.1:5.2	and traveled around sponsoring sacrifices—
an8.1:5.3	horse sacrifice, human sacrifice,

an8.1:6.3	as all the constellations of stars
an8.1:6.4	aren’t worth a sixteenth part of the moon’s light.

an8.1:7.2	don’t conquer or encourage others to conquer,

an8.2:1.1	“Mendicants, there are eight causes and reasons that lead to acquiring the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life, and to its increase, growth, and full development once it has been acquired.
an8.2:1.2	What eight?
an8.2:1.3	It’s when a mendicant lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role. And they set up a keen sense of conscience and prudence for them, with warmth and respect.
an8.2:1.4	This is the first cause.
an8.2:2.1	When a mendicant lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role—with a keen sense of conscience and prudence for them, with warmth and respect—from time to time they go and ask them questions:
an8.2:2.2	‘Why, sir, does it say this? What does that mean?’
an8.2:2.3	Those venerables clarify what is unclear, reveal what is obscure, and dispel doubt regarding the many doubtful matters.
an8.2:2.4	This is the second cause.
an8.2:3.1	After hearing that teaching they perfect withdrawal of both body and mind.
an8.2:3.2	This is the third cause.
an8.2:4.1	A mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
an8.2:4.2	This is the fourth cause.
an8.2:5.1	They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.
an8.2:5.2	This is the fifth cause.
an8.2:6.1	They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.
an8.2:6.2	This is the sixth cause.
an8.2:7.1	When in the Saṅgha they don’t engage in motley talk or unworthy talk.
an8.2:7.2	Either they talk on Dhamma, or they invite someone else to do so, or they respect noble silence.
an8.2:7.3	This is the seventh cause.
an8.2:8.1	They meditate observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates.
an8.2:8.2	‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.
an8.2:8.3	Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling.
an8.2:8.4	Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is the ending of perception.
an8.2:8.5	Such are choices, such is the origin of choices, such is the ending of choices.
an8.2:8.6	Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’
an8.2:8.7	This is the eighth cause.
an8.2:9.1	Their spiritual companions esteem them:
an8.2:9.2	‘This venerable lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role. They set up a keen sense of conscience and prudence for them, with warmth and respect.
an8.2:9.3	Clearly this venerable knows and sees.’
an8.2:9.4	This quality leads to fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.

an8.2:14.3	This quality also leads to fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.
an8.2:15.1	‘When in the Saṅgha they don’t engage in motley talk or unworthy talk.
an8.2:15.2	Either they talk on Dhamma, or they invite someone else to do so, or they respect noble silence.
an8.2:15.3	Clearly this venerable knows and sees.’
an8.2:15.4	This quality also leads to fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.

an8.2:16.8	This quality also leads to fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.

an8.6:3.2	“Yes, sir,” they replied.

an8.6:3.5	They don’t reflect:

an8.8:1.1	At one time Venerable Uttara was staying on the Saṅkheyyaka Mountain in the Mahisa region near Dhavajālikā.
an8.8:1.2	There Uttara addressed the mendicants:
an8.8:1.3	“Mendicants, it’s good for a mendicant to check their own failings from time to time.

an8.8:3.2	Then he went up to Sakka, lord of gods, and said to him:
an8.8:3.3	“Please sir, you should know this.
an8.8:3.4	Venerable Uttara is teaching the mendicants on Saṅkheyyaka Mountain in this way:
an8.8:3.5	‘It’s good for a mendicant from time to time to check their own failings. …

an8.8:5.6	“Indeed, lord of gods.”
an8.8:5.7	“Sir, did this teaching come to you from your own inspiration, or was it spoken by the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”
an8.8:5.8	“Well then, lord of gods, I shall give you a simile.
an8.8:5.9	For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.
an8.8:6.1	Suppose there was a large heap of grain not far from a town or village.

an8.8:6.6	“Sir, they should reply that they took it from the large heap of grain.”
an8.8:6.7	“In the same way, lord of gods, whatever is well spoken is spoken by the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.
an8.8:6.8	Both myself and others rely completely on that when we speak.”
an8.8:7.1	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!

an8.9:4.1	This is how Nanda is committed to wakefulness.
an8.9:4.2	Nanda practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying his mind from obstacles.
an8.9:4.3	In the evening, he continues to practice walking and sitting meditation.
an8.9:4.4	In the middle of the night, he lies down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.
an8.9:4.5	In the last part of the night, he gets up and continues to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying his mind from obstacles.
an8.9:4.6	This is how Nanda is committed to wakefulness.
an8.9:5.1	This is how Nanda has mindfulness and situational awareness.
an8.9:5.2	Nanda knows feelings as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away.
an8.9:5.3	He knows perceptions as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away.
an8.9:5.4	He knows thoughts as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away.
an8.9:5.5	This is how Nanda has mindfulness and situational awareness.
an8.9:6.1	How could Nanda live the full and pure spiritual life unless he guards the sense doors, eats in moderation, is dedicated to wakefulness, and has mindfulness and situational awareness?”

an8.10:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond.
an8.10:1.2	Now at that time the mendicants accused a mendicant of an offense.
an8.10:1.3	The accused mendicant dodged the issue, distracted the discussion with irrelevant points, and displayed annoyance, hate, and bitterness.
an8.10:2.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,
an8.10:2.2	“Mendicants, throw this person out!
an8.10:2.3	Throw this person out!
an8.10:2.4	This person should be shown the door.
an8.10:2.5	Why should you be vexed by an outsider?
an8.10:2.6	Take a case where a certain person looks just the same as other good-natured mendicants when going out and coming back, when looking ahead and aside, when bending and extending the limbs, and when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes.
an8.10:2.7	That is, so long as the mendicants don’t notice his offense.
an8.10:2.8	But when the mendicants notice the offense, they know that he’s
an8.10:2.9	a corrupt ascetic, just useless trash.
an8.10:2.10	When they realize this they send him away.
an8.10:2.11	Why is that?
an8.10:2.12	So that he doesn’t corrupt good-natured mendicants.
an8.10:3.1	Suppose in a growing field of barley some bad barley appeared, just useless trash.
an8.10:3.2	Its roots, stem, and leaves would look just the same as the healthy barley.
an8.10:3.3	NA
an8.10:3.4	NA
an8.10:3.5	That is, so long as the head doesn’t appear.
an8.10:3.6	But when the head appears, they know that it’s
an8.10:3.7	bad barley, just useless trash.
an8.10:3.8	When they realize this they pull it up by the roots and throw it outside the field.
an8.10:3.9	Why is that?
an8.10:3.10	So that it doesn’t spoil the good barley.
an8.10:4.1	In the same way, take a case where a certain person looks just the same as other good-natured mendicants when going out and coming back, when looking ahead and aside, when bending and extending the limbs, and when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes.
an8.10:4.2	That is, so long as the mendicants don’t notice his offense.
an8.10:4.3	But when the mendicants notice the offense, they know that he’s
an8.10:4.4	a corrupt ascetic, just useless trash.
an8.10:4.5	When they realize this they send him away.
an8.10:4.6	Why is that?
an8.10:4.7	So that he doesn’t corrupt good-natured mendicants.
an8.10:5.1	Suppose that a large heap of grain is being winnowed. The grains that are firm and substantial form a heap on one side. And the grains that are flimsy and insubstantial are blown over to the other side.
an8.10:5.2	Then the owners take a broom and sweep them even further away.
an8.10:5.3	Why is that?
an8.10:5.4	So that it doesn’t spoil the good grain.
an8.10:5.5	In the same way, take a case where a certain person looks just the same as other good-natured mendicants when going out and coming back, when looking ahead and aside, when bending and extending the limbs, and when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes.
an8.10:5.6	That is, so long as the mendicants don’t notice his offense.
an8.10:5.7	But when the mendicants notice the offense, they know that he’s
an8.10:5.8	a corrupt ascetic, just useless trash.
an8.10:5.9	When they realize this they send him away.
an8.10:5.10	Why is that?
an8.10:5.11	So that he doesn’t corrupt good-natured mendicants.
an8.10:6.1	Suppose a man needs an irrigation gutter for a well. He’d take a sharp axe and enter the wood,
an8.10:6.2	where he’d knock various trees with the axe. The trees that were firm and substantial made a cracking sound.
an8.10:6.3	But the trees that were rotten inside, decomposing and decayed, made a thud.
an8.10:6.4	He’d cut down such a tree at the root, lop off the crown, and thoroughly clear out the insides. Then he’d use it as an irrigation gutter for the well.
an8.10:6.5	In the same way, take a case where a certain person looks just the same as other good-natured mendicants when going out and coming back, when looking ahead and aside, when bending and extending the limbs, and when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes.
an8.10:6.6	That is, so long as the mendicants don’t notice his offense.
an8.10:6.7	But when the mendicants notice the offense, they know that he’s
an8.10:6.8	a corrupt ascetic, just useless trash.
an8.10:6.9	When they realize this they send him away.
an8.10:6.10	Why is that?
an8.10:6.11	So that he doesn’t corrupt good-natured mendicants.
an8.10:7.1	By living together, know that
an8.10:7.2	they’re irritable, with wicked desires,
an8.10:7.3	offensive, stubborn, and contemptuous,
an8.10:7.4	jealous, stingy, and devious.
an8.10:8.1	They speak to people with a voice
an8.10:8.2	so smooth, just like an ascetic.
an8.10:8.3	But they act in secret, with their bad views
an8.10:8.4	and their lack of regard for others.
an8.10:9.1	You should recognize them for what they are:
an8.10:9.2	a creep and liar.
an8.10:9.3	Then having gathered in harmony,
an8.10:9.4	you should expel them.
an8.10:10.1	Throw out the trash!
an8.10:10.2	Get rid of the rubbish!
an8.10:10.3	And sweep away the scraps—
an8.10:10.4	they’re not ascetics, they just think they are.
an8.10:11.1	When you’ve thrown out those of wicked desires,
an8.10:11.2	of bad behavior and alms-resort,
an8.10:11.3	dwell in communion, ever mindful,
an8.10:11.4	the pure with the pure.
an8.10:11.5	Then in harmony, alert,
an8.10:11.6	make an end of suffering.”

an8.11:0.2	2. The Great Chapter
an8.11:0.3	11. At Verañja
an8.11:1.1	So I have heard.
an8.11:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in Verañja at the root of a neem tree dedicated to Naḷeru.
an8.11:1.3	Then the brahmin Verañja went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
an8.11:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
an8.11:2.1	“Master Gotama, I have heard that
an8.11:2.2	the ascetic Gotama doesn’t bow to old brahmins, the elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat.
an8.11:2.3	And this is indeed the case,
an8.11:2.4	for Master Gotama does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat.
an8.11:2.5	This is not appropriate, Master Gotama.”
an8.11:2.6	“Brahmin, I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—for whom I should bow down or rise up or offer a seat.
an8.11:2.7	If the Realized One bowed down or rose up or offered a seat to anyone, their head would explode!”
an8.11:3.1	“Master Gotama lacks taste.”
an8.11:3.2	“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say
an8.11:3.3	that I lack taste.
an8.11:3.4	For the Realized One has given up taste for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. It’s cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
an8.11:3.5	In this sense you could rightly say that I lack taste.
an8.11:3.6	But that’s not what you’re talking about.”
an8.11:4.1	“Master Gotama is indelicate.”
an8.11:4.2	“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say
an8.11:4.3	that I’m indelicate.
an8.11:4.4	For the Realized One has given up delight in sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. It’s cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
an8.11:4.5	In this sense you could rightly say that I’m indelicate.
an8.11:4.6	But that’s not what you’re talking about.”
an8.11:5.1	“Master Gotama is a teacher of inaction.”
an8.11:5.2	“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that
an8.11:5.3	I’m a teacher of inaction.
an8.11:5.4	For I teach inaction regarding bad bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and the many kinds of unskillful things.
an8.11:5.5	In this sense you could rightly say that I’m a teacher of inaction.
an8.11:5.6	But that’s not what you’re talking about.”
an8.11:6.1	“Master Gotama is a teacher of annihilationism.”
an8.11:6.2	“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that
an8.11:6.3	I’m a teacher of annihilationism.
an8.11:6.4	For I teach the annihilation of greed, hate, and delusion, and the many kinds of unskillful things.
an8.11:6.5	In this sense you could rightly say that I’m a teacher of annihilationism.
an8.11:6.6	But that’s not what you’re talking about.”
an8.11:7.1	“Master Gotama is disgusted.”
an8.11:7.2	“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that
an8.11:7.3	I’m disgusted.
an8.11:7.4	For I’m disgusted by bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and by attainment of the many kinds of unskillful things.
an8.11:7.5	In this sense you could rightly say that I’m disgusted.
an8.11:7.6	But that’s not what you’re talking about.”
an8.11:8.1	“Master Gotama is an exterminator.”
an8.11:8.2	“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that
an8.11:8.3	I’m an exterminator.
an8.11:8.4	For I teach the extermination of greed, hate, and delusion, and the many kinds of unskillful things.
an8.11:8.5	In this sense you could rightly say that I’m an exterminator.
an8.11:8.6	But that’s not what you’re talking about.”
an8.11:9.1	“Master Gotama is a mortifier.”
an8.11:9.2	“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that
an8.11:9.3	I’m a mortifier.
an8.11:9.4	For I say that bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind should be mortified.
an8.11:9.5	I say that a mortifier is someone who has given up unskillful qualities that should be mortified. They’ve cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they’re unable to arise in the future.
an8.11:9.6	The Realized One is someone who has given up unskillful qualities that should be mortified. He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they’re unable to arise in the future.
an8.11:9.7	In this sense you could rightly say that I’m a mortifier.
an8.11:9.8	But that’s not what you’re talking about.”
an8.11:10.1	“Master Gotama is an abortionist.”
an8.11:10.2	“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that
an8.11:10.3	I’m an abortionist.
an8.11:10.4	I say that an abortionist is someone who has given up future wombs and rebirth into a new state of existence. They’ve cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they’re unable to arise in the future.
an8.11:10.5	The Realized One has given up future wombs and rebirth into a new state of existence. He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they’re unable to arise in the future.
an8.11:10.6	In this sense you could rightly say that I’m an abortionist.
an8.11:10.7	But that’s not what you’re talking about.
an8.11:11.1	Suppose, brahmin, there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs.
an8.11:11.2	And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated.
an8.11:11.3	Now, the chick that is first to break out of the eggshell with its claws and beak and hatch safely: should that be called the eldest or the youngest?”
an8.11:11.4	“Master, Gotama, that should be called the eldest. For it is the eldest among them.”
an8.11:12.1	“In the same way, in this population lost in ignorance, trapped in their shells, I alone have broken open the egg of ignorance and realized the supreme perfect awakening.
an8.11:12.2	So, brahmin, I am the eldest and the first in the world.
an8.11:13.1	My energy was roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness was established and lucid, my body was tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind was immersed in samādhi.
an8.11:13.2	Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an8.11:13.3	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an8.11:13.4	And with the fading away of rapture, I entered and remained in the third absorption, where I meditated with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
an8.11:13.5	With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I entered and remained in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
an8.11:14.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward recollection of past lives.
an8.11:14.2	I recollected many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. I remembered: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
an8.11:15.1	This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the night.
an8.11:15.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.
an8.11:15.3	This was my first breaking out, like a chick breaking out of the eggshell.
an8.11:16.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.
an8.11:16.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
an8.11:17.1	This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of the night.
an8.11:17.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.
an8.11:17.3	This was my second breaking out, like a chick breaking out of the eggshell.
an8.11:18.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.
an8.11:18.2	I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
an8.11:18.3	I truly understood: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.
an8.11:18.4	Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.
an8.11:18.5	When it was freed, I knew it was freed.
an8.11:18.6	I understood: ‘Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.’
an8.11:19.1	This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the last watch of the night.
an8.11:19.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.
an8.11:19.3	This was my third breaking out, like a chick breaking out of the eggshell.”
an8.11:20.1	When he said this, the brahmin Verañja said to the Buddha:
an8.11:20.2	“Master Gotama is the eldest! Master Gotama is the best!
an8.11:20.3	Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!
an8.11:20.4	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.
an8.11:20.5	I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
an8.11:20.6	From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
an8.12:0.1	Numbered Discourses 8
an8.12:0.2	2. The Great Chapter
an8.12:0.3	12. With Sīha
an8.12:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
an8.12:1.2	Now at that time several very prominent Licchavis were sitting together at the meeting hall, praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways.
an8.12:2.1	Now at that time General Sīha, a disciple of the Jains, was sitting in that assembly.
an8.12:2.2	He thought,
an8.12:2.3	“That Blessed One must without a doubt be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha. For several very prominent Licchavis are praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways.
an8.12:2.4	Why don’t I go to see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!”
an8.12:2.5	Then General Sīha went to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and said to him,
an8.12:2.6	“Sir, I’d like to go to see the ascetic Gotama.”
an8.12:3.1	“But Sīha, you believe in the doctrine of action. Why should you go to see the ascetic Gotama, who teaches a doctrine of inaction?
an8.12:3.2	For the ascetic Gotama believes in a doctrine of inaction, he teaches inaction, and he guides his disciples in that way.”
an8.12:3.3	Then Sīha’s determination to go and see the Buddha died down.
an8.12:4.1	For a second time, several prominent Licchavis were sitting together at the meeting hall, praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways.
an8.12:4.2	And for a second time Sīha thought:
an8.12:4.3	NA
an8.12:4.4	“Why don’t I go to see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!”
an8.12:4.5	Then General Sīha went to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta …
an8.12:4.6	NA
an8.12:5.1	NA
an8.12:5.2	NA
an8.12:5.3	Then for a second time Sīha’s determination to go and see the Buddha died down.
an8.12:6.1	For a third time, several prominent Licchavis were sitting together at the meeting hall, praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways.
an8.12:6.2	And for a third time Sīha thought,
an8.12:6.3	“That Blessed One must without a doubt be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha. For several very prominent Licchavis are praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways.
an8.12:6.4	What can these Jains do to me, whether I consult with them or not?
an8.12:6.5	Why don’t I, without consulting them, go to see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!”
an8.12:7.1	Then Sīha, with around five hundred chariots, set out from Vesālī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha.
an8.12:7.2	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and went by foot.
an8.12:7.3	Then General Sīha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an8.12:8.1	“Sir, I have heard this:
an8.12:8.2	‘The ascetic Gotama believes in a doctrine of inaction, he teaches inaction, and he guides his disciples in that way.’
an8.12:8.3	I trust those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and do not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?
an8.12:8.4	For we don’t want to misrepresent the Blessed One.”
an8.12:9.1	“There is, Sīha, a sense in which you could rightly say that
an8.12:9.2	I believe in inaction, I teach inaction, and I guide my disciples in that way.
an8.12:10.1	And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that
an8.12:10.2	I believe in action, I teach action, and I guide my disciples in that way.

an8.12:13.2	I'm an exterminator, I teach extermination, and I guide my disciples in that way.
an8.12:14.1	And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that
an8.12:14.2	I’m a mortifier, I teach mortification, and I guide my disciples in that way.
an8.12:15.1	And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that
an8.12:15.2	I’m an abortionist, I teach abortion, and I guide my disciples in that way.
an8.12:16.1	And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that
an8.12:16.2	I’m ambitious, I teach ambition, and I guide my disciples in that way.
an8.12:17.1	And what’s the sense in which you could rightly say that
an8.12:17.2	I believe in inaction, I teach inaction, and I guide my disciples in that way?
an8.12:17.3	I teach inaction regarding bad bodily, verbal, and mental conduct,
an8.12:17.4	and the many kinds of unskillful things.
an8.12:17.5	In this sense you could rightly say that I teach inaction.
an8.12:17.6	NA
an8.12:18.1	And what’s the sense in which you could rightly say that
an8.12:18.2	I believe in action, I teach action, and I guide my disciples in that way?

an8.12:24.5	NA
an8.12:25.1	When he said this, General Sīha said to the Buddha,
an8.12:25.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent!
an8.12:25.3	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
an8.12:26.1	“Sīha, you should act after careful consideration. It’s good for well-known people such as yourself to act after careful consideration.”
an8.12:26.2	“Now I’m even more delighted and satisfied with the Buddha, since he tells me to act after careful consideration.
an8.12:26.3	For if the followers of other paths were to gain me as a disciple, they’d carry a banner all over Vesālī, saying:
an8.12:26.4	‘General Sīha has become our disciple!’
an8.12:26.5	And yet the Buddha tells me to act after careful consideration.
an8.12:26.6	For a second time, I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
an8.12:26.7	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
an8.12:27.1	“For a long time now, Sīha, your family has been a well-spring of support for the Jain ascetics. You should consider giving to them when they come.”
an8.12:27.2	“Now I’m even more delighted and satisfied with the Buddha, since he tells me to
an8.12:27.3	consider giving to the Jain ascetics when they come.
an8.12:27.4	Sir, I have heard this:
an8.12:27.5	‘The ascetic Gotama says,
an8.12:27.6	“Gifts should only be given to me, and to my disciples.
an8.12:27.7	Only what is given to me is very fruitful, not what is given to others.
an8.12:27.8	Only what is given to my disciples is very fruitful, not what is given to the disciples of others.”’
an8.12:27.9	Yet the Buddha encourages me to give to the Jain ascetics.
an8.12:27.10	Well, sir, we’ll know the proper time for that.
an8.12:27.11	For a third time, I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
an8.12:27.12	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
an8.12:28.1	Then the Buddha taught Sīha step by step, with
an8.12:28.2	a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation.
an8.12:28.3	And when the Buddha knew that Sīha’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas:
an8.12:28.4	suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.
an8.12:28.5	Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye,
an8.12:28.6	in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in General Sīha:
an8.12:28.7	“Everything that has a beginning has an end.”
an8.12:29.1	Then Sīha saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha,
an8.12:29.2	“Sir, may the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me.”
an8.12:29.3	The Buddha consented in silence.
an8.12:29.4	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Sīha got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
an8.12:30.1	Then Sīha addressed a certain man,
an8.12:30.2	“Mister, please find out if there is any meat ready for sale.”
an8.12:30.3	And when the night had passed General Sīha had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,
an8.12:30.4	“Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.”
an8.12:31.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Sīha’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.
an8.12:31.2	Now at that time many Jain ascetics in Vesālī went from street to street and square to square, calling out with raised arms:
an8.12:31.3	“Today General Sīha has slaughtered a fat calf for the ascetic Gotama’s meal.
an8.12:31.4	The ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared specially for him: this is a deed he caused.”
an8.12:32.1	Then a certain person went up to Sīha and whispered in his ear,
an8.12:32.2	“Please sir, you should know this.
an8.12:32.3	Many Jain ascetics in Vesālī are going from street to street and square to square, calling out with raised arms:
an8.12:32.4	‘Today General Sīha has slaughtered a fat calf for the ascetic Gotama’s meal.
an8.12:32.5	The ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared specially for him: this is a deed he caused.’”
an8.12:32.6	“Enough, sir. For a long time those venerables have wanted to discredit the Buddha, his teaching, and his Saṅgha.
an8.12:32.7	They’ll never stop misrepresenting the Buddha with their false, hollow, lying, untruthful claims.
an8.12:32.8	We would never deliberately take the life of a living creature, not even for life’s sake.”
an8.12:33.1	Then Sīha served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods.
an8.12:33.2	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Sīha sat down to one side.
an8.12:33.3	Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.

an8.13:1.1	“Mendicants, a fine royal thoroughbred with eight factors is worthy of a king, fit to serve a king, and considered a factor of kingship.
an8.13:1.2	What eight?
an8.13:1.3	It’s when a fine royal thoroughbred is well born on both
an8.13:1.4	the mother’s and the father’s sides.
an8.13:1.5	He’s bred in the region fine thoroughbreds come from.
an8.13:1.6	Whatever food he’s given,
an8.13:1.7	fresh or dry,
an8.13:1.8	he eats carefully, without making a mess.
an8.13:1.9	He’s disgusted by sitting or lying down in excrement or urine.
an8.13:1.10	He’s sweet-natured and pleasant to live with, and he doesn’t upset the other horses.
an8.13:1.11	He openly shows his tricks, bluffs, ruses, and feints to his trainer,
an8.13:1.12	so the trainer can try to subdue them.
an8.13:1.13	He carries his load, determining:
an8.13:1.14	‘Whether or not the other horses carry their loads, I’ll carry mine.’
an8.13:1.15	He always walks in a straight path.
an8.13:1.16	He’s strong, and stays strong even until death.
an8.13:1.17	A fine royal thoroughbred with these eight factors is worthy of a king. …
an8.13:2.1	In the same way, a mendicant with eight qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.
an8.13:2.2	What eight?
an8.13:2.3	It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
an8.13:2.4	Whatever food they’re given,
an8.13:2.5	coarse or fine,
an8.13:2.6	they eat carefully, without annoyance.
an8.13:2.7	They're disgusted with bad conduct by way of body, speech, or mind,
an8.13:2.8	and by attainment of the many kinds of unskillful things.
an8.13:2.9	They're sweet-natured and pleasant to live with, and they doesn’t upset the other mendicants.
an8.13:2.10	They openly show their tricks, bluffs, ruses, and feints to their sensible spiritual companions,
an8.13:2.11	so they can try to subdue them.
an8.13:2.12	They do their training, determining:
an8.13:2.13	‘Whether or not the other mendicants do their training, I’ll do mine.’
an8.13:2.14	They always walk in a straight path.
an8.13:2.15	And here the straight path is
an8.13:2.16	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
an8.13:2.17	They’re energetic:
an8.13:2.18	‘Gladly, let my skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the blood and flesh waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.’
an8.13:2.19	A mendicant with these eight qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”

an8.20:0.3	20. Sabbath
an8.20:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.
an8.20:1.2	Now, at that time it was the sabbath, and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.
an8.20:1.3	And then, as the night was getting late, in the first watch of the night, Venerable Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said,
an8.20:1.4	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the first watch of the night, and the Saṅgha has been sitting long.
an8.20:1.5	Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the mendicants.”
an8.20:2.1	But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent.
an8.20:2.2	For a second time, as the night was getting late, in the middle watch of the night, Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said,
an8.20:2.3	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the middle watch of the night, and the Saṅgha has been sitting long.
an8.20:2.4	Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the mendicants.”
an8.20:2.5	But for a second time the Buddha kept silent.
an8.20:2.6	For a third time, as the night was getting late, in the last watch of the night, Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said,
an8.20:2.7	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the last watch of the night and dawn stirs, bringing joy to the night.
an8.20:2.8	And the Saṅgha has been sitting long.
an8.20:2.9	Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the mendicants.”
an8.20:2.10	“Ānanda, the assembly is not pure.”
an8.20:3.1	Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought,
an8.20:3.2	“Who is the Buddha talking about?”
an8.20:3.3	NA
an8.20:3.4	Then he focused on comprehending the minds of everyone in the Saṅgha.
an8.20:3.5	He saw that unethical person, of bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual practitioner—though claiming to be one—rotten inside, corrupt, and depraved, sitting in the middle of the Saṅgha.
an8.20:3.6	When he saw him he got up from his seat, went up to him and said,
an8.20:3.7	“Get up, reverend. The Buddha has seen you.
an8.20:3.8	You can’t live in communion with the mendicants.”
an8.20:4.1	But when he said this, that person kept silent.

an8.20:4.7	he asked that monk to leave.
an8.20:4.8	NA
an8.20:4.9	But for a third time that person kept silent.
an8.20:5.1	Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna took that person by the arm, ejected him out the gate, and bolted the door. Then he went up to the Buddha, and said to him,
an8.20:5.2	“I have ejected that person.
an8.20:5.3	The assembly is pure.
an8.20:5.4	Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the mendicants.”
an8.20:5.5	“It’s incredible, Moggallāna, it’s amazing,
an8.20:5.6	how that silly man waited to be taken by the arm!”
an8.20:6.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:
an8.20:6.2	“Now, mendicants, you should perform the sabbath and recite the monastic code.
an8.20:6.3	From this day forth, I will not perform the sabbath or recite the monastic code.
an8.20:6.4	It’s impossible, mendicants, it can’t happen that a Realized One could recite the monastic code in an impure assembly.

an8.21:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
an8.21:1.2	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
an8.21:1.3	“Mendicants, you should remember the householder Ugga of Vesālī as someone who has eight amazing and incredible qualities.”
an8.21:1.4	That is what the Buddha said.
an8.21:1.5	When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.
an8.21:2.1	Then a certain mendicant robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the householder Ugga of Vesālī, where he sat on the seat spread out.
an8.21:2.2	Then Ugga of Vesālī went up to that mendicant, bowed, and sat down to one side. The mendicant said to him:
an8.21:3.1	“Householder, the Buddha declared that you have eight amazing and incredible qualities.
an8.21:3.2	What are the eight qualities that he spoke of?”
an8.21:3.3	“Sir, I don’t know
an8.21:3.4	what eight amazing and incredible qualities the Buddha was referring to.
an8.21:3.5	But these eight amazing and incredible qualities are found in me.
an8.21:3.6	Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an8.21:3.7	“Yes, householder,” replied the mendicant.
an8.21:3.8	Ugga of Vesālī said this:
an8.21:3.9	“Sir, when I first saw the Buddha off in the distance,
an8.21:3.10	my heart was inspired as soon as I saw him.
an8.21:3.11	This is the first incredible and amazing quality found in me.
an8.21:4.1	With confident heart I paid homage to the Buddha.
an8.21:4.2	The Buddha taught me step by step,
an8.21:4.3	with a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation.
an8.21:4.4	And when he knew that my mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas:
an8.21:4.5	suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.
an8.21:4.6	Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye,
an8.21:4.7	in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in me:
an8.21:4.8	‘Everything that has a beginning has an end.’
an8.21:4.9	I saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. I went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions.
an8.21:4.10	Right there I went for refuge to the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha. And I undertook the five training rules with celibacy as the fifth.
an8.21:4.11	This is the second incredible and amazing quality found in me.
an8.21:5.1	I had four teenage wives.
an8.21:5.2	And I went to them and said:
an8.21:5.3	‘Sisters, I’ve undertaken the five training rules with celibacy as fifth.
an8.21:5.4	If you wish, you may stay here, enjoy my wealth, and do good deeds. Or you can return to your own families.
an8.21:5.5	Or would you prefer if I gave you to another man?’
an8.21:5.6	When I said this, my eldest wife said to me:
an8.21:5.7	‘Master, please give me to such-and-such a man.’
an8.21:5.8	Then I summoned that man. Taking my wife with my left hand and a ceremonial vase with my right, I presented her to that man with the pouring of water.
an8.21:5.9	But I can’t recall getting upset while giving away my teenage wife.
an8.21:5.10	This is the third incredible and amazing quality found in me.
an8.21:6.1	And though my family has wealth,
an8.21:6.2	it’s shared without reserve with ethical people of good character.
an8.21:6.3	This is the fourth incredible and amazing quality found in me.
an8.21:7.1	When I pay homage to a mendicant,
an8.21:7.2	I do so carefully, not carelessly.
an8.21:7.3	This is the fifth incredible and amazing quality found in me.
an8.21:8.1	If that venerable teaches me the Dhamma,
an8.21:8.2	I listen carefully, not carelessly.
an8.21:8.3	But if they don’t teach me the Dhamma, I teach them.
an8.21:8.4	This is the sixth incredible and amazing quality found in me.
an8.21:9.1	It’s not unusual for deities to come to me and announce:
an8.21:9.2	‘Householder, the Buddha’s teaching is well explained!’
an8.21:9.3	When they say this I say to them:
an8.21:9.4	‘The Buddha’s teaching is well explained, regardless of whether or not you deities say so!’
an8.21:9.5	But I don’t recall getting too excited by the fact that
an8.21:9.6	the deities come to me, and I have a conversation with them.
an8.21:9.7	This is the seventh incredible and amazing quality found in me.
an8.21:10.1	Of the five lower fetters taught by the Buddha, I don’t see any that I haven’t given up.
an8.21:10.2	This is the eighth incredible and amazing quality found in me.

an8.21:12.1	Then that mendicant, after taking almsfood in Ugga of Vesālī’s home, got up from his seat and left.
an8.21:12.2	Then after the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
an8.21:12.3	He informed the Buddha of all he had discussed with the householder Ugga of Vesālī. The Buddha said:
an8.21:13.1	“Good, good, mendicant!

That one is a follower of the teachings. That one is a follower by faith. That one is ethical, of good character. That one is unethical, of bad character.’

an8.22:12.1	Then that mendicant, after taking almsfood in Ugga of Hatthi’s home, got up from his seat and left.
an8.22:12.2	Then after the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
an8.22:12.3	He informed the Buddha of all he had discussed with the householder Ugga of the village of Hatthi. The Buddha said:
an8.22:13.1	“Good, good, mendicant!
an8.22:13.2	When I declared that the householder Ugga of the village of Hatthi was someone who has eight amazing and incredible qualities, I was referring to the same eight qualities that he rightly explained to you.
an8.22:13.3	You should remember the householder Ugga of Hatthi as someone who has these eight amazing and incredible qualities.”

an8.23:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Āḷavī, at the Aggāḷava Tree-shrine.
an8.23:1.2	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
an8.23:1.3	“Mendicants, you should remember the householder Hatthaka of Āḷavī as someone who has seven amazing and incredible qualities.
an8.23:1.4	What seven?
an8.23:1.5	He’s faithful,
an8.23:1.6	ethical,

an8.23:1.12	You should remember the householder Hatthaka of Āḷavī as someone who has these seven amazing and incredible qualities.”
an8.23:1.13	That is what the Buddha said.
an8.23:1.14	When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.
an8.23:2.1	Then a certain mendicant robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the householder Hatthaka of Āḷavī, where he sat on the seat spread out.
an8.23:2.2	Then Hatthaka went up to that mendicant, bowed, and sat down to one side. The mendicant said to Hatthaka:
an8.23:3.1	“Householder, the Buddha declared that you have seven amazing and incredible qualities.
an8.23:3.2	What seven?
an8.23:3.3	He said that you’re faithful,
an8.23:3.4	ethical,
an8.23:3.5	conscientious,
an8.23:3.6	prudent,
an8.23:3.7	learned,

an8.23:3.10	The Buddha declared that you have these seven amazing and incredible qualities.”
an8.23:3.11	“But sir, I trust that no white-clothed lay people were present?”
an8.23:3.12	“No, there weren’t any white-clothed lay people present.”
an8.23:3.13	“That’s good, sir.”
an8.23:4.1	Then that mendicant, after taking almsfood in Hatthaka of Āḷavī’s home, got up from his seat and left.
an8.23:4.2	Then after the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him of what he had discussed with the householder Hatthaka. The Buddha said:

an8.23:7.4	Well then, mendicant, you should remember the householder Hatthaka of Āḷavī as someone who has this eighth amazing and incredible quality, that is, fewness of wishes.”

an8.24:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Āḷavī, at the Aggāḷava Tree-shrine.
an8.24:1.2	Then the householder Hatthaka of Āḷavī, escorted by around five hundred lay followers, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to Hatthaka:
an8.24:1.3	“Hatthaka, you have a large congregation.
an8.24:1.4	How do you bring together such a large congregation?”
an8.24:1.5	“Sir, I bring together such a large congregation by using the four ways of being inclusive as taught by the Buddha.
an8.24:1.6	When I know that a person
an8.24:1.7	can be included by a gift, I include them by giving a gift.
an8.24:1.8	When I know that a person
an8.24:1.9	can be included by kindly words, I include them by kindly words.
an8.24:1.10	When I know that a person
an8.24:1.11	can be included by taking care of them, I include them by caring for them.
an8.24:1.12	When I know that a person
an8.24:1.13	can be included by equality, I include them by treating them equally.
an8.24:1.14	But also, sir, my family is wealthy.
an8.24:1.15	They wouldn’t think that a poor person was worth listening to in the same way.”
an8.24:1.16	“Good, good, Hatthaka!
an8.24:1.17	This is the right way to bring together a large congregation.
an8.24:1.18	Whether in the past, future, or present, all those who have brought together a large congregation have done so by using these four ways of being inclusive.”

an8.24:2.1	Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Hatthaka of Āḷavī with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving.
an8.24:2.2	Then, not long after Hatthaka had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
an8.24:2.3	“Mendicants, you should remember the householder Hatthaka of Āḷavī as someone who has eight amazing and incredible qualities.

an8.25:1.4	“Mahānāma, when you’ve gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha,

an8.28:1.3	‘My defilements have ended’?”

an8.28:1.5	‘My defilements have ended.’
an8.28:2.1	What eight?
an8.28:2.2	Firstly, a mendicant with defilements ended has clearly seen with right wisdom all conditions as truly impermanent.
an8.28:2.3	This is a power that a mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim:
an8.28:2.4	‘My defilements have ended.’
an8.28:3.1	Furthermore, a mendicant with defilements ended has clearly seen with right wisdom that sensual pleasures are truly like a pit of glowing coals.
an8.28:3.2	This is a power that a mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim:
an8.28:3.3	‘My defilements have ended.’
an8.28:4.1	Furthermore, the mind of a mendicant with defilements ended slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion. They’re withdrawn, loving renunciation, and they’ve totally done with defiling influences.
an8.28:4.2	This is a power that a mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim:
an8.28:4.3	‘My defilements have ended.’
an8.28:5.1	Furthermore, a mendicant with defilements ended has well developed the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.
an8.28:5.2	This is a power that a mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim:
an8.28:5.3	‘My defilements have ended.’
an8.28:6.1	Furthermore, a mendicant with defilements ended has well developed the four bases of psychic power …
an8.28:6.2	the five faculties …
an8.28:6.3	the seven awakening factors …
an8.28:6.4	the noble eightfold path.

an8.29:1.1	“‘Now is the time! Now is the time!’ So says an uneducated ordinary person. But they don’t know whether it’s time or not.
an8.29:1.2	Mendicants, there are eight lost opportunities for spiritual practice.
an8.29:1.3	What eight?
an8.29:1.4	Firstly, a Realized One has arisen in the world—perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. He teaches the Dhamma leading to peace, extinguishment, awakening, as proclaimed by the Holy One.
an8.29:1.5	But a person has been reborn in hell.
an8.29:1.6	This is the first lost opportunity for spiritual practice.
an8.29:2.1	Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world.
an8.29:2.2	But a person has been reborn in the animal realm. This is the second lost opportunity.
an8.29:3.1	Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world.
an8.29:3.2	But a person has been reborn in the ghost realm. This is the third lost opportunity.
an8.29:4.1	Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world.
an8.29:4.2	But a person has been reborn in one of the long-lived orders of gods. This is the fourth lost opportunity.
an8.29:5.1	Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world.
an8.29:5.2	But a person has been reborn in the borderlands, among strange barbarian tribes, where monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen do not go. This is the fifth lost opportunity …
an8.29:6.1	Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. And a person is reborn in a central country. But they have wrong view and distorted perspective:
an8.29:6.2	‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no obligation to mother and father. No beings are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’ This is the sixth lost opportunity …
an8.29:7.1	Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world.
an8.29:7.2	And a person is reborn in a central country. But they’re witless, dull, stupid, and unable to distinguish what is well said from what is poorly said.
an8.29:7.3	This is the seventh lost opportunity …
an8.29:8.1	Furthermore, a Realized One has not arisen in the world …
an8.29:8.2	So he doesn’t teach the Dhamma leading to peace, extinguishment, awakening, as proclaimed by the Holy One. And a person is reborn in a central country. And they’re wise, bright, clever, and able to distinguish what is well said from what is poorly said.
an8.29:8.3	This is the eighth lost opportunity …
an8.29:9.1	There are these eight lost opportunities for spiritual practice.
an8.29:10.1	Mendicants, there is just one opportunity for spiritual practice.
an8.29:10.2	What is that one?
an8.29:10.3	It’s when a Realized One has arisen in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.
an8.29:10.4	He teaches the Dhamma leading to peace, extinguishment, awakening, as proclaimed by the Holy One. And a person is reborn in a central country. And they’re wise, bright, clever, and able to distinguish what is well said from what is poorly said.
an8.29:10.5	This is the one opportunity for spiritual practice.
an8.29:11.1	When you’ve gained the human state,
an8.29:11.2	and the true teaching has been so well proclaimed,
an8.29:11.3	if you don’t seize the moment
an8.29:11.4	it’ll pass you by.
an8.29:12.1	For many wrong times are spoken of,
an8.29:12.2	which obstruct the path.
an8.29:12.3	Only on rare occasions
an8.29:12.4	do Realized Ones arise.
an8.29:13.1	If you find yourself in their presence,
an8.29:13.2	so hard to find in the world,
an8.29:13.3	and if you’ve gained a human birth,
an8.29:13.4	and the teaching of the Dhamma;
an8.29:13.5	that’s enough to make an effort,
an8.29:13.6	for a person who loves themselves.
an8.29:14.1	How is the true teaching to be understood
an8.29:14.2	so that the moment doesn’t pass you by?
an8.29:14.3	For if you miss your moment
an8.29:14.4	you’ll grieve when sent to hell.
an8.29:15.1	If you fail to achieve
an8.29:15.2	certainty regarding the true teaching
an8.29:15.3	you’ll regret it for a long time,
an8.29:15.4	like a trader who loses a profit.
an8.29:16.1	A man shrouded by ignorance,
an8.29:16.2	a failure in the true teaching,
an8.29:16.3	will long undergo
an8.29:16.4	transmigration through birth and death.
an8.29:17.1	Those who’ve gained the human state
an8.29:17.2	when the true teaching has been so well proclaimed,
an8.29:17.3	and have completed what the Teacher taught—
an8.29:17.4	or will do so, or are doing so now—
an8.29:18.1	have realized the right time in the world
an8.29:18.2	for the supreme spiritual life.
an8.29:18.3	You should live guarded, ever mindful,
an8.29:18.4	not soaked with defilements,
an8.29:19.1	among those restrained ones
an8.29:19.2	who have practiced the path
an8.29:19.3	proclaimed by the Realized One, the one with vision,
an8.29:19.4	and taught by the Kinsman of the Sun.
an8.29:20.1	Having cut off all underlying tendencies
an8.29:20.2	that follow those drifting in Māra’s dominion,
an8.29:20.3	they’re the ones in this world who’ve truly crossed over,
an8.29:20.4	having reached the ending of defilements.”

an8.30:0.3	30. Anuruddha and the Great Thoughts
an8.30:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.
an8.30:1.2	And at that time Venerable Anuruddha was staying in the land of the Cetīs in the Eastern Bamboo Park.
an8.30:1.3	Then as Anuruddha was in private retreat this thought came to his mind:
an8.30:1.4	“This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes.
an8.30:1.5	It’s for the contented, not those who lack contentment.
an8.30:1.6	It’s for the secluded, not those who enjoy company.
an8.30:1.7	It’s for the energetic, not the lazy.
an8.30:1.8	It’s for the mindful, not the unmindful.
an8.30:1.9	It’s for those with immersion, not those without immersion.
an8.30:1.10	It’s for the wise, not the witless.”
an8.30:2.1	Then the Buddha knew what Anuruddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood in the land of the Bhaggas and reappeared in front of Anurruddha in the Eastern Bamboo Park in the land of the Cetīs,
an8.30:2.2	and sat on the seat spread out.
an8.30:2.3	Anuruddha bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.
an8.30:2.4	The Buddha said to him:
an8.30:3.1	“Good, good, Anuruddha!
an8.30:3.2	It’s good that you reflect on these thoughts of a great man:
an8.30:3.3	‘This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes.
an8.30:3.4	It’s for the contented, not those who lack contentment.
an8.30:3.5	It’s for the secluded, not those who enjoy company.
an8.30:3.6	It’s for the energetic, not the lazy.
an8.30:3.7	It’s for the mindful, not the unmindful.
an8.30:3.8	It’s for those with immersion, not those without immersion.
an8.30:3.9	It’s for the wise, not the witless.’
an8.30:3.10	Well then, Anuruddha, you should also reflect on the following eighth thought of a great man:
an8.30:3.11	‘This teaching is for those who don’t enjoy proliferating and don’t like to proliferate, not for those who enjoy proliferating and like to proliferate.’
an8.30:4.1	First you’ll reflect on these eight thoughts of a great man. Then whenever you want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, you’ll enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an8.30:5.1	You’ll enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an8.30:6.1	You’ll enter and remain in the third absorption, where you’ll meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
an8.30:7.1	Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, you’ll enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
an8.30:8.1	First you’ll reflect on these eight thoughts of a great man, and you’ll get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when you want, without trouble or difficulty. Then as you live contented your rag robe will seem to you like a chest full of garments of different colors seems to a householder or householder’s child.
an8.30:8.2	It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment.
an8.30:9.1	As you live contented your scraps of almsfood will seem to you like boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out, served with many soups and sauces seems to a householder or householder’s child.
an8.30:9.2	It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment.
an8.30:10.1	As you live contented your lodging at the root of a tree will seem to you like a bungalow, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with latches fastened and windows shuttered seems to a householder or householder’s child.
an8.30:10.2	It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment.
an8.30:11.1	As you live contented your lodging at the root of a tree will seem to you like a couch spread with woolen covers—shag-piled, pure white, or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red pillows at both ends seems to a householder or householder’s child.
an8.30:11.2	It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment.
an8.30:12.1	As you live contented your fermented urine as medicine will seem to you like various medicines—ghee, butter, oil, honey, and molasses—seem to a householder or householder’s child.
an8.30:12.2	It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment.
an8.30:12.3	Well then, Anuruddha, for the next rainy season residence you should stay right here in the land of the Cetīs in the Eastern Bamboo Park.”
an8.30:12.4	“Yes, sir,” Anuruddha replied.
an8.30:13.1	After advising Anuruddha like this, the Buddha—as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Eastern Bamboo Park in the land of the Cetīs and reappeared in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood in the land of the Bhaggas.
an8.30:13.2	He sat on the seat spread out
an8.30:13.3	and addressed the mendicants:
an8.30:13.4	“Mendicants, I will teach you the eight thoughts of a great man. Listen …
an8.30:13.5	And what are the eight thoughts of a great man?
an8.30:13.6	This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes.
an8.30:13.7	It’s for the contented, not those who lack contentment.
an8.30:13.8	It’s for the secluded, not those who enjoy company.
an8.30:13.9	It’s for the energetic, not the lazy.
an8.30:13.10	It’s for the mindful, not the unmindful.
an8.30:13.11	It’s for those with immersion, not those without immersion.
an8.30:13.12	It’s for the wise, not the witless.
an8.30:13.13	It’s for those who don’t enjoy proliferating and don’t like to proliferate, not for those who enjoy proliferating and like to proliferate.
an8.30:14.1	‘This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes.’
an8.30:14.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
an8.30:14.3	A mendicant with few wishes doesn’t wish: ‘May they know me as having few wishes!’ When contented, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as contented!’ When secluded, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as secluded!’ When energetic, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as energetic!’ When mindful, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as mindful!’ When immersed, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as immersed!’ When wise, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as wise!’ When not enjoying proliferation, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as one who doesn’t enjoy proliferating!’
an8.30:14.4	‘This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes.’
an8.30:14.5	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
an8.30:15.1	‘This teaching is for the contented, not those who lack contentment.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
an8.30:15.2	It’s for a mendicant who’s content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.
an8.30:15.3	‘This teaching is for the contented, not those who lack contentment.’
an8.30:15.4	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
an8.30:16.1	‘This teaching is for the secluded, not those who enjoy company.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
an8.30:16.2	It’s for a mendicant who lives secluded. But monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, rulers and their ministers, founders of religious sects and their disciples go to visit them.
an8.30:16.3	With a mind slanting, sloping, and inclining to seclusion, withdrawn, and loving renunciation, that mendicant invariably gives each of them a talk emphasizing the topic of dismissal.
an8.30:16.4	‘This teaching is for the secluded, not those who enjoy company.’
an8.30:16.5	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
an8.30:17.1	‘This teaching is for the energetic, not the lazy.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
an8.30:17.2	It’s for a mendicant who lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.
an8.30:17.3	‘This teaching is for the energetic, not the lazy.’
an8.30:17.4	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
an8.30:18.1	‘This teaching is for the mindful, not the unmindful.’
an8.30:18.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
an8.30:18.3	It’s for a mendicant who’s mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago.
an8.30:18.4	‘This teaching is for the mindful, not the unmindful.’
an8.30:18.5	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
an8.30:19.1	‘This teaching is for those with immersion, not those without immersion.’
an8.30:19.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
an8.30:19.3	It’s for a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.
an8.30:19.4	‘This teaching is for those with immersion, not those without immersion.’
an8.30:19.5	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
an8.30:20.1	‘This teaching is for the wise, not the witless.’
an8.30:20.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
an8.30:20.3	It’s for a mendicant who’s wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.
an8.30:20.4	‘This teaching is for the wise, not the witless.’
an8.30:20.5	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
an8.30:21.1	‘This teaching is for those who don’t enjoy proliferating and don’t like to proliferate, not for those who enjoy proliferating and like to proliferate.’
an8.30:21.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
an8.30:21.3	It’s for a mendicant whose mind is eager, confident, settled, and decided regarding the cessation of proliferation.
an8.30:21.4	‘This teaching is for those who don’t enjoy proliferating and don’t like to proliferate, not for those who enjoy proliferating and like to proliferate.’
an8.30:21.5	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.”
an8.30:22.1	Then Anuruddha stayed the next rainy season residence right there in the land of the Cetīs in the Eastern Bamboo Park.
an8.30:22.2	And Anuruddha, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
an8.30:22.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
an8.30:22.4	And Venerable Anuruddha became one of the perfected.
an8.30:22.5	And on the occasion of attaining perfection he recited these verses:
an8.30:23.1	“Knowing my thoughts,
an8.30:23.2	the supreme Teacher in the world
an8.30:23.3	came to me in a mind-made body,
an8.30:23.4	using his psychic power.
an8.30:24.1	He taught me more
an8.30:24.2	than I had thought of.
an8.30:24.3	The Buddha who loves non-proliferation
an8.30:24.4	taught me non-proliferation.
an8.30:25.1	Understanding that teaching,
an8.30:25.2	I happily did his bidding.
an8.30:25.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges,
an8.30:25.4	and have fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.”

an8.34:1.2	What eight factors does it have?
an8.34:1.3	It’s when a field has mounds and ditches. It has stones and gravel. It’s salty. It doesn’t have deep furrows. And it’s not equipped with water inlets, water outlets, irrigation channels, and boundaries.
an8.34:1.4	When a field has these eight factors a seed sown in it is not fruitful or rewarding or productive.
an8.34:2.1	In the same way, when an ascetic or brahmin has eight factors a gift given to them is not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or bountiful.
an8.34:2.2	What eight factors do they have?
an8.34:2.3	It’s when an ascetic or brahmin has wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong immersion.
an8.34:2.4	When an ascetic or brahmin has these eight factors a gift given to them is not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or bountiful.
an8.34:3.1	When a field has eight factors a seed sown in it is very fruitful and rewarding and productive.
an8.34:3.2	What eight factors does it have?
an8.34:3.3	It’s when a field doesn’t have mounds and ditches. It doesn’t have stones and gravel. It’s not salty. It has deep furrows. And it’s equipped with water inlets, water outlets, irrigation channels, and boundaries.
an8.34:3.4	When a field has these eight factors a seed sown in it is very fruitful and rewarding and productive.
an8.34:4.1	In the same way, when an ascetic or brahmin has eight factors a gift given to them is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful.
an8.34:4.2	What eight factors do they have?
an8.34:4.3	It’s when an ascetic or brahmin has right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
an8.34:4.4	When an ascetic or brahmin has these eight factors a gift given to them is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful.
an8.34:5.1	When the field is excellent,
an8.34:5.2	and the seed sown in it is excellent,
an8.34:5.3	and the rainfall is excellent,
an8.34:5.4	the crop of grain will be excellent.
an8.34:6.1	Its health is excellent,
an8.34:6.2	its growth is excellent,
an8.34:6.3	its maturation is excellent,
an8.34:6.4	and its fruit is excellent.
an8.34:7.1	So too, when you give excellent food
an8.34:7.2	to those of excellent ethics,
an8.34:7.3	it leads to many excellences,
an8.34:7.4	for what you did was excellent.
an8.34:8.1	So if a person wants excellence,
an8.34:8.2	let them excel in this.
an8.34:8.3	You should frequent those with excellent wisdom,
an8.34:8.4	so that your own excellence will flourish.
an8.34:9.1	Excelling in knowledge and conduct,
an8.34:9.2	and having excellence of mind,
an8.34:9.3	you perform excellent deeds,
an8.34:9.4	and gain excellent benefits.
an8.34:10.1	Truly knowing the world,
an8.34:10.2	and having attained excellence of view,
an8.34:10.3	one who excels in mind proceeds,
an8.34:10.4	relying on excellence in the path.
an8.34:11.1	Shaking off all stains,
an8.34:11.2	and attaining the excellence of extinguishment,
an8.34:11.3	you’re freed from all sufferings:

an8.35:1.7	‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders!’
an8.35:1.8	They settle on that idea, concentrate on it and develop it.

an8.39:3.8	This is the first gift that is a great offering, primordial, long-standing, traditional, and ancient. It is uncorrupted, as it has been since the beginning. It’s not being corrupted now nor will it be. Sensible ascetics and brahmins don’t look down on it.

an8.41:0.3	41. The Sabbath With Eight Factors, In Brief
an8.41:1.1	So I have heard.
an8.41:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an8.41:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
an8.41:1.4	“Mendicants!”
an8.41:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.
an8.41:1.6	The Buddha said this:
an8.41:2.1	“Mendicants, the observance of the sabbath with its eight factors is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful.
an8.41:2.2	And how should it be observed?
an8.41:2.3	It’s when a noble disciple reflects:
an8.41:2.4	‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They are scrupulous and kind, and live full of compassion for all living beings.
an8.41:2.5	I, too, for this day and night will give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. I’ll be scrupulous and kind, and live full of compassion for all living beings.
an8.41:2.6	I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’
an8.41:2.7	This is its first factor.
an8.41:3.1	‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving.
an8.41:3.2	I, too, for this day and night will give up stealing. I’ll take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. I’ll keep myself clean by not thieving.
an8.41:3.3	I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’
an8.41:3.4	This is its second factor.
an8.41:4.1	‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up unchastity. They are celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex.
an8.41:4.2	I, too, for this day and night will give up unchastity. I will be celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex.
an8.41:4.3	I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’
an8.41:4.4	This is its third factor.
an8.41:5.1	‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and trustworthy, and don’t trick the world with their words.
an8.41:5.2	I, too, for this day and night will give up lying. I’ll speak the truth and stick to the truth. I’ll be honest and trustworthy, and won’t trick the world with my words.
an8.41:5.3	I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’
an8.41:5.4	This is its fourth factor.
an8.41:6.1	‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
an8.41:6.2	I, too, for this day and night will give up alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
an8.41:6.3	I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’
an8.41:6.4	This is its fifth factor.
an8.41:7.1	‘As long as they live, the perfected ones eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and from food at the wrong time.
an8.41:7.2	I, too, for this day and night will eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time.
an8.41:7.3	I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’

an8.41:8.2	I, too, for this day and night will give up dancing, singing, music, and seeing shows; and beautifying and adorning myself with garlands, fragrance, and makeup.
an8.41:8.3	I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’
an8.41:8.4	This is its seventh factor.
an8.41:9.1	‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up high and luxurious beds. They sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat.
an8.41:9.2	I, too, for this day and night will give up high and luxurious beds. I’ll sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat.

an8.42:1.1	“Mendicants, the observance of the sabbath with its eight factors is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful.

an8.42:1.7	This is its first factor. …
an8.42:2.1	‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up high and luxurious beds. They sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat.
an8.42:2.2	I, too, for this day and night will give up high and luxurious beds. I’ll sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat.

an8.42:2.4	This is its eighth factor.
an8.42:2.5	The observance of the sabbath with its eight factors in this way is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful.
an8.42:3.1	How much so?
an8.42:3.2	Suppose you were to rule as sovereign lord over these sixteen great countries—Aṅga, Magadha, Kāsī, Kosala, Vajjī, Malla, Ceti, Vaṅga, Kuru, Pañcāla, Maccha, Sūrusena, Assaka, Avanti, Gandhāra, and Kamboja—full of the seven kinds of precious things.
an8.42:3.3	This wouldn’t be worth a sixteenth part of the sabbath with its eight factors.
an8.42:3.4	Why is that?
an8.42:3.5	Because human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.
an8.42:4.1	Fifty years in the human realm is one day and night for the Gods of the Four Great Kings.
an8.42:4.2	Thirty such days make up a month.
an8.42:4.3	Twelve such months make up a year.
an8.42:4.4	The life span of the Gods of the Four Great Kings is five hundred of these divine years.
an8.42:4.5	It’s possible that a woman or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will—when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company of the Gods of the Four Great Kings.
an8.42:4.6	This is what I was referring to when I said:
an8.42:4.7	‘Human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’
an8.42:5.1	A hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for the Gods of the Thirty-Three.

an8.42:7.4	The life span of the Joyful Gods is four thousand of these divine years.
an8.42:7.5	It’s possible that a woman or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will—when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company of the Joyful Gods.
an8.42:7.6	This is what I was referring to when I said:
an8.42:7.7	‘Human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’
an8.42:8.1	Eight hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for the Gods Who Love to Create.

an8.42:9.4	The life span of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others is sixteen thousand of these divine years.
an8.42:9.5	It’s possible that a woman or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will—when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others.
an8.42:9.6	This is what I was referring to when I said:
an8.42:9.7	‘Human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’
an8.42:10.1	You shouldn’t kill living creatures, or steal,
an8.42:10.2	or lie, or drink alcohol.
an8.42:10.3	Be celibate, refraining from sex,
an8.42:10.4	and don’t eat at night, the wrong time.
an8.42:11.1	Not wearing garlands or applying perfumes,
an8.42:11.2	you should sleep on a low bed, or a mat on the ground.
an8.42:11.3	This is the eight-factored sabbath, they say,
an8.42:11.4	explained by the Buddha, who has gone to suffering’s end.
an8.42:12.1	The moon and sun are both fair to see,
an8.42:12.2	radiating as far as they revolve.
an8.42:12.3	Those shining ones in the sky light up the quarters,
an8.42:12.4	dispelling the darkness as they traverse the heavens.
an8.42:13.1	All of the wealth that’s found in this realm—
an8.42:13.2	pearls, gems, fine beryl too,
an8.42:13.3	horn-gold or mountain gold,
an8.42:13.4	or natural gold dug up by marmots—
an8.42:14.1	they’re not worth a sixteenth part
an8.42:14.2	of the sabbath with its eight factors,
an8.42:14.3	as starlight cannot rival the moon.
an8.42:15.1	So an ethical woman or man,
an8.42:15.2	who has observed the eight-factored sabbath,
an8.42:15.3	having made merit whose outcome is happiness,
an8.42:15.4	blameless, they go to a heavenly place.”

an8.45:2.1	“Bojjhā, the observance of the sabbath with its eight factors is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful.
an8.45:2.2	And how should it be observed?
an8.45:2.3	It’s when a noble disciple reflects:
an8.45:2.4	‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They are scrupulous and kind, and live full of compassion for all living beings.
an8.45:2.5	I, too, for this day and night will give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. I’ll be scrupulous and kind, and live full of compassion for all living beings.
an8.45:2.6	I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’
an8.45:2.7	This is its first factor. …
an8.45:3.1	‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up high and luxurious beds. They sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat.
an8.45:3.2	I, too, for this day and night will give up high and luxurious beds. I’ll sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat.
an8.45:3.3	I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’
an8.45:3.4	This is its eighth factor.
an8.45:3.5	The observance of the sabbath with its eight factors in this way is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful.
an8.45:4.1	How much so?
an8.45:4.2	Suppose you were to rule as sovereign lord over these sixteen great countries—Aṅga, Magadha, Kāsī, Kosala, Vajjī, Malla, Ceti, Vaṅga, Kuru, Pañcāla, Maccha, Sūrusena, Assaka, Avanti, Gandhāra, and Kamboja—full of the seven kinds of precious things.
an8.45:4.3	This wouldn’t be worth a sixteenth part of the sabbath with its eight factors.
an8.45:4.4	Why is that?
an8.45:4.5	Because human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.
an8.45:5.1	Fifty years in the human realm is one day and night for the Gods of the Four Great Kings.
an8.45:5.2	Thirty such days make up a month.
an8.45:5.3	Twelve such months make up a year.
an8.45:5.4	The life span of the Gods of the Four Great Kings is five hundred of these divine years.
an8.45:5.5	It’s possible that a woman or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will—when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company of the Gods of the Four Great Kings.
an8.45:5.6	This is what I was referring to when I said:
an8.45:5.7	‘Human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’
an8.45:6.1	A hundred years in the human realm …
an8.45:6.2	Two hundred years in the human realm …
an8.45:6.3	Four hundred years in the human realm …
an8.45:6.4	Eight hundred years in the human realm …
an8.45:6.5	Sixteen hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others.
an8.45:6.6	Thirty such days make up a month.
an8.45:6.7	Twelve such months make up a year.
an8.45:6.8	The life span of the gods who control the creations of others is sixteen thousand of these divine years.
an8.45:6.9	It’s possible that a woman or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will—when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others.
an8.45:6.10	This is what I was referring to when I said:
an8.45:6.11	‘Human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’
an8.45:7.1	You shouldn’t kill living creatures, or steal,
an8.45:7.2	or lie, or drink alcohol.
an8.45:7.3	Be celibate, refraining from sex,
an8.45:7.4	and don’t eat at night, the wrong time.
an8.45:8.1	Not wearing garlands or applying perfumes,
an8.45:8.2	you should sleep on a low bed, or a mat on the ground.
an8.45:8.3	This is the eight-factored sabbath, they say,
an8.45:8.4	explained by the Buddha, who has gone to suffering’s end.
an8.45:9.1	The moon and sun are both fair to see,
an8.45:9.2	radiating as far as they revolve.
an8.45:9.3	Those shining ones in the sky light up the quarters,
an8.45:9.4	dispelling the darkness as they traverse the heavens.
an8.45:10.1	All of the wealth that’s found in this realm—
an8.45:10.2	pearls, gems, fine beryl too,
an8.45:10.3	horn-gold or mountain gold,
an8.45:10.4	or natural gold dug up by marmots—
an8.45:11.1	they’re not worth a sixteenth part
an8.45:11.2	of the mind developed with love,
an8.45:11.3	as starlight cannot rival the moon.
an8.45:12.1	So an ethical woman or man,
an8.45:12.2	who has observed the eight-factored sabbath,
an8.45:12.3	having made merit whose outcome is happiness,
an8.45:12.4	blameless, they go to a heavenly place.”

an8.46:0.3	46. Anuruddha and the Agreeable Deities
an8.46:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery.
an8.46:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Anuruddha had gone into retreat for the day’s meditation.
an8.46:1.3	Then several deities of the Lovable Host went up to Venerable Anuruddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:
an8.46:1.4	“Sir, Anuruddha, we are the deities called ‘Loveable’. We wield authority and control over three things.
an8.46:1.5	We can turn any color we want.
an8.46:1.6	We can get any voice that we want.
an8.46:1.7	We can get any pleasure that we want.
an8.46:1.8	We are the deities called ‘Loveable’. We wield authority and control over these three things.”
an8.46:2.1	Then Venerable Anuruddha thought,
an8.46:2.2	“If only these deities would all turn blue, of blue color, clad in blue, adorned with blue!”
an8.46:2.3	Then those deities, knowing Anuruddha’s thought, all turned blue.
an8.46:3.1	Then Venerable Anuruddha thought,
an8.46:3.2	“If only these deities would all turn yellow …”
an8.46:3.3	“If only these gods would all turn red …”
an8.46:3.4	“If only these gods would all turn white …”
an8.46:3.5	Then those deities, knowing Anuruddha’s thought, all turned white.
an8.46:4.1	Then one of those deities sang, one danced, and one snapped her fingers.
an8.46:4.2	Suppose there was a quintet made up of skilled musicians who had practiced well and kept excellent rhythm. They’d sound graceful, tantalizing, sensuous, lovely, and intoxicating.
an8.46:4.3	In the same way the performance by those deities sounded graceful, tantalizing, sensuous, lovely, and intoxicating.
an8.46:4.4	But Venerable Anuruddha averted his senses.
an8.46:5.1	Then those deities, thinking “Master Anuruddha isn’t enjoying this,” vanished right there.
an8.46:5.2	Then in the late afternoon, Anuruddha came out of retreat and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding:

an8.46:10.2	What eight?
an8.46:10.3	Take the case of a female whose mother and father give her to a husband wanting what’s best for her, out of kindness and compassion. She would get up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely.

an8.46:11.2	mother and father, and ascetics and brahmins.
an8.46:11.3	And when they arrive she serves them with a seat and water.

an8.46:13.2	She knows who is sick, and who is fit or unwell. She distributes to each a fair portion of various foods.
an8.46:14.1	She ensures that any income her husband earns is guarded and protected, whether money, grain, silver, or gold. She doesn’t overspend, steal, waste, or lose it.
an8.46:15.1	She’s a lay follower who has gone for refuge to the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha.
an8.46:16.1	She’s ethical.
an8.46:16.2	She doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or use alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.

an8.46:17.2	She lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.
an8.46:18.1	When they have these eight qualities females—when their body breaks up, after death—are reborn in company with the Gods of the Lovable Host.
an8.46:19.1	She’d never look down on her husband,
an8.46:19.2	who’s always eager to work hard,
an8.46:19.3	always looking after her,
an8.46:19.4	and bringing whatever she wants.
an8.46:20.1	And a good woman never scolds her husband

an8.51:0.3	51. With Gotamī
an8.51:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.
an8.51:1.2	Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:
an8.51:1.3	“Sir, please let females gain the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.”
an8.51:1.4	“Enough, Gotamī.
an8.51:1.5	Don’t advocate for females to gain the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.”
an8.51:2.1	For a second time …
an8.51:2.2	NA
an8.51:2.3	NA
an8.51:2.4	NA
an8.51:3.1	For a third time, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to the Buddha:
an8.51:3.2	“Sir, please let females gain the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.”
an8.51:3.3	“Enough, Gotamī.
an8.51:3.4	Don’t advocate for females to gain the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.”
an8.51:4.1	Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī thought, “The Buddha does not permit females to go forth.” Miserable and sad, weeping, with a tearful face, she bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on her right, before leaving.
an8.51:5.1	When the Buddha had stayed in Kapilavatthu as long as he wished, he set out for Vesālī.
an8.51:5.2	Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Vesālī,
an8.51:5.3	where he stayed at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
an8.51:5.4	Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī had her hair shaved, and dressed in ocher robes. Together with several Sakyan ladies she set out for Vesālī.
an8.51:5.5	Traveling stage by stage, she arrived at Vesālī and went to the Great Wood, the hall with the peaked roof.
an8.51:5.6	Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī stood crying outside the gate, her feet swollen, her limbs covered with dust, miserable and sad, with tearful face.
an8.51:6.1	Venerable Ānanda saw her standing there,
an8.51:6.2	and said to her,
an8.51:6.3	“Gotamī, why do you stand crying outside the gate, your feet swollen, your limbs covered with dust, miserable and sad, with tearful face?”
an8.51:6.4	“Sir, Ānanda, it’s because the Buddha does not permit females to go forth in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.”
an8.51:6.5	“Well then, Gotamī, wait here just a moment, while I ask the Buddha to grant the going forth for females.”
an8.51:7.1	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an8.51:7.2	“Sir, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī is standing crying outside the gate, her feet swollen, her limbs covered with dust, miserable and sad, with tearful face.
an8.51:7.3	She says that it’s because the Buddha does not permit females to go forth.
an8.51:7.4	Sir, please let females gain the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.”
an8.51:7.5	“Enough, Ānanda.
an8.51:7.6	Don’t advocate for females to gain the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.”
an8.51:8.1	For a second time …
an8.51:8.2	For a third time, Ānanda said to the Buddha:
an8.51:8.3	“Sir, please let females gain the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.”
an8.51:8.4	“Enough, Ānanda.
an8.51:8.5	Don’t advocate for females to gain the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.”
an8.51:9.1	Then Venerable Ānanda thought,
an8.51:9.2	“The Buddha does not permit females to go forth.
an8.51:9.3	Why don’t I try another approach?”
an8.51:9.4	Then Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,
an8.51:9.5	“Sir, is a female able to realize the fruits of stream-entry, once-return, non-return, and perfection once she has gone forth?”
an8.51:9.6	“She is able, Ānanda.”
an8.51:9.7	“If a female is able to realize the fruits of stream-entry, once-return, non-return, and perfection once she has gone forth.
an8.51:9.8	Sir, Mahāpajāpatī has been very helpful to the Buddha. She is his aunt who raised him, nurtured him, and gave him her milk.
an8.51:9.9	When the Buddha’s birth mother passed away, she nurtured him at her own breast.
an8.51:9.10	Sir, please let females gain the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.”
an8.51:10.1	“Ānanda, if Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī accepts these eight principles of respect, that will be her ordination.
an8.51:11.1	A nun, even if she has been ordained for a hundred years, should bow down to a monk who was ordained that very day. She should rise up for him, greet him with joined palms, and observe proper etiquette toward him.
an8.51:11.2	This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.
an8.51:12.1	A nun should not commence the rainy season residence in a monastery without monks.
an8.51:12.2	This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.
an8.51:13.1	Each fortnight the nuns should expect two things from the community of monks:
an8.51:13.2	the date of the sabbath, and visiting for advice.
an8.51:13.3	This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.
an8.51:14.1	After completing the rainy season residence the nuns should invite admonition from the communities of both monks and nuns in regard to anything that was
an8.51:14.2	seen, heard, or suspected.
an8.51:14.3	This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.
an8.51:15.1	A nun who has committed a grave offense should undergo penance in the communities of both monks and nuns for a fortnight.
an8.51:15.2	This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.
an8.51:16.1	A trainee nun who has trained in the six rules for two years should seek ordination from the communities of both monks and nuns.
an8.51:16.2	This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.
an8.51:17.1	A nun should not abuse or insult a monk in any way.
an8.51:17.2	This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.
an8.51:18.1	From this day forth it is forbidden for nuns to criticize monks, but it is not forbidden for monks to criticize nuns.
an8.51:18.2	This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.
an8.51:19.1	If Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī accepts these eight principles of respect, that will be her ordination.”
an8.51:20.1	Then Ānanda, having learned these eight principles of respect from the Buddha himself, went to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī and said:
an8.51:21.1	“Gotamī, if you accept eight principles of respect, that will be your ordination.
an8.51:22.1	A nun, even if she has been ordained for a hundred years, should bow down to a monk who was ordained that very day. She should rise up for him, greet him with joined palms, and observe proper etiquette toward him.
an8.51:22.2	This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts. …
an8.51:23.1	From this day forth it is forbidden for nuns to criticize monks, but it is not forbidden for monks to criticize nuns.
an8.51:23.2	This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.
an8.51:23.3	If you accept these eight principles of respect, that will be your ordination.”
an8.51:24.1	“Ānanda, suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and had bathed their head. After getting a garland of lotuses, jasmine, or liana flowers, they would take them in both hands and place them on the crown of the head.
an8.51:24.2	In the same way, sir, I accept these eight principles of respect as not to be transgressed so long as life lasts.”
an8.51:25.1	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:
an8.51:25.2	“Sir, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī has accepted the eight principles of respect as not to be transgressed so long as life lasts.”
an8.51:26.1	“Ānanda, if females had not gained the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One, the spiritual life would have lasted long. The true teaching would have remained for a thousand years.
an8.51:26.2	But since they have gained the going forth, now the spiritual life will not last long.
an8.51:26.3	The true teaching will remain only five hundred years.
an8.51:27.1	It’s like those families with many women and few men. They’re easy prey for bandits and thieves.
an8.51:27.2	In the same way, the spiritual life does not last long in a teaching and training where females gain the going forth.
an8.51:28.1	It’s like a field full of rice. Once the disease called ‘white bones’ attacks, it doesn’t last long.
an8.51:28.2	In the same way, the spiritual life does not last long in a teaching and training where females gain the going forth.
an8.51:29.1	It’s like a field full of sugar cane. Once the disease called ‘red rot’ attacks, it doesn’t last long.
an8.51:29.2	In the same way, the spiritual life does not last long in a teaching and training where females gain the going forth.
an8.51:30.1	As a man might build a dyke around a large lake as a precaution against the water overflowing,
an8.51:30.2	in the same way as a precaution I’ve prescribed the eight principles of respect as not to be transgressed so long as life lasts.”

an8.52:0.3	52. An Adviser for Nuns
an8.52:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
an8.52:1.2	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:
an8.52:1.3	“Sir, how many qualities should a monk have to be agreed on as an adviser for nuns?”
an8.52:2.1	“Ānanda, a monk with eight qualities may be agreed on as an adviser for nuns.
an8.52:2.2	What eight?
an8.52:2.3	Firstly, a monk is ethical, restrained in the code of conduct, with good behavior and supporters. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
an8.52:2.4	They’re learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s totally full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reciting them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.
an8.52:2.5	Both monastic codes have been passed down to them in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well judged in both the rules and accompanying material.
an8.52:2.6	They’re a good speaker. Their voice is polished, clear, articulate, and expresses the meaning.
an8.52:2.7	They’re able to educate, encourage, fire up, and inspire the community of nuns.
an8.52:2.8	They’re likable and agreeable to most of the nuns.
an8.52:2.9	They have never previously sexually harassed any woman wearing the ocher robe who has gone forth in the Buddha’s name.
an8.52:2.10	They have been ordained for twenty years or more.
an8.52:2.11	A monk with these eight qualities may be agreed on as an adviser for nuns.”

an8.53:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
an8.53:1.2	Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:
an8.53:2.1	“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.”
an8.53:2.2	“Gotamī, you might know that certain things
an8.53:2.3	lead to passion, not dispassion;
an8.53:2.4	to being fettered, not to being unfettered;
an8.53:2.5	to accumulation, not dispersal;
an8.53:2.6	to more desires, not fewer;
an8.53:2.7	to lack of contentment, not contentment;
an8.53:2.8	to crowding, not seclusion;
an8.53:2.9	to laziness, not energy;
an8.53:2.10	to being burdensome, not being unburdensome.
an8.53:2.11	You should definitely bear in mind that these things are
an8.53:2.12	not the teaching, not the training, and not the Teacher’s instructions.
an8.53:3.1	You might know that certain things
an8.53:3.2	lead to dispassion, not passion;
an8.53:3.3	to being unfettered, not to being fettered;
an8.53:3.4	to dispersal, not accumulation;

an8.53:3.6	to contentment, not lack of contentment;
an8.53:3.7	to seclusion, not crowding;
an8.53:3.8	to energy, not laziness;
an8.53:3.9	to being unburdensome, not being burdensome.

an8.54:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where they have a town named Kakkarapatta.
an8.54:1.2	Then Dīghajāṇu the Koliyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:
an8.54:1.3	“Sir, we are laypeople who enjoy sensual pleasures and living at home with our children. We use sandalwood imported from Kāsi, we wear garlands, perfumes, and makeup, and we accept gold and money.
an8.54:1.4	May the Buddha please teach us the Dhamma in a way that leads to our welfare and happiness in this life and in future lives.”
an8.54:2.1	“Byagghapajja, these four things lead to the welfare and happiness of a gentleman in this life.
an8.54:2.2	What four?
an8.54:2.3	Accomplishment in initiative, protection, good friendship, and balanced finances.
an8.54:2.4	And what is accomplishment in initiative?
an8.54:2.5	It’s when a gentleman earns a living by means such as
an8.54:2.6	farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions.
an8.54:2.7	He understands how to go about these things in order to complete and organize the work.
an8.54:2.8	This is called accomplishment in initiative.
an8.54:3.1	And what is accomplishment in protection?
an8.54:3.2	It’s when a gentleman owns legitimate wealth that he has earned by his own efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow.
an8.54:3.3	He ensures it is guarded and protected, thinking:
an8.54:3.4	‘How can I prevent my wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits, consumed by fire, swept away by flood, or taken by unloved heirs?’
an8.54:3.5	This is called accomplishment in protection.
an8.54:4.1	And what is accomplishment in good friendship?
an8.54:4.2	It’s when a gentleman resides in a town or village. And in that place there are householders or their children who may be young or old, but are mature in conduct, accomplished in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom. He associates with them, converses and engages in discussion. And he emulates the same kind of accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom.
an8.54:4.3	This is called accomplishment in good friendship.
an8.54:5.1	And what is accomplishment in balanced finances?
an8.54:5.2	It’s when a gentleman, knowing his income and expenditure, balances his finances, being neither too extravagant nor too frugal. He thinks, ‘In this way my income will exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.’
an8.54:5.3	It’s like an appraiser or their apprentice who, holding up the scales, knows that it’s low by this much or high by this much.
an8.54:5.4	In the same way, a gentleman, knowing his income and expenditure, balances his finances, being neither too extravagant nor too frugal. He thinks, ‘In this way my income will exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.’
an8.54:5.5	If a gentleman has little income but an opulent life, people will say: ‘This gentleman eats their wealth like a fig-eater!’
an8.54:5.6	If a gentleman has a large income but a spartan life, people will say: ‘This gentleman is starving themselves to death!’
an8.54:5.7	But a gentleman, knowing his income and expenditure, leads a balanced life, neither too extravagant nor too frugal, thinking, ‘In this way my income will exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.’
an8.54:5.8	This is called accomplishment in balanced finances.
an8.54:6.1	There are four drains on wealth that has been gathered in this way.
an8.54:6.2	Womanizing, drinking, gambling, and having bad friends, companions, and associates.
an8.54:6.3	Suppose there was a large reservoir with four inlets and four drains.
an8.54:6.4	And someone was to open up the drains and close off the inlets,
an8.54:6.5	and the heavens don’t provide enough rain.
an8.54:6.6	You’d expect that large reservoir to dwindle, not expand.
an8.54:6.7	In the same way, there are four drains on wealth that has been gathered in this way.
an8.54:6.8	Womanizing, drinking, gambling, and having bad friends, companions, and associates.
an8.54:7.1	There are four inlets for wealth that has been gathered in this way.
an8.54:7.2	Not womanizing, drinking, or gambling, and having good friends, companions, and associates.
an8.54:7.3	Suppose there was a large reservoir with four inlets and four drains.
an8.54:7.4	And someone was to open up the inlets and close off the drains,

an8.54:7.7	In the same way, there are four inlets for wealth that has been gathered in this way.
an8.54:7.8	Not womanizing, drinking, or gambling, and having good friends, companions, and associates.
an8.54:8.1	These are the four things that lead to the welfare and happiness of a gentleman in this life.
an8.54:9.1	These four things lead to the welfare and happiness of a gentleman in future lives.
an8.54:9.2	What four?
an8.54:9.3	Accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom.
an8.54:10.1	And what is accomplishment in faith?
an8.54:10.2	It’s when a gentleman has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:
an8.54:10.3	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
an8.54:10.4	This is called accomplishment in faith.
an8.54:11.1	And what is accomplishment in ethics?
an8.54:11.2	It’s when a gentleman doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
an8.54:11.3	This is called accomplishment in ethics.
an8.54:12.1	And what is accomplishment in generosity?
an8.54:12.2	It’s when a gentleman lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.
an8.54:12.3	This is called accomplishment in generosity.
an8.54:13.1	And what is accomplishment in wisdom?
an8.54:13.2	It’s when a gentleman is wise. He has the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.
an8.54:13.3	This is called accomplishment in wisdom.
an8.54:14.1	These are the four things that lead to the welfare and happiness of a gentleman in future lives.
an8.54:15.1	They’re enterprising in the workplace,
an8.54:15.2	diligent in managing things,
an8.54:15.3	they balance their finances,
an8.54:15.4	and preserve their wealth.
an8.54:16.1	Faithful, accomplished in ethics,
an8.54:16.2	bountiful, rid of stinginess,
an8.54:16.3	they always purify the path
an8.54:16.4	to well-being in lives to come.
an8.54:17.1	And so these eight qualities
an8.54:17.2	of a faithful householder
an8.54:17.3	are declared by the one who is truly named
an8.54:17.4	to lead to happiness in both spheres,
an8.54:18.1	welfare and benefit in this life,
an8.54:18.2	and happiness in the future lives.
an8.54:18.3	This is how, for a householder,
an8.54:18.4	merit grows by generosity.”

an8.55:10.3	Accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom.
an8.55:10.4	And what is accomplishment in faith?
an8.55:10.5	It’s when a gentleman has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:
an8.55:10.6	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
an8.55:10.7	This is called accomplishment in faith.
an8.55:11.1	And what is accomplishment in ethics?
an8.55:11.2	It’s when a gentleman doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
an8.55:11.3	This is called accomplishment in ethics.
an8.55:12.1	And what is accomplishment in generosity?
an8.55:12.2	It’s when a gentleman lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.
an8.55:12.3	This is called accomplishment in generosity.
an8.55:13.1	And what is accomplishment in wisdom?
an8.55:13.2	It’s when a gentleman is wise. He has the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.
an8.55:13.3	This is called accomplishment in wisdom.
an8.55:14.1	These are the four things that lead to the welfare and happiness of a gentleman in future lives.
an8.55:15.1	They’re enterprising in the workplace,
an8.55:15.2	diligent in managing things,
an8.55:15.3	they balance their finances,
an8.55:15.4	and preserve their wealth.
an8.55:16.1	Faithful, accomplished in ethics,
an8.55:16.2	bountiful, rid of stinginess,
an8.55:16.3	they always purify the path
an8.55:16.4	to well-being in lives to come.
an8.55:17.1	And so these eight qualities
an8.55:17.2	of a faithful householder
an8.55:17.3	are declared by the one who is truly named
an8.55:17.4	to lead to happiness in both spheres,
an8.55:18.1	welfare and benefit in this life,
an8.55:18.2	and happiness in the next.
an8.55:18.3	This is how, for a householder,
an8.55:18.4	merit grows by generosity.”

an8.56:1.1	“Mendicants, ‘danger’ is a term for sensual pleasures.

an8.56:1.5	‘dart’,

an8.56:1.7	‘bog’,
an8.56:1.8	and ‘womb’ are terms for sensual pleasures.
an8.56:1.9	And why is ‘danger’ a term for sensual pleasures?
an8.56:1.10	Someone who is besotted by sensual greed and shackled by lustful desire is not freed from dangers in the present life or in lives to come. That is why ‘danger’ is a term for sensual pleasures.
an8.56:1.11	And why are ‘suffering’,

an8.56:1.17	and ‘womb’ terms for sensual pleasures?
an8.56:1.18	Someone who is besotted by sensual greed and shackled by lustful desire is not freed from wombs in the present life or in lives to come. That is why ‘womb’ is a term for sensual pleasures.
an8.56:2.1	Danger, suffering, and disease,
an8.56:2.2	boil, dart, and snare,
an8.56:2.3	and bogs and wombs both.
an8.56:2.4	These describe the sensual pleasures
an8.56:2.5	to which ordinary people are attached.
an8.56:3.1	Swamped by things that seem pleasant,
an8.56:3.2	you go to another womb.
an8.56:3.3	But when a mendicant is keen,
an8.56:3.4	and doesn’t forget awareness,
an8.56:4.1	in this way they transcend
an8.56:4.2	this grueling swamp.
an8.56:4.3	They watch this population flounder,
an8.56:4.4	fallen into rebirth and old age.”

an8.63:9.1	When this immersion is well developed and cultivated in this way, you should develop it while placing the mind and keeping it connected. You should develop it without placing the mind, but just keeping it connected. You should develop it without placing the mind or keeping it connected. You should develop it with rapture. You should develop it without rapture. You should develop it with pleasure. You should develop it with equanimity.
an8.63:10.1	When this immersion is well developed and cultivated in this way, wherever you walk, you’ll walk comfortably. Wherever you stand, you’ll stand comfortably. Wherever you sit, you’ll sit comfortably. Wherever you lie down, you’ll lie down comfortably.”
an8.63:11.1	When that mendicant had been given this advice by the Buddha, he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
an8.63:11.2	Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
an8.63:11.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
an8.63:11.4	And that mendicant became one of the perfected.

an8.64:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Gayā on Gayā Head.
an8.64:1.2	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
an8.64:1.3	“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still not awake but intent on awakening—I perceived light but did not see visions.
an8.64:2.1	Then it occurred to me,
an8.64:2.2	‘What if I were to both perceive light and see visions?
an8.64:2.3	Then my knowledge and vision would become even more purified.’
an8.64:3.1	So after some time, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, I perceived light and saw visions.

an8.64:5.1	So after some time … I perceived light and saw visions. And I associated with those deities, conversed, and engaged in discussion.
an8.64:5.2	But I didn’t know which
an8.64:5.3	orders of gods those deities came from.
an8.64:6.1	Then it occurred to me,
an8.64:6.2	‘What if I were to perceive light and see visions; and associate with those deities, converse, and engage in discussion;
an8.64:6.3	and find out which orders of gods those deities come from?
an8.64:6.4	Then my knowledge and vision would become even more purified.’

an8.64:7.13	So after some time … I found out that
an8.64:7.14	these deities have a life-span of such a length.
an8.64:7.15	But I didn’t know whether or not I had previously lived together with those deities.

an8.64:8.5	and what deeds caused those deities to have such food and such an experience of pleasure and pain;
an8.64:8.6	and that these deities have a life-span of such a length; and whether or not I have previously lived together with those deities?
an8.64:8.7	Then my knowledge and vision would become even more purified.’

an8.64:9.4	NA
an8.64:9.5	I found out whether or not I have previously lived together with those deities.
an8.64:10.1	As long as my knowledge and vision about the deities was not fully purified from these eight perspectives, I didn’t announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.
an8.64:10.2	But when my knowledge and vision about the deities was fully purified from these eight perspectives, I announced my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.
an8.64:10.3	Knowledge and vision arose in me:

an8.70:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
an8.70:1.2	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.
an8.70:1.3	Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Ānanda,
an8.70:1.4	“Ānanda, get your sitting cloth.
an8.70:1.5	Let’s go to the Cāpāla shrine for the day’s meditation.”
an8.70:1.6	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha.
an8.70:2.1	Then the Buddha went up to the Cāpāla shrine, where he sat on the seat spread out.
an8.70:2.2	When he was seated he said to Venerable Ānanda:
an8.70:3.1	“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla shrines are all lovely.
an8.70:3.2	Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.
an8.70:3.3	The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.”
an8.70:3.4	But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign.
an8.70:3.5	He didn’t beg the Buddha,
an8.70:3.6	“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra.
an8.70:4.1	For a second time …
an8.70:4.2	And for a third time, the Buddha said to him:
an8.70:4.3	“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla shrines are all lovely.
an8.70:4.4	Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.
an8.70:4.5	The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.”
an8.70:4.6	But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign.
an8.70:4.7	He didn’t beg the Buddha,
an8.70:4.8	“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra.
an8.70:5.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,
an8.70:5.2	“Go now, Ānanda, at your convenience.”
an8.70:5.3	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He rose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before sitting at the root of a tree close by.
an8.70:5.4	And then, not long after Ānanda had left, Māra the Wicked said to the Buddha:
an8.70:6.1	“Sir, may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.
an8.70:6.2	Sir, you once made this statement:
an8.70:6.3	‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and practice in line with the teachings; not until they practice appropriately, living in line with the teaching; not until they’ve learned their tradition, and explain, teach, assert, establish, clarify, analyze, and reveal; not until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis.’
an8.70:6.4	Today you do have such monk disciples.
an8.70:7.1	May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.
an8.70:7.2	Sir, you once made this statement:
an8.70:7.3	‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have nun disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ …
an8.70:7.4	‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have layman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ …
an8.70:7.5	‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have laywoman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ …
an8.70:7.6	Today you do have such laywoman disciples.
an8.70:8.1	Sir, may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.
an8.70:8.2	Sir, you once made this statement:
an8.70:8.3	‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until my spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.’
an8.70:8.4	Today your spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.
an8.70:9.1	Sir, may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.”
an8.70:9.2	“Relax, Wicked One. The final extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon.
an8.70:9.3	Three months from now the Realized One will finally be extinguished.”
an8.70:10.1	So at the Cāpāla tree shrine the Buddha, mindful and aware, surrendered the life force.
an8.70:10.2	When he did so there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky.
an8.70:10.3	Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:
an8.70:10.4	“Weighing up the incomparable against an extension of life,
an8.70:10.5	the sage surrendered the life force.
an8.70:10.6	Happy inside, serene,
an8.70:10.7	he burst out of this self-made chain like a suit of armor.”
an8.70:11.1	Then Venerable Ānanda thought,
an8.70:12.2	“That was a really big earthquake!
an8.70:12.3	That was really a very big earthquake; awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky!
an8.70:12.4	What’s the cause, what’s the reason for a great earthquake?”
an8.70:13.1	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
an8.70:13.2	“Sir, that was a really big earthquake!
an8.70:13.3	That was really a very big earthquake; awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky!
an8.70:13.4	What’s the cause, what’s the reason for a great earthquake?”
an8.70:14.1	“Ānanda, there are these eight causes and reasons for a great earthquake.
an8.70:14.2	What eight?
an8.70:14.3	This great earth is grounded on water, the water is grounded on air, and the air stands in space. At a time when a great wind blows, it stirs the water, and the water stirs the earth.
an8.70:14.4	This is the first cause and reason for a great earthquake.
an8.70:15.1	Furthermore, there is an ascetic or brahmin with psychic power who has achieved mastery of the mind, or a god who is mighty and powerful. They’ve developed a limited perception of earth and a limitless perception of water. They make the earth shake and rock and tremble.
an8.70:15.2	This is the second cause and reason for a great earthquake.
an8.70:16.1	Furthermore, when the being intent on awakening passes away from the host of Joyful Gods, he’s conceived in his mother’s belly, mindful and aware. Then the earth shakes and rocks and trembles.
an8.70:16.2	This is the third cause and reason for a great earthquake.
an8.70:17.1	Furthermore, when the being intent on awakening comes out of his mother’s belly mindful and aware, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles.
an8.70:17.2	This is the fourth cause and reason for a great earthquake.
an8.70:18.1	Furthermore, when the Realized One realizes the supreme perfect awakening, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles.
an8.70:18.2	This is the fifth cause and reason for a great earthquake.
an8.70:19.1	Furthermore, when the Realized One rolls forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles.
an8.70:19.2	This is the sixth cause and reason for a great earthquake.
an8.70:20.1	Furthermore, when the Realized One, mindful and aware, surrenders the life force, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles.
an8.70:20.2	This is the seventh cause and reason for a great earthquake.
an8.70:21.1	Furthermore, when the Realized One becomes fully extinguished through the natural principle of extinguishment, without anything left over, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles.
an8.70:21.2	This is the eighth cause and reason for a great earthquake.

an8.72:3.1	When they’re faithful, ethical, and learned, a Dhamma speaker, one who frequents assemblies, one who teaches Dhamma to the assembly with assurance, one who gets the formless liberations, and one who lives having realized the ending of defilements,
an8.72:3.2	they’re complete in that respect.
an8.72:3.3	A mendicant who has these eight qualities is inspiring all around, and is complete in every respect.”

an8.73:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house.
an8.73:1.2	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
an8.73:1.3	“Mendicants!”
an8.73:1.4	“Venerable sir,” they replied.
an8.73:1.5	The Buddha said this:
an8.73:1.6	“Mendicants, when mindfulness of death is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless.
an8.73:1.7	But do you develop mindfulness of death?”
an8.73:2.1	When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha,
an8.73:2.2	“Sir, I develop mindfulness of death.”
an8.73:2.3	“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”
an8.73:2.4	“In this case, sir, I think:
an8.73:2.5	‘Oh, if I’d only live for another day and night, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’
an8.73:2.6	That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”
an8.73:3.1	Another mendicant said to the Buddha,
an8.73:3.2	“Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”
an8.73:3.3	“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”
an8.73:3.4	“In this case, sir, I think:
an8.73:3.5	‘Oh, if I’d only live for another day, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’
an8.73:3.6	That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”
an8.73:4.1	Another mendicant said to the Buddha,
an8.73:4.2	“Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”
an8.73:4.3	“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”
an8.73:4.4	“In this case, sir, I think:
an8.73:4.5	‘Oh, if I’d only live for half a day, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’
an8.73:4.6	That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”
an8.73:5.1	Another mendicant said to the Buddha,
an8.73:5.2	“Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”
an8.73:5.3	“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”
an8.73:5.4	“In this case, sir, I think:
an8.73:5.5	‘Oh, if I’d only live as long as it takes to eat a single almsmeal, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’
an8.73:5.6	That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”
an8.73:6.1	Another mendicant said to the Buddha,
an8.73:6.2	“Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”
an8.73:6.3	“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”
an8.73:6.4	“In this case, sir, I think:
an8.73:6.5	‘Oh, if I’d only live as long as it takes to eat half an almsmeal, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’
an8.73:6.6	That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”
an8.73:7.1	Another mendicant said to the Buddha,
an8.73:7.2	“Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”
an8.73:7.3	“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”
an8.73:7.4	“In this case, sir, I think:
an8.73:7.5	‘Oh, if I’d only live as long as it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’
an8.73:7.6	That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”
an8.73:8.1	Another mendicant said to the Buddha,
an8.73:8.2	“Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”
an8.73:8.3	“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”
an8.73:8.4	“In this case, sir, I think:
an8.73:8.5	‘Oh, if I’d only live as long as it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’
an8.73:8.6	That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”
an8.73:9.1	Another mendicant said to the Buddha,
an8.73:9.2	“Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”
an8.73:9.3	“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”
an8.73:9.4	“In this case, sir, I think:
an8.73:9.5	‘Oh, if I’d only live as long as it takes to breathe out after breathing in, or to breathe in after breathing out, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’
an8.73:9.6	That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”
an8.73:10.1	When this was said, the Buddha said to those mendicants:
an8.73:10.2	“The mendicants who develop mindfulness of death by wishing
an8.73:10.3	to live for a day and night …
an8.73:10.4	NA
an8.73:10.5	or to live for a day …
an8.73:10.6	NA
an8.73:10.7	or to live for half a day …
an8.73:10.8	NA
an8.73:10.9	or to live as long as it takes to eat a meal of almsfood …
an8.73:10.10	NA
an8.73:10.11	or to live as long as it takes to eat half a meal of almsfood …
an8.73:10.12	NA
an8.73:10.13	or to live as long as it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls …
an8.73:10.14	These are called mendicants who live negligently. They slackly develop mindfulness of death for the ending of defilements.
an8.73:11.1	But the mendicants who develop mindfulness of death by wishing
an8.73:11.2	to live as long as it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful …
an8.73:11.3	NA
an8.73:11.4	or to live as long as it takes to breathe out after breathing in, or to breathe in after breathing out …
an8.73:11.5	These are called mendicants who live diligently. They keenly develop mindfulness of death for the ending of defilements.
an8.73:12.1	So you should train like this:
an8.73:12.2	‘We will live diligently. We will keenly develop mindfulness of death for the ending of defilements.’
an8.73:12.3	That’s how you should train.”

an8.74:1.3	“Mendicants, when mindfulness of death is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless.
an8.74:2.1	And how is mindfulness of death developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial, to culminate in the deathless and end with the deathless?
an8.74:2.2	As day passes by and night draws close, a mendicant reflects:
an8.74:2.3	‘I might die of many causes.
an8.74:2.4	A snake might bite me, or a scorpion or centipede might sting me.
an8.74:2.5	And if I died from that it would stop my practice.

an8.74:2.7	And if I died from that it would stop my practice.’
an8.74:2.8	That mendicant should reflect:
an8.74:2.9	‘Are there any bad, unskillful qualities that I haven’t given up, which might be an obstacle to me if I die tonight?’
an8.74:3.1	Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that
an8.74:3.2	there are such bad, unskillful qualities. Then in order to give them up they should apply outstanding enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness.
an8.74:4.1	Suppose your clothes or head were on fire. In order to extinguish it, you’d apply intense enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness.
an8.74:4.2	In the same way, in order to give up those bad, unskillful qualities, that mendicant should apply outstanding enthusiasm …
an8.74:5.1	But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that
an8.74:5.2	there are no such bad, unskillful qualities. Then that mendicant should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.

an8.75:1.3	Accomplishment in initiative, protection, good friendship, and balanced finances. And accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom.
an8.75:1.4	These are the eight accomplishments.

an8.75:4.4	to lead to happiness in both spheres,
an8.75:5.1	welfare and benefit in this life,

an8.76:1.2	What eight?
an8.76:1.3	Accomplishment in initiative, protection, good friendship, and balanced finances. And accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom.
an8.76:1.4	And what is accomplishment in initiative?
an8.76:1.5	It’s when a gentleman earns a living by means such as
an8.76:1.6	farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions.
an8.76:1.7	He understands how to go about these things in order to complete and organize the work.
an8.76:1.8	This is called accomplishment in initiative.
an8.76:2.1	And what is accomplishment in protection?
an8.76:2.2	It’s when a gentleman owns legitimate wealth that he has earned by his own efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow. He ensures it is guarded and protected, thinking:
an8.76:2.3	‘How can I prevent my wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits, consumed by fire, swept away by flood, or taken by unloved heirs?’
an8.76:2.4	This is called accomplishment in protection.
an8.76:3.1	And what is accomplishment in good friendship?
an8.76:3.2	It’s when a gentleman resides in a town or village. And in that place there are householders or their children who may be young or old, but are mature in conduct, accomplished in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom. He associates with them, converses and engages in discussion. And he emulates the same kind of accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom.
an8.76:3.3	This is called accomplishment in good friendship.
an8.76:4.1	And what is accomplishment in balanced finances?
an8.76:4.2	It’s when a gentleman, knowing his income and expenditure, balances his finances, being neither too extravagant nor too frugal. He thinks, ‘In this way my income will exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.’
an8.76:4.3	It’s like an appraiser or their apprentice who, holding up the scales, knows that it’s low by this much or high by this much.
an8.76:4.4	In the same way, a gentleman, knowing his income and expenditure, balances his finances, being neither too extravagant nor too frugal. He thinks, ‘In this way my income will exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.’
an8.76:4.5	If a gentleman has little income but an opulent life, people will say: ‘This gentleman eats their wealth like a fig-eater!’
an8.76:4.6	If a gentleman has a large income but a spartan life, people will say: ‘This gentleman is starving themselves to death!’
an8.76:4.7	But a gentleman, knowing his income and expenditure, leads a balanced life, neither too extravagant nor too frugal, thinking, ‘In this way my income will exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.’
an8.76:4.8	This is called accomplishment in balanced finances.
an8.76:5.1	And what is accomplishment in faith?
an8.76:5.2	It’s when a gentleman has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:
an8.76:5.3	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
an8.76:5.4	This is called accomplishment in faith.
an8.76:6.1	And what is accomplishment in ethics?
an8.76:6.2	It’s when a gentleman doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
an8.76:6.3	This is called accomplishment in ethics.
an8.76:7.1	And what is accomplishment in generosity?
an8.76:7.2	It’s when a gentleman lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.
an8.76:7.3	This is called accomplishment in generosity.
an8.76:8.1	And what is accomplishment in wisdom?
an8.76:8.2	It’s when a gentleman is wise. He has the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.
an8.76:8.3	This is called accomplishment in wisdom.
an8.76:9.1	These are the eight accomplishments.
an8.76:10.1	They’re enterprising in the workplace,

an8.80:1.1	“Mendicants, there are eight grounds for laziness.
an8.80:1.2	What eight?
an8.80:1.3	Firstly, a mendicant has some work to do.
an8.80:1.4	They think:
an8.80:1.5	‘I have some work to do. But while doing it my body will get tired. I’d better have a lie down.’
an8.80:1.6	They lie down, and don’t rouse energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.
an8.80:1.7	This is the first ground for laziness.
an8.80:2.1	Furthermore, a mendicant has done some work.
an8.80:2.2	They think:
an8.80:2.3	‘I’ve done some work. But while working my body got tired. I’d better have a lie down.’
an8.80:2.4	They lie down, and don’t rouse energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.
an8.80:2.5	This is the second ground for laziness.
an8.80:3.1	Furthermore, a mendicant has to go on a journey.
an8.80:3.2	They think:
an8.80:3.3	‘I have to go on a journey. But while walking my body will get tired. I’d better have a lie down.’
an8.80:3.4	They lie down, and don’t rouse energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.
an8.80:3.5	This is the third ground for laziness.

an8.80:4.2	They think:
an8.80:4.3	‘I’ve gone on a journey. But while walking my body got tired. I’d better have a lie down.’
an8.80:4.4	They lie down, and don’t rouse energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.
an8.80:4.5	This is the fourth ground for laziness.
an8.80:5.1	Furthermore, a mendicant has wandered for alms, but they didn’t get to fill up on as much food as they like, rough or fine.
an8.80:5.2	They think:
an8.80:5.3	‘I’ve wandered for alms, but I didn’t get to fill up on as much food as I like, rough or fine. My body is tired and unfit for work. I’d better have a lie down.’
an8.80:5.4	They lie down, and don’t rouse energy for achieving the unachieved, attaining the unattained, and realizing the unrealized.
an8.80:5.5	This is the fifth ground for laziness.
an8.80:6.1	Furthermore, a mendicant has wandered for alms, and they got to fill up on as much food as they like, rough or fine.
an8.80:6.2	They think:
an8.80:6.3	‘I’ve wandered for alms, and I got to fill up on as much food as I like, rough or fine. My body is heavy, unfit for work, like I’ve just eaten a load of beans. I’d better have a lie down.’
an8.80:6.4	They lie down, and don’t rouse energy for achieving the unachieved, attaining the unattained, and realizing the unrealized.
an8.80:6.5	This is the sixth ground for laziness.
an8.80:7.1	Furthermore, a mendicant feels a little sick.
an8.80:7.2	They think:
an8.80:7.3	‘I feel a little sick. Lying down would be good for me. I’d better have a lie down.’
an8.80:7.4	They lie down, and don’t rouse energy for achieving the unachieved, attaining the unattained, and realizing the unrealized.
an8.80:7.5	This is the seventh ground for laziness.
an8.80:8.1	Furthermore, a mendicant has recently recovered from illness.
an8.80:8.2	They think:
an8.80:8.3	‘I’ve recently recovered from illness. My body is weak and unfit for work. I’d better have a lie down.’
an8.80:8.4	They lie down, and don’t rouse energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.
an8.80:8.5	This is the eighth ground for laziness.
an8.80:8.6	These are the eight grounds for laziness.
an8.80:9.1	There are eight grounds for arousing energy.
an8.80:9.2	What eight?
an8.80:9.3	Firstly, a mendicant has some work to do.
an8.80:9.4	They think:
an8.80:9.5	‘I have some work to do. While working it’s not easy to focus on the instructions of the Buddhas. I’d better preemptively rouse up energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.’
an8.80:9.6	They rouse energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.
an8.80:9.7	This is the first ground for arousing energy.
an8.80:10.1	Furthermore, a mendicant has done some work.
an8.80:10.2	They think:
an8.80:10.3	‘I’ve done some work. While I was working I wasn’t able to focus on the instructions of the Buddhas. I’d better preemptively rouse up energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.’
an8.80:10.4	They rouse up energy …
an8.80:10.5	This is the second ground for arousing energy.
an8.80:11.1	Furthermore, a mendicant has to go on a journey.

an8.80:13.2	They think:

an8.80:13.4	This is the fifth ground for arousing energy.
an8.80:14.1	Furthermore, a mendicant has wandered for alms, and they got to fill up on as much food as they like, rough or fine.
an8.80:14.2	They think:

an8.82:1.8	they pay homage, but don’t ask questions …

an8.82:1.13	The Realized One doesn’t feel inspired to teach.

an8.86:0.3	86. With Nāgita
an8.86:1.1	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Icchānaṅgala.
an8.86:1.2	He stayed in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.
an8.86:1.3	The brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala heard:
an8.86:1.4	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala. He is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.
an8.86:1.5	He has this good reputation:
an8.86:1.6	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ …
an8.86:1.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”
an8.86:2.1	Then, when the night had passed, they took many different foods and went to the forest near Icchānaṅgala, where they stood outside the gates making a dreadful racket.
an8.86:2.2	Now, at that time Venerable Nāgita was the Buddha’s attendant.
an8.86:2.3	Then the Buddha said to Nāgita,
an8.86:2.4	“Nāgita, who’s making that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”
an8.86:2.5	“Sir, it’s these brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala. They’ve brought many different foods, and they’re standing outside the gates wanting to offer it specially to the Buddha and the mendicant Saṅgha.”
an8.86:2.6	“Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to me.
an8.86:2.7	There are those who can’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can.
an8.86:2.8	Let them enjoy the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity.”
an8.86:3.1	“Sir, may the Blessed One please relent now! May the Holy One relent!
an8.86:3.2	Now is the time for the Buddha to relent.
an8.86:3.3	Wherever the Buddha now goes, the brahmins and householders will incline the same way, as will the people of town and country.
an8.86:3.4	It’s like when it rains heavily and the water flows downhill.
an8.86:3.5	In the same way, wherever the Buddha now goes, the brahmins and householders will incline the same way, as will the people of town and country.
an8.86:3.6	Why is that?
an8.86:3.7	Because of the Buddha’s ethics and wisdom.”
an8.86:4.1	“Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to me.
an8.86:4.2	There are those who can’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can.
an8.86:4.3	Let them enjoy the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity.
an8.86:5.1	Even some of the deities can’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can.
an8.86:5.2	When you all come together to enjoy each other’s company, I think:
an8.86:5.3	‘These venerables mustn’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can.
an8.86:5.4	That must be because they come together to enjoy each other’s company.’
an8.86:6.1	Take mendicants I see poking each other with their fingers, giggling and playing together.
an8.86:6.2	I think to myself:
an8.86:6.3	‘These venerables mustn’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can.
an8.86:6.4	That must be because they’re poking each other with their fingers, giggling and playing together.’
an8.86:7.1	Take mendicants I see eat as much as they like until their bellies are full, then indulge in the pleasures of sleeping, lying down, and drowsing.
an8.86:7.2	I think to myself:
an8.86:7.3	‘These venerables mustn’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can.
an8.86:7.4	That must be because they eat as much as they like until their bellies are full, then indulge in the pleasures of sleeping, lying down, and drowsing.’
an8.86:8.1	Take a mendicant living within a village who I see sitting immersed in samādhi.
an8.86:8.2	I think to myself:
an8.86:8.3	‘Now a monastery worker, a novice, or a fellow practitioner will make this venerable fall from immersion.’
an8.86:8.4	So I’m not pleased that that mendicant is living within a village.
an8.86:9.1	Take a mendicant in the wilderness who I see sitting nodding in meditation.
an8.86:9.2	I think to myself:
an8.86:9.3	‘Now this venerable, having dispelled that sleepiness and weariness, will focus just on the unified perception of wilderness.’
an8.86:9.4	So I’m pleased that that mendicant is living in the wilderness.
an8.86:10.1	Take a mendicant in the wilderness who I see sitting without being immersed in samādhi.
an8.86:10.2	I think to myself:
an8.86:10.3	‘Now if this venerable’s mind is not immersed in samādhi they will immerse it; or if it is immersed in samādhi, they will preserve it.’
an8.86:10.4	So I’m pleased that that mendicant is living in the wilderness.
an8.86:11.1	Take a mendicant in the wilderness who I see sitting immersed in samādhi.
an8.86:11.2	I think to myself:

an9.1:0.1	Numbered Discourses 9
an9.1:0.2	1. Awakening
an9.1:0.3	1. Awakening
an9.1:1.1	So I have heard.
an9.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an9.1:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
an9.1:2.1	“Mendicants, if wanderers who follow other paths were to ask:
an9.1:2.2	‘Reverends, what is the vital condition for the development of the awakening factors?’ How would you answer them?”
an9.1:2.3	“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. … The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
an9.1:3.1	“Well then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an9.1:3.2	“Yes, sir,” they replied.
an9.1:3.3	The Buddha said this:
an9.1:4.1	“Mendicants, if wanderers who follow other paths were to ask:
an9.1:4.2	‘Reverends, what is the vital condition for the development of the awakening factors?’ You should answer them:
an9.1:5.1	‘It’s when a mendicant has good friends, companions, and associates.
an9.1:5.2	This is the first vital condition for the development of the awakening factors.
an9.1:6.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
an9.1:6.2	This is the second vital condition for the development of the awakening factors.
an9.1:7.1	Furthermore, a mendicant gets to take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart, when they want, without trouble or difficulty. That is, talk about fewness of wishes, contentment, seclusion, aloofness, arousing energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom.
an9.1:7.2	This is the third vital condition for the development of the awakening factors.
an9.1:8.1	Furthermore, a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.
an9.1:8.2	This is the fourth vital condition for the development of the awakening factors.
an9.1:9.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.
an9.1:9.2	This is the fifth vital condition for the development of the awakening factors.’
an9.1:10.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to
an9.1:10.2	be ethical …
an9.1:11.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to
an9.1:11.2	take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart …
an9.1:12.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to
an9.1:12.2	live with energy roused up …
an9.1:13.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to
an9.1:13.2	be wise …
an9.1:14.1	But then, a mendicant grounded on these five things should develop four further things.
an9.1:14.2	They should develop the perception of ugliness to give up greed, love to give up hate, mindfulness of breathing to cut off thinking, and perception of impermanence to uproot the conceit ‘I am’.
an9.1:14.3	When you perceive impermanence, the perception of not-self becomes stabilized.
an9.1:14.4	Perceiving not-self, you uproot the conceit ‘I am’ and attain extinguishment in this very life.”

an9.2:0.2	1. Awakening
an9.2:0.3	2. Supported
an9.2:1.1	Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an9.2:1.2	“Sir, they speak of being ‘supported’.
an9.2:1.3	How is a mendicant who is supported defined?”
an9.2:1.4	“Mendicant, if a mendicant supported by faith gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful, the unskillful is actually given up by them.
an9.2:1.5	If a mendicant supported by conscience …
an9.2:1.6	If a mendicant supported by prudence …
an9.2:1.7	If a mendicant supported by energy …
an9.2:1.8	If a mendicant supported by wisdom gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful, the unskillful is actually given up by them.
an9.2:1.9	What’s been given up is completely given up when it has been given up by seeing with noble wisdom.
an9.2:2.1	But then, a mendicant grounded on these five things should rely on four things.
an9.2:2.2	What four?
an9.2:2.3	After appraisal, a mendicant uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things.
an9.2:2.4	That’s how a mendicant is supported.”

an9.3:0.3	3. With Meghiya
an9.3:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Cālikā, on the Cālikā mountain.
an9.3:1.2	Now, at that time Venerable Meghiya was the Buddha’s attendant.
an9.3:1.3	Then Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,
an9.3:1.4	“Sir, I’d like to enter Jantu village for alms.”
an9.3:1.5	“Please, Meghiya, go at your convenience.”
an9.3:2.1	Then Meghiya robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Jantu village for alms.
an9.3:2.2	After the meal, on his return from almsround in Jantu village, he went to the shore of Kimikālā river.
an9.3:2.3	As he was going for a walk along the shore of the river he saw a lovely and delightful mango grove.
an9.3:2.4	It occurred to him,
an9.3:2.5	“Oh, this mango grove is lovely and delightful! It’s truly good enough for meditation for a kinsman who wants to meditate.
an9.3:2.6	If the Buddha allows me, I’ll come back to this mango grove to meditate.”

an9.3:4.9	“We’re alone, Meghiya. Wait until another mendicant comes.”
an9.3:5.1	For a second time Meghiya said to the Buddha,
an9.3:5.2	“Sir, the Buddha has nothing more to do, and nothing that needs improvement.
an9.3:5.3	But I have.
an9.3:5.4	If you allow me, I’ll go back to that mango grove to meditate.”
an9.3:5.5	“We’re alone, Meghiya. Wait until another mendicant comes.”
an9.3:6.1	For a third time Meghiya said to the Buddha,
an9.3:6.2	“Sir, the Buddha has nothing more to do, and nothing that needs improvement.
an9.3:6.3	But I have.
an9.3:6.4	If you allow me, I’ll go back to that mango grove to meditate.”
an9.3:6.5	“Meghiya, since you speak of meditation, what can I say?
an9.3:6.6	Please, Meghiya, go at your convenience.”
an9.3:7.1	Then Meghiya got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went to that mango grove, and, having plunged deep into it, sat at the root of a certain tree for the day’s meditation.
an9.3:7.2	But while Meghiya was meditating in that mango grove he was beset mostly by three kinds of bad, unskillful thoughts, namely,
an9.3:7.3	sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts.
an9.3:7.4	Then he thought,
an9.3:7.5	“It’s incredible, it’s amazing!
an9.3:7.6	I’ve gone forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith,
an9.3:7.7	but I’m still harassed by these three kinds of bad, unskillful thoughts:
an9.3:7.8	sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts.”

an9.3:10.2	What five?
an9.3:10.3	Firstly, a mendicant has good friends, companions, and associates.
an9.3:10.4	This is the first thing …
an9.3:11.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.

an9.3:13.2	This is the fourth thing …
an9.3:14.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.
an9.3:14.2	This is the fifth thing that, when the heart’s release is not ripe, helps it ripen.
an9.3:15.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to
an9.3:15.2	be ethical …
an9.3:16.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to
an9.3:16.2	take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart …
an9.3:17.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to be energetic …
an9.3:18.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to be wise …
an9.3:19.1	But then, a mendicant grounded on these five things should develop four further things.
an9.3:19.2	They should develop the perception of ugliness to give up greed, love to give up hate, mindfulness of breathing to cut off thinking, and perception of impermanence to uproot the conceit ‘I am’.
an9.3:19.3	When you perceive impermanence, the perception of not-self becomes stabilized.
an9.3:19.4	Perceiving not-self, you uproot the conceit ‘I am’ and attain extinguishment in this very life.”

an9.4:0.3	4. With Nandaka
an9.4:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an9.4:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Nandaka was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk.
an9.4:1.3	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall. He stood outside the door waiting for the talk to end.
an9.4:1.4	When he knew the talk had ended he cleared his throat and knocked with the latch.
an9.4:1.5	The mendicants opened the door for the Buddha,
an9.4:2.1	and he entered the assembly hall, where he sat on the seat spread out.
an9.4:2.2	He said to Nandaka,
an9.4:2.3	“Nandaka, that was a long exposition of the teaching you gave to the mendicants.
an9.4:2.4	My back was aching while I stood outside the door waiting for the talk to end.”
an9.4:3.1	When he said this, Nandaka felt embarrassed and said to the Buddha,
an9.4:3.2	“Sir, we didn’t know that the Buddha was standing outside the door.
an9.4:3.3	If we’d known, I wouldn’t have said so much.”
an9.4:4.1	Then the Buddha, knowing that Nandaka was embarrassed, said to him,
an9.4:4.2	“Good, good, Nandaka!
an9.4:4.3	It’s appropriate for gentlemen like you, who have gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness, to sit together for a Dhamma talk.
an9.4:4.4	When you’re sitting together you should do one of two things:
an9.4:4.5	discuss the teachings or keep noble silence.
an9.4:4.6	Nandaka, a mendicant is faithful but not ethical.
an9.4:4.7	So they’re incomplete in that respect,
an9.4:4.8	and should fulfill it, thinking,
an9.4:4.9	‘How can I become faithful and ethical?’
an9.4:4.10	When a mendicant is faithful and ethical, they’re complete in that respect.
an9.4:5.1	A mendicant is faithful and ethical, but does not get internal serenity of heart.
an9.4:5.2	So they’re incomplete in that respect,
an9.4:5.3	and should fulfill it, thinking,
an9.4:5.4	‘How can I become faithful and ethical and get internal serenity of heart?’
an9.4:5.5	When a mendicant is faithful and ethical and gets internal serenity of heart, they’re complete in that respect.
an9.4:6.1	A mendicant is faithful, ethical, and gets internal serenity of heart, but they don’t get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles.
an9.4:6.2	So they’re incomplete in that respect.
an9.4:6.3	Suppose, Nandaka, there was a four-footed animal
an9.4:6.4	that was lame and disabled.
an9.4:6.5	It would be incomplete in that respect.
an9.4:6.6	In the same way, a mendicant is faithful, ethical, and gets internal serenity of heart, but they don’t get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles.
an9.4:6.7	So they’re incomplete in that respect,
an9.4:6.8	and should fulfill it, thinking,
an9.4:6.9	‘How can I become faithful and ethical and get internal serenity of heart and get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles?’
an9.4:7.1	When a mendicant is faithful and ethical and gets internal serenity of heart and gets the higher wisdom of discernment of principles, they’re complete in that respect.”
an9.4:7.2	That is what the Buddha said.
an9.4:7.3	When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.
an9.4:8.1	Then soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Nandaka said to the mendicants,
an9.4:8.2	“Just now, reverends, the Buddha explained a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure in four statements, before getting up from his seat and entering his dwelling:
an9.4:8.3	‘Nandaka, a mendicant is faithful but not ethical.
an9.4:8.4	So they’re incomplete in that respect,
an9.4:8.5	and should fulfill it, thinking,
an9.4:8.6	“How can I become faithful and ethical?”
an9.4:8.7	When a mendicant is faithful and ethical, they’re complete in that respect.
an9.4:8.8	A mendicant is faithful and ethical, but does not get internal serenity of heart. …
an9.4:8.9	They get internal serenity of heart, but they don’t get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles.
an9.4:8.10	So they’re incomplete in that respect.
an9.4:8.11	Suppose, Nandaka, there was a four-footed animal that was lame and disabled.
an9.4:8.12	It would be incomplete in that respect.
an9.4:8.13	In the same way, a mendicant is faithful, ethical, and gets internal serenity of heart, but they don’t get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles.
an9.4:8.14	So they’re incomplete in that respect,
an9.4:8.15	and should fulfill it, thinking:
an9.4:8.16	“How can I become faithful and ethical and get internal serenity of heart and get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles?”
an9.4:8.17	When a mendicant is faithful and ethical and gets internal serenity of heart and gets the higher wisdom of discernment of principles,
an9.4:8.18	they’re complete in that respect.’
an9.4:9.1	Reverends, there are these five benefits of listening to the teachings at the right time and discussing the teachings at the right time.
an9.4:9.2	What five?
an9.4:9.3	Firstly, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
an9.4:9.4	Whenever they do this, they become liked and approved by the Teacher, respected and admired.
an9.4:9.5	This is the first benefit …
an9.4:10.1	Furthermore, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma …
an9.4:10.2	Whenever they do this, they feel inspired by the meaning and the teaching in that Dhamma.
an9.4:10.3	This is the second benefit …
an9.4:11.1	Furthermore, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma …
an9.4:11.2	Whenever they do this, they see the meaning of a deep saying in that Dhamma with penetrating wisdom.
an9.4:11.3	This is the third benefit …
an9.4:12.1	Furthermore, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma …
an9.4:12.2	Whenever they do this, their spiritual companions esteem them more highly, thinking,
an9.4:12.3	‘For sure this venerable has attained or will attain.’
an9.4:12.4	This is the fourth benefit …
an9.4:13.1	Furthermore, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma …
an9.4:13.2	Whenever they do this, there may be trainee mendicants present, who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary. Hearing that teaching, they rouse energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.
an9.4:13.3	There may be perfected mendicants present, who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, a chieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment. Hearing that teaching, they simply wish to live happily in the present life.
an9.4:13.4	This is the fifth benefit …
an9.4:13.5	These are the five benefits of listening to the teachings at the right time and discussing the teachings at the right time.”
an9.5:0.1	Numbered Discourses 9
an9.5:0.2	1. Awakening
an9.5:0.3	5. Powers
an9.5:1.1	“Mendicants, there are these four powers.
an9.5:1.2	What four?
an9.5:1.3	The powers of wisdom, energy, blamelessness, and inclusiveness.
an9.5:1.4	And what is the power of wisdom?
an9.5:1.5	One has clearly seen and clearly contemplated with wisdom those qualities that are skillful and considered to be skillful; those that are unskillful … blameworthy … blameless … dark … bright … to be cultivated … not to be cultivated … not worthy of the noble ones … worthy of the noble ones and considered to be worthy of the noble ones.
an9.5:1.6	This is called the power of wisdom.
an9.5:2.1	And what is the power of energy?
an9.5:2.2	One generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives to give up those qualities that are unskillful and considered to be unskillful; those that are blameworthy … dark … not to be cultivated … not worthy of the noble ones and considered to be not worthy of the noble ones.
an9.5:2.3	One generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives to gain those qualities that are skillful and considered to be skillful; those that are blameless … bright … to be cultivated … worthy of the noble ones and considered to be worthy of the noble ones.
an9.5:2.4	This is called the power of energy.
an9.5:3.1	And what is the power of blamelessness?
an9.5:3.2	It’s when a mendicant has blameless conduct by way of body, speech, and mind.
an9.5:3.3	This is called the power of blamelessness.
an9.5:4.1	And what is the power of inclusiveness?
an9.5:4.2	There are these four ways of being inclusive.
an9.5:4.3	Giving, kindly words, taking care, and equality.
an9.5:4.4	The best of gifts is the gift of the teaching.
an9.5:4.5	The best sort of kindly speech is to teach the Dhamma again and again to someone who is engaged and who lends an ear.
an9.5:4.6	The best way of taking care is to encourage, settle, and ground the unfaithful in faith, the unethical in ethics, the stingy in generosity, and the ignorant in wisdom.
an9.5:4.7	The best kind of equality is the equality of a stream-enterer with another stream-enterer, a once-returner with another once-returner, a non-returner with another non-returner, and a perfected one with another perfected one.
an9.5:4.8	This is called the power of inclusiveness.
an9.5:4.9	These are the four powers.
an9.5:5.1	A noble disciple who has these four powers has got past five fears.
an9.5:5.2	What five?
an9.5:5.3	Fear regarding livelihood, disrepute, feeling insecure in an assembly, death, and bad rebirth.
an9.5:5.4	Then that noble disciple reflects:
an9.5:5.5	‘I have no fear regarding livelihood.
an9.5:5.6	Why would I be afraid of that?
an9.5:5.7	I have these four powers:
an9.5:5.8	the powers of wisdom, energy, blamelessness, and inclusiveness.
an9.5:5.9	A witless person might fear for their livelihood.
an9.5:5.10	A lazy person might fear for their livelihood.
an9.5:5.11	A person who does blameworthy things by way of body, speech, and mind might fear for their livelihood.
an9.5:5.12	A person who does not include others might fear for their livelihood.
an9.5:5.13	I have no fear of disrepute …
an9.5:5.14	I have no fear about feeling insecure in an assembly …
an9.5:5.15	I have no fear of death …
an9.5:5.16	I have no fear of a bad rebirth.
an9.5:5.17	Why would I be afraid of that?
an9.5:5.18	I have these four powers:
an9.5:5.19	the powers of wisdom, energy, blamelessness, and inclusiveness.
an9.5:5.20	A witless person might be afraid of a bad rebirth.
an9.5:5.21	A lazy person might be afraid of a bad rebirth.
an9.5:5.22	A person who does blameworthy things by way of body, speech, and mind might be afraid of a bad rebirth.
an9.5:5.23	A person who does not include others might be afraid of a bad rebirth.’
an9.5:5.24	A noble disciple who has these four powers has got past these five fears.”

an9.6:2.3	You should distinguish two kinds of robes:
an9.6:2.4	those you should wear, and those you shouldn’t wear.
an9.6:2.5	You should distinguish two kinds of almsfood:
an9.6:2.6	that which you should eat, and that which you shouldn’t eat.

an9.6:3.1	You should distinguish two kinds of people:
an9.6:3.2	those you should associate with, and those you shouldn’t associate with.’
an9.6:3.3	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
an9.6:3.4	Well, should you know of a person:
an9.6:3.5	‘When I associate with this person, unskillful qualities grow, and skillful qualities decline.
an9.6:3.6	And the necessities of life that a renunciate requires—robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—are hard to come by.
an9.6:3.7	And the goal of the ascetic life for which I went forth from the lay life to homelessness is not being fully developed.’ In this case you should leave that person at that very time of the day or night, without asking. You shouldn’t follow them.
an9.6:4.1	Whereas, should you know of a person:
an9.6:4.2	‘When I associate with this person, unskillful qualities grow, and skillful qualities decline.
an9.6:4.3	But the necessities of life that a renunciate requires—robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—are easy to come by.
an9.6:4.4	However, the goal of the ascetic life for which I went forth from the lay life to homelessness is not being fully developed.’ In this case you should leave that person after reflecting, without asking. You shouldn’t follow them.
an9.6:5.1	Well, should you know of a person:
an9.6:5.2	‘When I associate with this person, unskillful qualities decline, and skillful qualities grow.

an9.7:1.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
an9.7:2.1	“Sir, one time the Buddha was staying right here in Rājagaha, the Mountainfold.
an9.7:2.2	There I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
an9.7:2.3	‘A mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—can’t transgress in five respects.
an9.7:2.4	A mendicant with defilements ended can’t deliberately take the life of a living creature, take something with the intention to steal, have sex, tell a deliberate lie, or store up goods for their own enjoyment like they did as a lay person.’
an9.7:2.5	I trust I properly heard, learned, attended, and remembered that from the Buddha?”
an9.7:3.1	“Indeed, Sutavā, you properly heard, learned, attended, and remembered that.
an9.7:3.2	In the past, as today, I say this:

an9.7:3.4	A mendicant with defilements ended can’t deliberately take the life of a living creature, take something with the intention to steal, have sex, tell a deliberate lie, or store up goods for their own enjoyment like they did as a lay person. And they can’t make decisions prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity, or cowardice.’

an9.11:0.3	11. Sāriputta’s Lion’s Roar
an9.11:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an9.11:1.2	Then Venerable Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
an9.11:1.3	“Sir, I have completed the rainy season residence at Sāvatthī.
an9.11:1.4	I wish to depart to wander the countryside.”
an9.11:1.5	“Please, Sāriputta, go at your convenience.”
an9.11:1.6	Then Sāriputta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
an9.11:1.7	And then, not long after Sāriputta had left, a certain monk said to the Buddha,
an9.11:1.8	“Sir, Venerable Sāriputta attacked me and left without saying sorry.”
an9.11:1.9	So the Buddha addressed a certain monk,
an9.11:1.10	“Please, monk, in my name tell Sāriputta that
an9.11:1.11	the teacher summons him.”
an9.11:1.12	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Sāriputta and said to him,
an9.11:1.13	“Reverend Sāriputta, the teacher summons you.”
an9.11:1.14	“Yes, reverend,” Sāriputta replied.
an9.11:2.1	Now at that time the venerables Mahāmoggallāna and Ānanda took a key and went from dwelling to dwelling, saying:
an9.11:2.2	“Come forth, venerables! Come forth, venerables!
an9.11:2.3	Now Venerable Sāriputta will roar his lion’s roar in the presence of the Buddha!”
an9.11:2.4	Then Venerable Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
an9.11:2.5	“Sāriputta, one of your spiritual companions has made this complaint:
an9.11:2.6	‘Venerable Sāriputta attacked me and left without saying sorry.’”
an9.11:3.1	“Sir, someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry.
an9.11:4.1	Suppose they were to toss both clean and unclean things on the earth, like feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The earth isn’t horrified, repelled, and disgusted because of this.
an9.11:4.2	In the same way, I live with a heart like the earth, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
an9.11:4.3	Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry.

an9.11:6.2	In the same way, I live with a heart like fire, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
an9.11:6.3	Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry.
an9.11:7.1	Suppose the wind was to blow on both clean and unclean things, like feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The wind isn’t horrified, repelled, and disgusted because of this.

an9.11:7.3	Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry.
an9.11:8.1	Suppose a rag was to wipe up both clean and unclean things, like feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The rag isn’t horrified, repelled, and disgusted because of this.

an9.11:9.1	Suppose an outcaste boy or girl, holding a pot and clad in rags, were to enter a town or village. They’d enter with a humble mind.

an9.11:9.3	Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry.

an9.11:11.1	Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and had bathed their head. If the corpse of a snake or a dog or a human were hung around their neck, they’d be horrified, repelled, and disgusted.
an9.11:11.2	In the same way, I’m horrified, repelled, and disgusted by this rotten body.

an9.11:13.1	Then that monk rose from his seat, placed his robe over one shoulder, bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said,
an9.11:13.2	“I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to speak ill of Venerable Sāriputta with a false, hollow, lying, untruthful claim.
an9.11:13.3	Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.”
an9.11:13.4	“Indeed, monk, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to act in that way.
an9.11:13.5	But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it.
an9.11:13.6	For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.”
an9.11:14.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta,
an9.11:14.2	“Sāriputta, forgive that silly man before his head explodes into seven pieces right here.”
an9.11:14.3	“I will pardon that venerable if he asks me:

an9.12:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an9.12:1.2	Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
an9.12:1.3	Then it occurred to him,
an9.12:1.4	“It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī.
an9.12:1.5	Why don’t I go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths?”
an9.12:1.6	Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there.
an9.12:1.7	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.
an9.12:2.1	Now at that time while those wanderers who follow other paths were sitting together this discussion came up among them:
an9.12:2.2	“Reverends, no-one who dies with something left over is exempt from hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm. They’re not exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld.”
an9.12:2.3	Sāriputta neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers who follow other paths.
an9.12:2.4	He got up from his seat, thinking,
an9.12:2.5	“I will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.”
an9.12:2.6	Then Sāriputta wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.

an9.12:5.3	There’s a person who has fulfilled ethics and immersion, but has limited wisdom.
an9.12:5.4	With the ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished between one life and the next.

an9.12:6.8	This is the fifth person …
an9.12:7.1	Furthermore, there’s a person who has fulfilled ethics, but has limited immersion and wisdom.
an9.12:7.2	With the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, they’re a once-returner. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.
an9.12:7.3	This is the sixth person …
an9.12:8.1	Furthermore, there’s a person who has fulfilled ethics, but has limited immersion and wisdom.
an9.12:8.2	With the ending of three fetters, they’re a one-seeder. They will be reborn just one time in a human existence, then make an end of suffering.

an9.12:9.1	Furthermore, there’s a person who has fulfilled ethics, but has limited immersion and wisdom.
an9.12:9.2	With the ending of three fetters, they go from family to family. They will transmigrate between two or three families and then make an end of suffering.
an9.12:9.3	This is the eighth person …
an9.12:10.1	Furthermore, there’s a person who has fulfilled ethics, but has limited immersion and wisdom.
an9.12:10.2	With the ending of three fetters, they have at most seven rebirths. They will transmigrate at most seven times among gods and humans and then make an end of suffering.

an9.12:11.3	Up until now, Sāriputta, I have not felt the need to give this exposition of the teaching to the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.
an9.12:11.4	Why is that?
an9.12:11.5	For I didn’t want those who heard it to introduce negligence.

an9.20:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an9.20:1.2	Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,
an9.20:2.1	“Householder, I wonder whether your family gives gifts?”
an9.20:2.2	“It does, sir.
an9.20:2.3	But only coarse gruel with pickles.”
an9.20:2.4	“Householder, someone might give a gift that’s either coarse or fine.
an9.20:2.5	But they give it carelessly, thoughtlessly, not with their own hand. They give the dregs, and they give without consideration for consequences.
an9.20:2.6	Then wherever the result of any such gift manifests, their mind doesn’t incline toward enjoyment of nice food, clothes, vehicles, or the five refined kinds of sensual stimulation.
an9.20:2.7	And their children, wives, bondservants, employees, and workers don’t want to listen to them. They don’t pay attention or try to understand.
an9.20:2.8	Why is that?
an9.20:2.9	Because that is the result of deeds done carelessly.
an9.20:3.1	Someone might give a gift that’s either coarse or fine.
an9.20:3.2	And they give it carefully, thoughtfully, with their own hand. They don’t give the dregs, and they give with consideration for consequences.
an9.20:3.3	Then wherever the result of any such gift manifests, their mind inclines toward enjoyment of nice food, clothes, vehicles, or the five refined kinds of sensual stimulation.
an9.20:3.4	And their children, wives, bondservants, employees, and workers want to listen. They pay attention and try to understand.
an9.20:3.5	Why is that?
an9.20:3.6	Because that is the result of deeds done carefully.
an9.20:4.1	Once upon a time, householder, there was a brahmin named Velāma.
an9.20:4.2	He gave the following gift, a great offering.
an9.20:4.3	84,000 gold bowls filled with silver. 84,000 silver bowls filled with gold. 84,000 bronze bowls filled with gold coins. 84,000 elephants with gold adornments and banners, covered with gold netting. 84,000 chariots upholstered with the hide of lions, tigers, and leopards, and cream rugs, with gold adornments and banners, covered with gold netting. 84,000 milk cows with silken reins and bronze pails. 84,000 maidens bedecked with jeweled earrings. 84,000 couches spread with woolen covers—shag-piled, pure white, or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide, with canopies above and red pillows at both ends. 8,400,000,000 fine cloths of linen, cotton, silk, and wool. And who can say how much food, drink, snacks, meals, refreshments, and beverages? It seemed like an overflowing river.
an9.20:5.1	Householder, you might think:
an9.20:5.2	‘Surely the brahmin Velāma must have been someone else at that time?’
an9.20:5.3	But you should not see it like this.
an9.20:5.4	I myself was the brahmin Velāma at that time.
an9.20:5.5	I gave that gift, a great offering.
an9.20:5.6	But at that event there was no-one worthy of a religious donation, and no-one to purify the religious donation.
an9.20:6.1	It would be more fruitful to feed one person accomplished in view than that great offering of Velāma.

an9.22:4.1	And how is a wild person fast, but not beautiful or well proportioned?
an9.22:4.2	It’s when a mendicant truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.

an9.23:1.3	Craving is a cause of seeking. Seeking is a cause of gaining material possessions. Gaining material possessions is a cause of assessing. Assessing is a cause of desire and lust. Desire and lust is a cause of attachment. Attachment is a cause of ownership. Ownership is a cause of stinginess. Stinginess is a cause of safeguarding. Owing to safeguarding, many bad, unskillful things come to be: taking up the rod and the sword, quarrels, arguments, and fights, accusations, divisive speech, and lies.

an9.24:1.4	This is the first abode of sentient beings.

an9.24:5.2	This is the fifth abode of sentient beings.
an9.24:6.1	There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond perceptions of form. With the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they have been reborn in the dimension of infinite space.
an9.24:6.2	This is the sixth abode of sentient beings.
an9.24:7.1	There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite space. Aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they have been reborn in the dimension of infinite consciousness.
an9.24:7.2	This is the seventh abode of sentient beings.
an9.24:8.1	There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness. Aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they have been reborn in the dimension of nothingness.

an9.27:1.1	Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
an9.27:2.1	“Householder, when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, and has the four factors of stream-entry, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves:
an9.27:2.2	‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’
an9.27:3.1	What are the five dangers and threats they have quelled?
an9.27:3.2	Anyone who kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. Anyone who refrains from killing living creatures creates no dangers and threats either in the present life or in lives to come, and doesn’t experience mental pain and sadness.

Anyone who refrains from using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates no dangers and threats either in the present life or in lives to come, and doesn’t experience mental pain and sadness.
an9.27:4.5	So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
an9.27:5.1	These are the five dangers and threats they have quelled.
an9.27:6.1	What are the four factors of stream-entry that they have?
an9.27:6.2	It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha:
an9.27:6.3	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
an9.27:7.1	They have experiential confidence in the teaching:
an9.27:7.2	‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’
an9.27:8.1	They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha:
an9.27:8.2	‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’
an9.27:9.1	And a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.
an9.27:9.2	These are the four factors of stream-entry that they have.
an9.27:10.1	When a noble disciple has quelled these five dangers and threats, and has these four factors of stream-entry, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves:

an9.33:1.3	Where sensual pleasures cease, and those who have thoroughly ended sensual pleasures meditate, I say: ‘Clearly those venerables are desireless, extinguished, crossed over, and gone beyond in that respect.’

an9.33:1.5	they should be told:
an9.33:1.6	‘Reverend, it’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.

an9.34:0.3	34. Extinguishment is Bliss
an9.34:1.1	At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
an9.34:1.2	There he addressed the mendicants:
an9.34:1.3	“Reverends, extinguishment is bliss!
an9.34:1.4	Extinguishment is bliss!”
an9.34:1.5	When he said this, Venerable Udāyī said to him,
an9.34:1.6	“But Reverend Sāriputta, what’s blissful about it, since nothing is felt?”
an9.34:1.7	“The fact that nothing is felt is precisely what’s blissful about it.
an9.34:1.8	Reverend, there are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.
an9.34:1.9	What five?
an9.34:1.10	Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
an9.34:1.11	Sounds known by the ear …
an9.34:1.12	Smells known by the nose …
an9.34:1.13	Tastes known by the tongue …
an9.34:1.14	Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
an9.34:1.15	These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
an9.34:1.16	The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasure.
an9.34:2.1	First, take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures … enters and remains in the first absorption.
an9.34:2.2	While a mendicant is in such a meditation, should perceptions and attentions accompanied by sensual pleasures beset them, that’s an affliction for them.
an9.34:2.3	Suppose a happy person were to experience pain; that would be an affliction for them.
an9.34:2.4	In the same way, should perceptions and attentions accompanied by sensual pleasures beset them, that’s an affliction for them.
an9.34:2.5	And affliction has been called suffering by the Buddha.
an9.34:2.6	That’s the way to understand how extinguishment is bliss.
an9.34:3.1	Furthermore, take a mendicant who, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, enters and remains in the second absorption.
an9.34:3.2	While a mendicant is in such a meditation, should perceptions and attentions accompanied by placing of the mind and keeping it connected beset them, that’s an affliction for them.

an9.34:3.5	And affliction has been called suffering by the Buddha.

an9.34:5.5	And affliction has been called suffering by the Buddha.
an9.34:5.6	That too is a way to understand how extinguishment is bliss.
an9.34:6.1	Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.
an9.34:6.2	While a mendicant is in such a meditation, should perceptions and attentions accompanied by form beset them, that’s an affliction for them.

an9.34:7.1	Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness.
an9.34:7.2	While a mendicant is in such a meditation, should perceptions and attentions accompanied by the dimension of infinite space beset them, that’s an affliction for them.
an9.34:7.3	Suppose a happy person were to experience pain; that would be an affliction for them.

an9.34:8.1	Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.
an9.34:8.2	While a mendicant is in such a meditation, should perceptions and attentions accompanied by the dimension of infinite consciousness beset them, that’s an affliction for them.

an9.35:1.4	She’d take a step with a fore-hoof; but before it was properly set down, she’d lift up a hind-hoof.
an9.35:1.5	She wouldn’t go somewhere she’d never been before, or eat grass and drink water that she’d never tried before.

an9.35:1.10	In the same way, some foolish, incompetent, unskillful mendicant, lacking common sense, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an9.35:1.11	But they don’t cultivate, develop, and make much of that foundation; they don’t ensure it is properly stabilized.
an9.35:2.1	They think,

That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: “There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.” May I recollect my many past lives, with features and details.’
an9.35:16.2	They’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case.

an9.36:1.1	“Mendicants, I say that the first absorption is a basis for ending the defilements.
an9.36:1.2	The second absorption is also a basis for ending the defilements.
an9.36:1.3	The third absorption is also a basis for ending the defilements.
an9.36:1.4	The fourth absorption is also a basis for ending the defilements.
an9.36:1.5	The dimension of infinite space is also a basis for ending the defilements.
an9.36:1.6	The dimension of infinite consciousness is also a basis for ending the defilements.
an9.36:1.7	The dimension of nothingness is also a basis for ending the defilements.
an9.36:1.8	The dimension of neither perception nor non-perception is also a basis for ending the defilements.

an9.36:2.1	‘The first absorption is a basis for ending the defilements.’
an9.36:2.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
an9.36:2.3	Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption.
an9.36:2.4	They contemplate the phenomena there—included in form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness—as impermanent, as suffering, as diseased, as an abscess, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as falling apart, as empty, as not-self.
an9.36:2.5	They turn their mind away from those things,
an9.36:2.6	and apply it to the deathless:
an9.36:2.7	‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.’
an9.36:2.8	Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.
an9.36:2.9	If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.
an9.36:3.1	It’s like an archer or their apprentice who first practices on a straw man or a clay model. At a later time they become a long-distance shooter, a marksman, who shatters large objects.
an9.36:3.2	In the same way a noble disciple, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, enters and remains in the first absorption.
an9.36:3.3	They contemplate the phenomena there—included in form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness—as impermanent, as suffering, as diseased, as an abscess, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as falling apart, as empty, as not-self.

an9.36:10.1	And so, mendicants, penetration to enlightenment extends as far as attainments with perception.
an9.36:10.2	But the two dimensions that depend on these—
an9.36:10.3	the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, and the cessation of perception and feeling—are properly explained by mendicants who are skilled in these attainments and skilled in emerging from them, after they’ve entered them and emerged from them.”
an9.37:0.1	Numbered Discourses 9
an9.37:0.2	4. The Great Chapter
an9.37:0.3	37. By Ānanda
an9.37:1.1	At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery.
an9.37:1.2	There Ānanda addressed the mendicants:
an9.37:1.3	“Reverends, mendicants!”
an9.37:1.4	“Reverend,” they replied.
an9.37:1.5	Ānanda said this:
an9.37:2.1	“It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing!
an9.37:2.2	How this Blessed One who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, has found an opening in a confined space. It’s in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.
an9.37:2.3	The eye itself is actually present, and so are those sights. Yet one will not experience that sense-field.
an9.37:2.4	The ear itself is actually present, and so are those sounds. Yet one will not experience that sense-field.
an9.37:2.5	The nose itself is actually present, and so are those smells. Yet one will not experience that sense-field.
an9.37:2.6	The tongue itself is actually present, and so are those tastes. Yet one will not experience that sense-field.
an9.37:2.7	The body itself is actually present, and so are those touches. Yet one will not experience that sense-field.”
an9.37:3.1	When he said this, Venerable Udāyī said to Venerable Ānanda:
an9.37:3.2	“Reverend Ānanda, is one who doesn’t experience that sense-field actually percipient or not?”
an9.37:3.3	“Reverend, one who doesn’t experience that sense-field is actually percipient, not non-percipient.”
an9.37:4.1	“But what does one who doesn’t experience that sense-field perceive?”
an9.37:4.2	“It’s when a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.
an9.37:4.3	One who doesn’t experience that sense-field perceives in this way.
an9.37:5.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness.
an9.37:5.2	One who doesn’t experience that sense-field perceives in this way.
an9.37:6.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.
an9.37:6.2	One who doesn’t experience that sense-field perceives in this way.
an9.37:7.1	Reverend, one time I was staying near Sāketa in the deer park in Añjana Wood.
an9.37:7.2	Then the nun Jaṭilagāhikā came up to me, bowed, stood to one side, and said to me:
an9.37:7.3	‘Sir, Ānanda, regarding the immersion that does not lean forward or pull back, and is not held in place by forceful suppression.
an9.37:7.4	Being free, it’s stable. Being stable, it’s content. Being content, one is not anxious.
an9.37:7.5	What did the Buddha say was the fruit of this immersion?’
an9.37:8.1	When she said this, I said to her:
an9.37:8.2	‘Sister, regarding the immersion that does not lean forward or pull back, and is not held in place by forceful suppression.
an9.37:8.3	Being free, it’s stable. Being stable, it’s content. Being content, one is not anxious.
an9.37:8.4	The Buddha said that the fruit of this immersion is enlightenment.’
an9.37:8.5	One who doesn’t experience that sense-field perceives in this way, too.”

an9.38:0.3	38. Brahmin Cosmologists
an9.38:1.1	Then two brahmin cosmologists went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
an9.38:1.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
an9.38:2.1	“Master Gotama, Pūraṇa Kassapa claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus:
an9.38:2.2	‘Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.’
an9.38:2.3	He says:
an9.38:2.4	‘With infinite knowledge I know and see that the world is infinite.’
an9.38:2.5	And the Jain leader Nāṭaputta also claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus:
an9.38:2.6	‘Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.’
an9.38:2.7	He says:
an9.38:2.8	‘With infinite knowledge I know and see that the world is finite.’
an9.38:2.9	These two claim to speak from knowledge, but they directly contradict each other. Which one of them speaks the truth, and which falsehood?”
an9.38:3.1	“Enough, brahmins.
an9.38:3.2	Leave this aside:
an9.38:3.3	‘These two claim to speak from knowledge, but they directly contradict each other. Which one of them speaks the truth, and which falsehood?’
an9.38:3.4	I will teach you the Dhamma.
an9.38:3.5	Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an9.38:3.6	“Yes sir,” those brahmins replied.
an9.38:3.7	The Buddha said this:
an9.38:4.1	“Suppose there were four men standing in the four directions. Each of them was extremely fast, with an extremely mighty stride.
an9.38:4.2	They’re as fast as a light arrow easily shot across the shadow of a palm tree by a well-trained expert archer with a strong bow.
an9.38:4.3	Their stride was such that it spanned from the eastern ocean to the western ocean.
an9.38:4.4	Then the man standing in the east would say:
an9.38:4.5	‘I will reach the end of the world by traveling.’
an9.38:4.6	Though he’d travel for his whole lifespan of a hundred years—pausing only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness—he’d die along the way, never reaching the end of the world.
an9.38:4.7	Then the man standing in the west …
an9.38:4.8	Then the man standing in the north …
an9.38:4.9	Then the man standing in the south would say:
an9.38:4.10	‘I will reach the end of the world by traveling.’
an9.38:4.11	Though he’d travel for his whole lifespan of a hundred years—pausing only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness—he’d die along the way, never reaching the end of the world.
an9.38:4.12	Why is that?
an9.38:4.13	I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by running like this.
an9.38:4.14	But I also say there’s no making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world.
an9.38:5.1	These five kinds of sensual stimulation are called the world in the training of the Noble One.
an9.38:5.2	What five?
an9.38:5.3	Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
an9.38:5.4	Sounds known by the ear …
an9.38:5.5	Smells known by the nose …
an9.38:5.6	Tastes known by the tongue …
an9.38:5.7	Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
an9.38:5.8	These five kinds of sensual stimulation are called the world in the training of the Noble One.
an9.38:6.1	Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an9.38:6.2	This is called a mendicant who, having gone to the end of the world, meditates at the end of the world.
an9.38:6.3	Others say of them:
an9.38:6.4	‘They’re included in the world, and haven’t yet left the world.’
an9.38:6.5	And I also say this:
an9.38:6.6	‘They’re included in the world, and haven’t yet left the world.’
an9.38:7.1	Furthermore, take a mendicant who, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, enters and remains in the second absorption …
an9.38:7.2	third absorption …
an9.38:7.3	fourth absorption.
an9.38:7.4	This is called a mendicant who, having gone to the end of the world, meditates at the end of the world.

an9.38:9.2	the dimension of nothingness …
an9.38:9.3	the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
an9.38:9.4	This is called a mendicant who, having gone to the end of the world, meditates at the end of the world.
an9.38:9.5	Others say of them:
an9.38:9.6	‘They’re included in the world, and haven’t yet left the world.’
an9.38:9.7	And I also say this:
an9.38:9.8	‘They’re included in the world, and haven’t yet left the world.’
an9.38:10.1	Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end.
an9.38:10.2	This is called a mendicant who, having gone to the end of the world, meditates at the end of the world. And they’ve crossed over clinging to the world.”

an9.39:1.2	In that battle the demons won and the gods lost.
an9.39:1.3	Defeated, the gods fled north with the demons in pursuit.
an9.39:1.4	Then the gods thought,
an9.39:1.5	‘The demons are still in pursuit.
an9.39:1.6	Why don’t we engage them in battle a second time?’
an9.39:1.7	And so a second battle was fought between the gods and the demons.
an9.39:1.8	And for a second time the demons won and the gods lost.
an9.39:1.9	Defeated, the gods fled north with the demons in pursuit.
an9.39:2.1	Then the gods thought,
an9.39:2.2	‘The demons are still in pursuit.

an9.39:2.5	And for a third time the demons won and the gods lost.
an9.39:2.6	Defeated and terrified, the gods fled right into the castle of the gods.
an9.39:2.7	When they had entered their castle, they thought,
an9.39:2.8	‘Now we’re in a secure location and the demons can’t do anything to us.’
an9.39:2.9	The demons also thought,
an9.39:2.10	‘Now the gods are in a secure location and we can’t do anything to them.’
an9.39:3.1	Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons.
an9.39:3.2	In that battle the gods won and the demons lost.

an9.39:4.6	Defeated and terrified, the demons fled right into the citadel of the demons.

an9.39:4.9	And the gods also thought,
an9.39:4.10	‘Now the demons are in a secure location and we can’t do anything to them.’

an9.39:5.3	‘Now I’m in a secure location and Māra can’t do anything to me.’
an9.39:5.4	And Māra the Wicked also thinks,
an9.39:5.5	‘Now the mendicant is in a secure location and we can’t do anything to them.’

an9.40:0.3	40. The Simile of the Bull Elephant in the Forest
an9.40:1.1	“Mendicants, when a wild bull elephant is engrossed in the pasture, but other elephants—males, females, younglings, or cubs—got there first and trampled the grass, the wild bull elephant is horrified, repelled, and disgusted by that.
an9.40:1.2	When the wild bull elephant is engrossed in the pasture, but other elephants—males, females, younglings, or cubs—eat the broken branches that he has dragged down, the wild bull elephant is horrified, repelled, and disgusted by that.
an9.40:1.3	When a wild bull elephant has plunged into the pool, but other elephants—males, females, younglings, or cubs—got there first and stirred up the water with their trunks, the wild bull elephant is horrified, repelled, and disgusted by that.
an9.40:1.4	When a wild bull elephant has come out of the pool and the female elephants bump into him, the wild bull elephant is horrified, repelled, and disgusted by that.
an9.40:2.1	At that time the wild bull elephant thinks:
an9.40:2.2	‘These days I live crowded by other males, females, younglings, and cubs.
an9.40:2.3	I eat the grass they’ve trampled, and they eat the broken branches I’ve dragged down. I drink muddy water, and after my bath the female elephants bump into me.
an9.40:2.4	Why don’t I live alone, withdrawn from the herd?’
an9.40:2.5	After some time he lives alone, withdrawn from the herd, and he eats untrampled grass, and other elephants don’t eat the broken branches he has dragged down. He doesn’t drink muddy water, and the female elephants don’t bump into him after his bath.
an9.40:3.1	At that time the wild bull elephant thinks:
an9.40:3.2	‘Formerly I lived crowded by other males, females, younglings, and cubs. I ate the grass they’d trampled, and they ate the broken branches I’d dragged down. I drank muddy water, and after my bath the female elephants bumped into me. Now I live alone, and I’m free of all these things.’ He breaks off a branch and scratches his body, happily relieving his itches.
an9.40:4.1	In the same way, when a mendicant lives crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their ministers, and by teachers of other paths and their disciples, they think:
an9.40:4.2	‘These days I live crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their ministers, and teachers of other paths and their disciples.
an9.40:4.3	Why don’t I live alone, withdrawn from the group?’
an9.40:4.4	They frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.
an9.40:4.5	Gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, they sit down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there.
an9.40:5.1	Giving up desire for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of desire, cleansing the mind of desire.
an9.40:5.2	Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will.
an9.40:5.3	Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind free of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness.
an9.40:5.4	Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.
an9.40:5.5	Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.
an9.40:5.6	They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.
an9.40:5.7	Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an9.40:5.8	They happily relieve their itches.
an9.40:5.9	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption …
an9.40:5.10	third absorption …
an9.40:5.11	fourth absorption.
an9.40:5.12	They happily relieve their itches.
an9.40:6.1	Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space.
an9.40:6.2	They happily relieve their itches.
an9.40:6.3	Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness. …
an9.40:6.4	Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. …
an9.40:6.5	Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. …
an9.40:6.6	Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end.
an9.40:6.7	They happily relieve their itches.”

an9.41:0.3	41. With the Householder Tapussa
an9.41:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Mallas, near the Mallian town named Uruvelakappa.
an9.41:1.2	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Uruvelakappa for alms.
an9.41:1.3	Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Ānanda,
an9.41:1.4	“Ānanda, you stay right here, while I plunge deep into the Great Wood for the day’s meditation.”
an9.41:1.5	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.
an9.41:1.6	Then the Buddha plunged deep into the Great Wood and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation.
an9.41:2.1	The householder Tapussa went up to Venerable Ānanda, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an9.41:3.1	“Sir, Ānanda, we are laypeople who enjoy sensual pleasures. We like sensual pleasures, we love them and take joy in them.
an9.41:3.2	But renunciation seems like an abyss.
an9.41:3.3	I have heard that in this teaching and training there are very young mendicants whose minds are eager for renunciation; they’re confident, settled, and decided about it. They see it as peaceful.
an9.41:3.4	Renunciation is the dividing line between the multitude and the mendicants in this teaching and training.”
an9.41:4.1	“Householder, we should see the Buddha about this matter.
an9.41:4.2	Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this.
an9.41:4.3	As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”
an9.41:5.1	“Yes, sir,” replied Tapussa.
an9.41:5.2	Then Ānanda together with Tapussa went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Ānanda told him what had happened.

an9.41:6.4	NA
an9.41:7.1	“That’s so true, Ānanda! That’s so true!
an9.41:7.2	Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought,
an9.41:7.3	‘Renunciation is good! Seclusion is good!’
an9.41:7.4	But my mind wasn’t eager for renunciation; it wasn’t confident, settled, and decided about it. I didn’t see it as peaceful.
an9.41:7.5	Then I thought,
an9.41:7.6	‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind isn’t eager for renunciation, and not confident, settled, and decided about it? Why don’t I see it as peaceful?’
an9.41:7.7	Then I thought,
an9.41:7.8	‘I haven’t seen the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, and so I haven’t cultivated that. I haven’t realized the benefits of renunciation, and so I haven’t developed that.
an9.41:7.9	That’s why my mind isn’t eager for renunciation, and not confident, settled, and decided about it. And it’s why I don’t see it as peaceful.’
an9.41:7.10	Then I thought,
an9.41:7.11	‘Suppose that, seeing the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, I were to cultivate that. And suppose that, realizing the benefits of renunciation, I were to develop that.
an9.41:7.12	It’s possible that my mind would be eager for renunciation; it would be confident, settled, and decided about it. And I would see it as peaceful.’
an9.41:7.13	And so, after some time, I saw the drawbacks of sensual pleasures and cultivated that, and I realized the benefits of renunciation and developed that.
an9.41:7.14	Then my mind was eager for renunciation; it was confident, settled, and decided about it. I saw it as peaceful.
an9.41:7.15	And so, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an9.41:7.16	While I was in that meditation, perceptions and attentions accompanied by sensual pleasures beset me, and that was an affliction for me.
an9.41:7.17	Suppose a happy person were to experience pain; that would be an affliction for them.
an9.41:7.18	In the same way, when perceptions and attentions accompanied by sensual pleasures beset me, that was an affliction for me.
an9.41:8.1	Then I thought,
an9.41:8.2	‘Why don’t I, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled … enter and remain in the second absorption?’
an9.41:8.3	But my mind wasn’t eager to stop placing the mind; it wasn’t confident, settled, and decided about it. I didn’t see it as peaceful.
an9.41:8.4	Then I thought,
an9.41:8.5	‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind isn’t eager to stop placing the mind, and not confident, settled, and decided about it? Why don’t I see it as peaceful?’
an9.41:8.6	Then I thought,
an9.41:8.7	‘I haven’t seen the drawbacks of placing the mind, and so I haven’t cultivated that. I haven’t realized the benefits of not placing the mind, and so I haven’t developed that.
an9.41:8.8	That’s why my mind isn’t eager to stop placing the mind, and not confident, settled, and decided about it. And it’s why I don’t see it as peaceful.’
an9.41:8.9	Then I thought,
an9.41:8.10	‘Suppose that, seeing the drawbacks of placing the mind, I were to cultivate that. And suppose that, realizing the benefits of not placing the mind, I were to develop that. It’s possible that my mind would be eager to stop placing the mind; it would be confident, settled, and decided about it. And I would see it as peaceful.’
an9.41:8.11	And so, after some time, I saw the drawbacks of placing the mind and cultivated that, and I realized the benefits of not placing the mind and developed that.
an9.41:8.12	Then my mind was eager to stop placing the mind; it was confident, settled, and decided about it. I saw it as peaceful.
an9.41:8.13	And so, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled … I was entering and remaining in the second absorption.
an9.41:8.14	While I was in that meditation, perceptions and attentions accompanied by placing the mind beset me, and that was an affliction for me.
an9.41:8.15	Suppose a happy person were to experience pain; that would be an affliction for them.
an9.41:8.16	In the same way, when perceptions and attentions accompanied by placing the mind and keeping it connected beset me, that was an affliction for me.
an9.41:9.1	Then I thought,
an9.41:9.2	‘Why don’t I, with the fading away of rapture, enter and remain in the third absorption, where I will meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, “Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss”?’
an9.41:9.3	But my mind wasn’t eager for freedom from rapture; it wasn’t confident, settled, and decided about it. I didn’t see it as peaceful.
an9.41:9.4	Then I thought,
an9.41:9.5	‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind isn’t eager for freedom from rapture, and not confident, settled, and decided about it? Why don’t I see it as peaceful?’
an9.41:9.6	Then I thought,
an9.41:9.7	‘I haven’t seen the drawbacks of rapture, and so I haven’t cultivated that. I haven’t realized the benefits of freedom from rapture, and so I haven’t developed that.
an9.41:9.8	That’s why my mind isn’t eager for freedom from rapture, and not confident, settled, and decided about it. And it’s why I don’t see it as peaceful.’
an9.41:9.9	Then I thought,
an9.41:9.10	‘Suppose that, seeing the drawbacks of rapture, I were to cultivate that. And suppose that, realizing the benefits of freedom from rapture, I were to develop that. It’s possible that my mind would be eager to be free from rapture; it would be confident, settled, and decided about it. And I would see it as peaceful.’
an9.41:9.11	And so, after some time, I saw the drawbacks of rapture and cultivated that, and I realized the benefits of freedom from rapture and developed that.
an9.41:9.12	Then my mind was eager for freedom from rapture; it was confident, settled, and decided about it. I saw it as peaceful.
an9.41:9.13	And so, with the fading away of rapture … I was entering and remaining in the third absorption.

an9.41:9.15	Suppose a happy person were to experience pain; that would be an affliction for them.
an9.41:9.16	In the same way, when perceptions and attentions accompanied by rapture beset me, that was an affliction for me.
an9.41:10.1	Then I thought,
an9.41:10.2	‘Why don’t I, with the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness?’
an9.41:10.3	But my mind wasn’t eager to be without pleasure and pain; it wasn’t confident, settled, and decided about it. I didn’t see it as peaceful.
an9.41:10.4	Then I thought,
an9.41:10.5	‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind isn’t eager to be without pleasure and pain, and not confident, settled, and decided about it? Why don’t I see it as peaceful?’
an9.41:10.6	Then I thought,
an9.41:10.7	‘I haven’t seen the drawbacks of equanimous bliss, and so I haven’t cultivated that. I haven’t realized the benefits of being without pleasure and pain, and so I haven’t developed that.
an9.41:10.8	That’s why my mind isn’t eager to be without pleasure and pain, and not confident, settled, and decided about it. And it’s why I don’t see it as peaceful.’

It’s possible that my mind would be eager to be without pleasure and pain; it would be confident, settled, and decided about it. And I would see it as peaceful.’
an9.41:10.11	And so, after some time, I saw the drawbacks of equanimous bliss and cultivated that, and I realized the benefits of being without pleasure and pain and developed that.
an9.41:10.12	Then my mind was eager to be without pleasure and pain; it was confident, settled, and decided about it. I saw it as peaceful.
an9.41:10.13	And so, giving up pleasure and pain … I was entering and remaining in the fourth absorption.

an10.1:0.3	1. What’s the Purpose?
an10.1:1.1	So I have heard.
an10.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an10.1:1.3	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an10.1:2.1	“Sir, what is the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics?”
an10.1:2.2	“Ānanda, having no regrets is the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics.”
an10.1:3.1	“But what’s the purpose and benefit of having no regrets?”
an10.1:3.2	“Joy is the purpose and benefit of having no regrets.”
an10.1:4.1	“But what’s the purpose and benefit of joy?”

an10.1:10.2	“Knowledge and vision of freedom is the purpose and benefit of disillusionment and dispassion.

an10.1:11.2	Joy is the purpose and benefit of not having regrets.
an10.1:11.3	Rapture is the purpose and benefit of joy.
an10.1:11.4	Tranquility is the purpose and benefit of rapture.

an10.2:1.1	“Mendicants, an ethical person, who has fulfilled ethical conduct, need not make a wish:
an10.2:1.2	‘May I have no regrets!’
an10.2:1.3	It’s only natural that an ethical person has no regrets.
an10.2:1.4	When you have no regrets you need not make a wish:
an10.2:1.5	‘May I feel joy!’
an10.2:1.6	It’s only natural that joy springs up when you have no regrets.
an10.2:1.7	When you feel joy you need not make a wish:
an10.2:1.8	‘May I experience rapture!’
an10.2:1.9	It’s only natural that rapture arises when you’re joyful.
an10.2:1.10	When your mind is full of rapture you need not make a wish:
an10.2:1.11	‘May my body become tranquil!’
an10.2:1.12	It’s only natural that your body becomes tranquil when your mind is full of rapture.
an10.2:1.13	When your body is tranquil you need not make a wish:
an10.2:1.14	‘May I feel bliss!’
an10.2:1.15	It’s only natural to feel bliss when your body is tranquil.
an10.2:1.16	When you feel bliss you need not make a wish:
an10.2:1.17	‘May my mind be immersed in samādhi!’
an10.2:1.18	It’s only natural for the mind to be immersed in samādhi when you feel bliss.
an10.2:1.19	When your mind is immersed in samādhi you need not make a wish:
an10.2:1.20	‘May I truly know and see!’
an10.2:1.21	It’s only natural to truly know and see when your mind is immersed in samādhi.
an10.2:1.22	When you truly know and see you need not make a wish:
an10.2:1.23	‘May I become disillusioned and dispassionate!’
an10.2:1.24	It’s only natural to become disillusioned and dispassionate when you truly know and see.
an10.2:1.25	When you’re disillusioned and dispassionate you need not make a wish:
an10.2:1.26	‘May I realize the knowledge and vision of freedom!’
an10.2:1.27	It’s only natural to realize the knowledge and vision of freedom when you’re disillusioned and dispassionate.
an10.2:2.1	And so, mendicants, the knowledge and vision of freedom is the purpose and benefit of disillusionment and dispassion.
an10.2:2.2	Disillusionment and dispassion is the purpose and benefit of truly knowing and seeing.
an10.2:2.3	Truly knowing and seeing is the purpose and benefit of immersion.
an10.2:2.4	Immersion is the purpose and benefit of bliss.
an10.2:2.5	Bliss is the purpose and benefit of tranquility.
an10.2:2.6	Tranquility is the purpose and benefit of rapture.
an10.2:2.7	Rapture is the purpose and benefit of joy.
an10.2:2.8	Joy is the purpose and benefit of not having regrets.
an10.2:2.9	Not having regrets is the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics.
an10.2:2.10	And so, mendicants, good qualities flow on and fill up from one to the other, for going from the near shore to the far shore.”

an10.18:1.1	So I have heard.
an10.18:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an10.18:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
an10.18:1.4	“Mendicants!”
an10.18:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.
an10.18:1.6	The Buddha said this:
an10.18:2.1	“Mendicants, you should live with a protector, not without one.
an10.18:2.2	Living without a protector is suffering.
an10.18:2.3	There are ten qualities that serve as protector.
an10.18:2.4	What ten?
an10.18:2.5	Firstly, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the code of conduct, with good behavior and supporters. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
an10.18:2.6	Knowing this, the mendicants—whether senior, middle, or junior—think that mendicant is worth advising and instructing.
an10.18:2.7	Being treated with such kindness by the senior, middle, and junior mendicants, that mendicant can expect only growth, not decline.
an10.18:2.8	This is a quality that serves as protector.
an10.18:3.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.

an10.20:0.3	20. Abodes of the Noble Ones (2nd)
an10.20:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma.
an10.20:1.2	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
an10.20:2.1	“There are these ten noble abodes in which the noble ones of the past, present, and future abide.
an10.20:2.2	What ten?
an10.20:2.3	A mendicant has given up five factors, possesses six factors, has a single guard, has four supports, has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth, has totally given up searching, has unsullied intentions, has stilled the physical process, and is well freed in mind and well freed by wisdom.
an10.20:3.1	And how has a mendicant given up five factors?
an10.20:3.2	It’s when a mendicant has given up sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt.
an10.20:3.3	That’s how a mendicant has given up five factors.
an10.20:4.1	And how does a mendicant possess six factors?
an10.20:4.2	It’s when a mendicant, seeing a sight with their eyes, is neither happy nor sad. They remain equanimous, mindful and aware.
an10.20:4.3	Hearing a sound with their ears …
an10.20:4.4	Smelling an odor with their nose …
an10.20:4.5	Tasting a flavor with their tongue …
an10.20:4.6	Feeling a touch with their body …
an10.20:4.7	Knowing a thought with their mind, they’re neither happy nor sad. They remain equanimous, mindful and aware.
an10.20:4.8	That’s how a mendicant possesses six factors.
an10.20:5.1	And how does a mendicant have a single guard?
an10.20:5.2	It’s when a mendicant’s heart is guarded by mindfulness.
an10.20:5.3	That’s how a mendicant has a single guard.
an10.20:6.1	And how does a mendicant have four supports?
an10.20:6.2	After appraisal, a mendicant uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things.
an10.20:6.3	That’s how a mendicant has four supports.
an10.20:7.1	And how has a mendicant eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth?
an10.20:7.2	Different ascetics and brahmins have different idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth. For example:
an10.20:7.3	the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.
an10.20:7.4	A mendicant has dispelled, eliminated, thrown out, rejected, let go of, given up, and relinquished all these.
an10.20:7.5	That’s how a mendicant has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth.
an10.20:8.1	And how has a mendicant totally given up searching?
an10.20:8.2	It’s when they’ve given up searching for sensual pleasures, for continued existence, and for a spiritual life.
an10.20:8.3	That’s how a mendicant has totally given up searching.
an10.20:9.1	And how does a mendicant have unsullied intentions?
an10.20:9.2	It’s when a mendicant has given up intentions of sensuality, malice, and cruelty.
an10.20:9.3	That’s how a mendicant has unsullied intentions.
an10.20:10.1	And how has a mendicant stilled the physical process?
an10.20:10.2	It’s when, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
an10.20:10.3	That’s how a mendicant has stilled the physical process.
an10.20:11.1	And how is a mendicant well freed in mind?
an10.20:11.2	It’s when a mendicant’s mind is freed from greed, hate, and delusion.
an10.20:11.3	That’s how a mendicant is well freed in mind.
an10.20:12.1	And how is a mendicant well freed by wisdom?
an10.20:12.2	It’s when a mendicant understands: ‘I’ve given up greed, hate, and delusion, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so they’re unable to arise in the future.’
an10.20:12.3	That’s how a mendicant’s mind is well freed by wisdom.
an10.20:13.1	Mendicants, whether in the past, future, or present, all the noble ones of noble abodes abide in these same ten noble abodes.

an10.21:0.3	21. The Lion’s Roar
an10.21:1.1	“Mendicants, towards evening the lion, king of beasts, emerges from his den,
an10.21:1.2	yawns,
an10.21:1.3	looks all around the four directions,
an10.21:1.4	and roars his lion’s roar three times.
an10.21:1.5	Then he sets out on the hunt.
an10.21:1.6	Why is that?
an10.21:1.7	Thinking: ‘May I not accidentally injure any little creatures that happen to be in the wrong place.’
an10.21:2.1	‘Lion’ is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.
an10.21:2.2	When the Realized One teaches Dhamma to an assembly, this is his lion’s roar.
an10.21:3.1	The Realized One possesses ten powers of a Realized One. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.
an10.21:3.2	What ten?
an10.21:3.3	Firstly, the Realized One truly understands the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible.
an10.21:3.4	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.
an10.21:4.1	Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of causes and reasons.
an10.21:4.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
an10.21:5.1	Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands where all paths of practice lead.
an10.21:5.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
an10.21:6.1	Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the world with its many and diverse elements.
an10.21:6.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
an10.21:7.1	Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the diverse attitudes of sentient beings.
an10.21:7.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
an10.21:8.1	Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the faculties of other sentient beings and other individuals after comprehending them with his mind.
an10.21:8.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
an10.21:9.1	Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments.
an10.21:9.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
an10.21:10.1	Furthermore, the Realized One recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. He remembers: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ Thus he recollects his many past lives, with features and details.
an10.21:10.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
an10.21:11.1	Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Realized One sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, he sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
an10.21:11.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
an10.21:12.1	Furthermore, the Realized One has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.
an10.21:12.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
an10.21:13.1	These are the ten powers of a Realized One that the Realized One possesses. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.”

an10.22:0.3	22. Hypotheses
an10.22:1.1	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
an10.22:2.1	“Ānanda, I claim to be assured regarding the teachings that lead to realizing by insight the various different hypotheses.
an10.22:2.2	So I am able to teach the Dhamma in appropriate ways to different people. Practicing accordingly, when something exists they’ll know it exists. When it doesn’t exist they’ll know it doesn’t exist. When something is inferior they’ll know it’s inferior. When it’s superior they’ll know it’s superior. When something is not supreme they’ll know it’s not supreme. When it is supreme they’ll know it’s supreme.
an10.22:2.3	And they will know or see or realize it in whatever way it should be known or seen or realized. This is possible.
an10.22:2.4	But this is the unsurpassable knowledge, that is: truly knowing each and every case.
an10.22:2.5	And Ānanda, I say that there is no other knowledge better or finer than this.
an10.22:3.1	The Realized One possesses ten powers of a Realized One. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.

an10.23:6.3	It’s when a faithless person wishes to be known as faithful.
an10.23:6.4	An unethical person wishes to be known as ethical.
an10.23:6.5	An uneducated person wishes to be known as learned.
an10.23:6.6	A lover of company wishes to be known as secluded.

an10.24:1.1	At one time Venerable Mahācunda was staying in the land of the Cetis at Sahajāti.
an10.24:1.2	There he addressed the mendicants:
an10.24:1.3	“Reverends, mendicants!”
an10.24:1.4	“Reverend,” they replied.
an10.24:1.5	Venerable Mahācunda said this:

an10.26:1.1	At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying in the land of the Avantis near Kuraraghara on Steep Mountain.
an10.26:1.2	Then the laywoman Kāḷī of Kurughara went up to Venerable Mahākaccāna, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
an10.26:1.3	“Sir, this was said by the Buddha in ‘The Maidens’ Questions’:
an10.26:2.1	‘I’ve reached the goal, peace of heart.
an10.26:2.2	Having conquered the army of the likable and pleasant,
an10.26:2.3	alone, practicing absorption, I awakened to bliss.
an10.26:2.4	That’s why I don’t get too close to people,
an10.26:2.5	and no-one gets too close to me.’
an10.26:3.1	How should we see the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement?”
an10.26:4.1	“Sister, some ascetics and brahmins regard the attainment of the meditation on universal earth to be the ultimate. Thinking ‘this is the goal’, they are reborn.
an10.26:4.2	The Buddha directly knew the extent to which the attainment of the meditation on universal earth was the ultimate.
an10.26:4.3	Directly knowing this he saw the beginning, the drawback, and the escape. And he saw the knowledge and vision of the variety of paths.
an10.26:4.4	Because he saw the beginning, the drawback, and the escape, and he saw the knowledge and vision of the variety of paths, he knew that he had reached the goal, peace of heart.
an10.26:5.1	Some ascetics and brahmins regard the attainment of the meditation on universal water to be the ultimate. Thinking ‘this is the goal’, they are reborn. …
an10.26:5.2	Some ascetics and brahmins regard the attainment of the meditation on universal fire …

an10.26:5.8	universal space …
an10.26:5.9	universal consciousness to be the ultimate. Thinking ‘this is the goal’, they are reborn.
an10.26:5.10	The Buddha directly knew the extent to which the attainment of the meditation on universal consciousness was the ultimate.
an10.26:5.11	Directly knowing this he saw the beginning, the drawback, and the escape. And he saw the knowledge and vision of the variety of paths.
an10.26:5.12	Because he saw the beginning, the drawback, and the escape, and he saw the knowledge and vision of the variety of paths, he knew that he had reached the goal, peace of heart.
an10.26:5.13	So, sister, that’s how to understand the detailed meaning of what the Buddha said in brief in ‘The Maiden’s Questions’:
an10.26:6.1	‘I’ve reached the goal, peace of heart.
an10.26:6.2	Having conquered the army of the likable and pleasant,
an10.26:6.3	alone, practicing absorption, I awakened to bliss.
an10.26:6.4	That’s why I don’t get too close to people,

an10.27:0.3	27. The Great Questions (1st)
an10.27:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an10.27:1.2	Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
an10.27:1.3	Then it occurred to him,
an10.27:1.4	“It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī.
an10.27:1.5	Why don’t we go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths?”
an10.27:2.1	Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there.
an10.27:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them:
an10.27:3.1	“Reverends, the ascetic Gotama teaches his disciples like this:
an10.27:3.2	‘Please, mendicants, directly know all things. Meditate having directly known all things.’
an10.27:3.3	We too teach our disciples:
an10.27:3.4	‘Please, reverends, directly know all things. Live having directly known all things.’
an10.27:3.5	What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?”
an10.27:4.1	Those mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers who follow other paths.
an10.27:4.2	They got up from their seat, thinking,
an10.27:4.3	“We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.”
an10.27:5.1	Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.

an10.27:9.3	Questioned like this, the wanderers who follow other paths would be stumped, and, in addition, would get frustrated.
an10.27:9.4	Why is that?
an10.27:9.5	Because they’re out of their element.
an10.27:9.6	I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them.

an10.28:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kajaṅgalā in a bamboo grove.
an10.28:1.2	Then several lay followers of Kajaṅgalā went to the nun Kajaṅgalikā, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to her:
an10.28:2.1	“Ma’am, this was said by the Buddha in ‘The Great Questions’:
an10.28:2.2	‘One thing: question, passage for recitation, and answer. Two … three … four … five … six … seven … eight … nine … ten things: question, passage for recitation, and answer.’
an10.28:2.3	How should we see the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement?”
an10.28:3.1	“Good people, I haven’t heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha or from esteemed mendicants.
an10.28:3.2	But as to how it seems to me,
an10.28:3.3	listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an10.28:3.4	“Yes, ma’am,” replied the lay followers.
an10.28:3.5	The nun Kajaṅgalikā said this:
an10.28:4.1	“‘One thing: question, passage for recitation, and answer.’ That’s what the Buddha said,

an10.28:4.5	‘All sentient beings are sustained by food.’
an10.28:4.6	Becoming completely disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding this one thing, seeing its limits and fully comprehending its meaning, a mendicant makes an end of suffering in this very life.

an10.28:10.7	and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed.

an10.29:3.1	There comes a time when this cosmos contracts.
an10.29:3.2	As it contracts, most sentient beings migrate to the realm of streaming radiance.
an10.29:3.3	There they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time.
an10.29:3.4	When the cosmos is contracting, the gods of streaming radiance are said to be the foremost.

an10.29:4.13	These are the ten universal dimensions of meditation.
an10.29:5.1	The best of these ten universal dimensions of meditation is when someone perceives the meditation on universal consciousness above, below, across, non-dual and limitless.

an10.29:10.1	Not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally, blue, with blue color, blue hue, and blue tint.
an10.29:10.2	They’re like a flax flower that’s blue, with blue color, blue hue, and blue tint. Or a cloth from Bāraṇasī that’s smoothed on both sides, blue, with blue color, blue hue, and blue tint.
an10.29:10.3	In the same way, not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally, blue, with blue color, blue hue, and blue tint.

an10.29:14.6	Their desire fades away even for the foremost, let alone the inferior.
an10.29:15.1	There are four ways of practice.
an10.29:15.2	What four?
an10.29:15.3	Painful practice with slow insight,
an10.29:15.4	painful practice with swift insight,
an10.29:15.5	pleasant practice with slow insight, and
an10.29:15.6	pleasant practice with swift insight.
an10.29:15.7	These are the four ways of practice.
an10.29:16.1	The best of these four ways of practice is the pleasant practice with swift insight.
an10.29:16.2	Some sentient beings practice like this.
an10.29:16.3	But even the sentient beings who practice like this decay and perish.
an10.29:16.4	Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with it.
an10.29:16.5	Their desire fades away even for the foremost, let alone the inferior.
an10.29:17.1	There are these four perceptions.

an10.29:17.5	One person perceives the limitless.
an10.29:17.6	One person, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, perceives the dimension of nothingness.
an10.29:17.7	These are the four perceptions.
an10.29:18.1	The best of these four perceptions is when a person, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, perceives the dimension of nothingness.
an10.29:18.2	Some sentient beings perceive like this.
an10.29:18.3	But even the sentient beings who perceive like this decay and perish.
an10.29:18.4	Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with it.
an10.29:18.5	Their desire fades away even for the foremost, let alone the inferior.
an10.29:19.1	This is the best of the convictions of outsiders, that is: ‘I might not be, and it might not be mine. I will not be, and it will not be mine.’
an10.29:19.2	When someone has such a view, you can expect
an10.29:19.3	that they will be repulsed by continued existence,
an10.29:19.4	and they will not be repulsed by the cessation of continued existence.
an10.29:19.5	Some sentient beings have such a view.
an10.29:19.6	But even the sentient beings who have views like this decay and perish.
an10.29:19.7	Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with it.
an10.29:19.8	Their desire fades away even for the foremost, let alone the inferior.
an10.29:20.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who advocate ultimate purity of the spirit.
an10.29:20.2	This is the best of the advocates of ultimate purity of the spirit, that is, when someone, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
an10.29:20.3	They teach Dhamma in order to directly know and realize this.
an10.29:20.4	Some sentient beings have such a doctrine.
an10.29:20.5	But even the sentient beings who have such a doctrine decay and perish.
an10.29:20.6	Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with it.
an10.29:20.7	Their desire fades away even for the foremost, let alone the inferior.
an10.29:21.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who advocate ultimate extinguishment in this very life.
an10.29:21.2	This is the best of those who advocate extinguishment in this very life, that is, liberation by not grasping after truly understanding the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of the six fields of contact.
an10.29:21.3	Though I speak and explain like this, certain ascetics and brahmins misrepresent me with the false, hollow, lying, untruthful claim:
an10.29:21.4	‘The ascetic Gotama doesn’t advocate the complete understanding of sensual pleasures, sights, or feelings.’
an10.29:21.5	But I do advocate the complete understanding of sensual pleasures, sights, and feelings. And I advocate complete extinguishment by not grasping in this very life, wishless, extinguished, and cooled.”

an10.30:0.3	30. Kosala (2nd)
an10.30:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an10.30:1.2	Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala returned from combat after winning a battle and succeeding in his objective.
an10.30:1.3	Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went to the monastery.
an10.30:1.4	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot.
an10.30:1.5	At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air.
an10.30:1.6	Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to them and said,
an10.30:1.7	“Sirs, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?
an10.30:1.8	For I want to see the Buddha.”
an10.30:1.9	“Great king, that’s his dwelling, with the door closed. Approach it quietly, without hurrying; go onto the porch, clear your throat, and knock with the latch. The Buddha will open the door.”
an10.30:2.1	So the king approached the Buddha’s dwelling and knocked, and the Buddha opened the door.
an10.30:2.2	Then King Pasenadi entered the Buddha’s dwelling. He bowed with his head to the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name:
an10.30:2.3	“Sir, I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!
an10.30:2.4	I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!”
an10.30:3.1	“But great king, for what reason do you demonstrate such utmost devotion for this body, conveying your manifest love?”
an10.30:3.2	“Sir, it’s because of my gratitude and thanks for the Buddha that I demonstrate such utmost devotion, conveying my manifest love.
an10.30:4.1	The Buddha is practicing for the welfare and happiness of the people. He has established many people in the noble method, that is, the principles of goodness and skillfulness.
an10.30:4.2	This is a reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.
an10.30:5.1	Furthermore, the Buddha is ethical, possessing ethical conduct that is mature, noble, and skillful.
an10.30:5.2	This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.
an10.30:6.1	Furthermore, the Buddha lives in the wilderness, frequenting remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.
an10.30:6.2	This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.
an10.30:7.1	Furthermore, the Buddha is content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.
an10.30:7.2	This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.
an10.30:8.1	Furthermore, the Buddha is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.
an10.30:8.2	This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.
an10.30:9.1	Furthermore, the Buddha gets to take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart, when he wants, without trouble or difficulty. That is, talk about fewness of wishes, contentment, seclusion, aloofness, arousing energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom.
an10.30:9.2	This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.
an10.30:10.1	Furthermore, the Buddha gets the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when he wants, without trouble or difficulty.
an10.30:10.2	This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.
an10.30:11.1	Furthermore, the Buddha recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. He remembers: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so he recollects his many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
an10.30:11.2	This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.
an10.30:12.1	Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
an10.30:12.2	This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.
an10.30:13.1	Furthermore, the Buddha has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.
an10.30:13.2	This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.
an10.30:14.1	Well, now, sir, I must go.
an10.30:14.2	I have many duties, and much to do.”

an10.30:14.4	Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.

an10.31:2.1	“Upāli, the Realized One laid down training rules for his disciples and recited the monastic code for ten reasons.
an10.31:2.2	What ten?
an10.31:2.3	For the well-being of the Saṅgha and for the comfort of the Saṅgha. For keeping difficult persons in check and for the comfort of good-hearted mendicants. For restraining defilements that affect the present life and protecting against defilements that affect lives to come. For inspiring confidence in those without it, and increasing confidence in those who have it. For the continuation of the true teaching and the support of the training.

an10.32:1.2	“Upāli, there are ten grounds to suspend the recitation of the monastic code.
an10.32:1.3	What ten?
an10.32:1.4	A mendicant who has committed an expulsion offense is sitting in the assembly. A discussion about whether someone has committed an expulsion offense is unfinished. A person who is not fully ordained is sitting in the assembly. A discussion about whether someone is fully ordained or not is unfinished. Someone who has resigned the training is sitting in the assembly. A discussion about whether someone has rejected the training or not is unfinished. A eunuch is sitting in the assembly. A discussion about whether someone is a eunuch is unfinished. A raper of nuns is sitting in the assembly. A discussion about whether or not someone is a raper of nuns is unfinished.

an10.33:1.3	What ten?
an10.33:1.4	It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
an10.33:1.5	They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.

an10.45:0.3	45. Entering a Royal Harem
an10.45:1.1	“Mendicants, there are ten drawbacks to entering a royal harem.
an10.45:1.2	What ten?
an10.45:1.3	Firstly, a king is sitting with his chief queen
an10.45:1.4	when a monk enters.
an10.45:1.5	When the queen sees the monk she smiles, or when the monk sees the queen he smiles.
an10.45:1.6	So the king thinks:
an10.45:1.7	‘They’ve done it for sure, or they will do it.’
an10.45:1.8	This is the first drawback of entering a royal harem.
an10.45:2.1	Furthermore, a king has many duties, and much to do. He has sex with one of the women but doesn’t remember.
an10.45:2.2	She gets pregnant from that.
an10.45:2.3	So the king thinks:
an10.45:2.4	‘No-one else has entered here, except for that monk.
an10.45:2.5	Could this be the monk’s doing?’
an10.45:2.6	This is the second drawback of entering a royal harem.
an10.45:3.1	Furthermore, a gem is lost somewhere in the royal harem.
an10.45:3.2	So the king thinks:
an10.45:3.3	‘No-one else has entered here, except for that monk.
an10.45:3.4	Could this be the monk’s doing?’
an10.45:3.5	This is the third drawback of entering a royal harem.
an10.45:4.1	Furthermore, secret deliberations in the royal harem are leaked outside.
an10.45:4.2	So the king thinks:
an10.45:4.3	‘No-one else has entered here, except for that monk.
an10.45:4.4	Could this be the monk’s doing?’
an10.45:4.5	This is the fourth drawback of entering a royal harem.
an10.45:5.1	Furthermore, in a royal harem, a father longs for their son, or a son longs for his father.
an10.45:5.2	They think:
an10.45:5.3	‘No-one else has entered here, except for that monk.
an10.45:5.4	Could this be the monk’s doing?’
an10.45:5.5	This is the fifth drawback of entering a royal harem.
an10.45:6.1	Furthermore, the king promotes someone to a higher position.
an10.45:6.2	Those who are upset by this think:
an10.45:6.3	‘The king is close to that monk.
an10.45:6.4	Could this be the monk’s doing?’

an10.55:0.3	55. Decline
an10.55:1.1	There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:
an10.55:1.2	“Reverends, mendicants!”
an10.55:1.3	“Reverend,” they replied.
an10.55:1.4	Sāriputta said this:
an10.55:2.1	“Reverends, they speak of a person liable to decline,
an10.55:2.2	and one not liable to decline.
an10.55:2.3	But how did the Buddha define a person liable to decline, and one not liable to decline?”
an10.55:2.4	“Reverend, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta.
an10.55:2.5	May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this.
an10.55:2.6	The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
an10.55:3.1	“Then listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an10.55:3.2	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.
an10.55:3.3	Sāriputta said this:
an10.55:4.1	“How did the Buddha define a person liable to decline?
an10.55:4.2	It’s when a mendicant doesn’t get to hear a teaching they haven’t heard before. They forget those teachings they have heard. They don’t keep rehearsing the teachings they’ve already got to know. And they don’t come to understand what they haven’t understood before.
an10.55:4.3	That’s how the Buddha defined a person liable to decline.
an10.55:5.1	And how did the Buddha define a person not liable to decline?
an10.55:5.2	It’s when a mendicant gets to hear a teaching they haven’t heard before. They remember those teachings they have heard. They keep rehearsing the teachings they’ve already got to know. And they come to understand what they haven’t understood before.
an10.55:5.3	That’s how the Buddha defined a person not liable to decline.
an10.55:6.1	If a mendicant isn’t skilled in the ways of another’s mind, then they should train themselves: ‘I will be skilled in the ways of my own mind.’
an10.55:6.2	NA
an10.55:7.1	And how is a mendicant skilled in the ways of their own mind?
an10.55:7.2	Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water. If they see any dirt or blemish there, they’d try to remove it.
an10.55:7.3	But if they don’t see any dirt or blemish there, they’re happy with that, as they’ve got all they wished for:
an10.55:7.4	‘How fortunate that I’m clean!’
an10.55:7.5	In the same way, checking is very helpful for a mendicant’s skillful qualities.
an10.55:7.6	‘Is contentment often found in me or not? Is kind-heartedness often found in me or not? Is freedom from dullness and drowsiness often found in me or not? Is calm often found in me or not? Is confidence often found in me or not? Is love often found in me or not? Is purity of mind often found in me or not? Is internal joy with the teaching found in me or not? Is internal serenity of heart found in me or not? Is the higher wisdom of discernment of principles found in me or not?’
an10.55:8.1	Suppose a mendicant, while checking, doesn’t see any of these skillful qualities in themselves. In order to get them they should apply outstanding enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness.
an10.55:8.2	Suppose your clothes or head were on fire. In order to extinguish it, you’d apply outstanding enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness.

an10.60:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an10.60:1.2	Now at that time Venerable Girimānanda was sick, suffering, gravely ill.
an10.60:1.3	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an10.60:2.1	“Sir, Venerable Girimānanda is sick, suffering, gravely ill.
an10.60:2.2	Sir, please go to Venerable Girimānanda out of compassion.”
an10.60:2.3	“Ānanda, if you were to recite to the mendicant Girimānanda these ten perceptions, it’s possible that after hearing them his illness will die down on the spot.
an10.60:3.1	What ten?
an10.60:3.2	The perceptions of impermanence, not-self, ugliness, drawbacks, giving up, fading away, cessation, dissatisfaction with the whole world, impermanence of all conditions, and mindfulness of breathing.
an10.60:4.1	And what is the perception of impermanence?
an10.60:4.2	It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this:
an10.60:4.3	‘Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent.’
an10.60:4.4	And so they meditate observing impermanence in the five grasping aggregates.
an10.60:4.5	This is called the perception of impermanence.
an10.60:5.1	And what is the perception of not-self?
an10.60:5.2	It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this:
an10.60:5.3	‘The eye and sights, ear and sounds, nose and smells, tongue and tastes, body and touches, and mind and thoughts are not-self.’
an10.60:5.4	And so they meditate observing not-self in the six interior and exterior sense fields.
an10.60:5.5	This is called the perception of not-self.
an10.60:6.1	And what is the perception of ugliness?
an10.60:6.2	It’s when a mendicant examines their own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth.
an10.60:6.3	‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’
an10.60:6.4	And so they meditate observing ugliness in this body.
an10.60:6.5	This is called the perception of ugliness.
an10.60:7.1	And what is the perception of drawbacks?
an10.60:7.2	It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this:
an10.60:7.3	‘This body has much suffering and many drawbacks. For this body is beset with many kinds of affliction, such as the following.
an10.60:7.4	Diseases of the eye, inner ear, nose, tongue, body, head, outer ear, mouth, teeth, and lips. Cough, asthma, catarrh, inflammation, fever, stomach ache, fainting, dysentery, gastric pain, cholera, leprosy, boils, eczema, tuberculosis, epilepsy, herpes, itch, scabs, smallpox, scabies, hemorrhage, diabetes, piles, pimples, and ulcers. Afflictions stemming from disorders of bile, phlegm, wind, or their conjunction. Afflictions caused by change in weather, by not taking care of yourself, by overexertion, or as the result of past deeds. Cold, heat, hunger, thirst, defecation, and urination.’
an10.60:7.5	And so they meditate observing drawbacks in this body.
an10.60:7.6	This is called the perception of drawbacks.
an10.60:8.1	And what is the perception of giving up?
an10.60:8.2	It’s when a mendicant doesn’t tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen, and they don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them.
an10.60:8.3	This is called the perception of giving up.
an10.60:9.1	And what is the perception of fading away?
an10.60:9.2	It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this:
an10.60:9.3	‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, extinguishment.’
an10.60:9.4	This is called the perception of fading away.
an10.60:10.1	And what is the perception of cessation?
an10.60:10.2	It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this:
an10.60:10.3	‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, cessation, extinguishment.’
an10.60:10.4	This is called the perception of cessation.
an10.60:11.1	And what is the perception of dissatisfaction with the whole world?
an10.60:11.2	It’s when a mendicant lives giving up and not grasping on to the attraction and grasping to the world, the mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendencies.
an10.60:11.3	This is called the perception of dissatisfaction with the whole world.
an10.60:12.1	And what is the perception of the impermanence of all conditions?
an10.60:12.2	It’s when a mendicant is horrified, repelled, and disgusted with all conditions.
an10.60:12.3	This is called the perception of the impermanence of all conditions.
an10.60:13.1	And what is mindfulness of breathing?
an10.60:13.2	It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establishes mindfulness right there.
an10.60:13.3	Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.
an10.60:13.4	When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’
an10.60:13.5	When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’
an10.60:13.6	They practice breathing in experiencing the whole body. They practice breathing out experiencing the whole body.
an10.60:13.7	They practice breathing in stilling the body’s motion. They practice breathing out stilling the body’s motion.
an10.60:13.8	They practice breathing in experiencing rapture. They practice breathing out experiencing rapture.
an10.60:13.9	They practice breathing in experiencing bliss. They practice breathing out experiencing bliss.

an10.60:14.1	If you were to recite to the mendicant Girimānanda these ten perceptions, it’s possible that after hearing them his illness will die down on the spot.”
an10.60:15.1	Then Ānanda, having learned these ten perceptions from the Buddha himself, went to Girimānanda and recited them.
an10.60:15.2	Then after Girimānanda heard these ten perceptions his illness died down on the spot.

an10.68:1.1	At one time the Buddha stayed near Naḷakapāna in the parrot tree grove.
an10.68:1.2	Now, at that time it was the sabbath, and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.
an10.68:1.3	The Buddha spent most of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk. Then he looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were so very silent. He addressed Venerable Sāriputta,
an10.68:2.1	“Sāriputta, the Saṅgha of mendicants is rid of dullness and drowsiness.
an10.68:2.2	Give them some Dhamma talk as you feel inspired.
an10.68:2.3	My back is sore,
an10.68:2.4	I’ll stretch it.”
an10.68:2.5	“Yes, sir,” Sāriputta replied.
an10.68:3.1	And then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.
an10.68:3.2	There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:
an10.68:3.3	“Reverends, mendicants!”
an10.68:3.4	“Reverend,” they replied.
an10.68:3.5	Sāriputta said this:

an10.71:1.4	“Venerable sir,” they replied.
an10.71:1.5	The Buddha said this:
an10.71:2.1	“Mendicants, live by the ethical precepts and the monastic code. Live restrained in the code of conduct, conducting yourselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, keep the rules you’ve undertaken.
an10.71:3.1	A mendicant might wish: ‘May I be liked and approved by my spiritual companions, respected and admired.’ So let them fulfill their precepts, be committed to inner serenity of the heart, not neglect absorption, be endowed with discernment, and frequent empty huts.

an10.72:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof, together with several well-known senior disciples.
an10.72:1.2	They included Venerables Cāla, Upacāla, Kakkaṭa, Kaṭimbha, Kaṭa, Kaṭissaṅga,
an10.72:1.3	and other well-known senior disciples.
an10.72:2.1	Now at that time several well-known Licchavis plunged deep into the Great Wood to see the Buddha. Driving a succession of fine carriages, they made a dreadful racket.
an10.72:2.2	Then those venerables thought:
an10.72:2.3	“These several well-known Licchavis have plunged deep into the Great Wood to see the Buddha. Driving a succession of fine carriages, they’re making a dreadful racket.

Seeing shows is a thorn to someone restraining the senses. Lingering in the neighborhood of females is a thorn to celibacy. Sound is a thorn to the first absorption. Placing the mind and keeping it connected are a thorn to the second absorption. Rapture is a thorn to the third absorption. Breathing is a thorn to the fourth absorption. Perception and feeling are a thorn to the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling. Greed, hate, and delusion are thorns.

an10.75:2.2	My father Purāṇa was celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex.
an10.75:2.3	When he passed away the Buddha declared that he was a once-returner, who was reborn in the company of the Joyful Gods.

an10.83:4.1	But when a mendicant has faith, approaches, pays homage, asks questions, lends an ear, remembers the teachings, reflects on the meaning, practices accordingly, has a good voice, and encourages their spiritual companions,
an10.83:4.2	the Realized One feels inspired to teach.
an10.83:4.3	When someone has these ten qualities, the Realized One feels totally inspired to teach.”

an10.84:2.3	They’re pursued, pressed, and grilled by the Realized One, or by one of his disciples who has the absorptions, and is skilled in attainments, in the minds of others, and in the ways of another’s mind.
an10.84:2.4	Grilled in this way they get stuck or lose their way. They fall to ruin and disaster.
an10.84:3.1	The Realized One or one of his disciples comprehends their mind and investigates:

an10.85:1.3	“Reverends, mendicants!”
an10.85:1.4	“Reverend,” they replied.
an10.85:1.5	Venerable Mahācunda said this:
an10.85:2.1	“Take a mendicant who boasts and brags about their achievements:
an10.85:2.2	‘I enter and emerge from the first absorption, the second absorption, the third absorption, and the fourth absorption.

an10.85:3.1	They’re pursued, pressed, and grilled by the Realized One, or by one of his disciples who has the absorptions, and is skilled in attainments, in the minds of others, and in the ways of another’s mind.
an10.85:3.2	Grilled in this way they get stuck or lose their way. They fall to ruin and disaster.

an10.85:16.4	They’d say:
an10.85:16.5	‘Well then, my dear friend, dig here.’ So they dig there, but don’t find anything.

an10.86:0.3	86. Overestimation
an10.86:1.1	At one time Venerable Mahākassapa was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
an10.86:1.2	There he addressed the mendicants:
an10.86:1.3	“Reverends, mendicants!”
an10.86:1.4	“Reverend,” they replied.
an10.86:1.5	Venerable Mahākassapa said this:
an10.86:2.1	“Take a mendicant who declares enlightenment:
an10.86:2.2	‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’
an10.86:2.3	They’re pursued, pressed, and grilled by the Realized One, or by one of his disciples who has the absorptions, and is skilled in attainments, in the minds of others, and in the ways of another’s mind.
an10.86:2.4	Grilled in this way they get stuck or lose their way. They fall to ruin and disaster.
an10.86:3.1	The Realized One or one of his disciples comprehends their mind and investigates:
an10.86:3.2	‘Why does this venerable declare enlightenment, saying,
an10.86:3.3	“I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’?”’
an10.86:4.1	They understand,

an10.86:5.2	And they declare enlightenment out of overestimation:
an10.86:5.3	“I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”’
an10.86:6.1	The Realized One or one of his disciples comprehends their mind and investigates:

These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.

an10.87:1.2	“Mendicants!”
an10.87:1.3	“Venerable sir,” they replied.
an10.87:1.4	The Buddha said this:
an10.87:2.1	“Firstly, a mendicant raises disciplinary issues and doesn’t praise the settlement of disciplinary issues.
an10.87:2.2	This quality doesn’t conduce to fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.
an10.87:3.1	Furthermore, a mendicant doesn’t want to train, and doesn’t praise taking up the training. …

an10.87:11.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is inhospitable to their spiritual companions, and doesn’t praise hospitality.
an10.87:11.2	This quality doesn’t conduce to fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.
an10.87:12.1	Even though a mendicant such as this might wish:
an10.87:12.2	‘If only my spiritual companions would honor, respect, esteem, and venerate me!’ Still they don’t honor, respect, esteem, and venerate them.
an10.87:12.3	Why is that?
an10.87:12.4	Because their sensible spiritual companions see that they haven’t given up those bad unskillful qualities.
an10.87:13.1	Suppose a wild colt was to wish:
an10.87:13.2	‘If only the humans would put me in a thoroughbred’s place, feed me a thoroughbred’s food, and give me a thoroughbred’s grooming.’ Still the humans wouldn’t put them in a thoroughbred’s place, feed them a thoroughbred’s food, or give them a thoroughbred’s grooming.
an10.87:13.3	Why is that?
an10.87:13.4	Because sensible humans see that they haven’t given up their tricks, bluffs, ruses, and feints.

an10.87:13.7	Why is that?
an10.87:13.8	Because their sensible spiritual companions see that they haven’t given up those bad unskillful qualities.
an10.87:14.1	Next, a mendicant doesn’t raise disciplinary issues and praises the settlement of disciplinary issues.
an10.87:14.2	This quality conduces to fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.

an10.87:23.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is hospitable to their spiritual companions, and praises hospitality.
an10.87:23.2	This quality conduces to fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.
an10.87:24.1	Even though a mendicant such as this might never wish:
an10.87:24.2	‘If only my spiritual companions would honor, respect, esteem, and venerate me!’ Still they honor, respect, esteem, and venerate them.
an10.87:24.3	Why is that?
an10.87:24.4	Because their sensible spiritual companions see that they’ve given up those bad unskillful qualities.
an10.87:25.1	Suppose a fine thoroughbred never wished:
an10.87:25.2	‘If only the humans would put me in a thoroughbred’s place, feed me a thoroughbred’s food, and give me a thoroughbred’s grooming.’ Still the humans would put them in a thoroughbred’s place, feed them a thoroughbred’s food, and give them a thoroughbred’s grooming.

an10.88:1.2	What ten?
an10.88:1.3	They don’t achieve the unachieved. What they have achieved falls away. They don’t refine their good qualities. They overestimate their good qualities, or lead the spiritual life dissatisfied, or commit a corrupt offense, or contract a severe illness, or go mad and lose their mind. They feel lost when they die. And when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.

an10.89:0.3	89. With Kokālika
an10.89:1.1	Then the mendicant Kokālika went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
an10.89:1.2	“Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.”
an10.89:1.3	“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika!
an10.89:1.4	Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna,
an10.89:1.5	they’re good monks.”
an10.89:2.1	For a second time Kokālika said to the Buddha,
an10.89:2.2	“Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.”
an10.89:2.3	“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika!
an10.89:2.4	Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna,
an10.89:2.5	they’re good monks.”
an10.89:3.1	For a third time Kokālika said to the Buddha,
an10.89:3.2	“Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.”
an10.89:3.3	“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika!
an10.89:3.4	Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna,
an10.89:3.5	they’re good monks.”
an10.89:4.1	Then Kokālika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
an10.89:4.2	Not long after he left his body erupted with boils the size of mustard seeds.
an10.89:4.3	The boils grew to the size of mung beans, then chickpeas, then jujube seeds, then jujubes, then myrobalans, then unripe wood apples, then ripe wood apples. Finally they burst open, and pus and blood oozed out.
an10.89:4.4	He just laid down on banana leaves like a poisoned fish.
an10.89:5.1	Then Tudu the independent brahmā went to Kokālika, and standing in the sky he said to him,
an10.89:5.2	“Kokālika, have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna,
an10.89:5.3	they’re good monks.”
an10.89:5.4	“Who are you, reverend?”
an10.89:5.5	“I am Tudu the independent brahmā.”
an10.89:5.6	“Didn’t the Buddha declare you a non-returner? So what exactly are you doing back here?
an10.89:5.7	See how far you have strayed!”
an10.89:6.1	Then Tudu addressed Kokālika in verse:
an10.89:7.1	“A person is born
an10.89:7.2	with an axe in their mouth.
an10.89:7.3	A fool cuts themselves with it
an10.89:7.4	when they say bad words.
an10.89:8.1	When you praise someone worthy of criticism,
an10.89:8.2	or criticize someone worthy of praise,
an10.89:8.3	you choose bad luck with your own mouth:
an10.89:8.4	you’ll never find happiness that way.
an10.89:9.1	Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing,
an10.89:9.2	if all you lose is your money
an10.89:9.3	and all you own, even yourself.
an10.89:9.4	What’s really terrible luck
an10.89:9.5	is to hate the holy ones.
an10.89:10.1	For more than two quinquadecillion years,
an10.89:10.2	and another five quattuordecillion years,
an10.89:10.3	a slanderer of noble ones goes to hell,
an10.89:10.4	having aimed bad words and thoughts at them.”
an10.89:11.1	Then the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness.
an10.89:11.2	He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.
an10.89:12.1	Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,
an10.89:12.2	“Sir, the mendicant Kokālika has passed away.
an10.89:12.3	He was reborn in the pink lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.”
an10.89:12.4	That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said.
an10.89:12.5	Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there.
an10.89:13.1	Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened.
an10.89:13.2	NA
an10.89:13.3	NA
an10.89:13.4	NA
an10.89:13.5	NA
an10.89:13.6	NA
an10.89:14.1	When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha,
an10.89:14.2	“Sir, how long is the life span in the Pink Lotus hell?”
an10.89:14.3	“It’s long, mendicant.
an10.89:14.4	It’s not easy to calculate
an10.89:14.5	how many years, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts.”
an10.89:15.1	“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?”
an10.89:15.2	“It’s possible,” said the Buddha.
an10.89:15.3	“Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed. And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it.
an10.89:15.4	By this means the Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell.
an10.89:15.5	Now, twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Nirabbuda hell.
an10.89:15.6	Twenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Ababa hell.
an10.89:15.7	Twenty lifetimes in the Ababa hell equal one lifetime in the Aṭaṭa hell.
an10.89:15.8	Twenty lifetimes in the Aṭaṭa hell equal one lifetime in the Ahaha hell.
an10.89:15.9	Twenty lifetimes in the Ahaha hell equal one lifetime in the Yellow Lotus hell.
an10.89:15.10	Twenty lifetimes in the Yellow Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Sweet-Smelling hell.
an10.89:15.11	Twenty lifetimes in the Sweet-Smelling hell equal one lifetime in the Blue Water Lily hell.
an10.89:15.12	Twenty lifetimes in the Blue Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the White Lotus hell.
an10.89:15.13	Twenty lifetimes in the White Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Pink Lotus hell.
an10.89:15.14	The mendicant Kokālika has been reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.”
an10.89:15.15	That is what the Buddha said.
an10.89:15.16	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:
an10.89:16.1	“A person is born
an10.89:16.2	with an axe in their mouth.
an10.89:16.3	A fool cuts themselves with it
an10.89:16.4	when they say bad words.
an10.89:17.1	When you praise someone worthy of criticism,
an10.89:17.2	or criticize someone worthy of praise,
an10.89:17.3	you choose bad luck with your own mouth:
an10.89:17.4	you’ll never find happiness that way.
an10.89:18.1	Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing,
an10.89:18.2	if all you lose is your money
an10.89:18.3	and all you own, even yourself.
an10.89:18.4	What’s really terrible luck
an10.89:18.5	is to hate the holy ones.
an10.89:19.1	For more than two quinquadecillion years,
an10.89:19.2	and another five quattuordecillion years,
an10.89:19.3	a slanderer of noble ones goes to hell,
an10.89:19.4	having aimed bad words and thoughts at them.”

an10.90:0.2	9. Senior Mendicants
an10.90:0.3	90. The Powers of One Who has Ended Defilements
an10.90:1.1	Then Venerable Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
an10.90:1.2	“Sāriputta, how many powers does a mendicant who has ended the defilements have that qualify them to claim:
an10.90:1.3	‘My defilements have ended.’”
an10.90:2.1	“Sir, a mendicant who has ended the defilements has ten powers that qualify them to claim:
an10.90:2.2	‘My defilements have ended.’
an10.90:2.3	What ten?
an10.90:2.4	Firstly, a mendicant with defilements ended has clearly seen with right wisdom all conditions as truly impermanent.
an10.90:2.5	This is a power that a mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim:
an10.90:2.6	‘My defilements have ended.’
an10.90:3.1	Furthermore, a mendicant with defilements ended has clearly seen with right wisdom that sensual pleasures are truly like a pit of glowing coals.
an10.90:3.2	This is a power that a mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim:
an10.90:3.3	‘My defilements have ended.’
an10.90:4.1	Furthermore, the mind of a mendicant with defilements ended slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion. They’re withdrawn, loving renunciation, and they’ve totally done with defiling influences.
an10.90:4.2	This is a power that a mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim:
an10.90:4.3	‘My defilements have ended.’
an10.90:5.1	Furthermore, a mendicant with defilements ended has well developed the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.
an10.90:5.2	This is a power that a mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim:
an10.90:5.3	‘My defilements have ended.’
an10.90:6.1	Furthermore, a mendicant with defilements ended has well developed the four right efforts. …
an10.90:6.2	the four bases of psychic power …
an10.90:6.3	the five faculties …
an10.90:6.4	the five powers …
an10.90:6.5	the seven awakening factors …
an10.90:6.6	the noble eightfold path.
an10.90:6.7	This is a power that a mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim:
an10.90:6.8	‘My defilements have ended.’
an10.90:7.1	A mendicant who has ended the defilements has these ten powers that qualify them to claim:
an10.90:7.2	‘My defilements have ended.’”

an10.91:0.3	91. Pleasure Seekers
an10.91:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an10.91:1.2	Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the Buddha said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika:
an10.91:2.1	“These ten pleasure seekers are found in the world.
an10.91:2.2	What ten?
an10.91:2.3	First, a pleasure seeker seeks wealth using illegitimate, coercive means.
an10.91:2.4	They don’t make themselves happy and pleased, nor share it and make merit.
an10.91:3.1	Next, a pleasure seeker seeks wealth using illegitimate, coercive means.
an10.91:3.2	They make themselves happy and pleased, but don’t share it and make merit.

an10.91:6.2	They make themselves happy and pleased, but don't share it and make merit.

an10.91:10.2	They make themselves happy and pleased, and they share it and make merit.
an10.91:10.3	But they enjoy that wealth tied, infatuated, attached, blind to the drawbacks, and not understanding the escape.
an10.91:11.1	Next, a pleasure seeker seeks wealth using legitimate, non-coercive means.
an10.91:11.2	They make themselves happy and pleased, and they share it and make merit.
an10.91:11.3	And they enjoy that wealth untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawbacks, and understanding the escape.

an10.92:0.2	10. With Upāli
an10.92:0.3	92. Dangers
an10.92:1.1	Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
an10.92:2.1	“Householder, when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble cycle with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves:
an10.92:2.2	‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’
an10.92:3.1	What are the five dangers and threats they have quelled?
an10.92:3.2	Anyone who kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. Anyone who refrains from killing living creatures creates no dangers and threats either in the present life or in lives to come, and doesn’t experience mental pain and sadness.
an10.92:3.3	So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from killing living creatures.
an10.92:4.1	Anyone who steals …
an10.92:4.2	Anyone who commits sexual misconduct …
an10.92:4.3	Anyone who lies …
an10.92:4.4	Anyone who uses alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. Anyone who refrains from using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates no dangers and threats either in the present life or in lives to come, and doesn’t experience mental pain and sadness.
an10.92:4.5	So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
an10.92:4.6	These are the five dangers and threats they have quelled.
an10.92:5.1	What are the four factors of stream-entry that they have?
an10.92:5.2	It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha:
an10.92:5.3	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, awakened, blessed.’
an10.92:5.4	They have experiential confidence in the teaching:
an10.92:5.5	‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’
an10.92:5.6	They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha:
an10.92:5.7	‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’
an10.92:5.8	And a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.
an10.92:5.9	These are the four factors of stream-entry that they have.
an10.92:6.1	And what is the noble cycle that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom?
an10.92:6.2	It’s when a noble disciple reflects:
an10.92:6.3	‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises.
an10.92:6.4	When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is:
an10.92:6.5	Ignorance is a condition for choices.
an10.92:6.6	Choices are a condition for consciousness.
an10.92:6.7	Consciousness is a condition for name and form.
an10.92:6.8	Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields.
an10.92:6.9	The six sense fields are conditions for contact.
an10.92:6.10	Contact is a condition for feeling.
an10.92:6.11	Feeling is a condition for craving.
an10.92:6.12	Craving is a condition for grasping.
an10.92:6.13	Grasping is a condition for continued existence.
an10.92:6.14	Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.
an10.92:6.15	Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be.
an10.92:6.16	That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
an10.92:6.17	When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease.
an10.92:6.18	That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’
an10.92:6.19	This is the noble cycle that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom.
an10.92:7.1	When a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble cycle with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves:
an10.92:7.2	‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’”

an10.93:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
an10.93:1.2	Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika left Sāvatthī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha.
an10.93:1.3	Then it occurred to him,
an10.93:1.4	“It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha,
an10.93:1.5	as he’s in retreat.
an10.93:1.6	And it’s the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicants,
an10.93:1.7	as they’re in retreat.
an10.93:1.8	Why don’t I go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths?”
an10.93:2.1	Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths.
an10.93:2.2	Now at that time, the wanderers who follow other paths had come together, making an uproar, a dreadful racket as they sat and talked about all kinds of unworthy topics.
an10.93:2.3	They saw Anāthapiṇḍika coming off in the distance,
an10.93:2.4	and stopped each other, saying,
an10.93:2.5	“Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound.
an10.93:2.6	The householder Anāthapiṇḍika, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is coming into our monastery.
an10.93:2.7	He is included among the white-clothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing in Sāvatthī.
an10.93:2.8	Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet.
an10.93:2.9	Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”
an10.93:3.1	Then those wanderers who follow other paths fell silent.
an10.93:3.2	Then Anāthapiṇḍika went up to them, and exchanged greetings with those wanderers.
an10.93:3.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The wanderers said to him,
an10.93:3.4	“Tell us, householder, what is the view of the ascetic Gotama?”
an10.93:3.5	“Sirs, I don’t know all his views.”
an10.93:4.1	“Well then, since it seems you don’t know all the views of the ascetic Gotama,
an10.93:4.2	tell us, what are the views of the mendicants?”
an10.93:4.3	“Sirs, I don’t know all the mendicants’ views.”
an10.93:5.1	“Well then, since it seems you don’t know all the views of the ascetic Gotama or of the mendicants,
an10.93:5.2	tell us, householder, what is your view?”
an10.93:5.3	“Sirs, it’s not hard for me to explain what my views are.
an10.93:5.4	But please, let the venerables explain their own convictions first. Afterwards it won’t be hard for me to explain my views.”
an10.93:6.1	When he said this, one of the wanderers said to him,
an10.93:6.2	“The cosmos is eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.
an10.93:6.3	That’s my view, householder.”
an10.93:7.1	Another wanderer said,
an10.93:7.2	“The cosmos is not eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.
an10.93:7.3	That’s my view, householder.”
an10.93:8.1	Another wanderer said,
an10.93:8.2	“The world is finite …” …
an10.93:8.3	“The world is infinite …” …
an10.93:8.4	“The soul and the body are the same thing …” …
an10.93:8.5	“The soul and the body are different things …” …
an10.93:8.6	“A Realized One exists after death …” …
an10.93:8.7	“A Realized One doesn’t exist after death …” …
an10.93:8.8	“A Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death …” …
an10.93:8.9	“A Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.
an10.93:8.10	That’s my view, householder.”
an10.93:9.1	When this was said, Anāthapiṇḍika said this,
an10.93:9.2	“Sirs, regarding the venerable who said this:
an10.93:9.3	‘The cosmos is eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.
an10.93:9.4	That’s my view, householder.’
an10.93:9.5	This view of his has either arisen from his own improper attention, or is conditioned by what someone else says.
an10.93:9.6	But that view is created, conditioned, chosen, dependently originated.
an10.93:9.7	Anything that is created, conditioned, chosen, and dependently originated is impermanent.
an10.93:9.8	And what’s impermanent is suffering.
an10.93:9.9	What he clings to and holds to is just suffering.
an10.93:10.1	Regarding the venerable who said this:
an10.93:10.2	‘The cosmos is not eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.
an10.93:10.3	That’s my view, householder.’
an10.93:10.4	This view of his has either arisen from his own improper attention, or is conditioned by what someone else says.
an10.93:10.5	But that view is created, conditioned, chosen, dependently originated.
an10.93:10.6	Anything that is created, conditioned, chosen, and dependently originated is impermanent.
an10.93:10.7	And what’s impermanent is suffering.
an10.93:10.8	What he clings to and holds to is just suffering.
an10.93:11.1	Regarding the venerable who said this:
an10.93:11.2	‘The world is finite …’ …

an10.93:11.9	‘A Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.
an10.93:11.10	That’s my view, householder.’
an10.93:11.11	This view of his has either arisen from his own improper attention, or is conditioned by what someone else says.
an10.93:11.12	But that view is created, conditioned, chosen, dependently originated.
an10.93:11.13	Anything that is created, conditioned, chosen, and dependently originated is impermanent.
an10.93:11.14	And what’s impermanent is suffering.
an10.93:11.15	What he clings to and holds to is just suffering.”
an10.93:12.1	When he said this the wanderers said to him,
an10.93:12.2	“Householder, we’ve each explained our own convictions.
an10.93:12.3	Tell us, householder, what is your view?”
an10.93:12.4	“Sirs, anything that is created, conditioned, chosen, and dependently originated is impermanent.
an10.93:12.5	And what’s impermanent is suffering.
an10.93:12.6	And what’s suffering is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.
an10.93:12.7	That’s my view, sirs.”
an10.93:13.1	“Householder, anything that is created, conditioned, chosen, and dependently originated is impermanent.
an10.93:13.2	And what’s impermanent is suffering.
an10.93:13.3	What you cling to and hold to is just suffering.”
an10.93:14.1	“Sirs, anything that is created, conditioned, chosen, and dependently originated is impermanent.
an10.93:14.2	And what’s impermanent is suffering.
an10.93:14.3	And I’ve truly seen clearly with right wisdom that what’s suffering is not mine, I am not this, it’s not my self.
an10.93:14.4	And I truly understand the escape beyond that.”
an10.93:15.1	When this was said, those wanderers sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.
an10.93:15.2	Seeing this, Anāthapiṇḍika got up from his seat. He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed.
an10.93:15.3	“Good, good, householder!
an10.93:15.4	That’s how you should legitimately and completely refute those foolish men from time to time.”
an10.93:16.1	Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired the householder Anāthapiṇḍika with a Dhamma talk,
an10.93:16.2	after which Anāthapiṇḍika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving.
an10.93:17.1	Then, not long after Anāthapiṇḍika had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
an10.93:17.2	“Mendicants, even a mendicant who has ordained for a hundred years in this teaching and training would legitimately and completely refute those wanderers who follow other paths just as the householder Anāthapiṇḍika did.”
an10.94:0.1	Numbered Discourses 10
an10.94:0.2	10. With Upāli
an10.94:0.3	94. With Vajjiyamāhita
an10.94:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond.
an10.94:1.2	Then the householder Vajjiyamāhita left Sāvatthī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha.
an10.94:1.3	Then it occurred to him,
an10.94:1.4	“It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha,
an10.94:1.5	as he’s in retreat.
an10.94:1.6	And it’s the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicants,
an10.94:1.7	as they’re in retreat.
an10.94:1.8	Why don’t I go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths?”
an10.94:2.1	Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths.
an10.94:2.2	Now at that time, the wanderers who follow other paths had come together, making an uproar, a dreadful racket as they sat and talked about all kinds of unworthy topics.
an10.94:3.1	They saw Vajjiyamāhita coming off in the distance, and stopped each other, saying,
an10.94:3.2	“Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound.
an10.94:3.3	The householder Vajjiyamāhita, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is coming into our monastery.
an10.94:3.4	He is included among the white-clothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing near Campā.
an10.94:3.5	Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet.

an10.94:4.1	Then those wanderers who follow other paths fell silent.
an10.94:4.2	Then Vajjiyamāhita went up to them, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there.
an10.94:4.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The wanderers said to him:
an10.94:4.4	“Is it really true, householder? Does the ascetic Gotama criticize all forms of mortification? Does he categorically condemn and denounce those self-mortifiers who live rough?”
an10.94:4.5	“No, sirs, the ascetic Gotama does not criticize all forms of mortification. Nor does he categorically condemn and denounce those self-mortifiers who live rough.
an10.94:4.6	The Buddha criticizes where it is due, and praises where it is due.
an10.94:4.7	In doing so he is one who speaks after analyzing the question,
an10.94:4.8	and is not definitive on this point.”
an10.94:5.1	When he said this, one of the wanderers said to him,
an10.94:5.2	“Hold on, householder! That ascetic Gotama who you praise is an exterminator who refrains from making statements.”
an10.94:5.3	“On this point, also, I reasonably respond to the venerables.
an10.94:5.4	The Buddha has stated ‘This is skillful’ and
an10.94:5.5	‘This is unskillful’.
an10.94:5.6	So when it comes to what is skillful and unskillful the Buddha makes a statement.
an10.94:5.7	He is not an exterminator who refrains from making statements.”
an10.94:6.1	When this was said, those wanderers sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.
an10.94:6.2	Seeing this, Vajjiyamāhita got up from his seat. He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,
an10.94:6.3	and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed.
an10.94:7.1	“Good, good, householder!
an10.94:7.2	That’s how you should legitimately and completely refute those foolish men from time to time.
an10.94:7.3	Householder, I don’t say that all mortifications should be undergone.
an10.94:7.4	But I don’t say that no mortifications should be undergone.
an10.94:7.5	I don’t say that all observances should be undertaken.
an10.94:7.6	But I don’t say that no observances should be undertaken.
an10.94:7.7	I don’t say that all efforts should be tried.
an10.94:7.8	But I don’t say that no efforts should be tried.
an10.94:7.9	I don’t say that everything should be given up.
an10.94:7.10	But I don’t say that nothing should be given up.
an10.94:7.11	I don’t say that you should be liberated with all kinds of freedom.
an10.94:7.12	But I don’t say that you should not be liberated with any kind of freedom.
an10.94:8.1	When undergoing certain mortifications, unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline. I say that you shouldn’t undergo those mortifications.
an10.94:8.2	When undergoing certain mortifications, unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow. I say that you should undergo those mortifications.
an10.94:9.1	When undertaking certain observances, unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline. I say that you shouldn’t undertake those observances.
an10.94:9.2	When undertaking certain observances, unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow. I say that you should undertake those observances.
an10.94:10.1	When trying certain efforts, unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline. I say that you shouldn’t try those efforts.
an10.94:10.2	When trying certain efforts, unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow. I say that you should try those efforts.
an10.94:11.1	When giving up certain things, unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline. I say that you shouldn’t give up those things.
an10.94:11.2	When giving up certain things, unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow. I say that you should give up those things.
an10.94:12.1	When being liberated with certain kinds of freedom, unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline. I say that you shouldn’t be liberated with those kinds of freedom.
an10.94:12.2	When being liberated with certain kinds of freedom, unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow. I say that you should be liberated with those kinds of freedom.”
an10.94:13.1	After Vajjiyamāhita had been educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired with a Dhamma talk by the Buddha, he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving.
an10.94:14.1	Then, not long after Vajjiyamāhita had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
an10.94:14.2	“Mendicants, even a mendicant who for a long time has had little dust in their eye in this teaching and training would legitimately and completely refute those wanderers who follow other paths just as the householder Vajjiyamāhita did.”
an10.95:0.1	Numbered Discourses 10
an10.95:0.2	10. With Upāli
an10.95:0.3	95. With Uttiya
an10.95:1.1	Then the wanderer Uttiya went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
an10.95:1.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,
an10.95:1.3	“Master Gotama, is this right: ‘The cosmos is eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?”
an10.95:1.4	“This has not been declared by me, Uttiya.”
an10.95:1.5	NA
an10.95:2.1	“Then is this right: ‘The cosmos is not eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?”
an10.95:2.2	“This has not been declared by me, Uttiya.”
an10.95:2.3	NA

an10.95:3.4	‘The soul and the body are different things …’ …

an10.95:3.8	‘A Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?”
an10.95:3.9	“This has not been declared by me, Uttiya.”
an10.95:3.10	NA
an10.95:4.1	“When asked about all these points, Master Gotama says that they have not been declared by him.
an10.95:4.2	NA

an10.95:6.8	NA
an10.95:6.9	NA
an10.95:6.10	NA
an10.95:6.11	So what exactly has been declared by Master Gotama?”
an10.95:7.1	“Uttiya, I teach my disciples from my own insight in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.”
an10.95:8.1	“But when Master Gotama teaches in this way, is the whole world saved, or half, or a third?”
an10.95:8.2	But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent.
an10.95:9.1	Then Venerable Ānanda thought,
an10.95:9.2	“The wanderer Uttiya must not get the harmful misconception:
an10.95:9.3	‘When the ascetic Gotama was asked this all-important question he falters without answering. He just can’t do it!’
an10.95:9.4	That would be for his lasting harm and suffering.”
an10.95:10.1	Then Ānanda said to the wanderer Uttiya,
an10.95:10.2	“Well then, Reverend Uttiya, I shall give you a simile.
an10.95:10.3	For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.
an10.95:10.4	Suppose there was a king’s frontier citadel with fortified embankments, ramparts, and arches, and a single gate.
an10.95:10.5	And it has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and clever. He keeps strangers out and lets known people in.
an10.95:10.6	As he walks around the patrol path, he doesn’t see a hole or cleft in the wall, not even one big enough for a cat to slip out.
an10.95:10.7	He doesn’t know how many creatures enter or leave the citadel.
an10.95:10.8	But he does know that whatever sizable creatures enter or leave the citadel, all of them do so via this gate.
an10.95:11.1	In the same way, it’s not the Realized One’s concern whether the whole world is saved by this, or half, or a third.
an10.95:11.2	But the Realized One knows that whoever is saved from the world—whether in the past, the future, or the present—all have given up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. They have firmly established their mind in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. And they have truly developed the seven awakening factors.
an10.95:11.3	That’s how they’re saved from the world, in the past, future, or present.
an10.95:11.4	Uttiya, you were just asking the Buddha the same question as before in a different way.
an10.95:11.5	That’s why he didn’t answer.”

an10.96:0.2	10. With Upāli
an10.96:0.3	96. With Kokanada
an10.96:1.1	At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monastery.
an10.96:1.2	Then Ānanda rose at the crack of dawn and went to the hot springs to bathe.
an10.96:1.3	When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying himself.
an10.96:1.4	The wanderer Kokanada also rose at the crack of dawn and went to the hot springs to bathe.
an10.96:2.1	He saw Ānanda coming off in the distance
an10.96:2.2	and said to him,
an10.96:2.3	“Who’s here, reverend?”
an10.96:2.4	“I’m a mendicant, reverend.”
an10.96:3.1	“Of which mendicants?”

an10.96:4.1	“I’d like to ask the venerable about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”

an10.97:2.1	What ten?
an10.97:2.2	It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
an10.97:3.1	They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.
an10.97:4.1	They have good friends, companions, and associates.
an10.97:5.1	They have right view, possessing right perspective.
an10.97:6.1	They wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. They control the body as far as the Brahmā realm.
an10.97:7.1	With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.
an10.97:8.1	They understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind.
an10.97:8.2	They understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’,
an10.97:8.3	and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’.
an10.97:8.4	They understand mind with hate …
an10.97:8.5	mind without hate …
an10.97:8.6	mind with delusion …
an10.97:8.7	mind without delusion …
an10.97:8.8	constricted mind …

an10.97:8.15	mind not immersed in samādhi …
an10.97:8.16	freed mind …
an10.97:8.17	They understand unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’.
an10.97:9.1	They recollect many kinds of past lives, that is, one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ Thus they recollect their many past lives, with features and details.
an10.97:10.1	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
an10.97:11.1	They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
an10.97:12.1	A mendicant with these ten qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”

an10.98:1.2	What ten?
an10.98:1.3	They are senior and have long gone forth.

an10.99:1.1	Then Venerable Upāli went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
an10.99:1.2	“Sir, I wish to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.”
an10.99:2.1	“Upāli, remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest are challenging.
an10.99:2.2	It’s hard to maintain seclusion and hard to find joy in it.
an10.99:2.3	Staying alone, the forests seem to rob the mind of a mendicant who isn’t immersed in samādhi.
an10.99:2.4	If someone should say this,
an10.99:2.5	‘Though I don’t have immersion, I’m going to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.’ You can expect that
an10.99:2.6	they’ll sink down or float away.
an10.99:3.1	Suppose there was a large lake,
an10.99:3.2	and along comes a bull elephant with a height of seven or eight cubits.
an10.99:3.3	He’d think,
an10.99:3.4	‘Why don’t I plunge into this lake and play around while washing my ears and back?
an10.99:3.5	When I’ve bathed and drunk, I’ll emerge from the water and go wherever I want.’
an10.99:3.6	And that’s just what he does.
an10.99:3.7	NA
an10.99:3.8	Why is that?
an10.99:3.9	Because his large life-form finds a footing in the depths.
an10.99:4.1	Then along comes a rabbit or a cat.
an10.99:4.2	They’d think,
an10.99:4.3	‘What difference is there between me and a bull elephant?
an10.99:4.4	Why don’t I plunge into this lake and play around while washing my ears and back?
an10.99:4.5	When I’ve bathed and drunk, I’ll emerge from the water and go wherever I want.’
an10.99:4.6	They jump into the lake rashly, without thinking.
an10.99:4.7	You can expect that
an10.99:4.8	they’ll sink down or float away.
an10.99:4.9	Why is that?
an10.99:4.10	Because their little life-form finds no footing in the depths.
an10.99:4.11	If someone should say this,
an10.99:4.12	‘Though I don’t have immersion, I’m going to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.’ You can expect that
an10.99:4.13	they’ll sink down or float away.
an10.99:5.1	Suppose there was a little baby boy playing in his own urine and feces.
an10.99:5.2	What do you think, Upāli?
an10.99:5.3	Isn’t that a totally foolish game?”
an10.99:5.4	“Yes, sir.”
an10.99:6.1	“After some time that boy grows up and his faculties mature.
an10.99:6.2	He accordingly plays childish games such as toy plows, tip-cat, somersaults, pinwheels, toy measures, toy carts, and toy bows.
an10.99:6.3	What do you think, Upāli?
an10.99:6.4	Aren’t such games better than what he did before?”
an10.99:6.5	“Yes, sir.”
an10.99:7.1	“After some time that boy grows up and his faculties mature further.
an10.99:7.2	He accordingly amuses himself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
an10.99:7.3	Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
an10.99:7.4	Sounds known by the ear …
an10.99:7.5	Smells known by the nose …
an10.99:7.6	Tastes known by the tongue …
an10.99:7.7	Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
an10.99:7.8	What do you think, Upāli?
an10.99:7.9	Aren’t such games better than what he did before?”
an10.99:7.10	“Yes, sir.”
an10.99:8.1	“But then a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.
an10.99:8.2	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.
an10.99:8.3	He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
an10.99:9.1	A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in some good family.
an10.99:9.2	They gain faith in the Realized One,
an10.99:9.3	and reflect,
an10.99:9.4	‘Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open.
an10.99:9.5	It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.
an10.99:9.6	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’
an10.99:10.1	After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
an10.99:11.1	Once they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings.
an10.99:12.1	They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving.
an10.99:13.1	They give up unchastity. They are celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex.
an10.99:14.1	They give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and trustworthy, and don’t trick the world with their words.
an10.99:15.1	They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.
an10.99:16.1	They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people.
an10.99:17.1	They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.
an10.99:18.1	They avoid injuring plants and seeds.
an10.99:18.2	They eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time.
an10.99:18.3	They avoid dancing, singing, music, and seeing shows.
an10.99:18.4	They avoid beautifying and adorning themselves with garlands, perfumes, and makeup.
an10.99:18.5	They avoid high and luxurious beds.

an10.99:18.12	chickens and pigs,
an10.99:18.13	elephants, cows, horses, and mares,
an10.99:18.14	and fields and land.
an10.99:18.15	They avoid running errands and messages;
an10.99:18.16	buying and selling;
an10.99:18.17	falsifying weights, metals, or measures;
an10.99:18.18	bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity;
an10.99:18.19	mutilation, murder, abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence.
an10.99:19.1	They’re content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly.
an10.99:19.2	Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.
an10.99:19.3	They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden.
an10.99:19.4	In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.
an10.99:19.5	When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves.
an10.99:20.1	When they see a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
an10.99:20.2	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving restraint over it.
an10.99:20.3	When they hear a sound with their ears …
an10.99:20.4	When they smell an odor with their nose …
an10.99:20.5	When they taste a flavor with their tongue …
an10.99:20.6	When they feel a touch with their body …
an10.99:20.7	When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
an10.99:20.8	If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint.
an10.99:20.9	When they have this noble sense restraint, they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves.
an10.99:21.1	They act with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.
an10.99:22.1	When they have this noble spectrum of ethics, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness,
an10.99:22.2	they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.
an10.99:22.3	Gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, they sit down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there.
an10.99:23.1	Giving up desire for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of desire, cleansing the mind of desire.
an10.99:23.2	Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will.
an10.99:23.3	Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness.
an10.99:23.4	Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.
an10.99:23.5	Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.
an10.99:24.1	They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.
an10.99:24.2	Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an10.99:24.3	What do you think, Upāli?
an10.99:24.4	Isn’t this state better than what they had before?”
an10.99:24.5	“Yes, sir.”
an10.99:25.1	“When my disciples see this quality inside themselves they frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. But so far they haven’t achieved their own goal.
an10.99:26.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an10.99:26.2	What do you think, Upāli?
an10.99:26.3	Isn’t this state better than what they had before?”
an10.99:26.4	“Yes, sir.”
an10.99:27.1	“When my disciples see this quality inside themselves they frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. But so far they haven’t achieved their own goal.
an10.99:28.1	Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption. They meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
an10.99:28.2	What do you think, Upāli?
an10.99:28.3	Isn’t this state better than what they had before?”
an10.99:28.4	“Yes, sir.”
an10.99:29.1	“When my disciples see this quality inside themselves they frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. But so far they haven’t achieved their own goal.
an10.99:30.1	Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. …” …
an10.99:31.1	“Furthermore, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, a mendicant enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.
an10.99:31.2	What do you think, Upāli?
an10.99:31.3	Isn’t this state better than what they had before?”
an10.99:31.4	“Yes, sir.”

an10.99:33.1	Furthermore, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, a mendicant enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. …” …
an10.99:34.1	“Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. …” …
an10.99:35.1	“Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
an10.99:35.2	What do you think, Upāli?
an10.99:35.3	Isn’t this state better than what they had before?”
an10.99:35.4	“Yes, sir.”
an10.99:36.1	“When my disciples see this quality inside themselves they frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. But so far they haven’t achieved their own goal.
an10.99:37.1	Furthermore, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end.
an10.99:37.2	What do you think, Upāli?
an10.99:37.3	Isn’t this state better than what they had before?”

an10.115:8.4	That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.
an10.115:8.5	You should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”
an10.115:9.1	“Certainly he is the Buddha, who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the truth, he is holiness. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of the deathless, the lord of truth, the Realized One.
an10.115:9.2	That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.
an10.115:9.3	We should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.
an10.115:9.4	Still, Venerable Ānanda is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.
an10.115:9.5	You are capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the Buddha.
an10.115:9.6	Please explain this, if it’s no trouble.”
an10.115:10.1	“Then listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an10.115:10.2	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.
an10.115:10.3	Ānanda said this:
an10.115:11.1	“Reverends, the Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail:
an10.115:11.2	‘You should know bad principles and good principles.
an10.115:11.3	And you should know bad results and good results.
an10.115:11.4	Knowing these things, your practice should follow the good principles with good results.’
an10.115:12.1	So what are bad principles? What are good principles? What are bad results? And what are good results?
an10.115:13.1	Wrong view is a bad principle.
an10.115:13.2	Right view is a good principle.
an10.115:13.3	And the many bad, unskillful qualities produced by wrong view are bad results.
an10.115:13.4	And the many skillful qualities fully developed because of right view are good results.
an10.115:14.1	Wrong thought is a bad principle.
an10.115:14.2	Right thought is a good principle. …
an10.115:14.3	Wrong speech is a bad principle.
an10.115:14.4	Right speech is a good principle. …
an10.115:14.5	Wrong action is a bad principle.

an10.115:14.7	Wrong livelihood is a bad principle.
an10.115:14.8	Right livelihood is a good principle. …
an10.115:14.9	Wrong effort is a bad principle.
an10.115:14.10	Right effort is a good principle. …
an10.115:14.11	Wrong mindfulness is a bad principle.
an10.115:14.12	Right mindfulness is a good principle. …
an10.115:14.13	Wrong immersion is a bad principle.
an10.115:14.14	Right immersion is a good principle. …
an10.115:14.15	Wrong knowledge is a bad principle.
an10.115:14.16	Right knowledge is a good principle. …
an10.115:15.1	Wrong freedom is a bad principle.
an10.115:15.2	Right freedom is a good principle.
an10.115:15.3	And the many bad, unskillful qualities produced by wrong freedom are bad results.
an10.115:15.4	And the many skillful qualities fully developed because of right freedom are good results.
an10.115:16.1	The Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail:
an10.115:16.2	‘You should know bad principles and good principles …
an10.115:16.3	and practice accordingly.’ And this is how I understand the detailed meaning of this passage for recitation.
an10.115:16.4	If you wish, you may go to the Buddha and ask him about this.
an10.115:16.5	You should remember it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”
an10.115:17.1	“Yes, reverend,” said those mendicants, approving and agreeing with what Ānanda said. Then they rose from their seats and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then they said:

an10.115:22.1	“Good, good, mendicants!
an10.115:22.2	Ānanda is astute,
an10.115:22.3	he has great wisdom.
an10.115:22.4	If you came to me and asked this question, I would answer it in exactly the same way as Ānanda.

an10.116:1.1	Then the wanderer Ajita went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
an10.116:1.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,
an10.116:2.1	“Master Gotama, we have a spiritual companion called ‘The Philosopher’.
an10.116:2.2	He has worked out around five hundred arguments by which followers of other paths will know when they’ve been refuted.”
an10.116:3.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,

an10.116:4.2	“Yes, sir,” they replied.
an10.116:4.3	The Buddha said this:

an10.119:0.3	119. The Ceremony of Descent (1st)
an10.119:1.1	Now, at that time it was the sabbath. The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi had bathed his head and dressed in a new pair of linen robes. Holding a handful of fresh grass, he stood to one side not far from the Buddha.
an10.119:2.1	The Buddha saw him,
an10.119:2.2	and said,
an10.119:2.3	“Brahmin, why have you bathed your head and dressed in a new pair of linen robes? Why are you standing to one side holding a handful of fresh grass?
an10.119:2.4	What’s going on today with the brahmin clan?”
an10.119:2.5	“Master Gotama, today is the ceremony of descent for the brahmin clan.”
an10.119:3.1	“But how do the brahmins observe the ceremony of descent?”
an10.119:3.2	“Well, Master Gotama, on the sabbath the brahmins bathe their heads and dress in a new pair of linen robes. They make a heap of fresh cow dung and spread it with green grass. Then they make their beds between the boundary and the fire chamber.
an10.119:3.3	That night they rise three times and worship the fire with joined palms:
an10.119:3.4	‘We descend, lord! We descend, lord!’
an10.119:3.5	And they serve the fire with abundant ghee, oil, and butter.
an10.119:3.6	And when the night has passed they serve the brahmins with a variety of delicious foods.
an10.119:3.7	That’s how the brahmins observe the ceremony of descent.”
an10.119:4.1	“The ceremony of descent observed by the brahmins is quite different from that observed in the training of the Noble One.”
an10.119:4.2	“But Master Gotama, how is the ceremony of descent observed in the training of the Noble One?

an10.119:5.1	“Well then, brahmin, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an10.119:5.2	“Yes sir,” Jāṇussoṇi replied.
an10.119:5.3	The Buddha said this:
an10.119:6.1	“It’s when a noble disciple reflects:
an10.119:6.2	‘Wrong view has a bad result
an10.119:6.3	in both this life and the next.’
an10.119:6.4	Reflecting like this, they give up wrong view,

an10.119:12.1	‘Wrong mindfulness has a bad result

an10.119:15.1	‘Wrong freedom has a bad result
an10.119:15.2	in both this life and the next.’
an10.119:15.3	Reflecting like this, they give up wrong freedom,
an10.119:15.4	they descend from wrong freedom.
an10.119:15.5	This is the ceremony of descent in the training of the Noble One.”
an10.119:16.1	“The ceremony of descent observed by the brahmins is quite different from that observed in the training of the Noble One.
an10.119:16.2	And, Master Gotama, the ceremony of descent observed by the brahmins is not worth a sixteenth part of a master of the ceremony of descent observed in the training of the Noble One.
an10.119:16.3	Excellent, Master Gotama! …

an10.167:0.3	167. The Brahmin Ceremony of Descent
an10.167:1.1	Now, at that time it was the sabbath. The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi had bathed his head and dressed in a new pair of linen robes. Holding a handful of fresh grass, he stood to one side not far from the Buddha.
an10.167:2.1	The Buddha saw him,
an10.167:2.2	and said,
an10.167:2.3	“Brahmin, why have you bathed your head and dressed in a new pair of linen robes? Why are you standing to one side holding a handful of fresh grass?
an10.167:2.4	What’s going on today with the brahmin clan?”
an10.167:2.5	“Master Gotama, today is the ceremony of descent for the brahmin clan.”
an10.167:3.1	“But how do the brahmins observe the ceremony of descent?”
an10.167:3.2	“Well, Master Gotama, on the sabbath the brahmins bathe their heads and dress in a new pair of linen robes. They make a heap of fresh cow dung and spread it with green grass. Then they make their beds between the boundary and the fire chamber.
an10.167:3.3	That night they rise three times and worship the fire with joined palms:
an10.167:3.4	‘We descend, lord! We descend, lord!’
an10.167:3.5	And they serve the fire with abundant ghee, oil, and butter.
an10.167:3.6	And when the night has passed they serve the brahmins with a variety of delicious foods.
an10.167:3.7	That’s how the brahmins observe the ceremony of descent.”
an10.167:4.1	“The ceremony of descent observed by the brahmins is quite different from that observed in the training of the Noble One.”
an10.167:4.2	“But Master Gotama, how is the ceremony of descent observed in the training of the Noble One?
an10.167:4.3	Master Gotama, please teach me this.”
an10.167:5.1	“Well then, brahmin, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an10.167:5.2	“Yes sir,” Jāṇussoṇi replied.
an10.167:5.3	The Buddha said this:
an10.167:6.1	“It’s when a noble disciple reflects:
an10.167:6.2	‘Killing living creatures has a bad result in the present life and in lives to come.’
an10.167:6.3	Reflecting like this, they give up killing living creatures,
an10.167:6.4	they descend from killing living creatures.

an10.167:9.3	Reflecting like this, they give up lying,
an10.167:9.4	they descend from lying.
an10.167:10.1	… ‘Divisive speech has a bad result
an10.167:10.2	in the present life and in lives to come.’
an10.167:10.3	Reflecting like this, they give up divisive speech,
an10.167:10.4	they descend from divisive speech.
an10.167:11.1	… ‘Harsh speech has a bad result
an10.167:11.2	in the present life and in lives to come.’
an10.167:11.3	Reflecting like this, they give up harsh speech,
an10.167:11.4	they descend from harsh speech.
an10.167:12.1	… ‘Talking nonsense has a bad result
an10.167:12.2	in the present life and in lives to come.’
an10.167:12.3	Reflecting like this, they give up talking nonsense,
an10.167:12.4	they descend from talking nonsense.
an10.167:13.1	… ‘Covetousness has a bad result
an10.167:13.2	in the present life and in lives to come.’
an10.167:13.3	Reflecting like this, they give up covetousness,
an10.167:13.4	they descend from covetousness.
an10.167:14.1	… ‘Ill will has a bad result
an10.167:14.2	in the present life and in lives to come.’
an10.167:14.3	Reflecting like this, they give up ill will,
an10.167:14.4	they descend from ill will.
an10.167:15.1	‘Wrong view has a bad result
an10.167:15.2	in the present life and in lives to come.’
an10.167:15.3	Reflecting like this, they give up wrong view,
an10.167:15.4	they descend from wrong view.
an10.167:15.5	This is the ceremony of descent in the training of the Noble One.”
an10.167:16.1	“The ceremony of descent observed by the brahmins is quite different from that observed in the training of the Noble One.
an10.167:16.2	And, Master Gotama, the ceremony of descent observed by the brahmins is not worth a sixteenth part of the ceremony of descent observed in the training of the Noble One.
an10.167:16.3	Excellent, Master Gotama, excellent! …
an10.167:16.4	From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

an10.172:1.4	That is what the Buddha said.
an10.172:1.5	When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.
an10.172:2.1	Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants considered,
an10.172:2.2	“The Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail.

an10.172:8.2	Such is the consequence for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the Buddha, you overlooked him, imagining that you should ask me about this matter.
an10.172:8.3	For he is the Buddha, who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the truth, he is holiness. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of the deathless, the lord of truth, the Realized One.
an10.172:8.4	That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.
an10.172:8.5	You should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”
an10.172:9.1	“Certainly he is the Buddha, who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the truth, he is holiness. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of the deathless, the lord of truth, the Realized One.

an10.172:22.1	The Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail:
an10.172:22.2	‘You should know bad principles and good principles …
an10.172:22.3	and practice accordingly.’
an10.172:22.4	And this is how I understand the detailed meaning of this passage for recitation.
an10.172:22.5	If you wish, you may go to the Buddha and ask him about this.
an10.172:22.6	You should remember it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”
an10.172:23.1	“Yes, reverend,” said those mendicants, approving and agreeing with what Mahākaccāna said. Then they rose from their seats and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then they said:

an10.172:28.1	“Good, good, mendicants!
an10.172:28.2	Mahākaccāna is astute, he has great wisdom.
an10.172:28.3	If you came to me and asked this question, I would answer it in exactly the same way as Mahākaccāna.

an10.174:1.1	“Mendicants, I say that killing living creatures is threefold:
an10.174:1.2	caused by greed, hate, or delusion.
an10.174:2.1	I say that stealing is threefold:

an10.176:0.3	176. With Cunda
an10.176:1.1	So I have heard.
an10.176:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Pāvā in Cunda the smith’s mango grove.
an10.176:1.3	Then Cunda the smith went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,
an10.176:1.4	“Cunda, whose purity do you believe in?”
an10.176:1.5	“Sir, I believe in the purity advocated by the western brahmins draped with moss who carry pitchers, serve the sacred flame, and immerse themselves in water.”
an10.176:2.1	“But Cunda, what kind of purity do these western brahmins advocate?”
an10.176:2.2	“The western brahmins encourage their disciples like this:
an10.176:2.3	‘Please, good people, rising early you should stroke the earth from your bed.
an10.176:2.4	If you don’t stroke the earth, stroke fresh cow dung.
an10.176:2.5	If you don’t stroke fresh cow dung, stroke green grass.
an10.176:2.6	If you don’t stroke green grass, serve the sacred flame.
an10.176:2.7	If you don’t serve the sacred flame, revere the sun with joined palms.
an10.176:2.8	If you don’t revere the sun with joined palms, immerse yourself in water three times, including the evening.’
an10.176:2.9	The western brahmins advocate this kind of purity.”
an10.176:3.1	“The purity advocated by the western brahmins is quite different from that in the training of the Noble One.”
an10.176:3.2	“But what, Master Gotama, is purity in the training of the Noble One?
an10.176:3.3	Master Gotama, please teach me this.”
an10.176:4.1	“Well then, brahmin, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an10.176:4.2	“Yes, sir,” Cunda replied.
an10.176:4.3	The Buddha said this:
an10.176:5.1	“Cunda, impurity is threefold by way of body,
an10.176:5.2	fourfold by way of speech,
an10.176:5.3	and threefold by way of mind.
an10.176:6.1	And how is impurity threefold by way of body?
an10.176:6.2	It’s when a certain person kills living creatures. They’re violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.
an10.176:7.1	They steal. With the intention to commit theft, they take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.
an10.176:8.1	They commit sexual misconduct. They have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal.
an10.176:9.1	This is the threefold impurity by way of body.
an10.176:10.1	And how is impurity fourfold by way of speech?
an10.176:10.2	It’s when a certain person lies. They’re summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, mister, say what you know.’ Not knowing, they say ‘I know.’ Knowing, they say ‘I don’t know.’ Not seeing, they say ‘I see.’ And seeing, they say ‘I don’t see.’ So they deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason.
an10.176:11.1	They speak divisively. They repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. And so they divide those who are harmonious, supporting division, delighting in division, loving division, speaking words that promote division.
an10.176:12.1	They speak harshly. They use the kinds of words that are cruel, nasty, hurtful, offensive, bordering on anger, not leading to immersion.
an10.176:13.1	They talk nonsense. Their speech is untimely, and is neither factual nor beneficial. It has nothing to do with the teaching or the training. Their words have no value, and are untimely, unreasonable, rambling, and pointless.
an10.176:13.2	This is the fourfold impurity by way of speech.
an10.176:14.1	And how is impurity threefold by way of mind?
an10.176:14.2	It’s when a certain person is covetous. They covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‘Oh, if only their belongings were mine!’
an10.176:15.1	They have ill will and malicious intentions: ‘May these sentient beings be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!’
an10.176:16.1	They have wrong view. Their perspective is distorted:
an10.176:16.2	‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no obligation to mother and father. No beings are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’
an10.176:16.3	This is the threefold impurity by way of mind.
an10.176:17.1	These are the ten ways of doing unskillful deeds.
an10.176:17.2	When you have these ten ways of doing unskillful deeds, then if you rise early, whether or not you stroke the earth from your bed, you’re still impure.
an10.176:18.1	Whether or not you stroke fresh cow dung, you’re still impure.
an10.176:19.1	Whether or not you stroke green grass, you’re still impure.
an10.176:20.1	Whether or not you serve the sacred flame, you’re still impure.
an10.176:21.1	Whether or not you revere the sun with joined palms, you’re still impure.
an10.176:22.1	Whether or not you immerse yourself in water three times, you’re still impure.
an10.176:22.2	Why is that?
an10.176:22.3	These ten ways of doing unskillful deeds are impure and make things impure.
an10.176:23.1	It’s because of those who do these ten kinds of unskillful deeds that hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, or any other bad places are found.
an10.176:24.1	Cunda, purity is threefold by way of body,
an10.176:24.2	fourfold by way of speech,
an10.176:24.3	and threefold by way of mind.
an10.176:25.1	And how is purity threefold by way of body?
an10.176:25.2	It’s when a certain person gives up killing living creatures. They renounce the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings.
an10.176:26.1	They give up stealing. They don’t, with the intention to commit theft, take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.
an10.176:27.1	They give up sexual misconduct. They don’t have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They don’t have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal.
an10.176:28.1	This is the threefold purity by way of body.
an10.176:29.1	And how is purity fourfold by way of speech?
an10.176:29.2	It’s when a certain person gives up lying. They’re summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, mister, say what you know.’ Not knowing, they say ‘I don’t know.’ Knowing, they say ‘I know.’ Not seeing, they say ‘I don’t see.’ And seeing, they say ‘I see.’ So they don’t deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason.
an10.176:30.1	They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.
an10.176:31.1	They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people.
an10.176:32.1	They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training.
an10.176:32.2	They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.
an10.176:33.1	This is the fourfold purity by way of speech.
an10.176:34.1	And how is purity threefold by way of mind?
an10.176:34.2	It’s when a certain person is content. They don’t covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‘Oh, if only their belongings were mine!’
an10.176:35.1	They have a kind heart and loving intentions: ‘May these sentient beings live free of enmity and ill will, untroubled and happy!’
an10.176:36.1	They have right view, an undistorted perspective:
an10.176:36.2	‘There is meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There is obligation to mother and father. There are beings reborn spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are well attained and practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’
an10.176:37.1	This is the threefold purity by way of mind.
an10.176:38.1	These are the ten ways of doing skillful deeds.
an10.176:38.2	When you have these ten ways of doing skillful deeds, then if you rise early, whether or not you stroke the earth from your bed, you’re still pure.
an10.176:39.1	Whether or not you stroke fresh cow dung, you’re still pure.
an10.176:40.1	Whether or not you stroke green grass, you’re still pure.
an10.176:41.1	Whether or not you serve the sacred flame, you’re still pure.
an10.176:42.1	Whether or not you revere the sun with joined palms, you’re still pure.
an10.176:43.1	Whether or not you immerse yourself in water three times, you’re still pure.
an10.176:43.2	Why is that?
an10.176:43.3	These ten ways of doing skillful deeds are pure and make things pure.
an10.176:44.1	It’s because of those who do these ten kinds of skillful deeds that gods, humans, or any other good places are found.”
an10.176:45.1	When he said this, Cunda the smith said to the Buddha,
an10.176:45.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent! …
an10.176:45.3	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

an10.177:1.1	Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
an10.177:1.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,
an10.177:2.1	“We who are known as brahmins
an10.177:2.2	give gifts and perform memorial rites for the dead:
an10.177:2.3	‘May this gift aid my departed relatives and family. May they partake of this gift.’
an10.177:2.4	But does this gift really aid departed relatives and family?
an10.177:2.5	Do they actually partake of it?”
an10.177:2.6	“It aids them if the conditions are right, brahmin, but not if the conditions are wrong.”
an10.177:3.1	“Then, Master Gotama, what are the right and wrong conditions?”
an10.177:3.2	“Brahmin, take someone who kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, with wrong view.
an10.177:3.3	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in hell.
an10.177:3.4	There they survive feeding on the food of the hell beings.
an10.177:3.5	The conditions there are wrong, so the gift does not aid the one who lives there.
an10.177:4.1	Take someone else who kills living creatures … and has wrong view.
an10.177:4.2	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the animal realm.
an10.177:4.3	There they survive feeding on the food of the beings in the animal realm.
an10.177:4.4	The conditions there too are wrong, so the gift does not aid the one who lives there.
an10.177:5.1	Take someone else who doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, or use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. They're contented, kind-hearted, and have right view.
an10.177:5.2	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the human realm.
an10.177:5.3	There they survive feeding on human food.

an10.177:6.1	Take someone else who doesn’t kill living creatures … and has right view.
an10.177:6.2	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of the gods.
an10.177:6.3	There they survive feeding on the food of the gods.

an10.177:7.2	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the ghost realm.

an10.177:7.4	The conditions there are right, so the gift aids the one who lives there.”
an10.177:8.1	“But Master Gotama, who partakes of that gift if the departed relative is not reborn in that place?”
an10.177:8.2	“Other departed relatives reborn there will partake of that gift.”
an10.177:9.1	“But who partakes of the gift when neither that relative nor other relatives have been reborn in that place?”
an10.177:9.2	“It’s impossible, brahmin, it cannot happen that that place is vacant of departed relatives in all this long time.
an10.177:9.3	It’s never fruitless for the donor.”
an10.177:10.1	“Does Master Gotama propose this even when the conditions are wrong?”
an10.177:10.2	“I propose this even when the conditions are wrong.
an10.177:10.3	Take someone who kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, with wrong view.
an10.177:10.4	They give to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, perfumes, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting.

an10.177:18.1	“It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing,

an10.211:1.2	What ten?
an10.211:1.3	It’s when a certain person kills living creatures. They’re violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.
an10.211:2.1	They steal. With the intention to commit theft, they take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.
an10.211:3.1	They commit sexual misconduct. They have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal.
an10.211:4.1	They lie. They’re summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, mister, say what you know.’ Not knowing, they say ‘I know.’ Knowing, they say ‘I don’t know.’ Not seeing, they say ‘I see.’ And seeing, they say ‘I don’t see.’ So they deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason.
an10.211:5.1	They speak divisively. They repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. And so they divide those who are harmonious, supporting division, delighting in division, loving division, speaking words that promote division.
an10.211:6.1	They speak harshly. They use the kinds of words that are cruel, nasty, hurtful, offensive, bordering on anger, not leading to immersion.
an10.211:7.1	They talk nonsense. Their speech is untimely, and is neither factual nor beneficial. It has nothing to do with the teaching or the training. Their words have no value, and are untimely, unreasonable, rambling, and pointless.
an10.211:8.1	They’re covetous. They covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‘Oh, if only their belongings were mine!’
an10.211:9.1	They have ill will and malicious intentions: ‘May these sentient beings be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!’
an10.211:10.1	They have wrong view. Their perspective is distorted:
an10.211:11.1	‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no obligation to mother and father. No beings are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’

an10.211:12.1	Someone with ten qualities is raised up to heaven.
an10.211:12.2	What ten?
an10.211:12.3	It’s when a certain person gives up killing living creatures. They renounce the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings.
an10.211:13.1	They give up stealing. They don’t, with the intention to commit theft, take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.
an10.211:14.1	They give up sexual misconduct. They don’t have sex with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They don’t have sex with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal.

an10.219:1.1	“Mendicants, I don’t say that intentional deeds that have been performed and accumulated are eliminated without being experienced.
an10.219:1.2	And that may be in the present life, or in the next life, or in some subsequent period.
an10.219:1.3	And I don’t say that suffering is ended without experiencing intentional deeds that have been performed and accumulated.
an10.219:2.1	That noble disciple is rid of desire, rid of ill will, unconfused, aware, and mindful. They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
an10.219:3.1	They understand:
an10.219:3.2	‘Formerly my mind was limited and undeveloped. Now it’s limitless and well developed. Whatever limited deeds I’ve done don’t remain or persist there.’
an10.219:4.1	What do you think, mendicants?
an10.219:4.2	Suppose a child had developed the heart’s release by love from their childhood on. Would they still do any bad deed?”
an10.219:4.3	“No, sir.”
an10.219:5.1	“Not doing any bad deed, would they still experience any suffering?”
an10.219:5.2	“No, sir.

an10.220:1.1	Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.
an10.220:1.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:

an10.220:3.2	Please, Master Gotama, teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.”
an10.220:3.3	“Well then, brahmin, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an10.220:3.4	“Yes, sir,” the brahmin replied.
an10.220:3.5	The Buddha said this:

an11.2:2.1	When you have no regrets you need not make a wish:
an11.2:2.2	‘May I feel joy!’
an11.2:2.3	It’s only natural that joy springs up when you have no regrets.
an11.2:3.1	When you feel joy you need not make a wish:
an11.2:3.2	‘May I experience rapture!’
an11.2:3.3	It’s only natural that rapture arises when you’re joyful.
an11.2:4.1	When your mind is full of rapture you need not make a wish:
an11.2:4.2	‘May my body become tranquil!’
an11.2:4.3	It’s only natural that your body becomes tranquil when your mind is full of rapture.
an11.2:5.1	When your body is tranquil you need not make a wish:
an11.2:5.2	‘May I feel bliss!’
an11.2:5.3	It’s only natural to feel bliss when your body is tranquil.
an11.2:6.1	When you feel bliss you need not make a wish:
an11.2:6.2	‘May my mind be immersed in samādhi!’
an11.2:6.3	It’s only natural for the mind to become immersed in samādhi when you feel bliss.
an11.2:7.1	When your mind is immersed in samādhi you need not make a wish:
an11.2:7.2	‘May I truly know and see!’
an11.2:7.3	It’s only natural to truly know and see when your mind is immersed in samādhi.
an11.2:8.1	When you truly know and see you need not make a wish:
an11.2:8.2	‘May I grow disillusioned!’
an11.2:8.3	It’s only natural to grow disillusioned when you truly know and see.
an11.2:9.1	When you’re disillusioned you need not make a wish:
an11.2:9.2	‘May I become dispassionate!’
an11.2:9.3	It’s only natural to grow dispassionate when you’re disillusioned.
an11.2:10.1	When you’re dispassionate you need not make a wish:
an11.2:10.2	‘May I realize the knowledge and vision of freedom!’
an11.2:10.3	It’s only natural to realize the knowledge and vision of freedom when you’re dispassionate.
an11.2:11.1	And so, mendicants, the knowledge and vision of freedom is the purpose and benefit of dispassion. Dispassion is the purpose and benefit of disillusionment. Disillusionment is the purpose and benefit of truly knowing and seeing. Truly knowing and seeing is the purpose and benefit of immersion. Immersion is the purpose and benefit of bliss. Bliss is the purpose and benefit of tranquility. Tranquility is the purpose and benefit of rapture. Rapture is the purpose and benefit of joy. Joy is the purpose and benefit of not having regrets. Not having regrets is the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics.
an11.2:11.2	And so, mendicants, good qualities flow on and fill up from one to the other, for going from the near shore to the far shore.”

an11.7:1.1	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
an11.7:2.1	“Could it be, sir, that a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this? They wouldn’t perceive earth in earth, water in water, fire in fire, or air in air. And they wouldn’t perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness, or the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. They wouldn’t perceive this world in this world, or the other world in the other world. And they wouldn’t perceive what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind. And yet they would still perceive.”
an11.7:3.1	“It could be, Ānanda, that a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this. They wouldn’t perceive earth in earth, water in water, fire in fire, or air in air. And they wouldn’t perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness, or the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. They wouldn’t perceive this world in this world, or the other world in the other world. And they wouldn’t perceive what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind. And yet they would still perceive.”
an11.7:4.1	“But how could this be, sir?”
an11.7:5.1	“Ānanda, it’s when a mendicant perceives:
an11.7:5.2	‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.’
an11.7:5.3	That’s how a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this. They wouldn’t perceive earth in earth, water in water, fire in fire, or air in air. And they wouldn’t perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness, or the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. They wouldn’t perceive this world in this world, or the other world in the other world. And they wouldn’t perceive what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind. And yet they would still perceive.”
an11.7:6.1	And then Ānanda approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.
an11.7:6.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Sāriputta:
an11.7:7.1	“Could it be, reverend Sāriputta, that a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this? They wouldn’t perceive earth in earth … And they wouldn’t perceive what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind. And yet they would still perceive.”

an11.9:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house.
an11.9:1.2	Then Venerable Sandha went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
an11.9:2.1	“Sandha, meditate like a thoroughbred,
an11.9:2.2	not like a wild colt.
an11.9:2.3	And how does a wild colt meditate?
an11.9:2.4	A wild colt, tied up by the feeding trough, meditates: ‘Fodder, fodder!’
an11.9:2.5	Why is that?
an11.9:2.6	Because it doesn’t occur to the wild colt tied up by the feeding trough:
an11.9:2.7	‘What task will the horse trainer have me do today? How should I respond?’
an11.9:2.8	Tied up by the feeding trough they just meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’
an11.9:2.9	In the same way, take a certain wild person who has gone to the forest, the root of a tree, or an empty hut. Their heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire, and they don’t truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen.
an11.9:2.10	Harboring sensual desire within they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate.
an11.9:2.11	Their heart is overcome by ill will …
an11.9:2.12	dullness and drowsiness …
an11.9:2.13	restlessness and remorse …
an11.9:2.14	doubt …
an11.9:2.15	Harboring doubt within they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate.
an11.9:2.16	They meditate dependent on earth, water, fire, and air. They meditate dependent on the dimension of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, or neither perception nor non-perception. They meditate dependent on this world or the other world. They meditate dependent on what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind.
an11.9:2.17	That’s how a wild colt meditates.
an11.9:3.1	And how does a thoroughbred meditate?
an11.9:3.2	A fine thoroughbred, tied up by the feeding trough, doesn’t meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’
an11.9:3.3	Why is that?
an11.9:3.4	Because it occurs to the fine thoroughbred tied up by the feeding trough:
an11.9:3.5	‘What task will the horse trainer have me do today? How should I respond?’
an11.9:3.6	Tied up by the feeding trough they don’t meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’
an11.9:3.7	For that fine thoroughbred regards the use of the goad as a debt, a bond, a loss, a misfortune.
an11.9:3.8	In the same way, take a certain fine thoroughbred person who has gone to the forest, the root of a tree, or an empty hut. Their heart is not overcome and mired in sensual desire, and they truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen.
an11.9:3.9	Their heart is not overcome by ill will …
an11.9:3.10	dullness and drowsiness …
an11.9:3.11	restlessness and remorse …
an11.9:3.12	doubt …
an11.9:3.13	They don’t meditate dependent on earth, water, fire, and air. They don’t meditate dependent on the dimension of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, or neither perception nor non-perception. They don’t meditate dependent on this world or the other world. They don’t meditate dependent on what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind.
an11.9:3.14	Yet they do meditate.
an11.9:3.15	When a fine thoroughbred meditates like this, the gods together with Indra, Brahmā, and Pajāpati worship them from afar:
an11.9:4.1	‘Homage to you, O thoroughbred!
an11.9:4.2	Homage to you, supreme among men!
an11.9:4.3	We don’t understand
an11.9:4.4	the basis of your absorption.’”
an11.9:5.1	When he said this, Venerable Sandha asked the Buddha,
an11.9:5.2	“But sir, how does that fine thoroughbred meditate?”
an11.9:5.3	NA
an11.9:5.4	NA
an11.9:6.1	NA
an11.9:6.2	NA
an11.9:6.3	NA
an11.9:6.4	NA
an11.9:7.1	“Sandha, for a fine thoroughbred person, the perception of earth has vanished in relation to earth. The perception of water … fire … air has vanished in relation to air. The perception of the dimension of infinite space has vanished in relation to the dimension of infinite space. The perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness … nothingness … neither perception nor non-perception has vanished in relation to the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. The perception of this world has vanished in relation to this world. The perception of the other world has vanished in relation to the other world. And the perception of what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind has vanished.
an11.9:7.2	That’s how that fine thoroughbred person doesn’t meditate dependent on earth, water, fire, and air. They don’t meditate dependent on the dimension of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, or neither perception nor non-perception. They don’t meditate dependent on this world or the other world.
an11.9:7.3	They don’t meditate dependent on what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind.
an11.9:7.4	Yet they do meditate.
an11.9:7.5	When a fine thoroughbred person meditates like this, the gods together with Indra, Brahmā, and Pajāpati worship them from afar:
an11.9:8.1	‘Homage to you, O thoroughbred!
an11.9:8.2	Homage to you, supreme among men!

an11.10:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, at the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground.
an11.10:1.2	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
an11.10:1.3	“Mendicants!”
an11.10:1.4	“Venerable sir,” they replied.
an11.10:1.5	The Buddha said this:
an11.10:2.1	“Mendicants, a mendicant who has three qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans.
an11.10:2.2	What three?
an11.10:2.3	The entire spectrum of an adept’s ethics, immersion, and wisdom.
an11.10:2.4	A mendicant with these three qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans.
an11.10:3.1	A mendicant who has another three qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans.
an11.10:3.2	What three?
an11.10:3.3	A demonstration of psychic power, a demonstration of revealing, and a demonstration of instruction.
an11.10:3.4	A mendicant with these three qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans.
an11.10:4.1	A mendicant who has another three qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans.
an11.10:4.2	What three?
an11.10:4.3	Right view, right knowledge, and right freedom.
an11.10:4.4	A mendicant with these three qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans.
an11.10:5.1	A mendicant who has two qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans.
an11.10:5.2	What two?
an11.10:5.3	Knowledge and conduct.
an11.10:5.4	A mendicant with these two qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans.
an11.10:5.5	Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra also spoke this verse:
an11.10:6.1	‘The aristocrat is first among people
an11.10:6.2	who take clan as the standard.
an11.10:6.3	But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct
an11.10:6.4	is first among gods and humans.’
an11.10:7.1	Now, that verse spoken by Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s beneficial, not pointless, and I agree with it.
an11.10:7.2	I also say:
an11.10:8.1	‘The aristocrat is first among people
an11.10:8.2	who take clan as the standard.
an11.10:8.3	But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct

an11.11:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.
an11.11:1.2	At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that
an11.11:1.3	when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering.
an11.11:1.4	Mahānāma the Sakyan heard about this.
an11.11:1.5	NA
an11.11:1.6	NA
an11.11:2.1	He went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:

an11.11:2.3	several mendicants are making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that
an11.11:2.4	when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering.
an11.11:2.5	Now, we spend our life in various ways. Which of these should we practice?”
an11.11:3.1	“Good, good, Mahānāma!
an11.11:3.2	It’s appropriate that gentlemen such as you come to me and ask:
an11.11:3.3	‘We spend our life in various ways. Which of these should we practice?’
an11.11:3.4	The faithful succeed, not the faithless.

an11.11:3.12	When a noble disciple recollects the Realized One their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion.
an11.11:3.13	At that time their mind is unswerving, based on the Realized One.
an11.11:3.14	A noble disciple whose mind is unswerving finds inspiration in the meaning and the teaching, and finds joy connected with the teaching.
an11.11:3.15	When they’re joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when they’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.
an11.11:3.16	This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and developed the recollection of the Buddha.
an11.11:4.1	Furthermore, you should recollect the teaching:
an11.11:4.2	‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’

an11.11:5.2	‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’

an11.11:7.1	Furthermore, you should recollect your own generosity:
an11.11:7.2	‘I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate.
an11.11:7.3	Among people with hearts full of the stain of stinginess I live at home rid of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.’

an11.11:8.2	‘There are the Gods of the Four Great Kings, the Gods of the Thirty-Three, the Gods of Yama, the Joyful Gods, the Gods Who Love to Create, the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others, the Gods of Brahmā’s Host, and gods even higher than these.
an11.11:8.3	When those deities passed away from here, they were reborn there because of their faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. I, too, have the same kind of faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.’

an11.13:0.3	13. With Nandiya
an11.13:1.1	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.
an11.13:1.2	Now at that time the Buddha wanted to commence the rains residence at Sāvatthī.
an11.13:2.1	Nandiya the Sakyan heard about this,

an11.13:3.1	So the Buddha commenced the rains residence in Sāvatthī,
an11.13:3.2	and so did Nandiya.
an11.13:3.3	There he applied himself to his work and from time to time got to see the Buddha.
an11.13:3.4	At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that

an11.13:6.2	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
an11.13:6.3	In this way you should establish mindfulness internally based on the Realized One.

an11.13:7.2	‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’
an11.13:7.3	In this way you should establish mindfulness internally based on the teaching.
an11.13:8.1	Furthermore, you should recollect your good friends:
an11.13:8.2	‘I’m fortunate, so very fortunate,
an11.13:8.3	to have good friends who advise and instruct me out of kindness and compassion.’
an11.13:8.4	In this way you should establish mindfulness internally based on good friends.
an11.13:9.1	Furthermore, you should recollect your own generosity:
an11.13:9.2	‘I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate.
an11.13:9.3	Among people with hearts full of the stain of stinginess I live at home rid of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.’
an11.13:9.4	In this way you should establish mindfulness internally based on generosity.
an11.13:10.1	Furthermore, you should recollect the deities:
an11.13:10.2	‘There are deities who, surpassing the company of deities that consume solid food, are reborn in a certain host of mind-made deities. They don’t see in themselves anything more to do, or anything that needs improvement.’
an11.13:10.3	An irreversibly freed mendicant doesn’t see in themselves anything more to do, or anything that needs improvement.
an11.13:10.4	In the same way, Nandiya, there are deities who, surpassing the company of deities that consume solid food, are reborn in a certain host of mind-made deities. They don’t see in themselves anything more to do, or anything that needs improvement.
an11.13:10.5	In this way you should establish mindfulness internally based on the deities.
an11.13:11.1	A noble disciple who has these eleven qualities gives up bad, unskillful qualities and doesn’t cling to them.
an11.13:11.2	It’s like when a pot full of water is tipped over, so the water drains out and doesn’t go back in.
an11.13:11.3	Suppose there was an uncontrolled fire. It advances burning up dry woodlands and doesn’t go back over what it has burned.

an11.14:0.3	14. With Subhūti
an11.14:1.1	And then Venerable Subhūti together with the mendicant Saddha went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,
an11.14:1.2	“Subhūti, what is the name of this mendicant?”
an11.14:1.3	“Sir, the name of this mendicant is Saddha. He is the son of the layman Saddha, and has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness.”
an11.14:2.1	“Well, I hope this mendicant Saddha exhibits the outcomes of faith.”
an11.14:2.2	“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!
an11.14:2.3	Let the Buddha to speak on the outcomes of faith.
an11.14:2.4	Now I will find out whether or not this mendicant Saddha exhibits the outcomes of faith.”
an11.14:3.1	“Well then, Subhūti, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an11.14:3.2	“Yes, sir,” Subhūti replied.
an11.14:3.3	The Buddha said this:
an11.14:4.1	“Firstly, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
an11.14:4.2	When a mendicant is ethical, this is an outcome of faith.
an11.14:5.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.
an11.14:5.2	When a mendicant is learned, this is an outcome of faith.
an11.14:6.1	Furthermore, a mendicant has good friends, companions, and associates.
an11.14:6.2	When a mendicant has good friends, this is an outcome of faith.
an11.14:7.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is easy to admonish, having qualities that make them easy to admonish. They’re patient, and take instruction respectfully.
an11.14:7.2	When a mendicant is easy to admonish, this is an outcome of faith.
an11.14:8.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is deft and tireless in a diverse spectrum of duties for their spiritual companions, understanding how to go about things in order to complete and organize the work.
an11.14:8.2	When a mendicant is skilled and tireless in a diverse spectrum of duties, this is an outcome of faith.
an11.14:9.1	Furthermore, a mendicant loves the teachings and is a delight to converse with, being full of joy in the teaching and training.
an11.14:9.2	When a mendicant loves the teachings, this is an outcome of faith.
an11.14:10.1	Furthermore, a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.
an11.14:10.2	When a mendicant is energetic, this is an outcome of faith.
an11.14:11.1	Furthermore, a mendicant gets the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.
an11.14:11.2	When a mendicant gets the four absorptions, this is an outcome of faith.
an11.14:12.1	Furthermore, a mendicant recollects many kinds of past lives.
an11.14:12.2	That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
an11.14:12.3	When a mendicant recollects many kinds of past lives, this is an outcome of faith.
an11.14:13.1	Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, a mendicant sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
an11.14:13.2	When a mendicant has clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, this is an outcome of faith.
an11.14:14.1	Furthermore, a mendicant has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
an11.14:14.2	When a mendicant has ended the defilements, this is an outcome of faith.”
an11.14:15.1	When he said this, Venerable Subhūti said to the Buddha:
an11.14:15.2	“Sir, the outcomes of faith for a faithful person that the Buddha speaks of are found in this mendicant; he does exhibit them.
an11.14:16.1	This mendicant is ethical …
an11.14:17.1	This mendicant is learned …
an11.14:18.1	This mendicant has good friends …
an11.14:19.1	This mendicant is easy to admonish …
an11.14:20.1	This mendicant is skilled and tireless in a diverse spectrum of duties …
an11.14:21.1	This mendicant loves the teachings …
an11.14:22.1	This mendicant is energetic …
an11.14:23.1	This mendicant gets the four absorptions …
an11.14:24.1	This mendicant recollects their many kinds of past lives …
an11.14:25.1	This mendicant has clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human …
an11.14:26.1	This mendicant has ended the defilements …
an11.14:26.2	The outcomes of faith for a faithful person that the Buddha speaks of are found in this mendicant; he does exhibit them.”
an11.14:27.1	“Good, good, Subhūti!
an11.14:27.2	So, Subhūti, you should live together with this mendicant Saddha.
an11.14:27.3	And when you want to see the Realized One, you should come together with him.”

an11.15:1.1	“Mendicants, you can expect eleven benefits when the heart’s release by love has been cultivated, developed, and practiced, made a vehicle and a basis, kept up, consolidated, and properly implemented.
an11.15:2.1	What eleven?
an11.15:2.2	You sleep at ease. You wake happily. You don’t have bad dreams. Humans love you. Non-humans love you. Deities protect you. You can’t be harmed by fire, poison, or blade. Your mind quickly enters immersion. Your face is clear and bright. You don’t feel lost when you die. If you don’t penetrate any higher, you’ll be reborn in a Brahmā realm.

an11.16:0.3	16. The Man From the City of Aṭṭhaka
an11.16:1.1	At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva.
an11.16:1.2	Now at that time the householder Dasama from the city of Aṭṭhaka had arrived at Pāṭaliputta on some business.
an11.16:2.1	He went to the Chicken Monastery, approached a certain mendicant, and said to him,
an11.16:2.2	“Sir, where is Venerable Ānanda now staying?
an11.16:2.3	For I want to see him.”
an11.16:2.4	“Householder, Venerable Ānanda is staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva.”
an11.16:3.1	Then the householder Dasama, having concluded his business there, went to the little village of Beluva in Vesālī to see Ānanda. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to Ānanda:
an11.16:3.2	“Sir, Ānanda, is there one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary?”
an11.16:3.3	“There is, householder.”
an11.16:4.1	“And what is that one thing?”
an11.16:4.2	“Householder, it’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
an11.16:4.3	Then they reflect:
an11.16:4.4	‘Even this first absorption is produced by choices and intentions.’
an11.16:4.5	They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’
an11.16:4.6	Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.
an11.16:4.7	If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.
an11.16:4.8	This is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary.
an11.16:5.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption …
an11.16:5.2	third absorption …
an11.16:5.3	fourth absorption.
an11.16:5.4	Then they reflect:
an11.16:5.5	‘Even this fourth absorption is produced by choices and intentions.’
an11.16:5.6	They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’
an11.16:5.7	Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.
an11.16:5.8	If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.
an11.16:5.9	This too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary.
an11.16:6.1	Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
an11.16:6.2	Then they reflect:
an11.16:6.3	‘Even this heart’s release by love is produced by choices and intentions.’
an11.16:6.4	They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’
an11.16:6.5	Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.
an11.16:6.6	If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.
an11.16:6.7	This too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One …
an11.16:7.1	Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion …
an11.16:7.2	They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing …
an11.16:7.3	They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth.
an11.16:7.4	In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
an11.16:7.5	Then they reflect:
an11.16:7.6	‘Even this heart’s release by equanimity is produced by choices and intentions.’
an11.16:7.7	They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’
an11.16:7.8	Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.
an11.16:7.9	If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.
an11.16:7.10	This too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One …
an11.16:8.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.
an11.16:8.2	Then they reflect:
an11.16:8.3	‘Even this attainment of the dimension of infinite space is produced by choices and intentions.’
an11.16:8.4	They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’
an11.16:8.5	Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.
an11.16:8.6	If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.
an11.16:8.7	This too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One …
an11.16:9.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. …
an11.16:9.2	Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. …
an11.16:9.3	Then they reflect:
an11.16:9.4	‘Even this attainment of the dimension of nothingness is produced by choices and intentions.’
an11.16:9.5	They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’
an11.16:9.6	Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.
an11.16:9.7	If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.
an11.16:9.8	This too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they reach the supreme sanctuary.”
an11.16:10.1	When he said this, the householder Dasama said to Venerable Ānanda:
an11.16:10.2	“Sir, suppose a person was looking for an entrance to a hidden treasure. And all at once they’d come across eleven entrances!
an11.16:10.3	In the same way, I was searching for the door to the deathless. And all at once I got to hear of eleven doors to the deathless.
an11.16:10.4	Suppose a person had a house with eleven doors. If the house caught fire they’d be able to flee to safety through any one of those doors.
an11.16:10.5	In the same way, I’m able to flee to safety through any one of these eleven doors to the deathless.
an11.16:10.6	Sir, those who follow other paths will seek a fee for the teacher.
an11.16:10.7	Why shouldn’t I make an offering to Venerable Ānanda?”
an11.16:11.1	Then the householder Dasama, having assembled the Saṅgha from Vesālī and Pāṭaliputta, served and satisfied them with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods.
an11.16:11.2	He clothed each and every mendicant in a pair of garments, with a set of three robes for Ānanda.
an11.16:11.3	And he had a dwelling worth five hundred built for Ānanda.

an11.17:0.3	17. The Cowherd
an11.17:1.1	“Mendicants, a cowherd with eleven factors can’t maintain and expand a herd of cattle.
an11.17:1.2	What eleven?
an11.17:1.3	It’s when a cowherd doesn’t know form, is unskilled in characteristics, doesn’t pick out flies’ eggs, doesn’t dress wounds, doesn’t smoke out pests, doesn’t know the ford, doesn’t know satisfaction, doesn’t know the trail, is not skilled in pastures, milks dry, and doesn’t show extra respect to the bulls who are fathers and leaders of the herd.
an11.17:1.4	A cowherd with these eleven factors can’t maintain and expand a herd of cattle.
an11.17:2.1	In the same way, a mendicant with eleven qualities can’t achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training.
an11.17:2.2	What eleven?
an11.17:2.3	It’s when a mendicant doesn’t know form, is unskilled in characteristics, doesn’t pick out flies’ eggs, doesn’t dress wounds, doesn’t smoke out pests, doesn’t know the ford, doesn’t know satisfaction, doesn’t know the trail, is not skilled in pastures, milks dry, and doesn’t show extra respect to senior mendicants of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha.
an11.17:3.1	And how does a mendicant not know form?
an11.17:3.2	It’s when a mendicant doesn’t truly understand that all form is the four primary elements, or form derived from the four primary elements.
an11.17:3.3	That’s how a mendicant doesn’t know form.
an11.17:4.1	And how is a mendicant not skilled in characteristics?
an11.17:4.2	It’s when a mendicant doesn’t understand that a fool is characterized by their deeds, and an astute person is characterized by their deeds.
an11.17:4.3	That’s how a mendicant isn’t skilled in characteristics.
an11.17:5.1	And how does a mendicant not pick out flies’ eggs?
an11.17:5.2	It’s when a mendicant tolerates a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen. They don’t give it up, get rid of it, eliminate it, and obliterate it.
an11.17:5.3	They tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen. They don’t give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them.
an11.17:5.4	That’s how a mendicant doesn’t pick out flies’ eggs.
an11.17:6.1	And how does a mendicant not dress wounds?
an11.17:6.2	When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they get caught up in the features and details.
an11.17:6.3	Since the faculty of sight is left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion become overwhelming. They don’t practice restraint, they don’t protect the faculty of sight, and they don’t achieve its restraint.
an11.17:6.4	When they hear a sound with their ears …
an11.17:6.5	When they smell an odor with their nose …
an11.17:6.6	When they taste a flavor with their tongue …
an11.17:6.7	When they feel a touch with their body …
an11.17:6.8	When they know a thought with their mind, they get caught up in the features and details.
an11.17:6.9	Since the faculty of the mind is left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion become overwhelming. They don’t practice restraint, they don’t protect the faculty of the mind, and they don’t achieve its restraint.
an11.17:6.10	That’s how a mendicant doesn’t dress wounds.
an11.17:7.1	And how does a mendicant not smoke out pests?
an11.17:7.2	It’s when a mendicant doesn’t teach others the Dhamma in detail as they learned and memorized it.
an11.17:7.3	That’s how a mendicant doesn’t smoke out pests.
an11.17:8.1	And how does a mendicant not know the ford?
an11.17:8.2	It’s when a mendicant doesn’t from time to time go up to those mendicants who are very learned—knowledgeable in the scriptures, who have memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the outlines—and ask them questions:
an11.17:8.3	‘Why, sir, does it say this? What does that mean?’
an11.17:8.4	Those venerables don’t clarify what is unclear, reveal what is obscure, and dispel doubt regarding the many doubtful matters.
an11.17:8.5	That’s how a mendicant doesn’t know the ford.
an11.17:9.1	And how does a mendicant not know satisfaction?
an11.17:9.2	It’s when a mendicant, when the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One are being taught, finds no inspiration in the meaning and the teaching, and finds no joy connected with the teaching.
an11.17:9.3	That’s how a mendicant doesn’t know satisfaction.
an11.17:10.1	And how does a mendicant not know the trail?
an11.17:10.2	It’s when a mendicant doesn’t truly understand the noble eightfold path.
an11.17:10.3	That’s how a mendicant doesn’t know the trail.
an11.17:11.1	And how is a mendicant not skilled in pastures?
an11.17:11.2	It’s when a mendicant doesn’t truly understand the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.
an11.17:11.3	That’s how a mendicant is not skilled in pastures.
an11.17:12.1	And how does a mendicant milk dry?
an11.17:12.2	It’s when a mendicant is invited by a householder to accept robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. But they don’t know moderation in accepting.
an11.17:12.3	That’s how a mendicant milks dry.
an11.17:13.1	And how does a mendicant not show extra respect to senior mendicants of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha?
an11.17:13.2	It’s when a mendicant doesn’t consistently treat senior mendicants of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha with kindness by way of body, speech, and mind, both in public and in private.
an11.17:13.3	That’s how a mendicant doesn’t show extra respect to senior mendicants of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha.
an11.17:14.1	A mendicant with these eleven qualities can’t achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training.

an11.17:19.1	And how does a mendicant pick out flies’ eggs?
an11.17:19.2	It’s when a mendicant doesn’t tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen, but gives it up, gets rid of it, eliminates it, and exterminates it. They don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them.

an11.17:20.3	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.

an11.18:2.1	“Could it be, sir, that a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this? They wouldn’t perceive earth in earth, water in water, fire in fire, or air in air. And they wouldn’t perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness, or the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. They wouldn’t perceive this world in this world, or the other world in the other world. And they wouldn’t perceive what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind. And yet they would still perceive.”
an11.18:3.1	“It could be, mendicants.”
an11.18:4.1	“But how could this be?”
an11.18:5.1	“It’s when a mendicant perceives:
an11.18:5.2	‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.’

an11.19:3.3	The Buddha said this:
an11.19:4.1	“A mendicant could gain such a state of immersion.”
an11.19:5.1	“But how could this be?”
an11.19:6.1	“It’s when a mendicant perceives:
an11.19:6.2	‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.’
an11.19:6.3	That’s how a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this. They wouldn’t perceive earth in earth, water in water, fire in fire, or air in air. And they wouldn’t perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness, or the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. They wouldn’t perceive this world in this world, or the other world in the other world. And they wouldn’t perceive what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind. And yet they would still perceive.”

an11.20:1.1	And then several mendicants went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.
an11.20:1.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him:
an11.20:2.1	“Could it be, reverend, that a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this? They wouldn’t perceive earth in earth, water in water, fire in fire, or air in air. And they wouldn’t perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness, or the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.

an11.20:2.2	“It could be, reverends.”

an11.21:1.1	There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:
an11.21:1.2	“Could it be, reverends, that a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this? They wouldn’t perceive earth in earth, water in water, fire in fire, or air in air. And they wouldn’t perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness, or the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.

an11.21:2.1	“Reverend, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta.
an11.21:2.2	May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this.
an11.21:2.3	The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
an11.21:3.1	“Then listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
an11.21:3.2	“Yes, friend,” they replied.
an11.21:3.3	Sāriputta said this:
an11.21:4.1	“A mendicant could gain such a state of immersion.”
an11.21:5.1	“But how could this be?”
