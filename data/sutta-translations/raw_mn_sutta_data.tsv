mn1:0.1	Middle Discourses 1	NA
mn1:0.2	The Root of All Things	NA
mn1:1.1	So I have heard.	Just as the Dīghanikāya begins with the complex and demanding Brahmajālasutta, the Majjhima opens with one of the most abstruse discourses in the canon. It examines the ways that the process of perception and identification evolves with progress on the path. It was translated, together with its commentary and extensive analysis, by Bhikkhu Bodhi as *The Discourse on the Root of Existence*. The commentarial background is also found in the Mūlapariyāya Jātaka ([ja245]()). The commentary connects this sutta with the Gotamakacetiyasutta ([an3.125]()), but there is no internal evidence to support this.
mn1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Ukkaṭṭhā, in the Subhaga Forest at the root of a magnificent sal tree.	Ukkaṭṭhā, near Sāvatthī, is mentioned only rarely, and always in the context of extraordinary teachings and events that emphasize the cosmic grandeur of the Buddha against the brahmins, likely because it was the home of the prominent Kosalan brahmin Pokkharasāti ([dn3:1.2.1](), [dn14:3.29.1](), [mn49:2.1]()).
mn1:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn1:1.4	“Mendicants!”	The pattern of this discourse answers to such passages as Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.7, where Yājñavalkya expounds a series of principles in relation to which the “immortal self” is conceived. The commentary says that this discourse was delivered to a group of former brahmins who had become conceited when they learned the Buddha’s teaching. While the text certainly responds to ideas and methods of Brahmanical texts, that interpretation is not supported by the text.
mn1:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn1:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn1:2.1	“Mendicants, I will teach you the explanation of the root of all things.	In his third discourse, speaking to Brahmanical ascetics, the Buddha reframed the “all” as the experience of the six senses ([sn35.28]()). The distinctive “conceiving” pattern of this sutta is therefore also applied to the “all” of the six senses ([sn35.30:1.19](), [sn35.90:3.7]()). More broadly, the same pattern is also applied to the “aggregates, elements, and sense fields” ([sn35.31:1.21](), [sn35.91:4.1]()). | The meaning of “root” is clarified later ([mn1:171.4]()) as “taking pleasure”, i.e. craving, which is the “root” of suffering.
mn1:2.2	Listen and apply your minds well, I will speak.”	NA
mn1:2.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
mn1:2.4	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn1:3.1	“Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.	An “unlearned ordinary person”, who has not realized any of the stages of the noble path, is contrasted with one who has entered the path. | “Noble one” (_ariya_) loosely conveys the sense “cultured” or “civilized”; it is a term for the inheritors of the Aryan culture that originated among the proto-Indo-European peoples of the central Asian steppes. | “True person” (_sappurisa_) indicates one who is authentic and genuine in their realization of the truth, and hence is virtuous and good. Both “noble one” and “true person” are technical terms referring to any person who has at least entered the path to stream-entry.
mn1:3.2	They perceive earth as earth.	Although their perception (_saññā_) is accurate, to perceive something “as” something is to recognize it filtered through memory and concepts learned in the past, a subtle pre-processing that interprets present experience in light of expectations and desires. | The ending _-to_ here and throughout is the “ablative of perspective”, which is used with verbs of cognition to express the idea of seeing something in a certain light; for example, one contemplates the body “as impermanent” ([mn74:9.1]()).
mn1:3.3	Having perceived earth as earth, they conceive it to be earth, they conceive it in earth, they conceive it as earth, they conceive that ‘earth is mine’, they approve earth.	To “conceive” or “imagine” (_maññati_) is, according to the commentary, to think in terms of a “self”, proliferating experience through craving, conceit, or views until it is constructed *for me*. This usage draws upon such passages as Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.20, where due to ignorance, a person “imagines” in a dream the fearful things they saw when awake, or at the highest level, “imagines I am this all” (_ahamevedaṁ sarvo’smīti manyate_). | Each of the five phrases takes the “perception of earth as earth” and conceives, imagines, or construes that perception in progressively more differentiated and objectified ways, until it becomes something that is owned and enjoyed.
mn1:3.4	Why is that?	NA
mn1:3.5	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	“Complete understanding” (_pariññā_) is the understanding of the arahant that permanently cuts through all delusions and conceits.
mn1:4.1	They perceive water as water.	The sutta proceeds through the four main physical elements or properties before proceeding to beings and then various deities. The difference between these things is not as clear-cut as one might think. The elements were worshiped as gods, while the gods were often anthropomorphized natural phenomena such as the sky (_deva_) or the sun (“streaming radiance”). To identify with a material element is to share the essence of a powerful force of nature. | A similar list, but with fewer items, is found starting at [mn49:11.1]().

mn1:6.3	Why is that?	NA
mn1:6.4	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	NA
mn1:7.1	They perceive creatures as creatures.	“Creatures” (_bhūta_) can refer to any living being, including humans and animals, as well as invisible entities such as ghosts.

mn1:7.3	Why is that?	NA
mn1:7.4	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	NA
mn1:8.1	They perceive gods as gods.	“Gods” (_deva_) or “deities” (_devatā_) is a generic description of the many divine entities of ancient Indian belief. Some were inherited from the old Vedic theology, while others reflect local customs and beliefs. All are impermanent and subject to suffering.
mn1:8.2	Having perceived gods as gods, they conceive them to be gods …	NA
mn1:8.3	Why is that?	NA
mn1:8.4	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	NA
mn1:9.1	They perceive the Progenitor as the Progenitor.	This is Pajāpati, the lonely creator god of Vedic belief. Having set the world in motion he was largely forgotten.
mn1:9.2	Having perceived the Progenitor as the Progenitor, they conceive him to be the Progenitor …	NA
mn1:9.3	Why is that?	NA
mn1:9.4	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	NA
mn1:10.1	They perceive the Divinity as the Divinity.	Brahmā is also regarded as a creator, but in the sense of the underlying divine force that sustains the life of the cosmos. In Buddhism, several individual Brahmās appear, depicted as high deities who achieved their status due to the practice of first _jhāna_ in a past life.
mn1:10.2	Having perceived the Divinity as the Divinity, they conceive him to be the Divinity …	NA
mn1:10.3	Why is that?	NA
mn1:10.4	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	NA
mn1:11.1	They perceive those of streaming radiance as those of streaming radiance.	This and the next two are higher Brahmā realms. Beings in this realm are sometimes called “gods” (_devā_). They achieved their status through the second, third, and fourth _jhānas_ respectively. Later Brahmanical texts mention a class of Ābhāsvara deities, but it does not appear to be a Vedic concept.
mn1:11.2	Having perceived those of streaming radiance as those of streaming radiance, they conceive them to be those of streaming radiance …	NA
mn1:11.3	Why is that?	NA
mn1:11.4	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	NA
mn1:12.1	They perceive those of universal beauty as those of universal beauty.	“Universal beauty” is _subhakiṇha_. _Subha_ is “beauty, radiance”. _Kiṇha_ is “universal, entire, total” (= Sanskrit _kṛtsna_); the same word is the basis for the meditation on “universals” (_kasiṇa_). The concept appears to be Buddhist, but we find a precedent when Yājñavalkya says that, just as salt is “entirely” salty, the Self is an “entire mass of consciousness” (_kṛtsnaḥ prajñānaghana eva_, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.5.13).
mn1:12.2	But then they conceive them to be those of universal beauty …	NA
mn1:12.3	Why is that?	NA
mn1:12.4	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	NA
mn1:13.1	They perceive those of abundant fruit as those of abundant fruit.	The gods of “abundant fruit” (_vehapphala_; Sanskrit _bṛhatphala_) do not appear in Brahmanical literature, but _bṛhat_ is a common descriptor of divinity. See eg. the Vedic god Bṛhaspati, identified with the planet Jupiter, or Rig Veda 9.107.15, which describes Soma as _ṛtam bṛhat_, “vast and true”.
mn1:13.2	Having perceived those of abundant fruit as those of abundant fruit, they conceive them to be those of abundant fruit …	NA
mn1:13.3	Why is that?	NA
mn1:13.4	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	NA
mn1:14.1	They perceive the Vanquisher as the Vanquisher.	“Vanquisher” (_abhibhū_) is an epithet of Brahmā ([mn49:5.2]()) that was appropriated for the Buddha ([an4.23:5.1]()). In Rig Veda 8.97.10 it is an epithet of Indra, but it is not a regular name for a deity in either Buddhism or Brahmanism. Here it appears to be the name of the highest of the Brahmā gods.
mn1:14.2	Having perceived the Vanquisher as the Vanquisher, they conceive him to be the Vanquisher …	NA
mn1:14.3	Why is that?	NA
mn1:14.4	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	NA
mn1:15.1	They perceive the dimension of infinite space as the dimension of infinite space.	Here begins the series of realms associated with the practice of formless meditations. These were practiced by the most advanced non-dualist Brahmanical teachers before the Buddha, who identified such experiences with the highest Self that is the cosmic divinity. The Buddha adopted the practices as part of the development of meditation, divesting them of metaphysical significance.
mn1:15.2	Having perceived the dimension of infinite space as the dimension of infinite space, they conceive it to be the dimension of infinite space …	“Space” (_ākāsa_) is a principle of deep significance in the Upaniṣads, yet it is ultimately a lesser manifestation of the Absolute. See eg. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.8.7; Taittirīya Upaniṣad 2.1.1; Chāndogya Upaniṣad 7.12.
mn1:15.3	Why is that?	NA
mn1:15.4	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	NA
mn1:16.1	They perceive the dimension of infinite consciousness as the dimension of infinite consciousness.	“Infinite consciousness” is identified with the highest Self by Yājñavalkya at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12.
mn1:16.2	Having perceived the dimension of infinite consciousness as the dimension of infinite consciousness, they conceive it to be the dimension of infinite consciousness …	NA

mn1:17.1	They perceive the dimension of nothingness as the dimension of nothingness.	Taught by the Brahmanical sage Āḷāra Kālāma at [mn26:15.13]().

mn1:17.3	Why is that?	NA
mn1:17.4	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	NA
mn1:18.1	They perceive the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception as the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	Taught by the Brahmanical sage Uddaka Rāmaputta at [mn26:16.13]().
mn1:18.2	Having perceived the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception as the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, they conceive it to be the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception …	NA
mn1:18.3	Why is that?	NA
mn1:18.4	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	NA
mn1:19.1	They perceive the seen as the seen.	The discourse presents four items—the seen, heard, thought, and known—which describe the means of knowing spiritual truths: the sight of a holy person, hearing a teaching, contemplating the truth, and meditative awareness. This framework, which is found commonly in the suttas, was adopted from Yājñavalkya; for example at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.8.11 he describes the Absolute as “the unseen seer, the unheard hearer, the unthought thinker, the unknown knower”.
mn1:19.2	Having perceived the seen as the seen, they conceive it to be the seen …	See [snp4.4]() for a more detailed critique of “seeing” a holy person as a standard of truth.
mn1:19.3	Why is that?	NA
mn1:19.4	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	NA
mn1:20.1	They perceive the heard as the heard.	This refers to teachings that are “heard” or passed down in oral tradition. It includes Vedic scriptures (_śruti_) that were believed to have been “heard” or transmitted by divine inspiration, as well Buddhist scriptures, which begin, “So I have heard”. No scripture is infallible ([mn76:25.2]()).
mn1:20.2	Having perceived the heard as the heard, they conceive it to be the heard …	NA
mn1:20.3	Why is that?	NA
mn1:20.4	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	NA
mn1:21.1	They perceive the thought as the thought.	_Muta_ means “(what is) thought”, but is often mistranslated as “sensed”, a meaning that does not apply in the early texts. Philosophical thought, like scripture, is fallible ([mn76:27.3]()), but people get attached to their theories ([snp4.5]()).
mn1:21.2	Having perceived the thought as the thought, they conceive it to be the thought …	NA
mn1:21.3	Why is that?	NA
mn1:21.4	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	NA
mn1:22.1	They perceive the known as the known.	The “known” (_viññāta_) is that which is cognized with consciousness (_viññāṇa_), especially states of expanded consciousness in deep meditation. Even such states are not immune to misinterpretation (eg. [mn136:9.1](), [dn1:1.31.1]()).
mn1:22.2	Having perceived the known as the known, they conceive it to be the known …	NA
mn1:22.3	Why is that?	NA
mn1:22.4	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	NA
mn1:23.1	They perceive oneness as oneness.	Perception of “oneness” (_ekatta_) sees the world as manifold reflections of an underlying unity. Arising from meditative experience or philosophical reflection, it is associated with the non-dual schools of Brahmanism. Īśa Upaniṣad 7, for example, speaks of “contemplating the oneness” (_ekatvam anupaśyataḥ_) of all creatures with the supreme soul. Yājñavalkya said in the state of non-differentiation the Self “becomes clear as water, one, the seer without a second; this is the Brahmā realm” (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.32: _salila eko draṣṭādvaito bhavati, eṣa brahmalokaḥ_).
mn1:23.2	Having perceived oneness as oneness, they conceive it to be oneness …	NA
mn1:23.3	Why is that?	NA
mn1:23.4	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	NA
mn1:24.1	They perceive diversity as diversity.	“Diversity” (_nānatta_) is the opposite fallacy to “oneness”; based on the diversity of sense experience, it interprets the world as irreducibly manifold. An example would be the Jains, who believed the world was made up of countless separate entities, a view criticized in Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 3.13 (_nānātvaṁ nindyate_). Both these fallacies take a particular mode of perception, which is true in certain respects, and apply it as an absolute.
mn1:24.2	Having perceived diversity as diversity, they conceive it to be diversity …	NA
mn1:24.3	Why is that?	NA
mn1:24.4	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	NA
mn1:25.1	They perceive all as all.	The “all” is another critical term in the Upaniṣads, representing the totality of creation as an expression of divinity. See eg. Chāndogya Upaniṣad 7.25.2, “the self is all this” (_ātmaivedaṁ sarvamiti_), or Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.5.19, “this self that experiences all is divinity” (_ayam ātmā brahma sarvānubhūḥ_).
mn1:25.2	Having perceived all as all, they conceive it to be all …	NA
mn1:25.3	Why is that?	NA
mn1:25.4	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	NA
mn1:26.1	They perceive extinguishment as extinguishment.	It is puzzling to see “extinguishment” (_nibbāna_; Sanskrit _nirvāṇa_) here, as it is the end of conceiving. The similar sequence at [mn49:23.1]() culminates with “all”. Three interpretations: (1) *Simple textual error*. Of the three Chinese parallels, EA 44.6 mentions _nibbāna_ here, while MA 106 and T 56 do not. If two separate texts have the same error, it predates the separation between the schools, or arose later through contamination. (2) *The five kinds of “extinguishment in the present life”*. These are false liberations believed by sectarians (Brahmajālasutta, [dn1:3.19.1]()). The commentary says they are meant here, but it seems unlikely, given that below the stream-enterer is enjoined to not identify with _nibbāna_, whereas they have already dispelled such misconceptions of the path. (3) *An unenlightened person’s misconception of the Buddhist goal*. At least some ancient Buddhists read it this way, as this passage is quoted in an Abhidhamma discussion as to whether the deathless as an object of thought can be a fetter (Kathāvatthu 9.2). The Theravāda commentary, rejecting this, says it was the view of the Pubbaseliyas, a branch of the Mahāsaṅghikas.
mn1:26.2	Having perceived extinguishment as extinguishment, they conceive it to be extinguishment, they conceive it in extinguishment, they conceive it as extinguishment, they conceive that ‘extinguishment is mine’, they approve extinguishment.	NA
mn1:26.3	Why is that?	NA
mn1:26.4	Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.	NA
mn1:26.5	NA	NA
mn1:27.1	A mendicant who is a trainee, who hasn’t achieved their heart’s desire, but lives aspiring to the supreme sanctuary from the yoke, directly knows earth as earth.	A “trainee” (_sekha_), who has realized stream-entry, once-return, or non-return, has had a vision of the path and Nibbāna. Yet since they have not fully relinquished the fetters that bind them to transmigration, they continue to deepen their practice of the noble eightfold path. Their “direct knowing” (_abhiññā_) is purified by the twin powers of _samatha_ and _vipassanā_ meditation, rather than “perception” (_saññā_), which is filtered through the five hindrances and other cognitive distortions. This distinction between perception and higher awareness (_vijñāna_ or _prajñāna_) was first made by Yājñavalkya (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12 and 4.5.13).
mn1:27.2	Having directly known earth as earth, let them not conceive it to be earth, let them not conceive it in earth, let them not conceive it as earth, let them not conceive that ‘earth is mine’, let them not approve earth.	The sutta depicts progress through the path in three grammatical modes. The ordinary person conceives; the trainee ought not conceive; the perfected one does not conceive. This echoes the “three rounds” of the first sermon (Dhammacakkappavattanasutta, [sn56.11]()): “there is” suffering; suffering “should be understood”; suffering “has been understood”.

The “perfected one” is the _arahant_, literally “worthy one”, who is the Buddhist spiritual ideal.

mn1:147.1	The Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha directly knows earth as earth.	The Buddha is an _arahant_, and he shares his fundamental understanding with other arahants. Yet the suttas elevate his understanding as the one who discovered the path.

mn1:171.4	Because he has understood that approval is the root of suffering,	This clarifies an ambiguity in the phrase “approve” (or “delights”, “relishes”, _(abhi)-nandati_). This can have a positive sense, as the audience normally “approves” the Buddha’s teachings (but see the end of this sutta). Here, however, the Buddha clarifies that he is using “approve” in the sense of craving, as it is found in the standard definition of the second noble truth ([sn56.11:4.4]()).
mn1:171.5	and that rebirth comes from continued existence; whoever has come to be gets old and dies.	With these lines the Buddha connects the teachings of this sutta with dependent origination. He employs a similar strategy at the end of the Brahmajālasutta.

mn1:194.8	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn1:194.9	But the mendicants did not approve what the Buddha said.	That they “did not approve” (_na abhinanduṁ_) is confirmed in the commentary and in the parallel at EA 44.6, which explains that the mendicants did not understand the discourse. Alternatively, some modern interpreters (Bodhi, Ñāṇananda), relying on the commentarial background explanation, suggest that the problem was that they understood it all too well and were not happy that their beliefs were challenged. These explanations, however, do not take into account the centrality of “approval” (_nanda_)—it is literally the “root” that lends the discourse its title. Given that an arahant does not “approve” even Nibbāna, and that “approval” is the root of suffering, is it any wonder that the audience did not “approve” the teaching? It is not that they did not understand, nor that their understanding threatened their egos, but that they understood so well that they received the teaching with perfect equanimity. Elsewhere the Buddha urged that one should “neither approve (_abhinandati_) nor dismiss” a teaching ([an4.180:2.5]() = [dn16:4.8.4](), [dn29:18.4](), [mn112:3.1]()). It seems that the normal response, where the audience approves a teaching with pleasure, is meant in a conventional sense, whereas this sutta shows how for an arahant all such responses are transcended.
mn2:0.1	Middle Discourses 2	NA
mn2:0.2	All the Defilements	NA
mn2:1.1	So I have heard.	A difficult philosophical text opens both the Dīghanikāya (Brahmajālasutta) and the Majjhimanikāya (Mūlapariyāyasutta) followed by a more practical teaching (Sāmaññaphalasutta, Sabbāsavasutta).
mn2:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn2:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn2:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn2:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn2:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn2:2.1	“Mendicants, I will teach you the explanation of the restraint of all defilements.	“Defilements” (_āsava_) are the fundamental “pollutions” or “corruptions” that darken awareness, trapping people in transmigration. In practical application, _āsava_ can mean the “discharge” from a sore ([an3.27:2.4]()). The Jain Tattvārthasūtra 6.1–2 defines _āsrava_ as the influx of deeds; these pollute the pure soul. | Note that the Pali _āsava_ represents two distinct words, which are homonyms in Pali but differentiated in Sanskrit. The word here is Sanskrit _āsrava_ (or _āśrava_), whereas Sanskrit _āsava_ means “intoxicant”, a sense found elsewhere in Pali ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:2.1.4]()).
mn2:2.2	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	This opening follows the pattern of [mn1]().
mn2:2.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
mn2:2.4	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn2:3.1	“Mendicants, I say that the ending of defilements is for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know or see.	The “ending of defilements” (_āsavānaṁ khayaṁ_) is a common sutta term for arahantship. | “Knowing and seeing” refers to the penetrating insight that arises from meditative immersion (_samādhi_, eg. [an5.168:2.2](), [an10.2:2.3](), [sn12.23:6.18](), [dn2:83.1]()).
mn2:3.2	For one who knows and sees what?	NA
mn2:3.3	Rational application of mind and irrational application of mind.	“Rational application of mind” (_yoniso manasikāra_) is a distinctively Buddhist term. It draws on the frequent Vedic image of the “womb of truth” (_yonāv ṛtasya_, Rig Veda 9.13.9), the source of the laws and patterns that govern the natural order. The idea is that by applying the mind by way of cause or reason the hidden truth can be uncovered. Here the meditator’s insight is framed not as uncovering the objective truth about the world, but as reflexively understanding the means of insight itself.
mn2:3.4	When you apply the mind irrationally, defilements arise, and once arisen they grow.	This passage and the next are comparable to the contemplation of the principles of the five hindrances and the seven awakening factors respectively in the fourth section of mindfulness meditation (_dhammānupassanā_; see [mn10:36.4]()).
mn2:3.5	When you apply the mind rationally, defilements don’t arise, and those that have already arisen are given up.	NA
mn2:4.1	Some defilements should be given up by seeing, some by restraint, some by using, some by enduring, some by avoiding, some by dispelling, and some by developing.	Here the Buddha gives the scheme of the sutta: seven methods for getting rid of defilements. Omitting the defilements given up by seeing, the remainder are found at [an6.58]().
mn2:5.0	1. Defilements Given Up by Seeing	NA
mn2:5.1	And what are the defilements that should be given up by seeing?	“Seeing” (_dassana_) the four noble truths with the wisdom of insight.
mn2:5.2	Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.	“Noble Ones” (_ariyā_) and “true persons” (_sappurisā_) both refer to the eight kinds of individual who have entered the eightfold path to awakening.
mn2:5.3	They don’t understand to which things they should apply the mind and to which things they should not apply the mind.	NA
mn2:5.4	So they apply the mind to things they shouldn’t and don’t apply the mind to things they should.	NA
mn2:6.1	And what are the things to which they apply the mind but should not?	NA
mn2:6.2	They are the things that, when the mind is applied to them, give rise to unarisen defilements and make arisen defilements grow: the defilements of sensual desire,	This indicates one sense of what “irrational” means: it creates the very things that one is trying to escape.
mn2:6.3	desire to be reborn,	NA
mn2:6.4	and ignorance.	NA
mn2:6.5	These are the things to which they apply the mind but should not.	NA
mn2:6.6	And what are the things to which they do not apply the mind but should?	NA
mn2:6.7	They are the things that, when the mind is applied to them, do not give rise to unarisen defilements and give up arisen defilements: the defilements of sensual desire,	NA
mn2:6.8	desire to be reborn,	NA
mn2:6.9	and ignorance.	NA
mn2:6.10	These are the things to which they do not apply the mind but should.	NA
mn2:7.1	Because of applying the mind to what they should not and not applying the mind to what they should, unarisen defilements arise and arisen defilements grow.	NA
mn2:7.2	This is how they apply the mind irrationally:	NA
mn2:7.3	‘Did I exist in the past? Did I not exist in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? After being what, what did I become in the past?	These are existential questions framed from a metaphysical perspective, i.e. they are based on the underlying assumption of a self. They are “irrational” because they avoid the question of cause: they only ask *what* happens, not *why* it happens.
mn2:7.4	Will I exist in the future? Will I not exist in the future? What will I be in the future? How will I be in the future? After being what, what will I become in the future?’	NA
mn2:7.5	Or they are undecided about the present thus:	NA
mn2:7.6	‘Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? This sentient being—where did it come from? And where will it go?’	NA
mn2:8.1	When they apply the mind irrationally in this way, one of the following six views arises in them and is taken as a genuine fact.	To wonder is natural, but when we take speculations seriously they become dogmas, insisted on as the truth, though in reality we have no way of knowing.
mn2:8.2	The view: ‘My self survives.’	See also the discussions on the “self” at [sn44.10]() and “gods” at [mn100:42.4](). All three passages are phrased the same way. In each case the question, drawing on the doubts about the past and future as depicted above, is whether the self continues to exist (_atthi_) or not (_natthi_) after death.
mn2:8.3	The view: ‘My self does not survive.’	NA
mn2:8.4	The view: ‘I perceive the self with the self.’	Compare Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.23, which, in a discussion of the hereafter, says that a sage who is tamed and stilled (_samāhito_) “sees the self in the self” (_ātmanyevātmānaṁ paśyati_). Note the different verb here; unlike the Upaniṣad, the sutta is not speaking of a sage who “sees” but of a theorist who “perceives”.
mn2:8.5	The view: ‘I perceive what is not-self with the self.’	The method of negation was employed by Yājñavalkya to discard false, shallow views of the Self: “This Self is that which is not that, not that” (_sa eṣa neti netyātmā_, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.5.15, etc.).
mn2:8.6	The view: ‘I perceive the self with what is not-self.’	The theorist still relies on perception (_saññā_) and hence does not see the Self, which is pure _viññāṇa_ cognized by _viññāṇa_: “Through what should one know the Knower?” (_vijñātāramare kena vijānīyāt_, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.14).
mn2:8.7	Or they have such a view:	NA
mn2:8.8	‘This self of mine is he, the speaker, the knower who experiences the results of good and bad deeds in all the different realms. This self is permanent, everlasting, eternal, and imperishable, and will last forever and ever.’	This view, attributed to the mendicant Sāti at [mn36:5.11](), is reminiscent of Yājñavalkya’s discussion of the Self as a person’s “light” in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. He illustrates the departure of the Self from the body at death by analogy with dreams, where a person sets aside the physical body and takes up a body of light (4.3.9). There (_tatra_) he is the “agent” (_kartā_, 4.3.10) who “moves between the worlds contemplating and playing, as it were” (4.3.7). He creates his own experiences, seeing good and bad (_dṛṣṭvaiva puṇyaṁ ca pāpaṁ ca_, 4.3.15). Being “immortal” (_amṛto_, 4.3.12), he wanders where he likes and returns unaffected (4.3.16). In 4.4.5, he additionally says that “as one acts, so one becomes”, doing good becoming good, and doing bad becoming bad. See too Aitareya Upaniṣad 3.1, which says the Self is that by which one sees, hears, smells, tastes, speaks and knows. | For the phrase _sassatisamaṁ_ (“lasting forever and ever”), compare Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.10.1: “He reaches that world free of sorrow and snow, where he lives forever and ever” (_sa lokam āgacchaty aśokam ahimam. tasmin vasati śāśvatīḥ samāḥ_).
mn2:8.9	This is called a misconception, the thicket of views, the desert of views, the twist of views, the dodge of views, the fetter of views.	“Twist” (_visūka_) is used with “dodge” (_vipphandita_) and sometimes “duck” (_visevita_) for an horse fighting the bit ([mn65:33.2]()) or a crab escaping the torment of children ([mn35:23.9]()). _Visūka_ is also used for a “show” of dance, etc., where the commentarial gloss _paṭāṇi_ (“screw”) reinforces the sense “twist, gyrate”. As descriptions of views, they suggest the active process of denial and distortion through which views shape how we see the world.
mn2:8.10	An unlearned ordinary person who is fettered by views is not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.	NA
mn2:8.11	They’re not freed from suffering, I say.	NA
mn2:9.1	NA	NA
mn2:9.2	But take a learned noble disciple who has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen true persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true persons.	NA
mn2:9.3	They understand to which things they should apply the mind and to which things they should not apply the mind.	NA
mn2:9.4	So they apply the mind to things they should and don’t apply the mind to things they shouldn’t.	NA
mn2:10.1	And what are the things to which they don’t apply the mind and should not?	NA
mn2:10.2	They are the things that, when the mind is applied to them, give rise to unarisen defilements and make arisen defilements grow: the defilements of sensual desire,	NA
mn2:10.3	desire to be reborn,	NA
mn2:10.4	and ignorance.	NA
mn2:10.5	These are the things to which they don’t apply the mind and should not.	NA
mn2:10.6	And what are the things to which they do apply the mind and should?	NA
mn2:10.7	They are the things that, when the mind is applied to them, do not give rise to unarisen defilements and give up arisen defilements: the defilements of sensual desire,	NA
mn2:10.8	desire to be reborn,	NA
mn2:10.9	and ignorance.	NA
mn2:10.10	These are the things to which they do apply the mind and should.	NA
mn2:10.11	Because of not applying the mind to what they should not and applying the mind to what they should, unarisen defilements don’t arise and arisen defilements are given up.	NA
mn2:11.1	They rationally apply the mind: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.	This is the realization of the four noble truths. The suttas distinguish between someone who accepts the truth of the Dhamma either by faith or by logic, and someone who truly sees with direct experience ([sn25.1]()). This direct vision, here called “rational application of mind”, may be expressed any number of different ways.
mn2:11.2	And as they do so, they give up three fetters:	NA
mn2:11.3	substantialist view, doubt, and misapprehension of precepts and observances.	They are a stream-enterer who has entered the first of the four stages of awakening. “Seeing” the four noble truths permanently severs these three fetters. This is the decisive difference between “seeing” and knowing by faith or logic ([sn25.1]()).
mn2:11.4	These are called the defilements that should be given up by seeing.	NA
mn2:12.0	2. Defilements Given Up by Restraint	NA
mn2:12.1	And what are the defilements that should be given up by restraint?	In the Gradual Training (eg. [mn38:35.1]()), sense restraint (_saṁvarā_) comes before seeing the four noble truths. The sequence in this sutta does not follow the order of practice; rather, it starts and ends with the most important items.
mn2:12.2	Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, lives restraining the faculty of the eye.	NA
mn2:12.3	For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without restraint of the eye faculty do not arise when there is such restraint.	Sense restraint is not about denial, but about freeing the mind from addiction.
mn2:12.4	Reflecting rationally, they live restraining the faculty of the ear …	NA
mn2:12.5	the nose …	NA
mn2:12.6	the tongue …	NA
mn2:12.7	the body …	NA
mn2:12.8	the mind.	NA
mn2:12.9	For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without restraint of the mind faculty do not arise when there is such restraint.	In the first and last items in this sutta, “giving up” defilements means their permanent eradication by means of the noble path. For the interim items, however, “giving up” refers to the more modest goal of practicing so that they do not arise in the mind. This creates the supportive conditions for deeper realizations, while giving the mind time for understanding to mature.
mn2:12.10	For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without restraint do not arise when there is such restraint.	NA
mn2:12.11	These are called the defilements that should be given up by restraint.	NA
mn2:13.0	3. Defilements Given Up by Using	NA
mn2:13.1	And what are the defilements that should be given up by using?	These are the four requisites used (_paṭisevana_) by a mendicant. They are provided to a mendicant at their ordination. Other possessions of a minor nature are also allowed, such as a razor, waistband, sandals, and so on. These passages are used as mindfulness reminders when making use of possessions.
mn2:13.2	Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, makes use of robes:	NA
mn2:13.3	‘Only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; and for covering up the private parts.’	NA
mn2:14.1	Reflecting rationally, they make use of almsfood:	NA
mn2:14.2	‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will have the means to keep going, blamelessness, and a comfortable abiding.’	The next sutta ([mn3]()) gives an example of this. | In several Chinese translations, “adornment” is applied to robes rather than almsfood, where it seems more fitting. | Compare the phrase _yātrāmātraprasiddhyarthaṁ_ (“for accomplishing mere maintenance”) at Manusmṛti 4.3.
mn2:15.1	Reflecting rationally, they make use of lodgings:	NA
mn2:15.2	‘Only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; to shelter from harsh weather and to enjoy retreat.’	NA
mn2:16.1	Reflecting rationally, they make use of medicines and supplies for the sick:	NA
mn2:16.2	‘Only for the sake of warding off the pains of illness and to promote good health.’	While it may seem odd to use medicines for purposes other than treating illness, this is a broad category. It includes anything used as a tonic, pick-me-up, or refreshment so long as it is not solid food, such as fruit juice, honey, ghee, ginger, etc.
mn2:17.1	For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without using these things do not arise when they are used.	NA
mn2:17.2	These are called the defilements that should be given up by using.	NA
mn2:18.0	4. Defilements Given Up by Enduring	NA
mn2:18.1	And what are the defilements that should be given up by enduring?	The Buddha depicted the spiritual path as one of freedom and happiness. Nonetheless, practitioners will invariably encounter adversities along the way. Such things should be endured (_adhivāsana_) with patience and strength, without giving up.
mn2:18.2	Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, endures cold, heat, hunger, and thirst. They endure the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. They endure rude and unwelcome criticism. And they put up with physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening.	NA

mn2:18.4	These are called the defilements that should be given up by enduring.	NA
mn2:19.0	5. Defilements Given Up by Avoiding	NA
mn2:19.1	And what are the defilements that should be given up by avoiding?	This item shows that endurance is not always the right response to adversity. Some things are best avoided (_parivajjana_) where possible. This is different, of course, from a strategy or compulsion of avoiding things that are uncomfortable.
mn2:19.2	Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, avoids a wild elephant, a wild horse, a wild ox, a wild dog, a snake, a stump, thorny ground, a pit, a cliff, a swamp, and a sewer.	NA
mn2:19.3	Reflecting rationally, they avoid sitting on inappropriate seats, walking in inappropriate neighborhoods, and mixing with bad friends—whatever sensible spiritual companions would believe to be a bad setting.	This introduces the hard-to-translate idea of _gocara_, literally “pasture”. It refers to the places or people to whom a mendicant “resorts”, especially when on alms. What is appropriate depends on context. For example, whereas there is no issue with accepting a meal from a sex worker ([dn16:2.14.7]()), it would provoke suspicion if a monk entered a brothel for the meal. | _Okappeti_ means “believe, trust” rather than “suspect”.
mn2:19.4	For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without avoiding these things do not arise when they are avoided.	NA
mn2:19.5	These are called the defilements that should be given up by avoiding.	NA
mn2:20.0	6. Defilements Given Up by Dispelling	NA
mn2:20.1	And what are the defilements that should be given up by dispelling?	This section shows that, rather than being “non-judgmental” about ones’ thoughts, a meditator should recognize and “dispel” (_vinodana_) those that are harmful. The first step, however, in dispelling harmful thoughts is to recognize that they are harmful, which requires a degree of mindfulness and equanimity. Often that is sufficient: once one is mindful of the bad thought, it undercuts the greed, hate, and delusion that fuels it and it fades away. In cases where the mind is too caught up in the harmful thinking, a more deliberate practice can be required ([mn20]()).
mn2:20.2	Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, doesn’t tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen, but gives it up, gets rid of it, eliminates it, and obliterates it. They don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them.	NA
mn2:20.3	For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without dispelling these things do not arise when they are dispelled.	NA
mn2:20.4	These are called the defilements that should be given up by dispelling.	NA
mn2:21.0	7. Defilements Given Up by Developing	NA
mn2:21.1	And what are the defilements that should be given up by developing?	To develop (_bhāvanā_) is literally to “make be more”, to “grow” or “amplify”. The good factors that are already present, especially in the stream-enterer, are cultivated to support the realization of full awakening.
mn2:21.2	It’s when a mendicant, reflecting rationally, develops the awakening factors of mindfulness,	The seven awakening factors especially emphasize the emotional and holistic dimension of meditative growth.
mn2:21.3	investigation of principles,	NA
mn2:21.4	energy,	NA
mn2:21.5	rapture,	NA
mn2:21.6	tranquility,	NA
mn2:21.7	immersion,	NA
mn2:21.8	and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.	The four terms here—seclusion, fading away, cessation, ripening as letting go—are commonly applied to the different formulations of the path, but especially the seven awakening factors. Each expresses a fundamental quality of the path. They can be understood as a process of deepening that moves towards Nibbāna, the ultimate letting go, while each of the four is also a term for Nibbāna itself.
mn2:21.9	For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without developing these things do not arise when they are developed.	NA
mn2:21.10	These are called the defilements that should be given up by developing.	NA
mn2:22.1	Now, take a mendicant who, by seeing, has given up the defilements that should be given up by seeing. By restraint, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by restraint. By using, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by using. By enduring, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by enduring. By avoiding, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by avoiding. By dispelling, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by dispelling. By developing, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by developing.	Spiritual teachings sometimes emphasize the critical role of a single practice to overcome different defilements, for example through chanting a mantra or by mindful awareness: many problems, one tool. This sutta, in line with the early texts generally, takes the opposing line, that the diversity of defilements requires a diversity of practices in response: many problems, many tools.
mn2:22.2	They’re called a mendicant who lives having restrained all defilements, who has cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of suffering.”	This is the arahant. | The “fetters” are enumerated as ten at eg. [an10.13](). | “Conceit”, which is one of the fetters, is the tendency of the mind to judge and assess in terms of oneself through the process of “conceiving” discussed in [mn1](). | They have “made an end of suffering” in the sense that they have cut off the root of transmigration. Nonetheless while an arahant is living they still experience suffering such as physical sickness.

mn3:0.2	Heirs in the Teaching	NA
mn3:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn3:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn3:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn3:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn3:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn3:2.1	“Mendicants, be my heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh.	“Things of the flesh” renders _āmisa_, literally “meat”. In Vedic sacrifice the flesh of the slaughtered beast was made holy and fit for the gods (Rig Veda 1.162.10). In this way the guilt of killing was assuaged and the flesh became allowable for the brahmin priests. Here the “flesh” is extended by implication to the material pleasures of the world.
mn3:2.2	Out of sympathy for you, I think,	NA
mn3:2.3	‘How can my disciples become heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh?’	NA
mn3:2.4	If you become heirs in things of the flesh, not in the teaching, that will make you liable to the accusation:	Text’s _ādiya_ (and variant _ādissā_) are future passive participles from √_dis_ (“point”) having the sense “liable to be pointed out or accused”.
mn3:2.5	‘The Teacher’s disciples live as heirs in things of the flesh, not in the teaching.’	NA
mn3:2.6	And it will make me liable to the accusation:	NA
mn3:2.7	‘The Teacher’s disciples live as heirs in things of the flesh, not in the teaching.’	NA
mn3:2.8	If you become heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh, that will make you not liable to the accusation:	NA
mn3:2.9	‘The Teacher’s disciples live as heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh.’	NA
mn3:2.10	And it will make me not liable to the accusation:	NA
mn3:2.11	‘The Teacher’s disciples live as heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh.’	NA
mn3:2.12	So, mendicants, be my heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh.	NA
mn3:2.13	Out of sympathy for you, I think,	NA
mn3:2.14	‘How can my disciples become heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh?’	NA
mn3:3.1	Suppose that I had eaten and refused more food, being full, and having had as much as I needed.	A mendicant tries to eat just what they need. In some circumstances, especially when eating on invitation in a house, the donors will first place a modest amount of food in the bowl, then offer more during the meal if it is needed. This passage concerns such extra food that has been refused.
mn3:3.2	And there was some extra almsfood that was going to be thrown away.	NA
mn3:3.3	Then two mendicants were to come who were weak with hunger.	NA
mn3:3.4	I’d say to them,	NA
mn3:3.5	‘Mendicants, I have eaten and refused more food, being full, and having had as much as I need.	NA
mn3:3.6	And there is this extra almsfood that’s going to be thrown away.	NA
mn3:3.7	Eat it if you like. Otherwise I’ll throw it out where there is little that grows, or drop it into water that has no living creatures.’	NA
mn3:3.8	Then one of those mendicants thought,	NA
mn3:3.9	‘The Buddha has eaten and refused more food.	NA
mn3:3.10	And he has some extra almsfood that’s going to be thrown away.	NA
mn3:3.11	If we don’t eat it he’ll throw it away.	NA
mn3:3.12	But the Buddha has also said:	NA
mn3:3.13	“Be my heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh.”	NA
mn3:3.14	And almsfood is one of the things of the flesh.	NA
mn3:3.15	Instead of eating this almsfood, why don’t I spend this day and night weak with hunger?’	NA
mn3:3.16	And that’s what they did.	NA
mn3:3.17	Then the second of those mendicants thought,	NA
mn3:3.18	‘The Buddha has eaten and refused more food.	NA
mn3:3.19	And he has some extra almsfood that’s going to be thrown away.	NA
mn3:3.20	If we don’t eat it he’ll throw it away.	NA
mn3:3.21	Why don’t I eat this almsfood, then spend the day and night having got rid of my hunger and weakness?’	NA
mn3:3.22	And that’s what they did.	NA
mn3:3.23	Even though that mendicant, after eating the almsfood, spent the day and night rid of hunger and weakness, it is the former mendicant who is more worthy of respect and praise.	NA
mn3:3.24	Why is that?	NA
mn3:3.25	Because for a long time that will conduce to that mendicant being of few wishes, content, self-effacing, unburdensome, and energetic.	This is an example of the “defilements given up by using” ([mn2:14.2]()). It makes a point: short term discomfort is outweighed by the benefits of overcoming greed. Note that the Buddha encouraged mendicants to eat regularly, and did not support fasting or other extreme diets.
mn3:3.26	So, mendicants, be my heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh.	NA
mn3:3.27	Out of sympathy for you, I think,	NA
mn3:3.28	‘How can my disciples become heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh?’”	NA
mn3:4.1	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn3:4.2	When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.	NA
mn3:4.3	Then soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Sāriputta said to the mendicants,	This marks the first time in the Majjhimanikāya that we hear a teaching from a disciple. Sāriputta was the Buddha’s leading disciple, famed for his wisdom. He gave many teachings in the suttas, typically, as here, preferring systematic expositions.
mn3:4.4	“Reverends, mendicants!”	NA
mn3:4.5	“Reverend,” they replied.	NA
mn3:4.6	Sāriputta said this:	NA
mn3:5.1	“Reverends, how do the disciples of a Teacher who lives in seclusion not train in seclusion? And how do they train in seclusion?”	Sāriputta continues on a similar theme, phrased in terms of “seclusion” (_viveka_) rather than “things of the flesh” (_āmisa_). Seclusion is explained in the commentaries as threefold: physical seclusion achieved by living a virtuous life in a quiet place; mental seclusion from the hindrances achieved through the _jhānas_; and seclusion from attachments, namely Nibbāna.
mn3:5.2	“Reverend, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta.	NA
mn3:5.3	May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this.	NA
mn3:5.4	The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	NA
mn3:5.5	“Well then, reverends, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn3:5.6	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.	NA
mn3:5.7	Sāriputta said this:	NA

mn4:0.2	Fear and Dread	NA
mn4:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn4:2.1	Then the brahmin Jānussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	We meet Jānussoṇi many times in the suttas, where he converses with the Buddha on a number of topics, with a special interest in the afterlife. His name appears in Sanskrit as Jānaśruti or Jānaśruteya, which are patronymics of Janaśruti, “famed among the people”, with the element _soṇi_ coming from the Vedic _ṣvaṇi_ (“sound”). The Chinese rendering <span lang='lzh'>生聞</span> (“Born Famous”, T 125.2.665b18) evidently assumes the same derivation (_jana_ “people” is from √_jan_ “born”). The Pali commentary says it is a title awarded the family priest (_purohita_) of Kosala, which would make him one of the most powerful brahmins alive. However, I can find no confirmation of such a title, whereas the use of Jānaśruti as a patronymic by the descendants of Janaśruti is well attested.
mn4:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:	NA
mn4:2.3	“Worthy Gotama, those gentlemen who have gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness out of faith in you have the worthy Gotama to lead the way, help them out, and give them encouragement.	This statement is sometimes translated as a question, but it lacks the usual question markers. The parallel at [EA 31.1](https://suttacentral.net/ea31.1/lzh/taisho) reverses the sequence: Jānussoṇi first says that living in the forest is hard, then introduces the idea that the Buddha is their guide, following which the Buddha tells his life story. This makes for a better flow of ideas.
mn4:2.4	And those people follow the worthy Gotama’s example.”	Picking up from the previous sutta the themes of following the Buddha’s example and of seclusion. | In _diṭṭhānugatiṁ_, read _diṭṭha_ (“what has been seen”, i.e. “example”), rather than _diṭṭhi_ (“view”) per commentary.
mn4:2.5	“That’s so true, brahmin! Everything you say is true, brahmin!”	NA
mn4:2.8	“But worthy Gotama, remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest are challenging. It’s hard to maintain seclusion and hard to find joy in solitude.	NA
mn4:2.9	The forests seem to rob the mind of a mendicant who isn’t immersed in samādhi.”	NA
mn4:2.10	“That’s so true, brahmin! Everything you say is true, brahmin!	NA
mn4:3.1	Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought,	This is the first of several times in the Majjhimanikāya that the Buddha spoke of his meditation before enlightenment (see eg. [mn19](), [mn128]()). In these texts the Buddha takes pains to depict himself as an ordinary person who struggled with the same issues in meditation as anyone else. | “Intent on awakening” is _bodhisatta_ (Sanskrit _bodhisattva_). Such passages as this are apparently the original context for this term. The Pali _satta_ represents a number of different words in Sanskrit, including _sajjita_ (“intent on, devoted to, fixed upon”), which makes better sense here than _sattva_ (“being”).
mn4:3.2	‘Remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest are challenging. It’s hard to maintain seclusion and hard to find joy in solitude.	NA
mn4:3.3	The forests seem to rob the mind of a mendicant who isn’t immersed in samādhi.’	NA
mn4:4.1	Then I thought,	NA
mn4:4.2	‘There are ascetics and brahmins with unpurified conduct of body, speech, and mind who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. Those ascetics and brahmins summon unskillful fear and dread because of these defects in their conduct.	That is, their guilt will manifest as fear. Throughout this sutta, the Buddha emphasizes that fear is overcome by the proper development of the path, which leads to confidence and strength of mind. This is in implicit contrast to the notion that one overcomes fear by either brute endurance and force of will or by magical spells and charms.
mn4:4.3	But I don’t frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with unpurified conduct of body, speech, and mind.	NA
mn4:4.4	My conduct is purified.	NA
mn4:4.5	I am one of those noble ones who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with purified conduct of body, speech, and mind.’	NA
mn4:4.6	Seeing this purity of conduct in myself I felt even more unruffled about staying in the forest.	“Unruffled” is _pallomamāpādiṁ_.
mn4:5.1	Then I thought,	NA

mn4:6.2	My livelihood is purified.	NA

mn4:21.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who perceive that it’s day when in fact it’s night, or perceive that it’s night when in fact it’s day.	The Buddha illustrates his claim that the forests can rob the mind of a meditator without _samādhi_. During the development of meditation, perception can change in strange and unsettling ways, making the meditator question the nature of reality. In some cases, over-exertion in meditation can indeed lead to mental breakdown.
mn4:21.2	This meditation of theirs is delusional, I say.	NA
mn4:21.3	I perceive that it’s night when in fact it is night, and perceive that it’s day when in fact it is day.	This alludes to the oft-repeated phrase “as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day”, which is associated with the meditative perception of light ([an4.41:3.3]()), the development of the bases of psychic power ([sn51.11:1.10]()), and the dispelling of drowsiness ([an7.61:7.2]()). The point of that phrase is that the mind has been developed until it is full of light regardless of whether it is light or dark outside. Here, the Buddha forestalls the accusation that this is deluded: he knows perfectly well what is day and what is night.
mn4:21.4	And if there’s anyone of whom it may be rightly said that	NA
mn4:21.5	a being not liable to delusion has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans, it’s of me that this should be said.	NA
mn4:22-26.1	My energy was roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness was established and lucid, my body was tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind was immersed in samādhi and unified.	To this point, the sutta has been focusing on the foundations of meditation from the special perspective of overcoming fear. Now that this has been achieved, it returns to the standard presentation of immersion and then wisdom. Taken together, then, it is the first presentation of the Gradual Training in the Majjhima Nikāya. | “Unified” (_ekagga_) is explained in the Pali commentaries as “rightly positioned, well placed”, suggesting _agga_ here is contracted _agāra_ (“place”). This is supported by the Chinese <span lang='lzh'>境</span> here, which means “place”. However, the Sanskrit form _ekāgra_ suggests, rather, the sense _agra_ (“peak”). See note on [mn44:12.2]().
mn4:22-26.2	Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	_Jhāna_ is a state of “elevated consciousness” (_adhicitta_), so all the terms have an elevated sense. The plural form indicates that “sensual pleasures” includes sense experience, which the meditator can turn away from since they no longer have any desire for it. The “unskillful qualities” are the five hindrances. The “rapture and bliss born of seclusion” is the happiness of abandoning the hindrances and freedom from sense impingement. “Placing the mind and keeping it connected” (_vitakka_, _vicāra_) uses terms that mean “thought” in coarse consciousness, but which in “elevated consciousness” refer to the subtle function of applying the mind to the meditation.
mn4:22-26.3	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	Each _jhāna_ begins as the least refined aspect of the previous _jhāna_ ends. This is not consciously directed, but describes the natural process of settling. The meditator is now fully confident and no longer needs to apply their mind: it is simply still and fully unified.
mn4:22-26.4	And with the fading away of rapture, I entered and remained in the third absorption, where I meditated with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	The emotional response to bliss matures from the subtle thrill of rapture to the poise of equanimity. Mindfulness is present in all states of deep meditation, but with equanimity it becomes prominent.
mn4:22-26.5	With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I entered and remained in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	The emotional poise of equanimity leads to the feeling of pleasure settling into the more subtle neutral feeling. Pain and sadness have been abandoned long before, but are emphasized here as they are subtle counterpart of pleasure.
mn4:27.1	When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward recollection of past lives. I recollected many kinds of past lives.	The equanimity of the fourth _jhāna_ is not dullness and indifference, but a brilliant and radiant awareness. The fourth _jhāna_ is the ideal basis for developing higher knowledges, although elsewhere the canon shows that even the first _jhāna_ can be a basis for liberating insight. Without _jhāna_, however, the eightfold path is incomplete and liberating insight is impossible. | The verb _abhininnāmeti_ (“extend”) indicates that the meditator comes out of full immersion like a tortoise sticking out its limbs ([sn35.240:1.7]()).
mn4:27.2	That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. I remembered: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	Empowered by the fourth _jhāna_, memory breaks through the veil of birth and death, revealing the vast expanse of time and dispelling the illusion that there is any place of eternal rest or sanctuary in the cycle of transmigration. The knowledge of these events is not hazy or murky, but clear and precise, illuminated by the brilliance of purified consciousness.
mn4:28.1	This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the night.	NA
mn4:28.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	NA
mn4:29.1	When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	NA
mn4:29.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	Here knowledge extends to the rebirths of others as well as oneself. Even more significant, it brings in the understanding of cause and effect; *why* rebirth happens the way it does. Such knowledge, however, is not infallible, as the Buddha warns in [dn1:2.5.3]() and [mn136](). The experience is one thing; the inferences drawn from it are another. One should draw conclusions only tentatively, after long experience. | “Clairvoyance” renders _dibbacakkhu_ (“celestial eye”), for which see Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.12.5, which says of the self that “the mind is its celestial eye” (_mano’sya daivaṁ cakṣuḥ_).
mn4:30.1	This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of the night.	NA
mn4:30.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	NA
mn4:31.1	When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	This is the experience of awakening that is the true goal of the Buddhist path. The defilements—properties of the mind that create suffering—have been curbed by the practice of ethics and suppressed by the power of _jhāna_. Here they are eliminated forever.
mn4:31.2	I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.	These are the four noble truths, which form the main content of the Buddha’s first sermon. They are the overarching principle into which all other teachings fall. As established in [mn2](), seeing the four noble truths indicates stream-entry, while the ending of all defilements indicates arahantship.
mn4:31.3	I truly understood: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.	The application of the four noble truths to defilements indicates that this is the final stage of awakening, perfection (or “arahantship”, _arahatta_). | Many translators use “defilement” to render _kilesa_, but since _kilesa_ appears only rarely in the early texts, I use “defilement” for _āsava_. Both terms refer to a stain, corruption, or pollution in the mind.
mn4:32.1	Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	_Bhavāsava_ is the defilement that craves to continue life in a new birth.
mn4:32.2	When it was freed, I knew it was freed.	This is a reflective awareness of the fact of awakening. The meditator reviews their mind and sees that it is free from all forces that lead to suffering.
mn4:32.3	I understood: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’”	This is a standard declaration of full awakening in the suttas, said both of the Buddha and of any arahant (“perfected one”). Each of the four phrases illustrates a cardinal principle of awakening. (1) Further transmigration through rebirths has come to an end due to the exhaustion (_khīṇa_) of that which propels rebirth, namely deeds motivated by craving. (2) The eightfold path has been developed fully in all respects. (3) All functions relating to the four noble truths have been completed, namely: understanding suffering, letting go craving, witnessing extinguishment, and developing the path. (4) Extinguishment is final, with no falling back to this or any other state of existence.
mn4:33.1	This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the final watch of the night.	NA
mn4:33.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	NA
mn4:34.1	Brahmin, you might think:	NA
mn4:34.2	‘Perhaps the ascetic Gotama is not free of greed, hate, and delusion even today, and that is why he still frequents remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.’	NA
mn4:34.3	But you should not see it like this.	NA
mn4:34.4	I see two reasons to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.	NA
mn4:34.5	I see happiness for myself in this life, and I have sympathy for future generations.”	Also at [an2.30:1.1](). The Buddha confirms Jānussoṇi’s belief that he acts to set a good example for others.
mn4:35.1	“Indeed, worthy Gotama has sympathy for future generations, since he is a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn4:35.2	Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent, worthy Gotama!	NA
mn4:35.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
mn4:35.4	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	Jānussoṇi goes for refuge so often in the suttas that it is almost a genre unto itself ([mn27](), [sn12:47](), [an2.17:3.1](), [an3:55](), [an3:59](), [an4:184](), [an6:52](), [an7:47](), [an10:119](), [an10:167](), [an10:177]()). Such narrative accounts of conversion or enlightenment at the end of discourses are not very reliable, as they are not the Buddha’s words but were added by editors at some point.

mn5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	The Buddha does not appear in this sutta, yet he is mentioned by way of respect, indicating that these events took place while he was alive.
mn5:1.3	There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:	NA
mn5:1.4	“Reverends, mendicants!”	NA
mn5:1.5	“Reverend,” they replied.	NA
mn5:1.6	Sāriputta said this:	NA
mn5:2.1	“Reverends, these four people are found in the world.	This sutta emphasizes how even small, apparently trivial defects betray a deeper corruption. Rather than hiding them away in shame, they will only be healed when brought to light.
mn5:2.2	What four?	NA
mn5:2.3	One person with a blemish doesn’t truly understand: ‘There is a blemish in me.’	“Blemish” (_aṅgaṇa_) is used literally as a mark or discoloration on the face ([mn15:8.3]()), and metaphorically in the sense of a psychological defect. It stems from the root √_añj_ in the sense of something smeared on the skin such as ointment ([mn75:23.13]()) or eyeshadow ([mn82:25.14]()).
mn5:2.4	But another person with a blemish does truly understand: ‘There is a blemish in me.’	NA
mn5:2.5	One person without a blemish doesn’t truly understand: ‘There is no blemish in me.’	NA
mn5:2.6	But another person without a blemish does truly understand: ‘There is no blemish in me.’	NA
mn5:2.7	In this case, of the two persons with a blemish, the one who doesn’t understand is said to be worse,	NA
mn5:2.8	while the one who does understand is better.	NA
mn5:2.9	And of the two persons without a blemish, the one who doesn’t understand is said to be worse,	NA
mn5:2.10	while the one who does understand is better.”	NA
mn5:3.1	When he said this, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to him:	NA
mn5:3.2	“What is the cause, Reverend Sāriputta, what is the reason why, of the two persons with a blemish, one is said to be worse and one better?	NA
mn5:3.3	And what is the cause, what is the reason why, of the two persons without a blemish, one is said to be worse and one better?”	NA
mn5:4.1	“Reverends, take the case of the person who has a blemish and does not understand it. You can expect that they won’t generate enthusiasm, make an effort, or rouse up energy to give up that blemish.	When Sāriputta and Moggallāna address each other, they use their name together with “reverend” (_āvuso_). Here we just have _āvuso_. I take it that Moggallāna is asking questions on behalf of the group, and Sāriputta addresses the group.

In early Pali, _nimitta_ is used for a feature or quality of the mind that, when focused on, promotes the growth of similar or related qualities. Thus focusing on beauty fosters the desire for that beauty.

In such cases, a sense of collective shame is essential to motivate the offender to change their ways.

[mn56:29.54]()). Here, the commentary explains it as someone who is a counterpart in that they too have committed an offense (_sāpattiko_, cp.

Even though they dwell in the wilderness, in remote lodgings, eat only almsfood, wander indiscriminately for almsfood, wear rag robes, and wear shabby robes, their spiritual companions don’t honor, respect, revere, and venerate them.	These are the outward signs of someone living a dedicated ascetic life.

mn5:31.1	When he said this, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to him,	NA
mn5:31.2	“Reverend Sāriputta, a simile strikes me.”	NA
mn5:31.3	“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said Sāriputta.	NA
mn5:31.4	“Reverend, this one time I was staying right here in Rājagaha, the Mountainfold.	NA
mn5:31.5	Then I robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.	NA
mn5:31.6	Now at that time Samīti of the wainwrights was planing the rim of a chariot wheel.	Samīti is mentioned only here. | The rare _yānakāra_ (“wainwright”) is used here instead of the normal _rathakāra_ (also at [Tha-ap 150:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/tha-ap150/pli/ms#1.1) and Varāhamihira’s Bṛhatsaṁhitā 10.17).
mn5:31.7	The Ājīvaka ascetic Paṇḍuputta, who was formerly of the wainwrights, was standing by,	The primary Pali account of Ājīvaka beliefs is at [dn2:20.2](). | Paṇḍuputta is mentioned only here, although he shares a name with the five “sons of Paṇḍu”, better known as Pāṇḍava, who fought the Kurukṣetra war in the Mahābhārata.
mn5:31.8	and this thought came to his mind:	NA
mn5:31.9	‘Oh, I hope Samīti the wainwright planes out the crooks, bends, and flaws in this rim. Then the rim will be rid of crooks, bends, and flaws, pure, and consolidated in the core.’	“Pure and consolidated in the core” (_suddhā assa sāre patiṭṭhitā_) recurs at [mn72:21.5]() (of an assembly) and [an3.93:6.13]() (of a crop).
mn5:31.10	And Samīti planed out the flaws in the rim just as Paṇḍuputta thought.	NA
mn5:31.11	Then Paṇḍuputta expressed his gladness:	NA
mn5:31.12	‘He planes like he knows my heart with his heart!’	NA
mn5:32.1	In the same way, there are those faithless people who went forth from the lay life to homelessness not out of faith but to earn a livelihood. They’re devious, deceitful, and sneaky. They’re restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They do not guard their sense doors or eat in moderation, and they are not dedicated to wakefulness. They don’t care about the ascetic life, and don’t keenly respect the training. They’re indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, lazy, and lacking energy. They’re unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds, witless and idiotic. Venerable Sāriputta planes their faults with this exposition of the teaching as if he knows my heart with his heart!	Also at [mn107:15.2]().
mn5:32.2	But there are those gentlemen who went forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith. They’re not devious, deceitful, and sneaky. They’re not restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They guard their sense doors and eat in moderation, and they are dedicated to wakefulness. They care about the ascetic life, and keenly respect the training. They’re not indulgent or slack, nor are they leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion. They’re energetic and determined. They’re mindful, with situational awareness, immersion, and unified minds; wise and clever. Hearing this exposition of the teaching from Venerable Sāriputta, they drink it up and devour it, as it were. And in speech and thought they say:	NA
mn5:32.3	‘It’s good, sirs, that he draws his spiritual companions away from the unskillful and establishes them in the skillful.’	The Pali Text Society edition treats this sentence as a simple continuation of Moggallāna’s speech. But it reads better as an exclamation by the good monks, as indicated by Mahāsaṅgīti’s close _-ti_.
mn5:33.1	Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and had bathed their head. Presented with a garland of lotuses, jasmine, or liana flowers, they would take them in both hands and place them on the crown of the head.	This simile is also found at [an8.51:24.1](). It is the inverse of the simile where a vain young person would try to remove any “blemish” from their face (eg. [mn15:8.3](), [an10.51:3.2](); with _kaṇika_ instead of _aṅgaṇa_ at [dn2:92.1]()).
mn5:33.2	In the same way, those gentlemen who went forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith … say:	NA
mn5:33.3	‘It’s good, sirs, that he draws his spiritual companions away from the unskillful and establishes them in the skillful.’”	NA
mn5:33.4	And so these two spiritual giants agreed with each others’ fine words.	“Spiritual giant” is _nāga_, which also means a dragon, a bull elephant, or a king cobra. | This mutual admiration is also expressed between Sāriputta and Moggallāna at [sn21.3:7.1]() and [ud4.4:8.1](), and between Sāriputta and Puṇṇa son of Mantāṇī at [mn24:17.13]().

mn6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn6:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn6:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn6:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn6:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn6:2.1	“Mendicants, live by the ethical precepts and the monastic code. Live restrained in the monastic code, conducting yourselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, keep the rules you’ve undertaken.	The “monastic code” (_pātimokkha_) is the primary list of rules for Buddhist monastics. There are many extant _pātimokkhas_ in Chinese, Tibetan, and Sanskrit from early Buddhist schools, all similar but with some variations especially in minor rules of etiquette. Each fortnight the _pātimokkha_ is recited to affirm the communal rules of the Saṅgha. Other passages are recited as inspiration, including this exhortation to keep the rules (also at [an4.12:1.1](), [an10.71:2.1](), and [iti111:2.1]()), as well as the verses known as _Ovāda Pātimokkha_ ([dn14:3.28.1]()). | Commentaries offer several explanations for the word _pātimokkha_, favoring the sense “leading to release” (from remorse and suffering). The Buddha says he laid down the _pātimokkha_ to tie the community together like flowers bunched with string ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.6]()), which suggests a connection with _paṭimukka_, “binding” ([mn38:41.11]()).
mn6:3.1	A mendicant might wish: ‘May I be liked and approved by my spiritual companions, respected and admired.’ So let them fulfill their precepts, be committed to inner serenity of the heart, not neglect absorption, be endowed with discernment, and frequent empty huts.	To “fulfill precepts” repeats the commitment to the monastic code. | “Serenity” and “absorption” are the practice of meditation to develop tranquility (_samatha_). |  “Discernment” is _vipassanā_ (“insight”) meditation | “Empty huts” indicates solitude.
mn6:4.1	A mendicant might wish: ‘May I receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.’ So let them fulfill their precepts, be committed to inner serenity of the heart, not neglect absorption, be endowed with discernment, and frequent empty huts.	This series of arguments is conditional: *if* this is what you want, *then* this is how to get it. The Buddha is not encouraging people to want these things; on the contrary, he frequently warned of the dangers of such attachments. He is being pragmatic: given that people have desires, how can they be encouraged to desire something better?
mn6:5.1	A mendicant might wish: ‘May the services of those whose robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick I enjoy be very fruitful and beneficial for them.’ So let them fulfill their precepts …	NA
mn6:6.1	A mendicant might wish: ‘When deceased family and relatives who have passed away recollect me with a confident mind, may this be very fruitful and beneficial for them.’ So let them fulfill their precepts …	NA

mn6:11.1	A mendicant might wish: ‘May I, with the ending of three fetters, become a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.’ So let them fulfill their precepts …	NA
mn6:12.1	A mendicant might wish: ‘May I, with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, become a once-returner, coming back to this world once only, then making an end of suffering.’ So let them fulfill their precepts …	NA
mn6:13.1	A mendicant might wish: ‘May I, with the ending of the five lower fetters, be reborn spontaneously and become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.’ So let them fulfill their precepts …	NA
mn6:14.1	A mendicant might wish: ‘May I wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying myself and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with my hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the realm of divinity.’ So let them fulfill their precepts …	“Psychic powers” (_iddhi_) were much cultivated in the Buddha’s day, but the means to acquire them varied: devotion to a god, brutal penances, or magic rituals. The Buddha taught that the mind developed in _samādhi_ was capable of things that are normally incomprehensible. | Only a few of these are attested as events in the early texts. The most common is the ability to disappear and reappear, exhibited by the Buddha ([an8.30:2.1]()), some disciples ([mn37:6.1]()), and deities ([mn67:8.1]()).
mn6:15.1	A mendicant might wish: ‘With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, may I hear both kinds of sounds, human and heavenly, whether near or far.’ So let them fulfill their precepts …	“Clairaudience” is a literal rendition of _dibbasota_. The root sense of _dibba_ is to “shine” like the bright sky or a divine being. The senses of clarity and divinity are both present.
mn6:16.1	A mendicant might wish: ‘May I understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with my mind.	Note that the Indic idiom is not the “reading” of minds, which suggests hearing the words spoken in inner dialogue. While this is exhibited by the Buddha (eg. [an8.30:2.1]()), the main emphasis is on the comprehension of the overall state of mind.

mn6:16.17	and unfreed mind as “unfreed mind”.’	NA
mn6:16.18	So let them fulfill their precepts …	NA
mn6:17.1	A mendicant might wish: ‘May I recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. May I remember: “There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.” May I thus recollect my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.’	Empowered by the fourth _jhāna_, memory breaks through the veil of birth and death, revealing the vast expanse of time and dispelling the illusion that there is any place of eternal rest or sanctuary in the cycle of transmigration.
mn6:17.2	So let them fulfill their precepts …	NA
mn6:18.1	A mendicant might wish: ‘With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, may I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place—and understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: “These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.” And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, may I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. And may I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.’	Here knowledge extends to the rebirths of others as well as oneself. Even more significant, it brings in the understanding of cause and effect; *why* rebirth happens the way it does. Such knowledge, however, is not infallible, as the Buddha warns in [dn1:2.5.3]() and [mn136](). The experience is one thing; the inferences drawn from it are another. One should draw conclusions only tentatively, after long experience.
mn6:18.2	So let them fulfill their precepts …	NA
mn6:19.1	A mendicant might wish: ‘May I realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.’	This is the experience of awakening that is the true goal of the Buddhist path. The defilements—properties of the mind that create suffering—have been curbed by the practice of ethics and suppressed by the power of _jhāna_. Here they are eliminated forever.
mn6:19.2	So let them fulfill their precepts, be committed to inner serenity of the heart, not neglect absorption, be endowed with discernment, and frequent empty huts.	NA

mn7:5.33	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	They have experiential confidence in the Buddha as a teacher because they have followed his path and realized the results that he speaks of.

mn7:6.2	‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’	A stream-enterer has direct experience of the four noble truths, so they have confirmed that the teaching is indeed realizable in this very life.

This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’	The suttas distinguish between two senses of Saṅgha. The “mendicant Saṅgha” (_bhikkhusaṅgha_) is the conventional community of monks and nuns. The “Saṅgha of disciples” (_sāvakasaṅgha_) is classified as fourfold according to the stages of awakening: stream-entry, once-return, non-return, and perfection. Each of these stages is further subdivided into those of the path who are practicing for realization and those of the fruit who have realized. These are referred to as “noble disciples”, four of the path and four of the fruit, making eight individuals in total. Saṅgha is not used in the sense of “spiritual community”.

And when they’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.	Reflection on one’s progress brings joy and spurs further progress. This can be so powerful as to be a basis for _samādhi_.
mn7:12.1	When a mendicant of such ethics, such qualities, and such wisdom eats boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out and served with many soups and sauces, that is no obstacle for them.	An offering of delicious food is normally the most sensual temptation in a mendicant’s day. In the Chinese parallel at EA 13.5, this is mentioned only after arahantship.
mn7:12.2	Compare with cloth that is dirty and soiled; it can be made pure and clean by pure water. Or native gold, which can be made pure and bright by a forge.	NA

In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	Here the Buddha introduces the so-called “divine meditations” (_brahmavihāra_) or “immeasurables” (_appamañña_). These are four wholesome emotional states that can be developed as a basis for _samādhi_. They were evidently pre-Buddhist, although they have not been traced as a group in pre-Buddhist texts. However, they are shared with later non-Buddhist texts such as  Yogasūtra 1.33 and the Jain Tattvārthasūtra 7.11. | “Love” (_mettā_) is a universal positive regard and well-wishing free of personal desires or attachments.
mn7:14.1	They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of compassion to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	“Compassion” (_karuṇā_) is the quality of empathy with the suffering of another or oneself and the wish to remove it.
mn7:15.1	They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of rejoicing to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	“Rejoicing” (_muditā_) is joyful celebration in the success of others or oneself, free of jealousy or cynicism.
mn7:16.1	They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	Equanimity (_upekkhā_) is literally “close watching”, not interfering but standing ready when needed. It is not indifference, which is why it emerges only at the end, after the positive emotions are developed.
mn7:17.1	They understand: ‘There is this, there is what is worse than this, there is what is better than this, and there is an escape beyond the scope of perception.’	This is a description of advanced insight by a stream-enterer. The meditator understands the current state of their experience, namely the mind developed through _samādhi_. They know that this is conditioned and hence liable to decline to a lower state “worse than this”. They know that there are still higher states of mind that can be developed. And they know that, while all states of meditation fall within the scope of perception, there is an ultimate escape, namely Nibbāna.
mn7:18.1	Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	NA
mn7:18.2	When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.	NA
mn7:18.3	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’	NA
mn7:18.4	This is called	NA
mn7:18.5	a mendicant who is bathed with the inner bathing.”	“Bathed” is _sināta_, a rare variant spelling of _nhata_ (Sanskrit _snāta_. _Sināta_ also occurs at [sn7.9:15.3]()). | Later Brahmanical texts regarded external bathing as spiritually effective only when accompanied by inner bathing or purity of soul. The Mahābhārata says that “he who is bathed in the bath of self-disciple is clean inside and out” (13.111.9c, _sa snāto yo damasnātaḥ sabāhyābhyantaraḥ śuciḥ_), while the Liṅga-purāṇa (1.8.33) insists that one who has bathed externally “must also practice the inner bathing” (_snānaṁ … ābhyantaraṁ caret_).
mn7:19.1	Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā was sitting not far from the Buddha.	It seems that the Buddha mentioned the inner bathing to provoke the brahmin. | Four of the six Chinese parallels to this passage situate it on the bank of a river.
mn7:19.2	He said to the Buddha,	NA
mn7:19.3	“But does the worthy Gotama go to the river Bāhuka to bathe?”	NA
mn7:19.4	“Brahmin, why go to the river Bāhuka?	NA
mn7:19.5	What can the river Bāhuka do?”	NA
mn7:19.6	“Many people deem that the river Bāhukā leads to a heavenly world and bestows merit. And many people wash off their bad deeds in the river Bāhukā.”	_Lokkha_, elsewhere unattested in Pali, is Sanskrit _lokya_, which occurs several times in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa in the sense “conducive to a (heavenly) world” (9.5.2.16, 10.5.2.12, 11.3.3.7). The root sense of _loka_ is “light” and it was originally the bright sky with its _devas_ (eg. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa Mādyandina 11.2.3.1–6, Kāṇva 3.2.5.1), later being extended to include all worlds. The PTS reading _mokkha_ is an unwarranted normalization, although it is supported by the parallel at MA 93, which has <span lang='lzh'>度</span>. Note that the expected form _lokiya_, although common in later Pali, occurs only in one early verse ([thag2.18:2.4]()). | Bathing for purity from misdeeds as a pre-Buddhist Brahmanical custom is attested in Śukla Yajurveda 3.48. The bhikkhunī Puṇṇikā pointed out that if this were true then the fish, frogs, and turtles would go to heaven ([thig12.1:6.1]()); her argument was echoed by the Jains (Sūyagaḍa 1.7.14–16) and later Brahmins (Liṅga-purāṇa 1.8.33–4).
mn7:20.1	Then the Buddha addressed Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā in verse:	NA
mn7:20.2	“The Bāhukā and the Adhikakkā,	The Bāhukā (variant Bahukā) is mentioned only here. It may be the Bāhudā found in various Sanskrit texts (Bhāgavata Purāṇa 5.19.18), both words having the sense “granter of abundance”. | Adhikakkā (variant Avikakkā) is mentioned only here. The commentary says it was a ford (_tittha_).
mn7:20.3	at Gayā and the Sundarikā too,	Gayā is a ford on the Phalgu River by the town of Gayā, which is still a popular site for sacred bathing. | Sundarikā was a river in Kosala used for Brahmanical rituals ([sn7.9](), [snp3.4]()). Bathing in the ford there was said to bring beauty (Mahābhārata 3.82.51).
mn7:20.4	Sarasvatī and Payāga,	Pali _sarassatī_ is better known in the Sanskrit form _sarasvatī_, the most prominent river of the Vedas, who “like a snorting boar, broke the back of the mountains with her mighty waves” (Rig Veda 6.61.2). Change stole her waters and today she is lost. Researchers have identified her with the now-residual Ghaggar-Hakra system in north-west India and Pakistan or the Helmand River in Afghanistan. | Payāga (modern Prayagraj, formerly Allahabad) is the sacred ford at the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamunā beside Kosambī (see [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.18]()). The Mahābhārata calls it the “vulva of the world” (3.83.71), the most meritorious of all fords, where bathing can wash away a hundred crimes (3.83.82).
mn7:20.5	and the river Bāhumatī:	The Bāhumatī River is elsewhere only known by a passing mention in Sanskrit reference works. As an epithet of Indra it means “strong of arm”.
mn7:20.6	a fool can constantly plunge into them	NA
mn7:20.7	but it won’t purify their dark deeds.	NA
mn7:20.8	What can the Sundarikā do?	NA
mn7:20.9	What the Payāga or the Bāhukā?	NA
mn7:20.10	They can’t cleanse a cruel person, a sinner	NA
mn7:20.11	from their bad deeds.	NA
mn7:20.12	For the pure in heart it’s always	NA
mn7:20.13	the spring festival or the sabbath.	“Spring festival” is _phaggu_, said to be held at Gayā ([thag5.7:1.4](), [thag4.6:1.2]()), although Sanskrit sources take it as the name of a river at Gayā.
mn7:20.14	For the pure in heart and clean of deed,	NA
mn7:20.15	their vows will always be fulfilled.	NA
mn7:20.16	It’s here alone that you should bathe, brahmin,	NA
mn7:20.17	making yourself a sanctuary for all creatures.	A _khema_ (“sanctuary”) is a place of safety for wild creatures, a meaning featured in several Jātaka stories (eg. [Ja 482](https://suttacentral.net/ja482)).
mn7:20.18	And if you speak no lies,	The straightforward ethical teachings here contrast with the more demanding teachings for the mendicants in the previous prose. Such teachings presage the universal values of _dharma_ promoted by King Asoka in his edicts.

mn7:20.23	For any well may be your Gayā!”	NA
mn7:21.1	When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā said to the Buddha,	NA
mn7:21.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	NA
mn7:21.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
mn7:21.4	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
mn7:21.5	May I receive the going forth, the ordination in the worthy Gotama’s presence?”	NA
mn7:22.1	And the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	NA
mn7:22.2	Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn7:22.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	NA
mn7:22.4	And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected.	NA
mn8:0.1	Middle Discourses 8	NA
mn8:0.2	Self-Effacement	NA
mn8:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	Of the two parallels to this sutta, MA 91 takes place at the Ghositārāma in Kosambī, while EA 47.9 is set in the Squirrels’ Feeding Ground at Rājagaha. The specifics of narrative backgrounds often vary; they are not “the Buddha’s word”, but rather were added by editors at some point.
mn8:2.1	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahācunda came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:	There are various Cundas whose connection is unclear. Mahācunda was one of the great disciples ([mn118:](), [an6.17]()), who later brought the Dhamma to the land of the Cetīs ([an6.46](), [an10.24]()). He once stayed with Channa and Sāriputta ([mn144:4.1](), [sn35.87:1.2]()); the commentaries say he was in fact Sāriputta’s younger brother. They also identify him with the “novice Cunda” who reported the deaths of Sāriputta ([sn47.13:1.3]()) and Mahāvīra ([dn29:2.1](), [mn104:3.1]()), explaining that the title “novice” was a nickname that persisted from the time he ordained as a young novice. It is unclear whether the commentaries take the Cundaka of [dn16:4.39.2]() = [ud8.5:14.3]() to be the same person, but he is there performing a similar role as carer adjacent to the Buddha’s death. Later there appears a Cūḷacunda ([tha-ap52:13.3]()). Thus there may have been one person known by different names, or several people whose stories have become conflated.
mn8:3.1	“Sir, there are many different views that arise in the world	NA
mn8:3.2	connected with theories of self or with theories of the cosmos.	These are discussed many times in the suttas, for example doctrines of the self at [mn2:8.2]() and [mn44](); of the cosmos at [mn63]() and [mn72](); and of both at [dn1:1.30.1]() and [mn102:14.1]().
mn8:3.3	How does a mendicant who is focusing on the starting point give up and let go of these views?”	The idiom _ādimeva_ elsewhere occurs only when the Buddha gives a mendicant instructions for a retreat. Typically ([sn47.3:1.6](), [sn47.15:1.4](), [sn47.16:1.4]()) he says to “purify the starting point of skillful qualities”, namely ethics (_sīla_) and views (_diṭṭhi_), on the latter of which Mahācunda is seeking clarification. | In the Pali the question is phrased directly and is sometimes translated “do they give them up?”, but the idiom _evametāsaṁ_ shifts the sense to “how do they give them up?” ([mn74:6.14](), [mn137:16.8]()). And that is indeed the answer the Buddha gives. The commentary explains it similarly (_etena upāyena etāsaṁ_), and both Chinese texts have <span lang='lzh'>云何</span> here, which typically stands for _kathaṁ_ (“how”).
mn8:3.4	“Cunda, there are many different views that arise in the world	NA
mn8:3.5	connected with theories of self or with theories of the cosmos.	NA
mn8:3.6	A mendicant gives up and lets go of these views by truly seeing with right wisdom where they arise, where they settle in, and where they operate as: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	This is the insight of stream-entry, where wrong views are fully abandoned by means of the clarified wisdom that sees the truth of conditionality. The remainder of the sutta discusses the practice leading to this point.
mn8:4.1	It’s possible that a certain mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, might enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn8:4.2	They might think	NA
mn8:4.3	they’re practicing self-effacement.	The term “self-effacement” that lends the sutta its title is Pali _sallekha_, which has the sense of “rubbing out” (an inscription or mark). It is associated with such virtues as contentment, seclusion, and simplicity (eg. [mn3:3.25]()). Here it refers to the strength of character to persist in “effacing” unwholesome qualities through developing their opposites, no matter what others might do. | Not to be confused with the Jain _sallekhanā_, where practitioners at the end of life refuse all food (Tattvārthasūtra 7.22). In fact, this sutta appears to emphasize the gentle nature of the Buddha’s approach in deliberate contrast with the stern austerities of the Jains.
mn8:4.4	But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’;	NA
mn8:4.5	they’re called ‘blissful meditations in this life’.	The sutta is not deprecating the _jhānas_, for they are a fundamental part of the early Buddhist path, and as such are included later under the heading of “right immersion” ([mn8:12.19]()). Indeed, the sutta ends with the Buddha encouraging Cunda to practice _jhāna_. Rather, this text emphasizes the need to actively develop all aspects of the path, humble or exalted, and integrate them in every aspect of life, rather than solely relying on meditation in seclusion.
mn8:5.1	It’s possible that some mendicant, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, might enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.

mn8:6.1	It’s possible that some mendicant, with the fading away of rapture, might enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA

mn8:7.1	It’s possible that some mendicant, with the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, might enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA

mn8:8.1	It’s possible that some mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, might enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space.	NA
mn8:8.2	They might think	NA
mn8:8.3	they’re practicing self-effacement.	NA
mn8:8.4	But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’;	NA

mn8:11.5	they’re called ‘peaceful meditations’.	NA
mn8:12.0	1. The Exposition of Self-Effacement	NA
mn8:12.1	Now, Cunda, you should work on self-effacement in each of the following ways.	The phrase “work on self-effacement” (_sallekho karaṇīyo_) recurs in each clause but is abbreviated in translation. It echoes the phrase _sikkhā karaṇīyā_ (“this training should be done”) which ends each of the Vinaya “training rules”. Both cases emphasize the active application of effort.
mn8:12.2	‘Others will be cruel, but here we will not be cruel.’	The list of unskillful qualities forms the skeleton of the rest of the sutta, being repeated five times with variations in the presentation. The Pali has 44 items, while MA 91 has 31 and EA 47.9 has 16. I note where the items appear in standard doctrinal lists. | Non-cruelty is mentioned first as it is the foundation of good qualities and the first moral precept, to not kill.
mn8:12.3	‘Others will kill living creatures, but here we will not kill living creatures.’	These ten make up the ten ways of doing of skillful deeds.
mn8:12.4	‘Others will steal, but here we will not steal.’	NA
mn8:12.5	‘Others will be unchaste, but here we will not be unchaste.’	NA
mn8:12.6	‘Others will lie, but here we will not lie.’	NA
mn8:12.7	‘Others will speak divisively, but here we will not speak divisively.’	NA
mn8:12.8	‘Others will speak harshly, but here we will not speak harshly.’	NA
mn8:12.9	‘Others will talk nonsense, but here we will not talk nonsense.’	NA
mn8:12.10	‘Others will be covetous, but here we will not be covetous.’	NA
mn8:12.11	‘Others will have ill will, but here we will not have ill will.’	NA
mn8:12.12	‘Others will have wrong view, but here we will have right view.’	This item performs double-duty as both the last of the ten ways of doing skillful deeds and the first of the noble eight (or ten) fold path.
mn8:12.13	‘Others will have wrong thought, but here we will have right thought.’	NA
mn8:12.14	‘Others will have wrong speech, but here we will have right speech.’	NA
mn8:12.15	‘Others will have wrong action, but here we will have right action.’	NA
mn8:12.16	‘Others will have wrong livelihood, but here we will have right livelihood.’	NA
mn8:12.17	‘Others will have wrong effort, but here we will have right effort.’	NA
mn8:12.18	‘Others will have wrong mindfulness, but here we will have right mindfulness.’	NA
mn8:12.19	‘Others will have wrong immersion, but here we will have right immersion.’	NA
mn8:12.20	‘Others will have wrong knowledge, but here we will have right knowledge.’	These two items are sometimes added to the eightfold path to make ten (eg. [mn117:35.13]()). They are missing in both parallels.
mn8:12.21	‘Others will have wrong freedom, but here we will have right freedom.’	NA
mn8:12.22	‘Others will be overcome with dullness and drowsiness, but here we will be rid of dullness and drowsiness.’	This is the third of the five hindrances, and the final two follow in sequence. The first two of the hindrances appear above as “covetousness” and “ill will” in the ten ways of doing unskillful deeds. Notably, the same pattern occurs in MA 91, which speaks to a common ancestor on this point. This shows that these items were organized to eliminate repetition, but in other cases (such as the kinds of wrong speech and wrong action) items do repeat.
mn8:12.23	‘Others will be restless, but here we will not be restless.’	NA
mn8:12.24	‘Others will have doubts, but here we will have gone beyond doubt.’	NA
mn8:12.25	‘Others will be irritable, but here we will be without anger.’	These ten are included in the sixteen blemishes of [mn7]().
mn8:12.26	‘Others will be acrimonious, but here we will be without acrimony.’	NA
mn8:12.27	‘Others will be offensive, but here we will be inoffensive.’	NA
mn8:12.28	‘Others will be contemptuous, but here we will be without contempt.’	NA
mn8:12.29	‘Others will be jealous, but here we will be without jealousy.’	NA
mn8:12.30	‘Others will be stingy, but here we will be without stinginess.’	NA
mn8:12.31	‘Others will be devious, but here we will not be devious.’	NA
mn8:12.32	‘Others will be deceitful, but here we will not be deceitful.’	NA
mn8:12.33	‘Others will be pompous, but here we will not be pompous.’	NA
mn8:12.34	‘Others will be arrogant, but here we will not be arrogant.’	NA
mn8:12.35	‘Others will be hard to admonish, but here we will not be hard to admonish.’	These three items are not part of a defined set, and in addition are absent from MA 91.
mn8:12.36	‘Others will have bad friends, but here we will have good friends.’	NA
mn8:12.37	‘Others will be negligent, but here we will be diligent.’	NA
mn8:12.38	‘Others will be faithless, but here we will have faith.’	These seven are the seven good (and bad) qualities of [mn53:11.1]().
mn8:12.39	‘Others will be conscienceless, but here we will have a sense of conscience.’	These seven are also in [mn53]().
mn8:12.40	‘Others will be imprudent, but here we will be prudent.’	NA
mn8:12.41	‘Others will be unlearned, but here we will be well learned.’	NA
mn8:12.42	‘Others will be lazy, but here we will be energetic.’	NA
mn8:12.43	‘Others will be unmindful, but here we will be mindful.’	NA
mn8:12.44	‘Others will be witless, but here we will be accomplished in wisdom.’	NA
mn8:12.45	‘Others will be attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go, but here we will not be attached to our own views, not holding them tight, but will let them go easily.’	Typically this follows “corrupt wishes and wrong view” (eg. [an6.36:2.5](), [dn33:2.2.61]()), thus is not part of a defined set in this sutta, and is also absent from MA 91.
mn8:13.0	2. Giving Rise to the Thought	NA
mn8:13.1	Cunda, I say that even giving rise to the thought of skillful qualities is very helpful, let alone following that path in body and speech.	This round foregrounds the “starting point”. Before we do anything, we think of doing it, and that in itself is powerful, as it sets the mind in a certain direction. For the Buddha, the mental intentions that underlie bodily behaviors are crucial, whereas for the Jains it is the bodily behaviors themselves that matter.
mn8:13.2	That’s why you should give rise to the following thoughts. ‘Others will be cruel, but here we will not be cruel.’	NA
mn8:13.3	‘Others will kill living creatures, but here we will not kill living creatures.’ …	NA
mn8:13.4	‘Others will be attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go, but here we will not be attached to our own views, not holding them tight, but will let them go easily.’	NA
mn8:14.0	3. Bypassing	NA
mn8:14.1	Cunda, suppose there was a rough path and another smooth path to get around it.	When the path is rough, the Buddha encourages us to find a smoother path. The undertakings of the Buddhist path should be pleasant and lead to happiness. While the path can be difficult, the difficulty itself is of no value. This is in implicit contrast with the Jains, who gave themselves to “burning off” (_tapas_) kamma through agonizing austerities.
mn8:14.2	Or suppose there was a rough ford and another smooth ford to get around it.	NA
mn8:14.3	In the same way, a cruel individual bypasses it by not being cruel. An individual who kills bypasses it by not killing. …	NA
mn8:14.4	NA	NA
mn8:14.5	An individual who is attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go, gets around it by not being attached to their own views, not holding them tight, but letting them go easily.	NA
mn8:15.0	4. Going Up	NA
mn8:15.1	Cunda, all unskillful qualities lead downwards, while all skillful qualities lead upwards.	This round emphasizes the unifying quality of good and bad, so that any good deed, no matter how small or insignificant, leads in the same direction.
mn8:15.2	In the same way, a cruel individual is led upwards by not being cruel. An individual who kills is led upwards by not killing …	NA
mn8:15.3	An individual who is attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go, is led upwards by not being attached to their own views, not holding them tight, but letting them go easily.	NA
mn8:16.0	5. The Exposition by Extinguishment	NA
mn8:16.1	If you’re sinking in the mud yourself, Cunda, it is quite impossible for you to pull out someone else who is sinking in the mud.	NA
mn8:16.2	But if you’re not sinking in the mud yourself, it is quite possible for you to pull out someone else who is sinking in the mud.	NA

mn9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn9:1.3	There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:	The Chinese and Sanskrit parallels depict this discourse as a conversation between Sāriputta and Mahākoṭṭhita, a context that appears to have been lost in the Pali. The sutta proceeds by starting with a simple analysis of right view, gradually stepping into deeper waters. Much of the discourse is framed in terms of dependent origination, but it focuses on the dependently originated phenomena, rather than the process of causality (see [sn12.20]() for this distinction).
mn9:1.4	“Reverends, mendicants!”	NA
mn9:1.5	“Reverend,” they replied.	NA
mn9:1.6	Sāriputta said this:	NA
mn9:2.1	“Reverends, they speak of this thing called ‘right view’.	NA
mn9:2.2	How do you define a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching?”	In other words, a stream-enterer. In [mn141:5.6](), Sāriputta is said to teach students as far as as stream-entry, while his friend Moggallāna leads them to arahantship.
mn9:2.3	“Reverend, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta.	NA

mn9:2.5	The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	NA
mn9:2.6	“Well then, reverends, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn9:2.7	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.	NA
mn9:2.8	Sāriputta said this:	NA
mn9:3.1	“A noble disciple understands the unskillful and its root, and the skillful and its root.	That is, the deed and the motivating force behind the deed.
mn9:3.2	When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching.	Sāriputta had a deliberate, systematic, and unhurried approach to teaching. First he introduces a fundamental question, in this case stream-entry. Then he gives a simple and practical answer. Then he goes on to draw out implications both broad and deep.
mn9:4.1	But what is the unskillful and what is its root? And what is the skillful and what is its root?	NA
mn9:4.2	Killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and covetousness, ill will, and wrong view.	Note that covetousness, ill will, and wrong view are strong forms of greed, hate, and delusion respectively.
mn9:4.3	This is called the unskillful.	NA
mn9:5.1	And what is the root of the unskillful?	NA
mn9:5.2	Greed, hate, and delusion.	NA
mn9:5.3	This is called the root of the unskillful.	NA
mn9:6.1	And what is the skillful?	NA
mn9:6.2	Avoiding killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; avoiding speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; contentment, good will, and right view.	These are the “ten ways of doing skillful deeds” (_dasakusalakammapathā_). There is a detailed explanation at [mn41:7.1]().
mn9:6.3	This is called the skillful.	NA
mn9:7.1	And what is the root of the skillful?	NA
mn9:7.2	Contentment, love, and understanding.	NA
mn9:7.3	This is called the root of the skillful.	NA
mn9:8.1	A noble disciple understands in this way the unskillful and its root, and the skillful and its root. They’ve completely given up the underlying tendency to greed, got rid of the underlying tendency to repulsion, and eradicated the underlying tendency to the view and conceit ‘I am’. They’ve given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge, and make an end of suffering in this very life.	This passage, which is repeated throughout the sutta, indicates the arahant. The phrasing is problematic, as it suggests that one has right view (stream-entry) only after fully relinquishing all defilements (arahantship). The commentary records a discussion of this problem, but in fact it is probably due to a textual corruption in the Pali text, as the parallels at MA 29 and SA 344 lack this passage. This shows how difficulties in the Pali text can sometimes lead to fruitless discussions in the absence of the broader context offered by parallels.
mn9:8.2	When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching.”	NA
mn9:9.1	Saying “Good, sir,” those mendicants approved and agreed with what Sāriputta said. Then they asked another question:	NA
mn9:9.2	“But reverend, might there be another way to describe a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching?”	By giving a brief and simple answer to a profound question, Sāriputta leaves room for the audience to request further explanation. This teaching method ensures audience engagement and conveys information in digestible doses.
mn9:10.1	“There might, reverends.	NA
mn9:10.2	A noble disciple understands fuel, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.	Sāriputta introduces the framework of the four noble truths, but structured in terms of “fuel” rather than suffering. | “Fuel” (or “food” or “nutriment”, _āhāra_) refers to both the thing that acts as a condition, fuel, or support, as well as the internal grasping and attachment to that thing. Its use as a philosophical term appears to be an innovation by the Buddha, replacing the _anna_ so dear to Vedic seers.
mn9:10.3	When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching.	NA
mn9:11.1	But what is fuel? What is its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation?	NA
mn9:11.2	There are these four fuels. They maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born.	Also at [mn38:15.1](), [sn12.11](), [sn12.12](), [sn12.63](), [sn12.64](); cp [snp1.8:5.3](). | “About to be born” is _sambhavesī_, which I follow Norman and Bodhi in reading as a future active participle, although the commentary takes it in the sense “seeking” to be born. Compare such Sanskrit constructions as Rig Veda 1.66.8, _yamo ha jāto yamo janitvaṁ_ (“the twin that is born and the twin about to be born”) and Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.3.1.24, _bhūtaṁ caiva bhaviṣyacca jātaṁ ca janiṣyamāṇaṁ_ (“has become and will be, born and to be born”). | The phrase is one of several in the suttas that appears to indicate an intermediate state between one life and the next, despite the fact that this view is formally rejected by the Theravada Abhidhamma ([Kv 8.2](https://suttacentral.net/kv8.2)).
mn9:11.3	What four?	NA
mn9:11.4	Solid food, whether solid or subtle; contact is the second, mental intention the third, and consciousness the fourth.	Coarse solid food sustains the bodies of beings in the human and animal realms, while fine solid food sustains the gods and ancestors, a belief intertwined with the Vedic notion that the gods partake of the food offered in sacrifice (eg. Rig Veda 1.187). | “Contact” (_phassa_) is the interaction between the inner and outer worlds, allowing us to situate ourselves in a sensory world full of fears and joys, stimulating feeling and hence the craving for more. | “Volition” (_manosañcetanā_) allows us to act in the world revealed by the senses and secure further “fuel”. | “Consciousness” (_viññāṇa_) is aware of all this, experiencing suffering, and giving rise to a new “name and form” in a future life in a fruitless search to find a world free of pain. Thus the four “fuels” can be considered as a distinctive perspective on dependent origination, which is expanded further in the subsequent items.
mn9:11.5	Fuel originates from craving. Fuel ceases when craving ceases. The practice that leads to the cessation of fuel is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:	The word _āhāra_ (“fuel”, “food”, “nutriment”) means literally “intake”, and is etymologically parallel to _upādāna_, “grasping”, “uptake”. Both terms have dual senses, on the one hand denoting fuel or sustenance, and on the other grasping and attachment. That is why here (as at [mn38:16.1]()), _āhāra_ is created by craving, just like _upādāna_ in the standard sequence ([mn38:17.8]()).
mn9:11.6	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.	NA
mn9:12.1	A noble disciple understands in this way fuel, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation. They’ve completely given up the underlying tendency to greed, got rid of the underlying tendency to repulsion, and eradicated the underlying tendency to the view and conceit ‘I am’. They’ve given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge, and make an end of suffering in this very life.	NA
mn9:12.2	When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching.”	NA
mn9:13.1	Saying “Good, sir,” those mendicants … asked another question:	NA
mn9:13.2	“But reverend, might there be another way to describe a noble disciple who … has come to the true teaching?”	NA
mn9:14.1	“There might, reverends.	NA
mn9:14.2	A noble disciple understands suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.	Here Sāriputta gives the classic statement on the four noble truths in terms of suffering (_dukkha_).
mn9:14.3	When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who … has come to the true teaching.	NA
mn9:15.1	But what is suffering? What is its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation?	NA
mn9:15.2	Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; association with the disliked is suffering; separation from the liked is suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering.	The definitions of the four noble truths are direct quotes from the Buddha’s first sermon, the Dhammacakkappavattanasutta ([sn56.11:4.2]()). They are notably emphasized by Sāriputta, who delves even further into them ([mn28:3.2](), [mn141:10.2]()), as he does later in this sutta also.
mn9:15.3	This is called suffering.	NA
mn9:16.1	And what is the origin of suffering?	NA
mn9:16.2	It’s the craving that leads to future lives, mixed up with relishing and greed, taking pleasure wherever it lands. That is,	This definition clarifies two common misunderstandings. First, not all desire causes suffering, for some kinds of desire lead out of suffering ([sn51.15:4.1]()). Second, rebirth is not a tangential part of the Buddha’s teachings, uncritically inherited from cultural suppositions; it is baked into the fundamental meaning of the four noble truths. | The idiom _tatratatra_ (literally “there, there”) is not selective (“here and there”) but distributive (“everywhere”). By taking pleasure in sense experience, the mind binds itself to the need for continued stimulation in future lives. The distancing sense “there” is important, for craving does not merely satisfy itself with what it currently experiences, but must always seek out renewed gratification. For an Upaniṣadic precursor, see the note to the same idiom at [mn2:8.8]().
mn9:16.3	craving for sensual pleasures, craving for continued existence, and craving to end existence.	Craving is a primal desire or hunger, often unconscious. | “Craving for sensual pleasures” (_kāmataṇhā_): the desire to experience pleasure through any of the five senses. | “Craving for continued existence” (_bhavataṇhā_): the desire to continue living in some form after death. | “Craving to end existence” (_vibhavataṇhā_): the desire to annihilate the self.
mn9:16.4	This is called the origin of suffering.	NA
mn9:17.1	And what is the cessation of suffering?	NA
mn9:17.2	It’s the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not clinging to it.	These terms are used widely in different senses, but here they are all synonyms of “extinction” (_nibbāna_). | Note especially the appearance of _cāga_ (“giving”) here. Giving is regarded as the most basic foundation of moral practice, yet even in its simplest form it partakes of the same nature as Nibbana.
mn9:17.3	This is called the cessation of suffering.	NA
mn9:18.1	And what is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering?	NA
mn9:18.2	It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:	NA

mn9:18.4	This is called the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.	NA
mn9:19.1	A noble disciple understands in this way suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.

mn9:21.1	“There might, reverends.	NA
mn9:21.2	A noble disciple understands old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation …	This is a nice example of Sāriputta’s analytical genius. He picks up “old age and death” from the explanation of “suffering” and treats it within the framework of the four noble truths. This creates continuity with the previous sections, as well as situating it within the Buddha’s teachings as a whole, since all footprints fit in an elephant’s footprint ([mn28:2.1]()). Further, he *deepens* understanding by applying the four noble truths recursively, bringing small details into close focus. Meanwhile, this item, following on from “suffering”, leads into the familiar sequence of items from dependent origination. Thus he simultaneously *broadens* the scope by linking the four noble truths with dependent origination.
mn9:22.1	But what are old age and death? What is their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation?	NA
mn9:22.2	The old age, decrepitude, broken teeth, gray hair, wrinkly skin, diminished vitality, and failing faculties of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.	_Jarā_ is neither the process of getting old (“ageing”), nor a psychological metaphor, but the physical state of being old (“old age”). The same applies to the definitions of “death” and “rebirth”.
mn9:22.3	This is called old age.	NA
mn9:22.4	And what is death?	Text lacks the expected question “what is old age?” on the previous section.
mn9:22.5	The passing away, perishing, disintegration, demise, mortality, death, decease, breaking up of the aggregates, laying to rest of the corpse, and cutting off of the life faculty of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.	NA

mn9:29.1	“There might, reverends.	NA
mn9:29.2	A noble disciple understands continued existence, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.	_Bhava_ means “being, existence, life” in the sense of “past and future lives”. The concept of _bhava_ includes both active and resultant dimensions of life. Consider it by analogy with, say, visiting a park. First there is the spark of an idea, a vague impression of a “park” in the mind, which solidifies into an intention. Acting on it, one goes to the park, where it becomes ones’ reality, the “world” one inhabits. Likewise, by creating ideas and volitions in the mind, one is aligning or tuning into the corresponding realm of existence, priming the mind to project itself into that state and make it a reality when one is reborn there.
mn9:30.1	But what is continued existence? What is its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation?	NA
mn9:30.2	There are these three states of continued existence.	The idea of three “worlds” (_loka_) or “states of existence” (_bhava_), variously defined, is shared between Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism. It originally referred to the earth (_bhū_, _pṛthivi_), the midspace (_antarikṣa_), and the heavens or sky (_diva_, _svarga_), the respective abodes of humanity, the ancestors, and the gods. In the mythology underlying the Vedas they were formed by Indra’s heroic deeds: empowered by soma, he first slew the dragon Vṛtra who bound the world in a mass of darkness, then he separated earth from sky, leaving the midspace between (Rig Veda 2.15), thus creating the visible or intelligible world.
mn9:30.3	Existence in the sensual realm, the realm of luminous form, and the formless realm.	The “sensual realm” encompasses all realms, including the human, from the lowest hell to the highest of the sensual heavens, the gods who control what is imagined by others. | “Luminous form” (_rūpa_) refers to the Brahmā realms attained through the luminous mind of _jhāna_. | The “formless” realms are attained through the formless meditations.
mn9:30.4	Continued existence originates from grasping. Continued existence ceases when grasping ceases. The practice that leads to the cessation of continued existence is simply this noble eightfold path …”	NA

mn9:33.1	“There might, reverends.	NA
mn9:33.2	A noble disciple understands grasping, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation …	“Grasping” (_upādāna_) has the active sense of “taking up” a new life, not just “clinging” to what one has. As noted above, it has a dual sense, because, like _āhāra_, it also means the “fuel” that sustains the fire of existence.
mn9:34.1	But what is grasping? What is its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation?	NA
mn9:34.2	There are these four kinds of grasping.	NA
mn9:34.3	Grasping at sensual pleasures, views, precepts and observances, and theories of a self.	Grasping begins with the primal desire of the senses, but the three other graspings are rather intellectual and sophisticated. Only a grown human being with a developed linguistic ability is able to formulate a view to become attached to, and likewise with attachment to religious observances and vows, and to theories of a self.

mn9:61.2	A noble disciple understands choices, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation …	This is the final item in the Chinese and Sanskrit parallels.
mn9:62.1	But what are choices? What is their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation?	_Saṅkhāra_ in early Buddhism has three main doctrinal senses. (1) The broadest sense is “conditioned phenomena”, which essentially means “everything except Nibbana”. (2) Sometimes it is a physical or mental “process” or “activity”, such as vitality or the breath. (3) In the five aggregates and dependent origination it has the sense of “morally potent volitions or choices” and is a synonym for _cetanā_ (“intention”) or _kamma_ (“deed”). It is defined as good, bad, and imperturbable choices ([dn33:1.10.77](), [sn12.51:9.4]()), the latter of which refers to the kamma of the fourth _jhāna_ and above. In this sense it is the moral “choices” for good or ill that propel consciousness into a new rebirth.
mn9:62.2	There are these three kinds of choice.	NA
mn9:62.3	Choices by way of body, speech, and mind.	This set of three refers to deeds carried out through the body, speech, and mind (eg. [mn57:8.2]()). “Mind” is _citta_, while the Sanskrit Dṛṣṭisampannasūtra has _mano_ in the parallel passage ([SF 172](https://suttacentral.net/sf172/san/tripathi#tri23.17b)). In dependent origination these are synonyms ([sn12.61:2.1]()). Not to be confused with the same terms when used in the context of mindfulness of breathing ([sn41.6:1.5]()).
mn9:62.4	Choices originate from ignorance. Choices cease when ignorance ceases. The practice that leads to the cessation of choices is simply this noble eightfold path …”	NA
mn9:64.2	“Might there be another way to describe a noble disciple?”	NA
mn9:64.3	“There might, reverends.	NA
mn9:65.1	A noble disciple understands ignorance, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation …	“Ignorance” is the only item not found in the Chinese and Sanskrit parallels. Perhaps the original form of the sutta treated ignorance solely under its inverse, which is right view itself. Thus the lack of ignorance as a separate item could have been deliberate, emphasizing how the entirety of right view, encompassing all items in the discourse, implies the opposite of ignorance.
mn9:65.3	But what is ignorance? What is its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation?	NA

mn9:66.1	Ignorance originates from defilement. Ignorance ceases when defilement ceases. The practice that leads to the cessation of ignorance is simply this noble eightfold path …”	The current presentation is unique, as ignorance is itself one of the defilements (_āsava_). Ignorance is normally the final item in dependent origination, the “head” from which all follows ([snp5.1:51.1]()). Nonetheless, causality is not a linear process, so a starting point is identified only for practical reasons. At [an10.62:2.4]() the five hindrances are said to be the “fuel” for ignorance.
mn9:68.1	Saying “Good, sir,” those mendicants approved and agreed with what Sāriputta said. Then they asked another question:	NA

mn9:69.1	“There might, reverends.	NA
mn9:69.2	A noble disciple understands defilement, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.	The appearance of “defilement” (_āsava_) at the end is appropriate, as its appearance in the four noble truths formula usually signifies arahantship. Nonetheless, the Chinese and Sanskrit parallels place it much earlier, after the four fuels. The sequence of the remaining items is mostly consistent between parallels.

The practice that leads to the cessation of defilement is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:	Ignorance and defilements are locked in a cycle of mutual dependent conditioning: ignorance begets more ignorance. Compare the mutual conditioning of consciousness with name and form at [dn15:20.1](). One implication of this is that no first point of ignorance and hence no first point of transmigration can be known.

mn10:1.1	So I have heard.	This discourse is copied at [dn22](), where the section on the four noble truths has been expanded with material mostly drawn from [mn141](). These discourses are the most influential texts for modern Theravada meditation, prompting countless modern commentaries. Comparative study of the several parallel versions reveals that this discourse, while comprised almost entirely of early material, was compiled in this form as one of the latest texts in the Pali suttas. | While mindfulness is always useful ([sn46.53:15.4]()), the “establishment of mindfulness” (_satipaṭṭhāna_) refers especially to a conscious development of contemplative practices based on mindfulness, i.e. “mindfulness meditation” or simply “meditation”.
mn10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma.	NA
mn10:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn10:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn10:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn10:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn10:2.1	“Mendicants, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment.	The phrase _ekāyano maggo_ (“path to convergence”) is given multiple meanings in commentaries and ancient translations. Outside of _satipaṭṭhāna_, it is used in only one context in Pali, where it means to “come together with” ([mn12:37.5]()). At [sn47.18:3.4]() the phrase is spoken by Brahmā, which suggests it was a Brahmanical term. At Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.11—a passage full of details shared with the suttas—it means a place where things unite or converge. Thus _satipaṭṭhāna_ leads to everything “coming together as one”. In other words, as seventh factor of the noble eightfold path, it leads to _samādhi_, the eighth factor ([sn45.1:3.9](); see also [mn44:12.3]()).
mn10:3.1	What four?	NA
mn10:3.2	It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	The idiom _kāye kāyānupassī_, literally “one who observes a body in the body” refers to focusing on a specific aspect of embodied experience, such as the breath, the postures, etc. | “Keen” (or “ardent”, _ātāpī_) implies effort, while “aware” (_sampajāno_) is the wisdom of understanding situation and context. | “Covetousness and displeasure” (_abhijjhādomanassaṁ_) are the strong forms of desire and aversion that are overcome by sense restraint in preparation for meditation.
mn10:3.3	They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	“Feelings” (_vedanā_) are the basic tones of pleasant, painful, or neutral, not the complexes we call “emotions”.
mn10:3.4	They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	“Mind” (_citta_) is simple awareness. In meditation contexts, “mind” is often similar in meaning to _samādhi_.
mn10:3.5	They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	“Principles” (_dhammā_) are the natural “systems” of cause and effect that underlie the “teachings”. The renderings “mind objects” or “mental qualities” are incorrect, as many of the things spoken of in this section are neither mind objects nor mental qualities. “Phenomena” is a possible translation, but the emphasis is not on the “appearance” of things, but on the “principles” governing their conditional relations.
mn10:3.6	NA	NA
mn10:4.0.1	1. Observing the Body	NA
mn10:4.0.2	1.1. Mindfulness of Breathing	NA
mn10:4.1	And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the body?	NA
mn10:4.2	It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in their presence.	The situation here—a mendicant gone to the forest—establishes that this practice takes place in the wider context of the Gradual Training. Indeed, this whole sutta can be understood as an expansion of this phrase, mentioned briefly at [dn2:67.3]().
mn10:4.3	Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.	The most fundamental meditation instruction. Notice how the Buddha phrases it: not “concentrate on the breath” as an object, but rather “breathing” as an activity to which one brings mindfulness. The stages of breath meditation are not meant to be done deliberately, but to be observed and understood as the natural process of deepening meditation.
mn10:4.4	Breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’	In the beginning, the breath is somewhat rough and coarse. The Pali idiom is “long” and “short” breath, but in English we usually say to breathe “heavily” or “lightly”.
mn10:4.5	When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ Breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’	Over time, the breath becomes more subtle and soft.
mn10:4.6	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the whole body.’	Contextually the idiom “whole body” (_sabbakāya_) here refers to the breath, marking the fuller and more continuous awareness that arises with tranquility. Some practitioners, however, interpret it as the “whole physical body”, broadening awareness to encompass the movement and settling of energies throughout the body.
mn10:4.7	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the physical process.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the physical process.’	The “physical process” (_kāyasaṅkhāraṁ_) is the breath itself ([sn41.6:1.8]()). This can become so soft as to be imperceptible.
mn10:4.8	It’s like a deft carpenter or carpenter’s apprentice. When making a deep cut they know: ‘I’m making a deep cut,’ and when making a shallow cut they know: ‘I’m making a shallow cut.’	Text has “long” and “short”, but “deep” and “shallow” or “heavy” and “light” are more idiomatic for describing the breath in English.
mn10:4.9	NA	NA
mn10:4.10	NA	NA
mn10:4.11	NA	NA
mn10:5.1	And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally.	“Internally” is one’s own body, “externally” the bodies of others, or external physical phenomena. This distinction is applied broadly in Buddhist meditation, but it is more relevant in some contexts than others. In the case of the breath, one is focusing on one’s own breath, but when contemplating, say, a dead body, or the material elements, there is more of an external dimension. Starting with “me” in here and the “world” out there, this practice dissolves this distinction so that we see we are of the same nature as everything else.
mn10:5.2	They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish.	This is the _vipassanā_ (“insight” or “discernment”) dimension of meditation, observing not just the rise and fall of phenomena, but also their conditioned “nature” as being “liable” (_-dhamma_) to impermanence. The meaning of this passage is explained at ([sn47.42]()). Apart from these passages, _vipassanā_ in _satipaṭṭhāna_ pertains specially to the observation of principles.
mn10:5.3	Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.	Mindfulness meditation leads to a range of knowledges as detailed by Anuruddha at [sn52.6]() and [sn52.11]()–24. An arahant is “independent” of any attachment (eg. [mn143]()), but _satipaṭṭhāna_ is also taught to give up dependency on views of the past and future ([dn29:40.1]()).

mn10:5.5	NA	NA
mn10:6.0	1.2. The Postures	NA
mn10:6.1	Furthermore, when a mendicant is walking they know: ‘I am walking.’ When standing they know: ‘I am standing.’ When sitting they know: ‘I am sitting.’ And when lying down they know: ‘I am lying down.’	In early Pali, this practice is found only in the two Satipaṭṭhānasuttas and the closely related Kāyagatāsatisutta ([mn119]()). It is practiced by developing a reflexive awareness of one’s posture and activity as it proceeds, often assisted by moving slowly and carefully.

mn10:7.5	NA	NA
mn10:8.0	1.3. Situational Awareness	NA
mn10:8.1	Furthermore, a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.	“Situational awareness” (_sampajañña_) understands the context and purpose of activities. The main examples here illustrate the activities of daily monastic life: leaving the monastery on almsround, restraint while in the town, care wearing the robes, then mindfully eating and going to the toilet.

mn10:10.1	Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth.	This practice is intended to counter sexual desire and obsession. The primary focus is on one’s own body, rather than another’s body, although that can be brought in also. By focusing on aspects of our body that we normally prefer to ignore, we move towards a healthy sense of acceptance and neutrality towards our body.
mn10:10.2	‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’	Thirty-one parts are mentioned in early texts, later expanded to thirty-two with the addition of the “brain” (_matthaluṅga_).
mn10:10.3	It’s as if there were a bag with openings at both ends, filled with various kinds of grains, such as fine rice, wheat, mung beans, peas, sesame, and ordinary rice. And someone with clear eyes were to open it and examine the contents: ‘These grains are fine rice, these are wheat, these are mung beans, these are peas, these are sesame, and these are ordinary rice.’	The “bag with openings at both ends” is the body. Not all the varieties of grains and beans can be positively identified.

mn10:12.2	‘In this body there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.’	While meditation on the elements is commonly taught in early texts, this phrase is found only in the two Satipaṭṭhānasuttas and the Kāyagatāsatisutta. Detailed instructions are found in such suttas as [mn28]() and [mn140](). This meditation works in any posture, whereas breath meditation is best done sitting, to allow the breath to become still.
mn10:12.3	It’s as if a deft butcher or butcher’s apprentice were to kill a cow and sit down at the crossroads with the meat cut into chops.	This gruesome image shows that butchery of cows was a normal feature of ancient Indian life. | A wide range of skilled workers have an “apprentice”, including potters, goldsmiths, accountants, carpenters, magicians, etc. The word is _antevāsī_, literally “one who dwells within”, suggesting that apprentices would stay with their teacher.

Cremation was expensive and not available to everyone. Bodies might be left in the charnel ground for a variety of reasons, such as local customs, lack of funds, or in cases of inauspicious death such as murder or execution. This is still seen in some places today, and monastics occasionally take the opportunity to practice meditation beside a corpse. However the wording of the Pali sounds like an imaginative exercise.

mn10:32.1	And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of feelings?	Literally “a feeling among the feelings”; the practice shows that the meditator contemplates specific feelings as they occur.
mn10:32.2	It’s when a mendicant who feels a pleasant feeling knows: ‘I feel a pleasant feeling.’	Pali employs direct quotes to indicate reflexive awareness: you feel the feeling and you know that you feel the feeling. It does not mean that you have to literally say “I feel a pleasant feeling”, although some adopt that as a meditation method.

mn10:32.5	When they feel a pleasant feeling of the flesh, they know: ‘I feel a pleasant feeling of the flesh.’	Feelings “of the flesh” (_sāmisa_)  are associated with the body and sensual desires ([sn36.31:4.1]()).
mn10:32.6	When they feel a pleasant feeling not of the flesh, they know: ‘I feel a pleasant feeling not of the flesh.’	Feelings “not of the flesh” (_nirāmisa_) are associated with renunciation and especially with the _jhānas_ and liberation ([sn36.31:5.1]()).
mn10:32.7	When they feel a painful feeling of the flesh, they know: ‘I feel a painful feeling of the flesh.’	NA

mn10:34.0	3. Observing the Mind	NA
mn10:34.1	And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the mind?	In Buddhist theory, awareness of the presence or absence of qualities such as greed is explained on three levels. There is the simple happenstance of whether greed is present at that time or not. Then there is the mind freed of greed through the power of absorption. Finally there is the liberation from greed which comes with full awakening.

mn10:36.0.2	4.1. The Hindrances	NA
mn10:36.1	And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of principles?	NA
mn10:36.2	It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the five hindrances.	The Satipaṭṭhānavibhaṅga of the Pali Abhidhamma only mentions the hindrances and awakening factors in this section ([Vb 7](https://suttacentral.net/vb7)). This, together with a range of other evidence, suggests that this was the original content of the observation of principles.
mn10:36.3	And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of principles with respect to the five hindrances?	NA
mn10:36.4	It’s when a mendicant who has sensual desire in them understands: ‘I have sensual desire in me.’ When they don’t have sensual desire in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have sensual desire in me.’ They understand how sensual desire arises; how, when it’s already arisen, it’s given up; and how, once it’s given up, it doesn’t arise again in the future.	Here causality is introduced. In the contemplation of mind, the meditator was aware of the presence or absence of desire in the mind. Now they look deeper, investigating the cause of desire and understanding how to be free of it forever. This contemplation of the “principles” of cause and effect is the distinctive feature of this section.
mn10:36.5	When they have ill will in them, they understand: ‘I have ill will in me.’ When they don’t have ill will in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have ill will in me.’ They understand how ill will arises; how, when it’s already arisen, it’s given up; and how, once it’s given up, it doesn’t arise again in the future.	NA
mn10:36.6	When they have dullness and drowsiness in them, they understand: ‘I have dullness and drowsiness in me.’ When they don’t have dullness and drowsiness in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have dullness and drowsiness in me.’ They understand how dullness and drowsiness arise; how, when they’ve already arisen, they’re given up; and how, once they’re given up, they don’t arise again in the future.	The Buddhist schools debated whether this included physical tiredness or not. The Theravada argued that it was purely a mental laziness, as even the Buddha got sleepy.
mn10:36.7	When they have restlessness and remorse in them, they understand: ‘I have restlessness and remorse in me.’ When they don’t have restlessness and remorse in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have restlessness and remorse in me.’ They understand how restlessness and remorse arise; how, when they’ve already arisen, they’re given up; and how, once they’re given up, they don’t arise again in the future.	NA
mn10:36.8	When they have doubt in them, they understand: ‘I have doubt in me.’ When they don’t have doubt in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have doubt in me.’ They understand how doubt arises; how, when it’s already arisen, it’s given up; and how, once it’s given up, it doesn’t arise again in the future.

mn10:38.3	It’s when a mendicant contemplates:	NA
mn10:38.4	‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.	“Form” (_rūpa_) is one’s own body and the external material world experienced through the senses. More subtly, it represents the “appearance” of physical phenomena, even when experienced solely in the mind as color, visions, etc.
mn10:38.5	Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling.	NA
mn10:38.6	Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is the ending of perception.	“Perception” (_saññā_) is the recognition or interpretation of experience in terms of meaningful wholes. We see, for example, “color” yet we perceive a “person”. In the Vinaya we find many examples where a person perceived things in one way, yet they turned out to be something else.
mn10:38.7	Such are choices, such is the origin of choices, such is the ending of choices.	In the five aggregates, _saṅkhārā_ is a synonym for “volition” (_cetanā_). The traditions later used it as a catch-all category for everything that does not fit in the other aggregates. In the suttas, however, the purpose of the aggregates is not to classify everything that exists, but to contemplate aspects of experience that we tend to identify as a “self”.

The same teaching is given more briefly at [an4.241:1.1](), where the four ascetics are defined as the stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, and perfected one,  and at [dn16:5.27.3](), where the presence of the four ascetics is attributed to the practice of the eightfold path.

The sequence of operative terms here is _allīna_, _upagata_, _ajjhosita_. Normally _allīna_ in Pali means to “stick to, cling to”.  But read this passage compared to [sn12.15:2.5]() where we find a similar movement of drawing close (_upagata_)and getting attached. The Mahāvastu in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit features _allīyati_ in the sense “approach”, “resort”. This lends a greater coherence to this passage.

mn12:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn12:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying outside the city of Vesālī in a woodland grove west of the town.	This description of the Buddha’s location is unique.
mn12:2.1	Now at that time Sunakkhatta the Licchavi had recently left this teaching and training.	Sunakkhatta’s dismal spiritual career began when he met the Buddha in [mn105](). In [dn6:5.3]() we learn that, after being ordained three years, he spoke of his limited success in meditation. The current sutta and [dn24]() deal with Sunakkhatta’s bitter criticisms of the Buddha shortly after his disrobal.
mn12:2.2	He was telling a crowd in Vesālī:	NA
mn12:2.3	“The ascetic Gotama has no superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.	These distinctions are defined in the Vinaya as “absorption, release, immersion, attainment, knowledge and vision, development of the path, realization of the fruits, giving up the defilements, a mind without hindrances, delighting in an empty dwelling” ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.8]()). They may be summarized as absorption, psychic abilities, and realization of the paths and fruits.
mn12:2.4	He teaches what he’s worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing his own perspective.	The Buddha taught that logic alone is an unreliable guide to the truth ([mn76:27.2](), [dn1:1.34.2]()), a fact of which Sunakkhatta was apparently not aware.
mn12:2.5	And his teaching leads those who practice it to the complete ending of suffering, the goal for which it’s taught.”	The Chinese parallel at T 757, rather, raises the question, “How could such a teaching lead to freedom from suffering?”
mn12:3.1	Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.	NA
mn12:3.2	He heard what Sunakkhatta was saying.	NA
mn12:3.3	NA	NA
mn12:3.4	NA	NA
mn12:3.5	NA	NA
mn12:3.6	Then he wandered for alms in Vesālī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	NA

mn12:3.11	NA	NA
mn12:4.1	“Sāriputta, Sunakkhatta, that futile man, is angry.	“Futile man” (_moghapurisa_) refers to someone who has been led astray by delusion.
mn12:4.2	His words are spoken out of anger.	NA
mn12:4.3	Thinking he criticizes the Realized One, in fact he just praises him.	NA
mn12:4.4	For it is praise of the Realized One to say:	NA
mn12:4.5	‘His teaching leads those who practice it to the complete ending of suffering, the goal for which it’s taught.’	NA
mn12:5.1	But there’s no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teaching:	“Inference from the teaching” (_dhammanvaya_) is a valid form of knowledge, where someone who has seen the Dhamma draws a reasoned conclusion based on fundamental principles.
mn12:5.2	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
mn12:6.1	And there’s no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teaching:	NA
mn12:6.2	‘That Blessed One wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying himself and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the realm of divinity.’	The Buddha introduces these here because, as we know from [dn24:1.4.1](), Sunakkhatta thought that such displays were a worthy goal of spiritual practice. The Chinese parallel, however, omits the psychic powers and instead has the _jhānas_. | This passage begins the six direct knowledges.
mn12:7.1	And there’s no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teaching:	NA
mn12:7.2	‘That Blessed One, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, hears both kinds of sounds, human and heavenly, whether near or far.’	NA

mn12:9.1	There are these ten powers of a Realized One that the Realized One possesses. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.	After the first three of the direct knowledges, the sequence is interrupted with the insertion of these ten powers of a Realized One, also found at [an10.21]() and [an10.22](). The Vibhaṅga, an early Abhidhamma book, gives a detailed explanation ([Vb 16:353](https://suttacentral.net/vb16/pli/ms#353.1) ff.). | Five powers are listed at [an5.11]() and six at [an6.64]().
mn12:9.2	What ten?	NA
mn12:10.1	Firstly, the Realized One truly understands the possible as possible, and the impossible as impossible.	Explained in detail at [mn115:12.1]()–17.
mn12:10.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.	NA
mn12:11.1	Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of grounds and causes.	The Vibhaṅga explains this as knowing the circumstances that prevent or support the fruition of deeds, namely: place of rebirth (_gati_), form of reincarnation (_upadhi_, explained by the commentary as _attabhāva_), time (_kāla_), and effort (_payoga_). | See also the analysis of “deeds” (_kamma_) in [mn57](), [mn135](), and [mn136]().
mn12:11.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …	NA
mn12:12.1	Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands where all paths of practice lead.	Expanded below in [mn12:35.1]()–42.13.
mn12:12.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …	NA
mn12:13.1	Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the world with its many and diverse elements.	See [mn115:4.1]()–9.6.
mn12:13.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …	NA
mn12:14.1	Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the diverse convictions of sentient beings.	This is not explained explicitly, but an example is found at [dn1:1.3.2](), where the Buddha knows the difference between Brahmadatta, who had faith in the triple gem, and Suppiya who did not. Thus _adhimutti_ (“conviction”) means “faith, belief” rather than “disposition”.
mn12:14.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …	NA
mn12:15.1	Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the faculties of other sentient beings and other individuals after comprehending them with his mind.	Exemplified by the Buddha when he surveyed the world after his awakening to see the diverse spiritual potentials of beings ([mn26:21.2](), [mn85:45.4](), [dn14:3.6.2](), [sn6.1:9.2](), [pli-tv-kd1:5.11.1]()).
mn12:15.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …	NA
mn12:16.1	Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments.	“Corruption” is any mental factor that darkens and diminishes meditation; “cleansing” is anything that brightens and enhances it. “Emergence” refers to understanding the reasons why one comes out of a given state of meditation (eg. [mn43:29.1]()). | The phrase “absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments” indicates that, although they are given various technical definitions, these are overlapping terms that describe in different ways the same field of deep meditation experiences.
mn12:16.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …	NA
mn12:17.1	Furthermore, the Realized One recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. He remembers: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so he recollects his many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	Here we return to the final three of the six direct knowledges, which also form the final three of the ten powers.
mn12:17.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …	NA
mn12:18.1	Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Realized One sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, he sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	NA
mn12:18.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …	NA
mn12:19.1	Furthermore, the Realized One has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.	NA
mn12:19.2	Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.	NA
mn12:20.1	A Realized One possesses these ten powers of a Realized One. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.	NA

mn12:21.3	He teaches what he’s worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing his own perspective.’	NA
mn12:21.4	Unless they give up that speech and that thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.	This seems harsh, but the suttas see such denigration of the Buddha as deeply wicked, since it closes off the path to Nibbana, as at [sn42.9:4.12]() where a village chief accuses the Buddha of destroying families by encouraging renunciation. At [dn24:1.16.13]() the Buddha warns Sunakkhatta that the naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta, without likewise giving up his speech, thought, and view, will not even be able to enter the Buddha’s presence, much less debate him.
mn12:21.5	Just as a mendicant accomplished in ethics, immersion, and wisdom would reach enlightenment in this very life, such is the consequence, I say.	NA
mn12:21.6	Unless they give up that speech and that thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.	NA
mn12:22.1	Sāriputta, a Realized One has four kinds of self-assurance. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.	These four “kinds of self-assurance” (_vesārajja_) are also found at [an4.8](). The first three are included in the Buddha’s dressing down of Sarabha at [an3.64]().
mn12:22.2	What four?	NA
mn12:23.1	I see no reason for anyone—whether ascetic, brahmin, god, Māra, or the Divinity, or anyone else in the world—to legitimately scold me, saying: ‘You claim to be a fully awakened Buddha, but you don’t understand these things.’	In his first discourse, the Buddha says that he did not claim to be fully awakened until he had understand the four noble truths in all three rounds and twelve aspects ([sn56.11:10.1]()). | Here _nimitta_ means “reason, ground, basis”.
mn12:23.2	Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.	NA
mn12:24.1	I see no reason for anyone—whether ascetic, brahmin, god, Māra, or the Divinity, or anyone else in the world—to legitimately scold me, saying: ‘You claim to have ended all defilements, but you still have these defilements.’	NA

mn12:25.1	I see no reason for anyone—whether ascetic, brahmin, god, Māra, or the Divinity, or anyone else in the world—to legitimately scold me, saying: ‘The acts that you say are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.’	This was the accusation of Ariṭṭha ([mn22]()). The Chinese parallel identifies the “obstructions” as desire and lust.
mn12:25.2	Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.	NA
mn12:26.1	I see no reason for anyone—whether ascetic, brahmin, god, Māra, or the Divinity, or anyone else in the world—to legitimately scold me, saying: ‘The teaching doesn’t lead those who practice it to the complete ending of suffering, the goal for which it is taught.’	NA

mn12:29.1	Sāriputta, there are these eight assemblies.	Mentioned also at [an8.69](), [dn16:3.21.3](), and [dn33:3.1.139]().

mn12:37.1	When I’ve comprehended the mind of a certain person, I understand:	Here the Buddha describes the process by which he knows where paths lead. First he comprehends their minds, then he infers their destiny, then he confirms the outcome. It is only in this limited way that he knows the future. If, as popular tradition would have it, he was literally omniscient, there would be no need to undertake such a laborious process involving inference, as he could simply directly see whatever he wanted.

Such pits are frequently mentioned in the suttas and must have been a common sight.

mn12:42.4	Suppose there was a lotus pond with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful.	NA
mn12:42.5	Nearby was a dense forest grove.	We have met _tibba_ above in the sense of “sharp” feelings. At [mnd14:58.13](), such a forest is said to be one of the four kinds of darkness.

mn12:43.6	Unless they give up that speech and that thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.	NA
mn12:44.1	Sāriputta, I recall having practiced a spiritual path consisting of four factors.	The Buddha evidently introduces this topic because Sunakkhatta was impressed by displays of austerity. It is a unique description of the Bodhisatta’s practices before awakening. The practices, which for the most part sound very Jain-like, were undertaken in various periods during the six years after the Bodhisatta went forth and before his awakening. | The supposedly Jain “fourfold restraint” is recorded at [mn56:12.2]() and [dn2:29.2](), while at [dn25:16.4]() the Buddha reinterprets it as keeping precepts.
mn12:44.2	I used to be a fervent mortifier, the ultimate fervent mortifier. I used to live rough, the ultimate rough-liver. I used to live in disgust of sin, the ultimate one living in disgust of sin. I used to be secluded, in ultimate seclusion.	“Fervent mortifier” (_tapassī_), “rough-liver” (_lūkha_), “one living in disgust of sin” (_jegucchī_), “secluded” (_pavivitta_).
mn12:45.1	And this is what my fervent mortification was like. I went naked, ignoring conventions. I licked my hands, and didn’t come or stop when asked. I didn’t consent to food brought to me, or food prepared specially for me, or an invitation for a meal.	_Tapas_ (“ardor, fire. fervor, fervent mortification”) is the raging flame of righteous pain that courses through body when it is pushed to its extremes. This “fervor” burns off the corrupting traces of _kamma_ and defilements. | Buddhist mendicants may not receive food in their hands, nor lick them while eating. Followers of the practices listed here would have walked steadily and randomly for alms, accepting only what was given at the time.
mn12:45.2	I didn’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who lives with a man; or where food for distribution is advertised; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. I accepted no fish or meat or beer or wine, and drank no fermented gruel.	Keeping sheep (_eḷaka_, for slaughter) goes against the Jain principle of non-violence, as does keeping weapons (_daṇḍa_). | A _musala_ often means “pestle”, but it can also be a “shovel”; at [mn81:18.12]() it is regarded as a virtue to not use one to dig the soil (which is regarded as being alive in Jainism). | _Thusodaka_ is an alcoholic porridge fermented from grain-husks, mentioned alongside _sovīraka_ in the Pali commentaries and Carakasaṁhitā 27g.191.
mn12:45.3	I went to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls.	NA
mn12:45.4	I fed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day.	NA
mn12:45.5	I ate once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. I lived committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals.	NA
mn12:45.6	I ate herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. I survived on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.	It is not easy to meaningfully distinguish the various kinds of grain.
mn12:45.7	I wore robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings.	All are extremely uncomfortable. Christian ascetics wore a “hair shirt” in order to “mortify the flesh” .
mn12:45.8	I tore out hair and beard, committed to this practice.	Jain ascetics tear out their hair at ordination, rather than shaving.
mn12:45.9	I constantly stood, refusing seats.	Remaining in one posture for months or years at a time is one of the most difficult practices.
mn12:45.10	I squatted, committed to the endeavor of squatting.	NA
mn12:45.11	I lay on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns my bed.	NA
mn12:45.12	I was devoted to ritual bathing three times a day, including the evening.	This seems out of place here. It was a Brahmanical practice ([sn7.21]()), as the Jains refused to bathe at all, hence the “rough living” of the following section. Indeed, bathing three times a day in the Indian climate would, for most of the year, be quite pleasant. Sometimes, however, it was deliberately done in the cold ([ud1.9:1.3]()).
mn12:45.13	And so I lived committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body.	NA
mn12:45.14	Such was my practice of fervent mortification.	NA
mn12:46.1	And this is what my rough living was like.	“Rough” (_lūkha_) is related to the Sanskrit _rūkṣa_, among the meanings of which is “soiled, smeared, dirtied”.
mn12:46.2	The dust and dirt built up on my body over many years until it started flaking off.	NA
mn12:46.3	It’s like the trunk of a pale-moon ebony tree, which builds up bark over many years until it starts flaking off.	NA
mn12:46.4	But it didn’t occur to me:	NA
mn12:46.5	‘Oh, this dust and dirt must be rubbed off by my hand or another’s.’	NA
mn12:46.6	That didn’t occur to me.	NA
mn12:46.7	Such was my rough living.	NA
mn12:47.1	And this is what my living in disgust of sin was like.	NA
mn12:47.2	I’d step forward or back ever so mindfully, so I was full of pity regarding even a drop of water, thinking:	The Bodhisatta learned mindfulness while doing Jain-like practices and later incorporated it into the eightfold path (see also [mn36:20.7]()). He also learned mindfulness under Brahmanical teachers ([mn26:15.17]()). | “Pity” is _dayā_, which is similar to the more commonly found terms _karuṇā_ or _anukampa_.
mn12:47.3	‘May I not injure any little creatures on unclear ground.’	To this day, Jain ascetics carry a soft broom to gently sweep away any insects in their path. | “Unclear ground” (_visamagata_) is explained by the commentary as ground that is uneven or covered in grass, branches, etc. A lion is said to reflect in the same way when setting out on a hunt ([an10.21:1.7]()). | Compare Bhāgavata Purāṇa 5.10.2, where a man carrying a palanquin is so scrupulous about avoiding treading on ants that he stops and starts, making the progress of the palanquin unsteady (_viṣama-gatāṁ_).
mn12:47.4	Such was my living in disgust of sin.	NA
mn12:48.1	And this is what my seclusion was like.	“Seclusion” (_viviktaśayyāsana_) is classified by the Jains as an “external austerity” (_bāhyatapas_) at Tattvārthasūtra 9.19.
mn12:48.2	I would plunge deep into a wilderness region and stay there.	NA
mn12:48.3	When I saw a cowherd or a shepherd, or someone gathering grass or sticks, or a lumberjack, I’d flee from forest to forest, from thicket to thicket, from valley to valley, from uplands to uplands.	NA
mn12:48.4	Why is that?	NA
mn12:48.5	So that I wouldn’t see them, nor they me.	NA
mn12:48.6	I fled like a wild deer seeing a human being.	NA
mn12:48.7	NA	NA
mn12:48.8	NA	NA
mn12:48.9	NA	NA
mn12:48.10	Such was my practice of seclusion.	This concludes the “spiritual path consisting of four factors” of [mn12:44.1]().
mn12:49.1	I would go on all fours into the cow-pens after the cattle had left and eat the dung of the young suckling calves.	NA
mn12:49.2	As long as my own urine and excrement lasted, I would even eat that.	NA
mn12:49.3	Such was my eating of most unnatural things.	At [pli-tv-kd6:14.6.3]() the four “great unnaturals” (or “filthy edibles”, _mahāvikaṭa_) are said to be feces, urine, ash, and clay.
mn12:50.1	I would plunge deep into an awe-inspiring forest grove and stay there.	NA
mn12:50.2	It was so awe-inspiring that	NA
mn12:50.3	normally it would make your hair stand on end if you weren’t free of greed.	NA
mn12:50.4	And on days such as the cold spell when the snow falls in the January winter, I stayed in the open by night and in the forest by day.	_Antaraṭṭhakā_ (Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit _aṣṭaka-rātri_) is the coldest part of Indian winter between the festival days that fall on the eighth day after the fullmoon in the two winter months of Māgha and Phagguna. This roughly corresponds with January, the coldest month in northern India.
mn12:50.5	But in the last month of summer I’d stay in the open by day and in the forest by night.	NA
mn12:50.6	And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me:	“Not supernaturally inspired” (_anacchariyā_) rejects the Vedic “channeling” of scripture from the Divinity, while “not learned before in the past” (_pubbe assutapubbā_), echoing the Dhammacakkappavattanasutta ([sn56.11:5.1]()), rejects the oral tradition.
mn12:50.7	‘Scorched and frozen,	NA
mn12:50.8	alone in the awe-inspiring forest.	NA
mn12:50.9	Naked, no fire to sit beside,	NA
mn12:50.10	the sage still pursues his quest.’	NA
mn12:51.1	I would make my bed in a charnel ground, with the bones of the dead for a pillow.	NA
mn12:51.2	Then village louts would come up to me. They’d spit and piss on me, throw mud on me, even poke sticks in my ears.	For “village louts” (_gāmaṇḍalā_), compare _aṇḍaka_ in the sense “nasty, cruel” at [mn41:9.4]().
mn12:51.3	But I don’t recall ever having a bad thought about them.	NA
mn12:51.4	Such was my abiding in equanimity.	NA
mn12:52.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	NA
mn12:52.2	‘Purity comes from food.’	Compare Chāndogya Upaniṣad 7.26.2: “from purity of food there is purity of being; from purity of being there is stable memory (mindfulness); relying on memory there is release from all ties” (_āhāraśuddhau sattvaśuddhiḥ; sattvaśuddhau dhruvā smṛtiḥ; smṛtilambhe sarvagranthīnāṁ vipramokṣaḥ_).
mn12:52.3	They say:	NA
mn12:52.4	‘Let’s live on jujubes.’	NA
mn12:52.5	So they eat jujubes and jujube powder, and drink jujube juice.	NA
mn12:52.6	And they enjoy many jujube concoctions.	NA
mn12:52.7	I recall eating just a single jujube.	NA
mn12:52.8	You might think that	NA
mn12:52.9	at that time the jujubes must have been very big.	NA
mn12:52.10	But you should not see it like this.	NA
mn12:52.11	The jujubes then were at most the same size as today.	NA
mn12:52.12	Eating so very little, my body became extremely emaciated.	NA
mn12:52.13	Due to eating so little, my major and minor limbs became like the joints of an eighty-year-old or a dying man,	_Āsītika_ is “eighty-year-old”, _kāḷa_ is “time (of death)” (read _kāla_), _pabba_ is “joint”.
mn12:52.14	my bottom became like a camel’s hoof,	NA
mn12:52.15	my vertebrae stuck out like beads on a string,	NA
mn12:52.16	and my ribs were as gaunt as the broken-down rafters on an old barn.	NA
mn12:52.17	Due to eating so little, the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets, like the gleam of water sunk deep down a well.	NA
mn12:52.18	Due to eating so little, my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bitter-gourd in the wind and sun.	NA
mn12:52.19	Due to eating so little, the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone, so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone, and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my belly.	NA
mn12:52.20	Due to eating so little, when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right there.	NA
mn12:52.21	Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out.	NA
mn12:53-55.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	NA
mn12:53-55.2	‘Purity comes from food.’	NA
mn12:53-55.3	They say:	NA
mn12:53-55.4	‘Let’s live on mung beans.’ …	NA
mn12:53-55.5	‘Let’s live on sesame.’ …	NA

mn12:56.1	But Sāriputta, I did not achieve any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones by that conduct, that practice, that grueling work.	NA
mn12:56.2	Why is that?	NA
mn12:56.3	Because I didn’t achieve that noble wisdom that’s noble and emancipating, and which delivers one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering.	NA
mn12:57.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	NA
mn12:57.2	‘Purity comes from transmigration.’	A view attributed to Makkhali Gosāla ([dn2:21.3]()). The idea is that transmigration is limited, so one will automatically be released after a certain number of lives.
mn12:57.3	But it’s not easy to find a realm that I haven’t previously transmigrated to in all this long time, except for the gods of the pure abodes.	NA
mn12:57.4	For if I had transmigrated to the gods of the pure abodes I would not have returned to this realm again.	The gods there are all “non-returners” and will attain arahantship in that realm.
mn12:58.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	NA
mn12:58.2	‘Purity comes from rebirth.’	This view and the next appear to be different ways of repeating the same view as before. Perhaps there is a subtle difference between them.
mn12:58.3	But it’s not easy to find any rebirth that I haven’t previously been reborn in …	NA
mn12:58.4	NA	NA
mn12:59.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	NA
mn12:59.2	‘Purity comes from abode of rebirth.’	NA

mn12:59.4	NA	NA
mn12:60.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	NA
mn12:60.2	‘Purity comes from sacrifice.’	This is, of course, the brahmins.
mn12:60.3	But it’s not easy to find a sacrifice that I haven’t previously offered in all this long time, when I was an anointed aristocratic king or a well-to-do brahmin.	NA
mn12:61.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	NA
mn12:61.2	‘Purity comes from serving the sacred flame.’	Again, serving the sacred flame is a fundamental, perhaps *the* fundamental, rite of the brahmins.
mn12:61.3	But it’s not easy to find a fire that I haven’t previously served in all this long time, when I was an anointed aristocratic king or a well-to-do brahmin.	NA
mn12:62.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	NA
mn12:62.2	‘So long as this gentleman is youthful, young, with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life he will be endowed with perfect lucidity of wisdom.	NA
mn12:62.3	But when he’s old, elderly, and senior, advanced in years, and has reached the final stage of life—eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old—he will lose his lucidity of wisdom.’	NA
mn12:62.4	But you should not see it like this.	NA
mn12:62.5	For now I am old, elderly, and senior, I’m advanced in years, and have reached the final stage of life. I am eighty years old.	This situates this discourse, and hence the Sunakkhatta cycle as a whole, near the end of the Buddha’s life.
mn12:62.6	Suppose I had four disciples with a lifespan of a hundred years. And they each were perfect in memory, range, retention, and perfect lucidity of wisdom.	Memory (_sati_), range (_gati_), retention (_dhiti_), and perfect lucidity of wisdom (_paññāveyyattiya_).
mn12:62.7	Imagine how easily a well-trained expert archer with a strong bow would shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palm tree.	NA
mn12:62.8	That’s how extraordinary they were in memory, range, retention, and perfect lucidity of wisdom.	NA
mn12:62.9	They’d bring up questions about the four kinds of mindfulness meditation again and again, and I would answer each question. They’d remember the answers and not ask the same question twice.	NA
mn12:62.10	And they’d pause only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness. But the Realized One would not run out of Dhamma teachings, words and phrases of the teachings, or spontaneous answers.	NA
mn12:62.11	And at the end of a hundred years my four disciples would pass away.	NA
mn12:62.12	Even if you have to carry me around on a stretcher, there will never be any deterioration in the Realized One’s lucidity of wisdom.	NA
mn12:63.1	And if there’s anyone of whom it may be rightly said that	NA
mn12:63.2	a being not liable to delusion has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans, it’s of me that this should be said.”	NA
mn12:63.3	NA	NA
mn12:64.1	Now at that time Venerable Nāgasamāla was standing behind the Buddha fanning him.	We meet Nāgasamāla in less auspicious circumstances at [ud8.7](), where he stubbornly disagrees with the Buddha on which path to take.
mn12:64.2	Then he said to the Buddha:	NA
mn12:64.3	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	NA
mn12:64.4	While I was listening to this exposition of the teaching my hair stood up!	NA
mn12:64.5	What is the name of this exposition of the teaching?”	NA
mn12:64.6	“Well then, Nāgasamāla, you may remember this exposition of the teaching as ‘The Hair-raising Discourse’.”	This original title is widely attested in the tradition, being found in some _uddāna_ summary verses in Burmese and Sinhalese manuscripts, [mil7.5.7:2.1](), a Jātaka of the same name ([ja94]()), several commentaries, and the Sanskrit and Chinese parallels. The subcommentary says that the name Mahāsīhanāda was given by the redactors.
mn12:64.7	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn12:64.8	Satisfied, Venerable Nāgasamāla approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn13:0.1	Middle Discourses 13	NA
mn13:0.2	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering	NA
mn13:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn13:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn13:2.1	Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	NA
mn13:2.2	Then it occurred to them,	NA
mn13:2.3	“It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī.	NA
mn13:2.4	Why don’t we visit the monastery of the wanderers of other religions?”	NA
mn13:2.5	Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there.	NA
mn13:2.6	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them:	NA
mn13:3.1	“Reverends, the ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of sensual pleasures, and so do we.	This group of three—_kāma_, _rūpa_, _vedanā_—is also found at [an3.126]() and [an10.29](), where it also relates to the teachings of outsiders.
mn13:3.2	The ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of forms, and so do we.	NA
mn13:3.3	The ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of feelings, and so do we.	The text does not say what the wanderers understood by these three full understandings. The commentary says they spoke in reference to, respectively, the first absorption, the formless attainments, and the non-percipient state.
mn13:3.4	What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?”	In questioning this, the wanderers display better discernment than many today, who leap all too readily from the discovery of something in common between religions to the assertion that they are therefore the same.
mn13:3.5	NA	NA
mn13:4.1	Those mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers of other religions.	NA
mn13:4.2	They got up from their seat, thinking,	NA
mn13:4.3	“We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.”	This is the quintessential Buddhist attitude when encountering something unknown: to neither accept nor reject, but inquire.
mn13:5.1	Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said:	NA

Bastions were “wetly plastered” (_addāvalepana_) for resistance from fire ([sn35.243:7.1]()).
mn13:13.2	There they are struck with arrows and spears, splashed with dung, crushed by a superior force, and their heads are chopped off,	For “splashed with dung” (_chakaṇakāyapi osiñcanti_), PTS reads _pakkaṭṭhī_, but this word appears to be spurious. The commentary says _chakaṇakā_ means “boiling cowdung”, but nothing in the word itself suggests “boiling”. The Chinese parallels at MA 99 and T 53 have “molten copper” <span lang='lzh'>融銅</span>, while EA 21.9 has “molten iron” (<span lang='lzh'>消鐵</span>). | _Abhivagga_ is only found here in Pali. The Atharvaveda (3.5.2, 6.54.2, 11.2.4) has _abhīvarga_ apparently in the sense of “domain”. The commentary says _abhivagga_ was a “hundred-toothed” weapon that crushed invaders of a castle. However, _vagga_ has the recognized military sense of “cadre, company, platoon”, so I take _abhivagga_ to mean “superior force”.

mn13:13.4	This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures.	NA

The commentary explains these punishments thus. “Porridge pot”: remove the top of the skull and drop in a hot iron ball so that the brains boil over. “Shell-shave”: grind the skull with gravel until it is smooth. “Rāhu”s mouth’: force open the mouth with a skewer, put in oil and wick, and light it so it burns like the sun swallowed by the titan Rāhu ([sn2.8]()). “Garland of fire”: smear the body with oil and set it alight. “Burning hand”: wrap the hand with oiled rags and set it alight. “Bulrush twist”: flay the skin from the neck down, then twist it into a band by which to hang the victim. “Bark dress”: cut the skin in strips and make it into a garment. “Antelope”: pin the bound victim to the ground and roast them alive. “Meat hook”: flay with double fish-hooks. “Coins”: slice off disks of flesh like coins. “Caustic pickle”: beat the victim, then rub the wounds with caustic solution. “Twisting bar”: pin the victim to the ground by the ears and twirl them by the feet. “Straw mat”: beat them until every bone is broken and the body becomes limp as a mattress.
mn13:14.4	These result in death and deadly pain.	NA
mn13:14.5	This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures.	NA
mn13:15.1	Furthermore, for the sake of sensual pleasures, they conduct themselves badly by way of body, speech, and mind.	NA
mn13:15.2	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	The drawbacks are escalating, the point being that hell is worse than the punishments described above.
mn13:15.3	This is a drawback of sensual pleasures to do with lives to come, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures.	Previous drawbacks pertained to what is “apparent in this very life” (_sandiṭṭhika_), whereas this applies to “lives to come” (_samparāyika_).

mn13:32.2	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.

mn14:0.1	Middle Discourses 14	NA
mn14:0.2	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering	NA
mn14:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn14:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.	NA
mn14:2.1	Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	Mahānāma was the brother of Anuruddha and Ānanda ([pli-tv-kd17:1.1.3]()) which, according to the commentary, makes the Buddha his cousin. He remained in the lay life as a devoted and generous follower, keenly interested in developing his practice. The early texts do not record any occasion of his awakening. However, the commentarial claim that he was a once-returner is supported by passages such as [sn55.22:2.3]() and [sn55.21:3.6]() that suggest he was indeed a noble disciple.
mn14:2.2	“For a long time, sir, I have understood your teaching like this:	NA
mn14:2.3	‘Greed, hate, and delusion are corruptions of the mind.’	NA
mn14:2.4	NA	NA
mn14:2.5	NA	NA
mn14:2.6	Despite understanding this, sometimes my mind is occupied by thoughts of greed, hate, and delusion.	NA
mn14:2.7	NA	NA
mn14:2.8	I wonder what qualities remain in me that I have such thoughts?”	As in the opening of the previous discourse, he exhibits curiosity and openness to inquiry.
mn14:3.1	“Mahānāma, there is a quality that remains in you that makes you have such thoughts.	NA
mn14:3.2	For if you had given up that quality you would not still be living at home and enjoying sensual pleasures.	NA
mn14:3.3	But because you haven’t given up that quality you are still living at home and enjoying sensual pleasures.	NA
mn14:4.1	Sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.	NA
mn14:4.2	So, Mahānāma, even though a noble disciple has clearly seen this with right wisdom, as long as they do not achieve the rapture and bliss that are apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that,	The “rapture and bliss that are apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities” includes the first and second _jhānas_. The text is in present tense: they *do not attain* _jhāna_, not *they have never attained* _jhāna_. In order to realize the noble truths, Mahānāma must, of course, have practiced the noble eightfold path, which includes _jhāna_. Indeed, at [an3.73:1.6]() Mahānāma said he understood that in the Buddha’s teaching, “Knowledge is for those with immersion, not those without immersion.” However, a stream-enterer and a once-returner have not fully given up the underlying attachment to sensual pleasures, so unless they are dedicated to regular meditation following that realization, it is possible for their mental clarity to deteriorate and sensual desires to return. It seems that the temptations and business of the lay life had distracted Mahānāma from his meditation.
mn14:4.3	they can return to sensual pleasures.	The Pali is expressed in a double negative: “they are not one who does not return”.
mn14:4.4	But when they do achieve that rapture and bliss, or something more peaceful than that,	NA
mn14:4.5	they do not return to sensual pleasures.	NA
mn14:5.1	Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too clearly saw with right wisdom that:	NA
mn14:5.2	‘Sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.’	NA
mn14:5.3	But so long as I didn’t achieve the rapture and bliss that are apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that,	NA
mn14:5.4	I didn’t announce that I would not return to sensual pleasures.	NA
mn14:5.5	But when I did achieve that rapture and bliss, or something more peaceful than that,	NA
mn14:5.6	I announced that I would not return to sensual pleasures.	The phrasing of this passage echoes that of the first sermon ([sn56.11:9.1]()).

mn14:15.1	Mahānāma, this one time I was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.	NA
mn14:15.2	Now at that time several Jain ascetics on the slopes of Isigili at the Black Rock were constantly standing, refusing seats. And they felt painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion.	A large open area where the Buddha taught occasionally ([sn8.10]()), but it is most famous as the place the monks Godhika ([sn4.23]()) and Vakkali took their lives ([sn22.87]()). | The practice of constant standing was formerly undertaken by the Bodhisatta ([mn12:45.9]()).
mn14:16.1	Then in the late afternoon, I came out of retreat and went to the Black Rock to visit those Jain ascetics. I said to them,	The Buddha reports a similar, but more detailed, conversation with Jains at [mn101]().
mn14:16.2	‘Reverends, why are you constantly standing, refusing seats, so that you suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion?’	Even with his own extensive experience in such practices, the Buddha still asks.
mn14:17.1	When I said this, those Jain ascetics said to me,	NA
mn14:17.2	‘Reverend, the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus:	The Jain leader Mahāvīra Vardhamāna is known as Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta in Pali texts. He is regarded as the 24th supreme leader of the Jains, although only he and his predecessor Pārśvanātha (not mentioned in the Pali) are historical. _Nigaṇṭha_ means “knotless” (i.e. without attachments); it is a term for a Jain ascetic. Nātaputta indicates his clan the Ñātikas (Sanskrit _jñātiputra_; Prākrit _nāyaputta_). The Pali tradition has confused _ñāti_ (“family”) with _nāṭa_ (“dancer”). Thus Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta means “the Jain monk of the Ñātika clan”.
mn14:17.3	“Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.”	The Buddha denied possessing such omniscience; rather, he knows the three knowledges ([mn71:5.5]()). Nonetheless, he can be poetically considered as “all-knowing” ([thag2.6:1.4](), [thag16.1:18.1](), [thag1.69:1.2]()), since he understands the “all” that is the six senses ([sn35.28]()).

mn14:17.5	“O Jain ascetics, you have done bad deeds in a past life. Wear them away with these severe and grueling austerities.	The Buddha emphasized understanding _kamma_ and relinquishing the causes of new _kamma_, rather than wearing away the unknowable mass of past _kamma_. | Mahāvīra’s emphasis on *bad* karma of the past presages the modern usage where karma is evoked when something inescapably bad happens.
mn14:17.6	And when in the present you are restrained in body, speech, and mind, you’re not doing any bad deeds for the future.	NA
mn14:17.7	So, due to eliminating past deeds by fervent mortification, and not doing any new deeds, there’s nothing to come up in the future.	NA
mn14:17.8	With no future consequence, deeds end. With the ending of deeds, suffering ends. With the ending of suffering, feeling ends. And with the ending of feeling, all suffering will have been worn away.”	The past participle with future tense (_nijjiṇṇaṁ bhavissati_) indicates a future perfect sense, “will have been worn away”.

mn14:20.1	‘Reverend Gotama, pleasure is not gained through pleasure; pleasure is gained through pain.	At [mn85:10.2]() the Buddha says that he too held this belief while still an unenlightened Bodhisatta. Thus not only were his austerities identical with the Jains, so were his beliefs. The Jain text Sūyagaḍa (known in Sanskrit as Sūtrakṛtāṅga) 1.3.4.6 rejects the view that pleasure is gained through pleasure, attributing it to those who disdain the noble path, which its commentary identifies with Buddhists.
mn14:20.2	For if pleasure were to be gained through pleasure, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha would gain pleasure, since he lives in greater pleasure than Venerable Gotama.’	With their path emphasizing painful austerity, there is little to support the idea that the Jains practiced meditation in the Buddhist sense, and certainly not the deep pleasure of _jhāna_.

mn15:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn15:1.2	At one time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.	The Bhaggas were an isolated republican clan, sandwiched between the Vacchas south of the Yamuna and the Kosalans north of the Ganges. By the time of the Buddha they were evidently subject to the Vacchas. | “Crocodile Hill” (_susumāragira_) was evidently the name of the capital city. Its name is something of a mystery, as the land is notably flat with the exception of a hill today called Pabhosa (also Prabhashgiri or Rohitgiri), which is now the site of a Jain temple. Perhaps it was this hill that from the river resembled a crocodile. The commentary, however, says the capital was was so-named because a crocodile made a noise in a nearby lake during the founding of the city.
mn15:1.3	There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants:	While Moggallāna is known for his mastery of advanced psychic abilities, suttas such as this and [mn5]() show his concern for even the smallest defects in ethical conduct.

mn15:1.6	Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:	NA

The Chinese parallels confirm this connection, saying the discourse was spoken on the Pavāraṇā.
mn15:2.2	other mendicants to admonish them. But they’re hard to admonish, having qualities that make them hard to admonish. They’re impatient, and don’t take instruction respectfully. So their spiritual companions don’t think it’s worth advising and instructing them, and that person doesn’t gain their trust.	This discourse acts as a sutta counterpart to the Vinaya rule [pli-tv-bu-vb-ss12](), which lays down a procedure to deal with a mendicant who makes themselves incorrigible. The Pali origin story for that rule lays the blame on the monk Channa, the Buddha’s former charioteer, who boasts “mine is the Buddha, mine the Dhamma!” It was evidently unsuccessful, as the Buddha on his deathbed had to further lay down the “divine punishment” for him ([dn16:6.4.1]()).

mn15:6.1	In such a case, a mendicant should measure themselves like this.	“Should measure against” is _anuminitabba_, which in its noun form _anumāna_ lends the sutta its title. The normal sense in later literature is “inference” (eg. [mil6.4.1]()). _Anumāna_ occurs in the early texts only here and in the passive form _anumīyati_ at [sn22.36:1.4](), where the sense must be to “measure against”.  This passage also discusses how to measure oneself in relation to another, an external standard, whereas the next section on reflection applies an inner standard. Hence the commentary glosses with: “should compare, should judge” (_tuletabbo tīretabbo_).

mn16:0.1	Middle Discourses 16	NA
mn16:0.2	Hard-heartedness	NA
mn16:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn16:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn16:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn16:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn16:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn16:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn16:2.1	“Mendicants, when a mendicant has not given up five kinds of hard-heartedness and severed five shackles of the heart, it’s not possible for them to achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training.	The two sets of five are also found at [an10.14](). The five kinds of “hard-heartedness” are also at [an5.205](), [an9.71](), [dn33:2.1.76](), and [dn34:1.6.24](), and the five “shackles of the heart” are at [an5.206](), [an9.72](), [an9.82](), [an9.92](), and [dn33:2.1.84](). | While this sutta is addressed as normal to the _bhikkhus_, the parallels at [an10.14](), MA 206, and EA 51.4 are all addressed to both monks and nuns. This is one of the instances showing that the term _bhikkhu_ is meant to include both monks and nuns, a common feature of Pali where the default gender is masculine. Hence I translate _bhikkhu_ with “mendicant”, which is both literal and gender-neutral, unless it is clear that males are meant, in which case I use “monk”.
mn16:3.1	What are the five kinds of hard-heartedness they haven’t given up?	“Hard-heartedness” or “emotional barrenness” (_cetokhila_): _ceto_ is one of several words for “mind, heart” and is functionally equivalent to _citta_, yet it tends to be used in contexts that emphasize the emotional dimensions of the mind such as here. _Khila_ is said, in the commentary to [snp1.2](), to be land so barren that nothing grows even if it rains for four months.

mn16:25.1	When a mendicant has given up these five kinds of hard-heartedness and severed these five shackles of the heart, it is possible for them to achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training.	Up to this point, the discourse is mostly identical to [an10.14](). In the next section, the Buddha goes on to show what “growth” means; with the emotional fundamentals in place, meditation can proceed.
mn16:26.1	They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort …	The four _iddhipada_ are included in the so-called 37 “wings to awakening” (_bodhipakkhiyadhamma_). They are an alternate presentation of the path of meditation, with a special focus on developing _samādhi_. It seems the Buddha designed this presentation of Dhamma to appeal to the many meditators who are fascinated by psychic powers, with the aim to lead them on to the higher goal of liberation. | “Enthusiasm” (_chanda_) is the desire or will to practice the Dhamma for liberation.
mn16:26.2	the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy, and active effort …	One who has the requisite enthusiasm will put forth “effort” to achieve the goal.
mn16:26.3	the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to mental development, and active effort …	When striving, one will purify and develop the “mind”. When _citta_ appears in meditation contexts, it is often virtually a synonym of _samādhi_ (see eg. _cittabhāvanā_, _cittasampadā_).
mn16:26.4	the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to inquiry, and active effort. And the fifth is sheer vigor.	The mind clarified in _samādhi_ can investigate the true nature of reality. | _Ussoḷhi_ (“vigor”) is similar in meaning to “energy” (_viriya_) and “active effort” (_saṅkhāra_), underscoring the importance of effort here.
mn16:27.1	A mendicant who possesses these fifteen factors, including vigor, is capable of breaking out, becoming awakened, and reaching the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.	_Yogakkhema_ (“sanctuary from the yoke”) is a metaphor for Nibbana that draws from the literal sense of _khema_ as an oasis or sanctuary for men and beasts. After a hard day’s journey, a caravan would stop to rest, “unyoke” the draft animals, lay down the burden, and refresh themselves in the cool waters.
mn16:27.2	Suppose there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs.	This simile recurs at [mn53:19.2]() and elsewhere.
mn16:27.3	And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated.	NA

mn17:0.2	Jungle Thickets	NA
mn17:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn17:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn17:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn17:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn17:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn17:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn17:2.1	“Mendicants, I will teach you an exposition about jungle thickets.	This sutta acts as a counterbalance to the many places where the Buddha encourages living secluded in the forest. The purpose of the life of solitude is to develop meditation and find freedom. But life is complicated and people are complicated, and sometimes what we think will support us becomes a hindrance. So regardless of how secluded and inspiring a place may be, it is crucial to always reflect on one’s actual progress in developing the wholesome.
mn17:2.2	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn17:2.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
mn17:2.4	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn17:3.1	“Mendicants, take the case of a mendicant who lives close by a jungle thicket.	Here I translate _upanissaya_ as “close by”.
mn17:3.2	As they do so, their mindfulness does not become established, their mind does not become immersed in samādhi, their defilements do not come to an end, and they do not arrive at the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.	This gives a brief summary of the path of meditation. First one “establishes mindfulness”, i.e. undertakes meditation based on the four _satipaṭṭhānas_. This leads to _samādhi_ as the mind becomes immersed in the four _jhānas_. Then, seeing reality with the unclouded clarity of a purified mind, defilements are abandoned and one is freed from transmigration.
mn17:3.3	And the necessities of life that a renunciate requires—robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—are hard to come by.	NA
mn17:3.4	That mendicant should reflect:	NA

mn17:4.9	That mendicant should, after appraisal, leave that jungle thicket; they should not stay there.	In this case they should leave after reflection, not necessarily “that very day”, since at least they can live comfortably and healthily, which is no small thing.

mn18:0.1	Middle Discourses 18	NA
mn18:0.2	The Honey-Cake	NA
mn18:1.1	So I have heard.	This is one of the most famous discourses in studies of early Buddhism, largely due to the ground-breaking analysis by Venerable Kaṭukurunde Ñāṇananda in his 1971  monograph *Concept and Reality in Early Buddhist Thought*, which established the meaning of _papañca_ as “conceptual proliferation”. | It is the first of the “thought trilogy”, a series of discourses that deal with the activity of thinking in meditation (also [mn19](), [mn20]()).
mn18:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.	The Banyan Tree Monastery (_nigrodhārāma_) was the normal residence for the Buddha and his disciples in the Sakyan republic. It was named, according to northern traditions, after the banyan trees that grew there, while the Pali commentaries say it was named after a Sakyan called Nigrodha who donated it. The two stories are not incompatible, as the owner could have been known by his most famous attribute, his banyan grove. It has been identified by stupas located next to the village Kudan, just north of the India-Nepal border.
mn18:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kapilavatthu for alms.	It would have been about thirty minutes walk to Kapilavatthu.
mn18:2.2	He wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Great Wood for the day’s meditation,	The Great Wood (_mahāvana_) was a favorite meditation place of the Buddha. The commentaries say it was a stretch of wilderness that reached as far as the Himalayas on one side (200 km) and the ocean on the other (1000 km). Later tradition says that a town should have three woods: a “great wood” for wilderness (_mahāvana_); a “prosperity wood” for resources (_sirivana_); and an “ascetic wood” for spiritual practice (_tapovana_).
mn18:2.3	plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a young wood-apple tree to meditate.	NA
mn18:3.1	Daṇḍapāṇi the Sakyan, while going for a walk,	Daṇḍapāṇi was said to be the brother of the Buddha’s birth mother Māyā and foster mother Mahāpajāpatī (Mahāvaṁsa 2.19), or else the father of the Buddha’s former wife Yasodharā (or Gopā, Lalitavistara 12.15). Both could be true, making Siddhattha’s wife his cousin. Reading between the lines, it seems Daṇḍapāṇi nursed a grudge against the Buddha. This would be understandable if Siddhattha’s birth resulted in the death of one of Daṇḍapāṇi’s sisters, while the other sister was left distraught when he went forth; and even more so if he abandoned Daṇḍapāṇi’s daughter with their newborn son.
mn18:3.2	plunged deep into the Great Wood. He approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn18:3.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side leaning on his staff, and said to the Buddha,	NA
mn18:3.4	“What is the ascetic’s doctrine? What does he assert?”	There is a minor Vinaya training against teaching anyone with “a staff in their hand” (_daṇḍapāṇi_, [pli-tv-bu-vb-sk58:1.3.1]()). This was evidently laid down because a staff could be used as a weapon, and hence was associated with royal authority or with policing and the exercise of violence. In a vision interpreted at Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.6.1.13, a man with staff in hand is identified with wrath (_krodha_).
mn18:4.1	“Good sir, my doctrine is such that one does not conflict with anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. And it is such that perceptions do not underlie the brahmin who lives detached from sensual pleasures, without indecision, stripped of worry, and rid of craving for rebirth in this or that state.	In the face of Daṇḍapāṇi’s evidently hostile attitude, the Buddha addresses his uncle with the respectful _āvuso_ (“sir”), and emphasizes non-conflict in line with his claim that, “I do not argue with the world; it is the world that argues with me” ([sn22.94]()). | The expression “perceptions do not underlie” (_saññā nānusenti_) is unique to this context and must pertain to the highly-charged relation between the Buddha and Daṇḍapāṇi. “Perception” is that mode of knowing that interprets the present in terms of the past, and hence it might sometimes be translated as “recognition”. The Buddha, by asserting he is no longer bound by past perceptions, is hinting that this is how Daṇḍapāṇi can get over his grudge.
mn18:4.2	That is my doctrine, and that is what I assert.”	NA
mn18:5.1	When he had spoken, Daṇḍapāṇi shook his head, waggled his tongue, raised his eyebrows until his brow puckered in three furrows, and departed leaning on his staff.	While the Buddha succeeding in deescalating possible conflict, clearly the teaching did not have the desired effect, at least right away. | Māra responds in the same way at [sn4.21:1.12]().
mn18:6.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the Banyan Tree Monastery, sat down on the seat spread out,	NA
mn18:6.2	and told the mendicants what had happened.	NA

mn18:6.13	NA	NA
mn18:6.14	When he had spoken, one of the mendicants said to him,	NA
mn18:7.1	“But sir, asserting what doctrine does the Buddha not conflict with anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans?	The “Buddha” (_bhagavā_) is the subject and object respectively of this sentence and the next, a detail not always captured in translations.
mn18:7.2	And how is it that perceptions do not underlie the Buddha, the brahmin who lives detached from sensual pleasures, without indecision, stripped of worry, and rid of craving for rebirth in this or that state?”	The following passage, with its longer explanation below, is one of the most dense and enigmatic statements in the suttas. I shall explain the terms as they occur, and draw out the structure of the argument as it is revealed.
mn18:8.1	“Mendicant, judgments driven by proliferating perceptions beset a person.	“Judgment” (_saṅkhā_) is the way we “appraise” or “assess” ourselves, especially in relation to others (cf. [mn1:3.3](), [dn1:1.3.2]()). | “Proliferation” (_papañca_) is the compulsion of the mind to spread out in endless inner commentary that hides reality. | “Beset” (_samudācaranti_) conveys the sense that the person is overwhelmed and swamped, no longer the agent of their existence. | A “person” (_purisa_) is the conventional sense of self that arises from desire and identification.
mn18:8.2	If they don’t find anything worth approving, welcoming, or getting attached to in the source from which these arise,	_Ettha_ (“regarding that”) refers back to _yatonidānaṁ_ (“the source from which”) in the previous line. This “source” has not yet been identified.
mn18:8.3	just this is the end of the underlying tendencies to desire, repulsion, views, doubt, conceit, the desire to be reborn, and ignorance. This is the end of taking up the rod and the sword, the end of quarrels, arguments, and disputes, of accusations, divisive speech, and lies.	Here the Buddha uses “underlying tendencies” (_anusaya_) for the normal set of seven, implying that these are meant by “perceptions” in the phrase “perceptions do not underlie the brahmin” at [mn18:4.1](). | He identifies the doctrine that leads to peace as the ending of these tendencies that create proliferation and judgment about the supposed “person”.
mn18:8.4	This is where these bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.”	By this the Buddha indicates arahantship.
mn18:9.1	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn18:9.2	When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.	While the Buddha usually took pains to make his teaching explicit, he sometimes left his students with puzzling or enigmatic statements as a way of encouraging them to figure them out for themselves.
mn18:10.1	Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants considered,	NA
mn18:10.2	“The Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail.	NA

mn18:10.8	Then those mendicants thought,	NA
mn18:10.9	“This Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.	Mahākaccāna was one of the great disciples, whose teachings specially emphasized the incisive analysis of consciousness through the lens of the six senses. He was said to be the most skilled at given detailed explanations of brief teachings ([an1.197]()), a skill he displayed also at [mn133](), [mn138](), and [an10.172](). Later he was to settle to the southwest in Avanti, where he established the Dhamma in the region.

mn18:14.2	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.	NA
mn18:14.3	Venerable Mahākaccāna said this:	NA
mn18:15.1	“Reverends, the Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail:	“Passage for recitation” is _uddesa_, which is used for a short passage to be memorized verbatim, to which is then attached a longer analysis.
mn18:15.2	‘Judgments driven by proliferating perceptions beset a person.	NA
mn18:15.3	If they don’t find anything worth approving, welcoming, or getting attached to in the source from which these arise,	NA
mn18:15.4	just this is the end of the underlying tendencies to desire, repulsion, views, doubt, conceit, the desire to be reborn, and ignorance. This is the end of taking up the rod and the sword, the end of quarrels, arguments, and disputes, of accusations, divisive speech, and lies. This is where these bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.’ This is how I understand the detailed meaning of this summary recital.	NA
mn18:16.1	Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights. The meeting of the three is contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. What you feel, you perceive. What you perceive, you think about. What you think about, you proliferate. What you proliferate is the source from which judgments driven by proliferating perceptions beset a person. This occurs with respect to sights known by the eye in the past, future, and present.	In this passage, Mahākaccāna deftly unfolds the meaning inside the syntax. For consciousness, contact, and feeling, he repeats the standard analysis of sense experience linked to dependent origination ([sn12.43]()), where each item, expressed as a noun, leads to the next like falling dominoes. Pivoting on feeling (cp. [sn12.43:4.5](), [dn15:18.6]()), he switches to verbs; feeling exerts a force that motivates desire, even though desire itself is left unstated here. In the Pali, the subject of the verbs is implicit, assuming an agent who is feeling, perceiving, thinking, and proliferating. But with proliferating, the syntax changes again. The agent is fully manifest as the “person” who, tragically, is no longer the subject in control of the process, but the hapless object of the swarm of judgments that beset them. It is at this point that time is introduced, as the concept of the “person” binds the mind to suffering in the three periods of time. If we relate this to the origin story, Daṇḍapāṇi has become the “person” he is, full of bitterness and resentment, because of his chronic ruminations on perceived injustices of the past. | Mahākaccāna identifies the “source” left undefined in the Buddha’s statement with proliferation itself. | This passage also clarifies the grammatical relationship between the main terms: perception leads to proliferation and proliferation results in judgments.

What you perceive, you think about. What you think about, you proliferate. What you proliferate is the source from which judgments driven by proliferating perceptions beset a person. This occurs with respect to ideas known by the mind in the past, future, and present.	Here, rather unsatisfactorily, “ideas” renders _dhammā_. _Dhamma_ in the sense of “what is known by the mind rather than the senses” doesn’t readily map on to a common concept in English. Attempts include “mind objects”, which introduces the Abhidhammic idea of “object” to the suttas, where it is entirely absent; or “(mental) phenomena”, which doesn’t really fit the common meaning of “phenomena” as being what is perceptible by the senses. Etymologically, the correct word would be “noumena”, but this is used only as a technical term in Kantian philosophy where it has a rather different sense. Ñāṇamoḷi’s “idea” might be the least bad option, in the sense of a thought, concept, sensation, or image present in consciousness.
mn18:17.1	Where there is the eye, sights, and eye consciousness, it will be possible to discover evidence of contact.	I take this passage as an encouragement to meditators who may be intimidated by the complex analysis that preceded. Mahākaccāna is assuring his audience that if they can see the fundamentals of sense experience, the rest of the process “will make itself known” (_paññāpessati_). | I render the repetitive phrase _phassapaññattiṁ paññāpessati_ idiomatically as “will discover evidence of contact”, but more literally it might be “the making known of contact will make itself known”.

mn18:22.1	When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,	NA
mn18:22.2	“Sir, suppose a person who was weak with hunger was to obtain a honey-cake. Wherever they taste it, they would enjoy a sweet, delicious flavor.	This simile is also used for the Buddha’s teachings at [an5.194:4.1]().

mn19:0.1	Middle Discourses 19	NA
mn19:0.2	Two Kinds of Thought	NA
mn19:1.1	So I have heard.	This discourse shows that a meditator must abandon unwholesome thought then wholesome thought before entering absorption. It is one of several discourses that give detailed instructions on dealing with thought in meditation (eg. [mn18](), [mn20](), [an3.101]()). While meditation existed before the Buddha, we do not find this kind of practical advice on how to go about it.
mn19:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn19:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn19:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn19:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA

[mn36:34.1]() says that at this point, after restoring his strength by eating solid food, he developed the absorptions, giving the impression that this happened immediately. However, the current sutta, supported by passages such as [mn128:16.2](), shows that this took some time, although it is not clear how long.
mn19:2.2	‘Why don’t I meditate by continually dividing my thoughts into two classes?’	NA
mn19:2.3	So I assigned sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts	By analyzing thoughts (_vitakka_), he is consciously developing the second factor of the noble eightfold path, right thought (_sammāsaṅkappa_). In this context, _vitakka_ and _saṅkappa_ are synonyms.

mn19:2.5	And I assigned thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness	NA
mn19:2.6	to the second class.	NA
mn19:3.1	Then, as I meditated—diligent, keen, and resolute—a sensual thought arose.	NA
mn19:3.2	I understood:	NA
mn19:3.3	‘This sensual thought has arisen in me.	First one knows the thought, understanding it in terms of the framework.
mn19:3.4	It leads to hurting myself, hurting others, and hurting both. It blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of distress, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment.’	Then one reflects on the causal outcome of the thought.
mn19:3.5	When I reflected that it leads to hurting myself, it went away.	Thoughts are eradicated not by force or judgment, but by reflective wisdom.
mn19:3.6	When I reflected that it leads to hurting others, it went away.	NA
mn19:3.7	When I reflected that it leads to hurting both, it went away.	NA
mn19:3.8	When I reflected that it blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of distress, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment, it went away.	NA
mn19:3.9	So I gave up, got rid of, and eliminated any sensual thoughts that arose.	NA
mn19:4-5.1	Then, as I meditated—diligent, keen, and resolute—a malicious thought arose …	The difference between “malice” (or “ill will”, _byāpāda_) and “cruelty” (_vihiṁsā_) is subtle; they are the respective opposites of “love” (_mettā_) and “compassion” (_karuṇā_). _Mettā_ wishes well simply and without qualification, just as “malice” wishes ill. But _karuṇa_ takes pleasure in the alleviation of pain, while _vihiṁsā_ takes pleasure in inflicting pain.
mn19:4-5.2	a cruel thought arose.	NA
mn19:4-5.3	I understood:	NA
mn19:4-5.4	‘This cruel thought has arisen in me.	NA
mn19:4-5.5	It leads to hurting myself, hurting others, and hurting both. It blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of distress, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment.’	NA

mn19:4-5.9	When I reflected that it blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of distress, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment, it went away.	NA
mn19:4-5.10	So I gave up, got rid of, and eliminated any cruel thoughts that arose.	NA
mn19:6.1	Whatever a mendicant frequently thinks about and considers becomes their heart’s inclination.	This is a key principle underlying Buddhist meditation. Compare Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 10.5.2.20, where the form in which one worships the divinity determines the divine manifestation.
mn19:6.2	If they often think about and consider sensual thoughts, they’ve given up the thought of renunciation to cultivate sensual thought. Their mind inclines to sensual thoughts.	NA
mn19:6.3	If they often think about and consider malicious thoughts … their mind inclines to malicious thoughts.	NA
mn19:6.4	If they often think about and consider cruel thoughts … their mind inclines to cruel thoughts.	NA
mn19:7.1	Suppose it’s the last month of the rainy season, in autumn, when the crops grow closely together, and a cowherd must take care of the cattle.	Compare [an3.101](), where the Buddha illustrates the same point with a simile of smelting gold.
mn19:7.2	He’d tap and poke them with his staff on this side and that to keep them in check.	NA
mn19:7.3	Why is that?	NA
mn19:7.4	For he sees that if they wander into the crops he could be executed, imprisoned, fined, or condemned.	At this point, a meditator guards against unwholesome thoughts, gently and persistently.
mn19:7.5	In the same way, I saw that unskillful qualities have the drawbacks of sordidness and corruption, and that skillful qualities have the benefit and cleansing power of renunciation.	NA
mn19:8.1	Then, as I meditated—diligent, keen, and resolute—a thought of renunciation arose.	NA
mn19:8.2	I understood:	NA
mn19:8.3	‘This thought of renunciation has arisen in me.	NA
mn19:8.4	It doesn’t lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both. It nourishes wisdom, it’s on the side of freedom from distress, and it leads to extinguishment.’	NA
mn19:8.5	If I were to keep on thinking and considering this all night …	NA
mn19:8.6	all day …	NA
mn19:8.7	all night and day, I see no danger that would come from that.	Meditators often wish to reach a state free of thought, but thought is a natural and essential function of the mind and wholesome habits of thought are a part of the eightfold path.
mn19:8.8	Still, thinking and considering for too long would tire my body.	NA
mn19:8.9	And when the body is tired, the mind is stressed.	NA
mn19:8.10	And when the mind is stressed, it’s far from immersion.	Even good thought has a limit as the mind is still active. | Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.21 enjoins the contemplative not to think too much, as it is fatiguing to speech.
mn19:8.11	So I stilled, settled, unified, and immersed my mind internally.	As the sutta later makes clear, this means that he entered absorption. The process described here extends over a period of time during which these different factors arose, rather than a single meditation sitting.
mn19:8.12	Why is that?	NA
mn19:8.13	So that my mind would not be stressed.	NA
mn19:9-10.1	Then, as I meditated—diligent, keen, and resolute—a thought of good will arose …	NA
mn19:9-10.2	a thought of harmlessness arose.	NA

mn19:11.4	If they often think about and consider thoughts of harmlessness … their mind inclines to thoughts of harmlessness.	NA
mn19:12.1	Suppose it’s the last month of summer, when all the crops have been gathered within a village, and a cowherd must take care of the cattle. While at the root of a tree or in the open he need only be mindful that	NA
mn19:12.2	the cattle are there.	NA
mn19:12.3	In the same way I needed only to be mindful that	NA
mn19:12.4	those things were there.	Compare [mn140:20.2]() and [an3.102:2.1](), where, when smelting is going well, the goldsmith merely observes with equanimity.
mn19:13.1	My energy was roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness was established and lucid, my body was tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind was immersed in samādhi and unified.	This passage, which describes the process of entering absorption, is here shown to be the opposite of the previous situation where the mind was continuing to think even wholesome thoughts.
mn19:14.1	Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	The first absorption still has _vitakka_, which above was rendered “thought” since it was clearly a verbal process. _Jhāna_ is, however, a state of “higher mind” where all mental processes are elevated. Pleasure is no longer the coarse stimulus of the senses, seclusion is no longer just being physically isolated, rapture is no longer exciting. And _vitakka_ is no longer the activity of verbalizing thought, as the burden of the sutta is to show that even wholesome thought prevents absorption. Rather, it is explained as a subtle process of placing the mind and keeping it in place (as defined at [mn117:14.2]()). The English word “thought” in the sense “to bring something to mind” might be elastic enough to cover this sense, but it is apt to be misleading. | The late canonical Peṭakopadesa has an interesting analysis that precedes the commentarial Theravadin understanding of this point ([Pe 7](https://suttacentral.net/pe7/pli/ms)).
mn19:15.1	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	Each _jhāna_ begins as the least refined aspect of the previous _jhāna_ ends. This is not consciously directed, but describes the natural process of settling. The meditator is now fully confident and no longer needs to apply their mind: it is simply still and fully unified.
mn19:16.1	And with the fading away of rapture, I entered and remained in the third absorption, where I meditated with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	The emotional response to bliss matures from the subtle thrill of rapture to the poise of equanimity. Mindfulness is present in all states of deep meditation, but with equanimity it becomes prominent.
mn19:17.1	With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I entered and remained in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	The emotional poise of equanimity leads to the feeling of pleasure settling into the more subtle neutral feeling. Pain and sadness have been abandoned long before, but are emphasized here as they are subtle counterpart of pleasure.
mn19:18.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward recollection of past lives.	NA
mn19:18.2	I recollected many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	The text is elided in the Pali, but clearly is meant to be understood in full per [mn4:27.2]().

mn19:23.3	I understood: ‘Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.’	NA
mn19:24.1	This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the last watch of the night.	NA
mn19:24.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	NA
mn19:25.1	Suppose that in a forested wilderness there was an expanse of low-lying marshes,	NA

mn19:25.3	Then along comes a person who wants to harm, injure, and threaten them.	NA
mn19:25.4	They close off the safe, secure path that leads to happiness, and open the wrong path. There they plant domesticated male and female deer as decoys	NA

mn20:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn20:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn20:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn20:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn20:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn20:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn20:2.1	“Mendicants, a mendicant committed to the higher mind should focus on five subjects from time to time.	The “higher mind” (_adhicitta_) is the four _jhānas_ ([an3.90:3.1]()). | “Subject” (_nimitta_) here has its normal meaning in meditation contexts: a property of experience that, when focused on, fosters similar properties. This is primarily the chosen subject of meditation, but it also includes any subject that the mind dwells on. | “From time to time” (_kālena kālaṁ_): these are not fundamentals of meditation like mindfulness, which should always be developed, but rather expedients for dealing with specific problems when they arise. A meditator should be familiar with these methods and apply them when needed. However, one should not be over-eager to reach for these methods; they are meant for those times when the normal process of meditation has gone awry.
mn20:2.2	What five?	NA
mn20:3.1	Take a mendicant who is focusing on some subject that gives rise to bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion. That mendicant should focus on some other subject connected with the skillful.	For example, a meditator who finds themselves plagued with thoughts of annoyance, having recognized that this is happening per [mn19](), should switch to a new meditation such as _mettā_.
mn20:3.2	As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end.	NA
mn20:3.3	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	NA
mn20:3.4	It’s like a deft mason or their apprentice who’d knock out or extract a large peg with a finer peg.	NA
mn20:3.5	In the same way, a mendicant … should focus on some other basis of meditation connected with the skillful …	NA
mn20:3.6	NA	NA
mn20:3.7	NA	NA
mn20:4.1	Now, suppose that mendicant is focusing on some other subject connected with the skillful, but bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion keep coming up. They should examine the drawbacks of those thoughts:	These methods are progressive; each one assumes that the former method has failed. | Looking at the drawbacks of unskillful thoughts was the cornerstone of the Bodhisatta’s method at per [mn19:3.4]().
mn20:4.2	‘So these thoughts are unskillful, they’re blameworthy, and they result in suffering.’	As per [mn19:3.4]().
mn20:4.3	As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end.	NA
mn20:4.4	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	NA
mn20:4.5	Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments. If the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human were hung around their neck, they’d be horrified, repelled, and disgusted.	NA

mn20:5.1	Now, suppose that mendicant is examining the drawbacks of those thoughts, but bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion keep coming up. They should try to forget and ignore them.	“Forget” is _asati_ and “ignore” is _amanasikāra_.
mn20:5.2	As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end.	NA
mn20:5.3	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	NA
mn20:5.4	Suppose there was a person with clear eyes, and some undesirable sights came into their range of vision.	NA
mn20:5.5	They’d just close their eyes or look away.	NA
mn20:5.6	In the same way, a mendicant … those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end …	The repetitions here are dubious. The Mahāsaṅgīti edition here and following omits the method that stops the thoughts. It is surely implied, but in the absence of any witnesses, I translate to preserve the roughness of the Pali.
mn20:5.7	NA	NA
mn20:6.1	Now, suppose that mendicant is ignoring and forgetting about those thoughts, but bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion keep coming up. They should focus on stopping the formation of thoughts.	The unique phrase “stopping the formation of thoughts” (_vitakkasaṅkhārasaṇṭhānaṁ_) lends the sutta its title. Here _saṅkhāra_ refers to the energy that drives the formation of thoughts. Understanding the cause helps to deprive it of its power.
mn20:6.2	As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end.	NA
mn20:6.3	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	NA
mn20:6.4	Suppose there was a person walking quickly.	“Walking quickly” like a person swamped by many thoughts ([mn18:16.1]()).
mn20:6.5	They’d think:	NA
mn20:6.6	‘Why am I walking so quickly?	NA
mn20:6.7	Why don’t I slow down?’	NA
mn20:6.8	So they’d slow down.	Multiple methods of quelling thought have failed, so this method focuses on gradually slowing down rather than stopping all at once. Asking “why am I thinking so much?” turns attention around, focusing on the previous thought rather than the next thing.
mn20:6.9	They’d think:	NA
mn20:6.10	‘Why am I walking slowly?	NA
mn20:6.11	Why don’t I stand still?’	NA
mn20:6.12	So they’d stand still.	NA

mn20:6.14	‘Why am I standing still?	NA
mn20:6.15	Why don’t I sit down?’	NA

mn20:6.18	‘Why am I sitting?	NA
mn20:6.19	Why don’t I lie down?’	NA
mn20:6.20	So they’d lie down.	NA
mn20:6.21	And so that person would reject successively coarser postures and adopt more subtle ones.	NA

mn20:7.1	Now, suppose that mendicant is focusing on stopping the formation of thoughts, but bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion keep coming up.	NA
mn20:7.2	With teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth, they should squeeze, squash, and crush mind with mind.	As a last resort, the meditator forcibly crushes unwholesome thoughts and makes themselves think wholesome thoughts. This is one of the Jain-like mortifying meditations that the Bodhisatta undertook before discovering the middle way ([mn36:20.2](), [mn85:20.2](), [mn100:17.2]()). There, compared to the other practices such as meditating without breathing, it is the first and gentlest. Thus the most gentle of the mortifying meditations becomes the harshest of the Buddhist methods. | The first two terms (_abhiniggaṇhāti_, _abhinippīḷeti_) also occur in the context of defeating an opponent in debate ([an10.116:5.1]()) and sexual assault ([pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:2.2.1]()). _Abhisantāpeti_ does not occur elsewhere in early Pali, but at Atharvaveda 2.12.6c it is a divine punishment for heretics.
mn20:7.3	As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end.	NA
mn20:7.4	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	NA
mn20:7.5	It’s like a strong man who grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes, squashes, and crushes them.	NA

mn20:8.10	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	NA
mn20:8.11	This is called a mendicant who is a master of the ways of thought.	NA
mn20:8.12	They will think what they want to think, and they won’t think what they don’t want to think.	NA
mn20:8.13	They’ve cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit have made an end of suffering.”	This sentence has a number of dubious features. Up until now the Chinese parallel at MA 101 is fairly similar, but it lacks this phrase. In addition, the passage lacks the expected conditional _yato ca_ construction (“When a mendicant … then they are called one who has cut off craving …”, eg. [mn22.1]()). Moreover, being phrased in the past tense it sits uneasily with the future tense of the previous phrase, and would have made better sense reversed (“Having cut off craving … they will think what they want to think”). Taken together, these considerations suggest that this passage may have been inserted by error in the Pali. The original scope of the sutta, then, would have focused solely on the quieting of thoughts for attaining _samādhi_.

mn21:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn21:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn21:2.1	Now at that time, Venerable Phagguna of the Top-Knot was spending too long mixing closely with some nuns.	This monk appears in three discourses, in none of which he distinguishes himself. At [sn12.12]() he persistently attempts to rephrase questions on dependent origination in terms of a self. And at [sn12.32]() Venerable Sāriputta gets word that Phagguna had disrobed. | According to the commentary, he was called Phagguna “of the Top-Knot” because of the style he wore his hair as a layperson. The name stuck, presumably to distinguish him from the Phagguna of [an6.56]() (and probably [sn35.83]()) who died in robes as a non-returner after hearing a Dhamma talk.
mn21:2.2	So much so that	NA
mn21:2.3	if any mendicant criticized those nuns in his presence, Phagguna of the Top-Knot got angry and upset, and even instigated disciplinary proceedings.	A “disciplinary proceeding” (_adhikaraṇa_) is a legal case in Vinaya. A standard set of four is listed at [mn104:12.3](). The kind of case is not specified in the text, but the commentary says they accused other mendicants of various offences and got Vinaya experts to litigate them, making it a “disciplinary issue arising from accusations” (_anuvādādhikaraṇa_, [pli-tv-kd14:14.2.7]()).
mn21:2.4	And if any mendicant criticized Phagguna of the Top-Knot in their presence, those nuns got angry and upset, and even instigated disciplinary proceedings.	NA
mn21:2.5	That’s how close Phagguna of the Top-Knot was with those nuns.	NA
mn21:3.1	Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was going on.	NA

mn21:3.4	NA	NA
mn21:3.5	NA	NA
mn21:3.6	NA	NA
mn21:4.1	So the Buddha addressed one of the monks,	NA
mn21:4.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Phagguna of the Top-Knot that	NA
mn21:4.3	the teacher summons him.”	NA
mn21:4.4	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Phagguna of the Top-Knot and said to him,	NA
mn21:4.5	“Reverend Phagguna, the teacher summons you.”	NA
mn21:4.6	“Yes, reverend,” Phagguna replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:	NA
mn21:5.1	“Is it really true, Phagguna, that you’ve been spending too long mixing closely with some nuns?	NA
mn21:5.2	So much so that	NA
mn21:5.3	if any mendicant criticizes those nuns in your presence, you get angry and upset, and even instigate disciplinary proceedings?	NA
mn21:5.4	And if any mendicant criticizes you in those nuns’ presence, they get angry and upset, and even instigate disciplinary proceedings?	NA
mn21:5.5	Is that how close you’ve become with those nuns?”	NA
mn21:5.6	“Yes, sir.”	NA
mn21:5.7	“Phagguna, are you not a gentleman who has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness?”	NA
mn21:5.8	“Yes, sir.”	NA
mn21:6.1	“As such, it’s not appropriate for you to mix so closely with those nuns.	NA
mn21:6.2	So if anyone criticizes those nuns in your presence, you should give up any desires or thoughts of domestic life.	NA
mn21:6.3	If that happens, you should train like this:	NA
mn21:6.4	‘My mind will not degenerate. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of sympathy, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’	NA
mn21:6.5	That’s how you should train.	NA
mn21:6.6	So even if someone strikes those nuns with fists, stones, rods, and swords in your presence, you should give up any desires or thoughts of domestic life.	This does not mean, of course, that one should not defend people against violence (see eg. [dn16:1.4.15]()), but that even in such circumstances one should not give way to anger.
mn21:6.7	If that happens, you should train like this:	NA
mn21:6.8	‘My mind will not degenerate. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of sympathy, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’	NA
mn21:6.9	That’s how you should train.	NA
mn21:6.10	So if anyone criticizes you in your presence, you should give up any desires or thoughts of domestic life.	The grammar here is a little tricky. The genitive plays two roles in these passages: specifying the context (_tava sammukhā_, “in your presence”), and as the object of criticism or blows (_pahāraṁ dadeyya_ “if they strike” operates above on “those nuns” (_tāsaṁ bhikkhunīnaṁ_) and below on “you” (_tava_)). Here we would expect both senses to be used, but the text only has _tava_ once. I assume that either one instance of _tava_ has been lost or it is meant to be distributed.
mn21:6.11	If that happens, you should train like this: ‘My mind will not degenerate. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of sympathy, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’	NA
mn21:6.12	That’s how you should train.	NA
mn21:6.13	So Phagguna, even if someone strikes you with fists, stones, rods, and swords, you should give up any desires or thoughts of domestic life.	Here _sammukhā_ is omitted, as it is unnecessary to specify being hit in your own presence.
mn21:6.14	If that happens, you should train like this: ‘My mind will not degenerate. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of sympathy, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’	NA
mn21:6.15	That’s how you should train.”	NA
mn21:7.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:	NA
mn21:7.2	“Mendicants, I used to be satisfied with the mendicants.	NA
mn21:7.3	Once, I addressed them:	NA
mn21:7.4	‘I eat my food in one sitting per day.	Eating once a day is also encouraged at [mn65](), while [mn70]() encourages not eating at night. In both cases, monks objected when asked to follow this practice. Thus all three instances depict the growing influence of recalcitrant monks in the Sangha, culminating in the Buddha laying down a formal Vinaya rule against eating at the wrong time ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc37]()). Per the allowance at [mn65:4.1](), the mendicants are not required to eat in one sitting, which remained as an optional ascetic practice.
mn21:7.5	Doing so, I find that I’m healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	NA
mn21:7.6	You too should eat your food in one sitting per day.	NA
mn21:7.7	Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.’	NA
mn21:7.8	I didn’t have to keep on instructing those mendicants;	NA
mn21:7.9	I just had to prompt their mindfulness.	This is referring to the early years of the dispensation, before the formal Vinaya code was laid down. The Buddha was reluctant to create a legal code and did so only when it became necessary ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.4.6]()). He preferred to lead without judgment and punishment, but by reason, positive encouragement, and inspiring with his own example.
mn21:7.10	Suppose a chariot stood harnessed to thoroughbreds at a level crossroads, with a goad ready.	This simile is also at [mn119:31.2](), [sn35.239:2.10](), and [an5.28:10.2]().
mn21:7.11	A deft horse trainer, a master charioteer, might mount the chariot, taking the reins in his right hand and goad in the left. He’d drive out and back wherever he wishes, whenever he wishes.	NA
mn21:7.12	In the same way, I didn’t have to keep on instructing those mendicants;	NA
mn21:7.13	I just had to prompt their mindfulness.	NA
mn21:7.14	So, mendicants, you too should give up what’s unskillful and devote yourselves to skillful qualities.	NA
mn21:7.15	In this way you’ll achieve growth, improvement, and maturity in this teaching and training.	NA
mn21:8.1	Suppose that not far from a town or village there was a large grove of sal trees	This is a unique simile.

mn21:8.3	Then along comes a person who wants to help protect and nurture that grove.	NA
mn21:8.4	They’d cut down the crooked sal saplings that were robbing the sap, and throw them out. They’d clean up the interior of the grove,	NA
mn21:8.5	and properly care for the straight, well-formed sal saplings.	NA
mn21:8.6	In this way, in due course, that sal grove would grow, increase, and mature.	NA

mn21:8.8	In this way you’ll achieve growth, improvement, and maturity in this teaching and training.	NA
mn21:9.1	Once upon a time, mendicants, right here in Sāvatthī there was a housewife named Vedehikā.	The lady Vedehikā is known only here. According to the commentary, her name means either “daughter of the lady from Videha”, or (implausibly) “wise one”. However, the much earlier Arthaśāstra treats _vaidehika_ either as a “merchant” (2.21.7) or as a caste name (3.7.32). This story paints a rare portrait of domestic life.
mn21:9.2	She had this good reputation:	NA
mn21:9.3	‘The housewife Vedehikā is sweet, even-tempered, and calm.’	The same set of three in a similar context occur at [an6.60]().
mn21:9.4	Now, Vedehikā had a bonded maid named Kāḷī who was deft, tireless, and well-organized in her work.	According to ancient Indian law (Arthaśāstra 3.13), slaves may be born such, be captured in war, or a person in a time of trouble may bind themselves in service for a fee. Non-Aryans (_mleccha_) may indenture their children, but this is forbidden for Aryans. Such bondservants were protected against cruelty, sexual abuse, and unfair work. After earning back the fee of their indenture they were freed, retaining their original inheritance and status. | The maid’s name means “black” (compare the Kāḷī at [thag2.16:1.1]() who “looks like a crow”). This is a persistent pattern in early Pali. The only other named slaves are Disā (“foe”, [dn3:1.16.1]()), her son Kaṇha (“black”, [dn3:1.16.1]()), and Kāka (“crow”, [pli-tv-kd8:1.26.6]()). These people were evidently non-Aryans descended from the native peoples of India, perhaps Tamils or other tribal groups.
mn21:9.5	Then Kāḷī thought,	NA
mn21:9.6	‘My mistress has a good reputation as being	NA
mn21:9.7	sweet, even-tempered, and calm.	NA
mn21:9.8	But does she actually have anger in her and just not show it? Or does she have no anger?	NA
mn21:9.9	Or is it just because my work is well-organized that she doesn’t show anger, even though she still has it inside?	NA
mn21:9.10	Why don’t I test my mistress?’	To “test” (or “inquire”) is _vīmaṁsā_, which features as the fourth of the bases of psychic power.
mn21:9.11	So Kāḷī got up during the day.	NA
mn21:9.12	Vedehikā said to her,	NA
mn21:9.13	‘Oi wench, Kāḷī!’	_He je_ is an idiomatic and disrespectful form of address, offering a glimpse of colloquial speech in the formal Pali of scripture. _He_ is an exclamation for calling attention, like “hey” but cruder. _Je_ is a derogatory term for women, used here and by the Vajjīs to Ambapālī at [dn16:2.16.3]().
mn21:9.14	‘What is it, ma’am?’	She uses the respectful address _ayye_ (“ma’am”).
mn21:9.15	‘You’re getting up in the day—what’s up with you, wench?’	NA
mn21:9.16	‘Nothing, ma’am.’	NA
mn21:9.17	‘Oh, so nothing’s up, you naughty maid, but you get up in the day!’ Angry and upset, she scowled.	NA
mn21:9.18	Then Kāḷī thought,	NA
mn21:9.19	‘My mistress actually has anger in her and just doesn’t show it; it’s not that she has no anger.	NA
mn21:9.20	It’s just because my work is well-organized that she doesn’t show anger, even though she still has it inside.	NA
mn21:9.21	Why don’t I test my mistress further?’	NA
mn21:9.22	So Kāḷī got up later in the day.	NA
mn21:9.23	Vedehikā said to her,	NA
mn21:9.24	‘Oi wench, Kāḷī!’	NA
mn21:9.25	‘What is it, ma’am?’	NA
mn21:9.26	‘You’re getting up later in the day—what’s up with you, wench?’	NA
mn21:9.27	‘Nothing, ma’am.’	NA
mn21:9.28	‘Oh, so nothing’s up, you naughty maid, but you get up later in the day!’ Angry and upset, she blurted out angry words.	NA
mn21:9.29	Then Kāḷī thought,	NA
mn21:9.30	‘My mistress actually has anger in her and just doesn’t show it; it’s not that she has no anger.	NA
mn21:9.31	It’s just because my work is well-organized that she doesn’t show anger, even though she still has it inside.	NA
mn21:9.32	Why don’t I test my mistress further?’	NA
mn21:9.33	So Kāḷī got up even later in the day.	Assuming that the three rounds are meant to be _divā_, _divātaraṁ_, _divātaraṁyeva_ (“in the day”, “later in the day”, “even later in the day”), although this is not followed consistently in the text.
mn21:9.34	Vedehikā said to her,	NA
mn21:9.35	‘Oi wench, Kāḷī!’	NA
mn21:9.36	‘What is it, ma’am?’	NA
mn21:9.37	‘You’re getting up even later in the day—what’s up with you, wench?’	NA
mn21:9.38	‘Nothing, ma’am.’	NA
mn21:9.39	‘Oh, so nothing’s up, you naughty maid, but you get up even later in the day!’ Angry and upset, she grabbed a door-pin and hit Kāḷī on the head, cracking it open.	_Aggaḷasūci_ is a “pin” (_sūci_) for fastening the “door” (_aggala_). It is sometimes translated as “rolling pin”, but that would be Sanskrit _vellana_ (Hindi _belan_).
mn21:9.40	Then Kāḷī, with blood pouring from her cracked skull, denounced her mistress to the neighbors,	NA
mn21:9.41	‘See, ladies, what the sweet one did!	NA
mn21:9.42	See what the even-tempered one did! See what the calm one did!	NA
mn21:9.43	How on earth can she grab a door-pin and hit her only maid on the head, cracking it open, just for getting up late?’	Arthaśāstra 3.13.9 says that inflicting punishment (_daṇḍapreṣaṇam_; cf. Pali _daṇḍāpesuṁ_ at [pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.38]()) on a slave is a crime for which a master incurs a fine equivalent to the cost of the slave.
mn21:9.44	Then after some time the housewife Vedehikā got this bad reputation:	NA
mn21:9.45	‘The housewife Vedehikā is fierce, ill-tempered, and not calm at all.’	No blame is given to Kāḷī for her deliberate provocation.
mn21:10.1	In the same way, a mendicant may be the sweetest of the sweet, the most even-tempered of the even-tempered, the calmest of the calm, so long as they don’t encounter any disagreeable criticism.	NA
mn21:10.2	But it’s when they encounter disagreeable criticism that you’ll know whether they’re really sweet, even-tempered, and calm.	NA
mn21:10.3	I don’t say that a mendicant is easy to admonish if they make themselves easy to admonish only for the sake of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	NA
mn21:10.4	Why is that?	NA
mn21:10.5	Because when they don’t get robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick, they’re no longer easy to admonish.	NA
mn21:10.6	But when a mendicant is easy to admonish purely because they honor, respect, revere, worship, and venerate the teaching, then I say that they’re easy to admonish.	NA
mn21:10.7	So, mendicants, you should train yourselves: ‘We will be easy to admonish purely because we honor, respect, revere, worship, and venerate the teaching.’	NA
mn21:10.8	That’s how you should train.	NA

mn22:0.1	Middle Discourses 22	NA
mn22:0.2	The Simile of the Cobra	NA
mn22:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn22:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn22:2.1	Now at that time a mendicant called Ariṭṭha, who had previously been a vulture trapper, had the following harmful misconception:	For “vulture trapper” (_gaddhabādhi_), see [sn47.7:1.4]() where _√bādh_ clearly means to “trap” a monkey. The commentary’s “killer” seems unjustified.
mn22:2.2	“As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.”	By this he denies the third of the four kinds of self-assurance ([mn12:25.1]()).
mn22:2.3	Several mendicants heard about this.	NA
mn22:2.4	NA	NA
mn22:2.5	NA	NA
mn22:3.1	They went up to Ariṭṭha and said to him,	NA
mn22:3.2	“Is it really true, Reverend Ariṭṭha, that you have such a harmful misconception:	NA
mn22:3.3	‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them’?”	NA
mn22:3.4	“Absolutely, reverends. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.”	NA
mn22:3.5	Then, wishing to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view, the mendicants pursued, pressed, and grilled him,	The stock phrase “pursued, pressed, and grilled” (_samanuyuñjanti samanugāhanti samanubhāsanti_) is sometimes rendered as if it meant to “question”, but here there is no question. While these terms are commonly used in a context of questioning, they do not, in and of themselves, mean to question. Rather they mean to engage with a person and push for an answer or response.
mn22:3.6	“Don’t say that, Ariṭṭha! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that.	Ariṭṭha makes two mistakes: misunderstanding sensual pleasures, and misrepresenting the Buddha.
mn22:3.7	In many ways the Buddha has said that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them.	Ariṭṭha did not specify what “obstructions” he was referring to, but this reply by the mendicants indicates that he meant indulgence in sensual pleasures, a conclusion supported by the commentary and several parallel texts. See too [thig16.1:45.2]() where sensual pleasures are said to be “obstructive”. Other things said to be obstructive are “possessions, honor, and popularity” (eg. [sn17.2:1.2]()) and “false speech” ([pli-tv-kd2:3.3.14]()). In the latter context, “obstructive” is explained as preventing the attainment of _jhāna_ and higher spiritual realizations.
mn22:3.8	The Buddha says that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.	NA
mn22:3.9	With the similes of a skeleton …	The first seven of these ten similes are taught with explanations at [mn54:15.1](). The full ten are quoted at [an5.76:11.2]() and by the bhikkhunī Sumedhā at [thig16.1:41.1](). With slight variations the list recurs in various parallels and some similes are found individually.

mn22:3.21	When they weren’t able to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view, the mendicants went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	NA

mn22:4.1	NA	NA
mn22:5.1	So the Buddha addressed one of the monks,	NA
mn22:5.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Ariṭṭha, formerly a vulture trapper, that	NA
mn22:5.3	the teacher summons him.”	NA
mn22:5.4	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Ariṭṭha and said to him,	NA
mn22:5.5	“Reverend Ariṭṭha, the teacher summons you.”	NA
mn22:5.6	“Yes, reverend,” Ariṭṭha replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	NA
mn22:5.7	“Is it really true, Ariṭṭha, that you have such a harmful misconception:	NA
mn22:5.8	‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them’?”	NA
mn22:5.9	“Absolutely, sir. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.”	“Absolutely” renders the particle _byā_, which is a rare intensive form of _iva_. It is employed in the same manner by Sāti at [mn38:3.7](), who is equally confident and equally wrong.
mn22:6.1	“Futile man, who on earth have you ever known me to teach in that way?	NA
mn22:6.2	Haven’t I said in many ways that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them?	NA
mn22:6.3	I’ve said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.	NA
mn22:6.4	With the similes of a skeleton …	NA
mn22:6.5	a scrap of meat …	NA
mn22:6.6	a grass torch …	NA

mn22:6.13	a snake’s head, I’ve said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.	NA
mn22:6.14	But still you misrepresent me by your wrong grasp, harm yourself, and create much wickedness.	NA
mn22:6.15	This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.”	The discourse up to this point is also found twice in the Vinaya. At [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68]() the Buddha makes it a confessable offence to persistently insist on a pernicious wrong view of this sort. At [pli-tv-kd11:32.1.1]() the Buddha asks the Sangha to perform an act of suspension (or “ejection”, _ukkhepanīyakamma_) against Ariṭṭha. This portion is also found in the parallel Vinayas of the Dharmaguptaka,Kāśyapīya, Mahāsāṅghika, Mahīśāsaka, Mūlasarvāstivāda, and Sarvāstivāda schools.
mn22:7.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,	NA
mn22:7.2	“What do you think, mendicants?	NA
mn22:7.3	Has this mendicant Ariṭṭha kindled even a spark of ardor in this teaching and training?”	“Kindled even a spark of ardor” renders _usmīkatopi_, found in a similar context at [mn38:6.3](). _Usmā_ elsewhere appears as bodily warmth ([mn43:22.9](), cf. Brahmasūtra 4.2.11), or the initial heating of fire-sticks when rubbed together ([mn140:19.13]()). But the most pertinent context is [ja526:55.4](), where a young ascetic will swiftly lose their _usmāgataṁ_—explained by the commentary as “the fire of an ascetic” (_samaṇatejaṁ_)—should they fall prey to sensual temptation. Thus, drawing on the traditional imagery of _tapas_ as heat and fervor, it refers to the kindling of ascetic ardor. It never became a technical term in Pali, but in Sanskrit Abhidharma, _uṣmagata_ refers to the conjunction of radiant _samādhi_ with wisdom in the initial realization of the truths, which “burns up” the defilements (Abhidharmakoṣabhāṣya 6.17, Abhidharmasamuccaya 2.4).
mn22:7.4	“How could that be, sir?	NA
mn22:7.5	No, sir.”	NA
mn22:7.6	When this was said, Ariṭṭha sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.	NA
mn22:7.7	Knowing this, the Buddha said,	NA
mn22:7.8	“Futile man, you will be known by your own harmful misconception.	NA
mn22:7.9	I’ll question the mendicants about this.”	NA
mn22:8.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,	NA
mn22:8.2	“Mendicants, do you understand my teaching as Ariṭṭha does, when he misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and creates much wickedness?”	NA
mn22:8.3	“No, sir.	NA
mn22:8.4	For in many ways the Buddha has told us that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them.	NA
mn22:8.5	NA	NA
mn22:8.6	The Buddha has said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.	NA
mn22:8.7	With the similes of a skeleton …	NA
mn22:8.8	a snake’s head, the Buddha has said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.”	NA
mn22:8.9	“Good, good, mendicants! It’s good that you understand my teaching like this.	NA

mn22:8.11	NA	NA
mn22:8.12	NA	NA
mn22:8.13	I’ve said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.	NA
mn22:8.14	But still this Ariṭṭha misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and creates much wickedness.	NA
mn22:8.15	This will be for his lasting harm and suffering.	NA
mn22:9.1	Truly, mendicants, it is quite impossible to perform sensual acts without sensual desires, sensual perceptions, and sensual thoughts.	According to the commentary, this refers to sexual intercourse. This sentence is not found in the Chinese parallel at MA 200.
mn22:10.1	Take a futile person who memorizes the teaching—	NA
mn22:10.2	statements, mixed prose & verse, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and elaborations.	These nine categories (_aṅga_) of the teaching were an early organization of the Dhamma before the system of _nikāyas_ (or _āgamas_) was introduced at the First Council. While their exact specification is uncertain, in my view they are most likely as follows (with an example of each). _Sutta_ is short doctrinal statements ([sn12.1]()). _Geyya_ is mixed prose and verse (“prosimetra”, [sn1.1]()). _Veyyākaraṇa_ is questions and answers ([mn22]()). _Gāthā_ is pure verse ([thig1.1]()). _Udāna_ is the inspired statements identified as such in the early texts ([mn75:19.1]()). _Itivuttaka_ perhaps means “legends of the past”  ([dn27]()) rather than the book of that name ([iti1]()). _Jātaka_ are the past life stories of the Buddha found in the early texts ([mn81]()). _Abbhutadhamma_ are stories of the amazing qualities of the Buddha or disciples ([mn123]()). _Vedalla_ are detailed analytical elaborations ([mn43]()). Once the system of _aṅgas_ fell into disuse, some names were repurposed as specific books (Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka). Northern traditions, including the parallels to this passage, usually extend the list to twelve with the addition of _nidāna_ (background stories), _apadāna_ (past lives of disciples), and _upadesa_ (explanatory treatises).
mn22:10.3	But they don’t examine the meaning of those teachings with wisdom,	NA
mn22:10.4	and so don’t come to an acceptance of them after deliberation.	“Considered acceptance” is _nijjhānaṁ khamanti_.
mn22:10.5	They memorize the teaching for the sake of finding fault and winning debates.	This theme is expanded in several discourses of the Aṭṭhakavagga, such as [snp4.8]().
mn22:10.6	They don’t realize the goal for which they memorized them.	NA
mn22:10.7	Because they’re wrongly grasped, those teachings lead to their lasting harm and suffering.	NA
mn22:10.8	Why is that?	NA
mn22:10.9	Because of their wrong grasp of the teachings.	Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.10 says that those who worship ignorance enter darkness, but those who love knowledge (_veda_) enter even greater darkness. This is a recurring theme; for example, Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.1.2 tells how Uddālaka saw the vanity of his son Śvetaketu when he returned from his schooling.
mn22:10.10	Suppose there was a person in need of a cobra. And while wandering in search of a cobra	The _alagadda_ appears only here in early Pali. Sanskrit sources identify _alagarda_ either as a water-snake—in which case, however, it is said to be non-venomous (Kṣīrasvāmin’s Amarakoṣodghāṭana 1.7.5)—or as a kind of cobra (_darvīkāra_, Suśrutasaṁhitā 5.4). | As to why the man was looking for a cobra, the commentary says he was looking to harvest the snake’s venom. But Candrakīrti, drawing on the pan-Indic legend that certain serpents have a “snake-gem” (_nāgamaṇi_) in their heads, says that a serpent captured with the proper herbs and incantations brings great riches, but should these fail it will turn deadly (Mūlamadhyamakavṛtti-prasannapadā, L. de La Vallée Poussin’s translation, page 497).
mn22:10.11	they’d see a big cobra,	NA
mn22:10.12	and grasp it by the coil or the tail.	NA
mn22:10.13	But that cobra would twist back and bite them on the hand or the arm or other major or minor limb,	NA
mn22:10.14	resulting in death or deadly pain.	NA
mn22:10.15	Why is that?	NA
mn22:10.16	Because of their wrong grasp of the cobra.	NA

mn22:12.1	So, mendicants, when you understand what I’ve said, you should remember it accordingly.	NA
mn22:12.2	But if I’ve said anything that you don’t understand, you should ask me about it, or some competent mendicants.	As in, for example, [mn18]().
mn22:13.1	Mendicants, I will teach you a simile of the teaching as a raft: for crossing over, not for holding on.	This is the second renowned simile introduced in this discourse. It is referenced by name in [mn38:14.1](). Metaphors of flood and crossing rivers abound in the Buddha’s teaching, and the specific idea of using a raft to cross over recurs at [ud8.6:27.4]() = [dn16:1.33.2]() = [pli-tv-kd6:28.12.7](), [snp1.2:4.1](), [sn35.238:5.6]().
mn22:13.2	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn22:13.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
mn22:13.4	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn22:13.5	“Suppose there was a person traveling along the road.	NA
mn22:13.6	They’d see a large deluge, whose near shore was dubious and perilous, while the far shore was a sanctuary free of peril.	NA
mn22:13.7	But there was no ferryboat or bridge for crossing over.	NA
mn22:13.8	They’d think,	NA
mn22:13.9	NA	NA
mn22:13.10	NA	NA
mn22:13.11	‘Why don’t I gather grass, sticks, branches, and leaves and make a raft? Riding on the raft, and paddling with my hands and feet, I can safely reach the far shore.’	NA
mn22:13.12	And so they’d do exactly that.	NA
mn22:13.13	And when they’d crossed over to the far shore, they’d think,	NA
mn22:13.14	‘This raft has been very helpful to me.	NA
mn22:13.15	Riding on the raft, and paddling with my hands and feet, I have safely crossed over to the far shore.	NA
mn22:13.16	Why don’t I hoist it on my head or pick it up on my shoulder and go wherever I want?’	NA
mn22:13.17	What do you think, mendicants?	NA
mn22:13.18	Would that person be doing what should be done with that raft?”	NA
mn22:13.19	“No, sir.”	NA
mn22:13.20	“And what, mendicants, should that person do with the raft?	NA
mn22:13.21	When they’d crossed over they should think,	NA
mn22:13.22	‘This raft has been very helpful to me. …	NA
mn22:13.23	NA	NA
mn22:13.24	Why don’t I beach it on dry land or set it adrift on the water and go wherever I want?’	NA
mn22:13.25	That’s what that person should do with the raft.	NA
mn22:13.26	In the same way, I have taught a simile of the teaching as a raft: for crossing over, not for holding on.	NA
mn22:14.1	By understanding the simile of the raft, you will even give up the teachings, let alone what is not the teachings.	_Dhammā_ in the plural refers back to “those teachings” (_tesaṁ dhammānaṁ_) of the nine categories. Accordingly, when this simile is invoked at [mn38:14.1](), it is in reference to views. The pair _dhamma_ and _adhamma_ usually means “the teaching” and “what is not the teaching” (eg. [an2.104]()). Just as the positive form, however, means more than just “teaching”, but rather a teaching of natural and moral truth, the negative form implies there is something unnatural, in conflict with the way the world is.
mn22:15.1	Mendicants, there are these six grounds for views.	“Grounds for views” (_diṭṭhiṭṭhānāni_) are the experiences or reasoning from which views are derived. The Buddha is explaining how Ariṭṭha fell into his wrong view. One of the purposes of this analysis is to show how, while divergent views might seem insightful, innovative, or courageous, they all fall back on the same basic fallacies.
mn22:15.2	What six?	NA
mn22:15.3	Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.	NA
mn22:15.4	They regard form as: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’	The misguided person assumes that one or other of the aggregates is their self. In modern times, the teaching of the aggregates is often presented as a reductive argument: “What you take to be your self is in fact just the aggregates”. But the Buddha’s point is, rather: “The aggregates that you take to be your self do not have the properties of a self,” namely permanence, etc.
mn22:15.5	They also regard feeling …	NA
mn22:15.6	perception …	NA
mn22:15.7	choices …	NA
mn22:15.8	whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, and explored by the mind as: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’	Standing in place of the fifth aggregate, “consciousness”, this includes all kinds of knowledge or spiritual wisdom, especially that gained through mysticism or meditation.
mn22:15.9	And as for this ground for views:	NA
mn22:15.10	‘The cosmos and the self are one and the same. After death I will be that, permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever.’	This is a both view and a ground for views. Such views, lacking empirical basis, have something dissatisfying about them, so adherent is driven to develop more and more complex metaphysical abstractions. At [dn1:1.30.1](), this is treated as an eternalist view that arises from the grounds of either recollection of past lives or logic. | The repeated demonstrative pronouns in the Pali _so loko so attā_ (literally, “This is the cosmos, this is the self”) affirm an emphatic and absolute identity: “The cosmos and the self are one and the same”. This phrase has a lexical parallel at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.22, which argues for the renunciate life: “What can descendants do for those for whom the self and the cosmos are one and the same” (_[a]yamātmāyaṁ loka_). See also the last words of a father to his son at 1.5.17: “You are divinity, you are the sacrifice, you are the cosmos” (_tvaṁ brahma tvaṁ yajñas tvaṁ loka_). | In this passage the terms _attā_ and _loko_ are reversed, presumably by textual error. It does not affect the meaning.
mn22:15.11	They regard this also as: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’	NA
mn22:16.1	But a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen true persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true persons.	NA
mn22:16.2	They regard form like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	NA
mn22:16.3	They also regard feeling …	NA

mn22:16.8	‘The cosmos and the self are one and the same. After death I will be that, permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever.’	NA
mn22:16.9	They also regard like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	NA
mn22:17.1	Seeing in this way they’re not anxious about what doesn’t exist.”	“What does not exist” (_asati_) is the self. | To be “anxious” (_paritassati_) is to be caught between desire and fear. It seems to be a word of specifically Buddhist usage, leaning equally on the roots _√tras_ (to tremble in fear) and _√tṛṣ_ (to thirst for or crave).
mn22:18.1	When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha,	NA
mn22:18.2	“Sir, can there be anxiety about what doesn’t exist externally?”	By adding “externally” the focus is shifted from the self to “what belongs to the self”, namely possessions. However, the Chinese parallel at MA 200 apparently takes it in reference to the anxiety of an eternalist who hears the Buddha teaching “externally”.
mn22:18.3	“There can, mendicant,” said the Buddha.	NA
mn22:18.4	“It’s when someone thinks,	NA
mn22:18.5	‘Oh, it once was mine but is mine no more.	NA

mn22:20.5	They hear the Realized One or their disciple teaching Dhamma for the uprooting of all grounds, fixations, obsessions, insistences, and underlying tendencies regarding views; for the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.	The structure of this long compound is revealed at [an10.96:14.1](), which shows that “views” is not one item on the list, but applies to each item.
mn22:20.6	They think,	NA
mn22:20.7	‘Whoa, I’m going to be annihilated and destroyed! I won’t even exist any more!’	They can only see the extremes: if not eternalism it must be annihilationism.

It appears twice elsewhere in the Majjhima ([mn35:20.4](), [mn109:15.1]()), in the Vinaya ([pli-tv-kd1:6.42.1]()), and about fifty times in the Saṁyutta.

mn22:26.19	“No, sir.”	NA
mn22:27.1	“So, mendicants, you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	NA
mn22:27.2	You should truly see any kind of feeling …	NA

mn22:27.5	consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	NA
mn22:28.1	Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.	NA
mn22:29.1	Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.	NA
mn22:29.2	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’	NA
mn22:30.1	Such a mendicant is one who is called ‘one who has lifted the cross-bar’, ‘one who has filled in the moat’, ‘one who has pulled up the pillar’, ‘one who is unimpeded’, and also ‘a noble one with banner lowered and burden dropped, detached’.	These similes recur at [an5.71]() and [an5.72](). They reflect ideas of entrapment and freedom.
mn22:31.1	And how has a mendicant raised the cross-bar?	Ignorance is a “hindrance” (_nīvaraṇa_), an image that ultimately draws on the Vedic myth of Vṛtra, a giant “constrictor” who trapped the waters (and sometimes cattle and sun) in darkness until it was slain by Indra and the waters released. Removing the bar permits escape from entrapment. At Chāndogya Upaniṣad 2.24.6, it is said that a devoted sacrificer may, at the time of death, pray that the cross-bar blocking entry to the next world be removed.
mn22:31.2	It’s when a mendicant has given up ignorance, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future.	NA
mn22:31.3	That’s how a mendicant has lifted the cross-bar.	NA
mn22:32.1	And how has a mendicant filled in the moat?	An elephant may be trapped by a moat [Cariyapiṭaka 11:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/cp11/en/sujato#3.1), so when it is filled in it may roam free.
mn22:32.2	It’s when a mendicant has given up transmigrating through births in future lives, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future.	NA
mn22:32.3	That’s how a mendicant has filled in the moat.	NA
mn22:33.1	And how has a mendicant pulled up the pillar?	Likewise, an elephant may be tethered to a pillar ([mn125:12.11](), [thag19.1:51.2](), [Cariyapiṭaka 11:3.2](https://suttacentral.net/cp11/en/sujato#3.2)). The term for “pillar” here (_esikā_) also serves as a pun for “search” (_esanā_). Two of the three “searches” (sensual pleasures and continued existence, [sn45.161]()) overlap with two of the three “cravings”.
mn22:33.2	It’s when a mendicant has given up craving, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future.	NA
mn22:33.3	That’s how a mendicant has pulled up the pillar.	NA
mn22:34.1	And how is a mendicant unimpeded?	Giving up the five lower “fetters” (thus becoming a non-returner) makes you “unbarred” (_niraggaḷa_). This is also the name of a Vedic sacrifice ([sn3.9:4.3]()), where it is probably a name for the horse sacrifice, during which the horse is set free to roam for a year.
mn22:34.2	It’s when a mendicant has given up the five lower fetters, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so they’re unable to arise in the future.	NA
mn22:34.3	That’s how a mendicant is unimpeded.	NA
mn22:35.1	And how is a mendicant a noble one with with banner lowered and burden dropped, detached?	A “banner” is held aloft as a sign of identity. | At [sn22.22](), the “burden” is said to be the five aggregates, and the burden is put down with the end of craving.
mn22:35.2	It’s when a mendicant has given up the conceit ‘I am’, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future.	NA
mn22:35.3	That’s how a mendicant is a noble one with banner lowered and burden dropped, detached.	NA
mn22:36.1	When a mendicant’s mind was freed like this, the gods together with Indra, the Divinity, and the Progenitor, search as they may, will not discover:	This expression conveys a deep sense of wonder when faced with a state of meditative consciousness so profound that its “basis” is unknown ([an11.9:3.15](), [sn22.79:14.26]()). The “basis” is that on which consciousness depends, which fuels it and keeps it going. All such dependencies have been uprooted.
mn22:36.2	‘This is the basis of that realized one’s consciousness.’	“Realized one” (_tahāgata_) usually refers to the Buddha, but sometimes, as here, it applies to any arahant.
mn22:36.3	Why is that?	NA
mn22:36.4	Because even in this very life that realized one is not found, I say.	Here “not found” renders _ananuvijja_, whereas at [mn22:25.5]() above it rendered _anupalabbhamāna_. Both terms refer to the self that is not discovered or discoverable.
mn22:37.1	Though I state and assert this, certain ascetics and brahmins misrepresent me with the incorrect, hollow, false, untruthful claim:	NA
mn22:37.2	‘The ascetic Gotama is an exterminator. He advocates the annihilation, eradication, and obliteration of an existing being.’	This is the annihilationist view, exemplified by Ajita of the hair blanket ([dn2:22.1]()), and referred to above at [mn22:20.7]().
mn22:37.3	They misrepresent me as what I am not, and saying what I do not say.	NA
mn22:37.4	NA	NA
mn22:37.5	In the past, as today, what I describe is suffering and the cessation of suffering.	The particle _c’eva_ here has its normal role of slight emphasis in conjunctions, and so this phrase does not mean, “I *only* teach suffering and the end of suffering”. The point, rather, is that when he speaks of cessation, it is the cessation of suffering, not the cessation of an “existing being”.
mn22:37.6	This being so, if others abuse, attack, harass, and trouble the Realized One, he doesn’t get resentful, bitter, and emotionally exasperated.	NA
mn22:38.1	Or if others honor, respect, revere, or venerate him, he doesn’t get thrilled, elated, and emotionally excited.	The Buddha teaches a similar equanimity at [dn1:1.5.1]().
mn22:38.2	If they praise him, he just thinks,	NA
mn22:38.3	‘They do such things for me regarding what in the past was completely understood.’	Read _tattha me_ “regarding that for me” rather than commentary’s _tattha (i)me_ “regarding that for these [aggregates]”. The latter reading is supported by BJT’s _tatrime_, but I think this is probably a backreading from the commentary. In the parallel phrase for the monks below, we would expect _tattha no_, which is in fact attested in the Thai and PTS editions, so I translate “us” accordingly.
mn22:39.1	So, mendicants, if others abuse, attack, harass, and trouble you, don’t make yourselves resentful, bitter, and emotionally exasperated.	NA
mn22:39.2	Or if others honor, respect, revere, or venerate you, don’t make yourselves thrilled, elated, and emotionally excited.	NA
mn22:39.3	If they praise you, just think,	NA
mn22:39.4	‘They do such things for us regarding what in the past was completely understood.’	This seems out of place here, for “completely understood” refers to arahantship, yet as a general teaching this should include everyone. In the Chinese parallel at MA 200, after being abused, one reflects that it is due to past deeds, and after being praised, one reflects that it is due to present knowledge and elimination of defilements. Anālayo (*Comparative Study*, pp. 56–7) suggests that the Pali phrase _pubbe pariññātaṁ_ might be a conflation of these two ideas due to a textual confusion which also left the Pali without a reflection on being abused. While this must remain conjectural, it is a neat explanation for the several doctrinal and textual problems of this passage.
mn22:40.1	So, mendicants, give up what isn’t yours.	This passage is found in several other suttas such as [sn22.33](), and applied to the six senses at [sn35.101]().
mn22:40.2	Giving it up will be for your lasting welfare and happiness.	NA

They are both considered to be “practicing to realize the fruit of stream-entry” (_sotāpattiphalasacchikiriyāya paṭipanno_), and, with the maturing of their faculties ([sn48.18:1.5]()), will assuredly attain stream-entry in this life ([sn25.1]()).

mn23:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn23:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Kassapa the Prince was staying in the Dark Forest.	“Kassapa the Prince” (Kumārakassapa) was ordained at twenty ([pli-tv-kd1:75.1.1]()). His verses are collected in the Theragāthā ([thag2.41]()). His love of elaborate similes and playful similes is shown in the Pāyāsisutta ([dn23]()), and echoed here in the teachings to him. He was declared the foremost of those with brilliant speech ([an1.217]()). | The Dark Forest (_andhavana_) was a thick grove south of Sāvatthī often visited by monks and nuns for meditation. However, this is the only discourse where someone is said to be staying there. The commentary says the name means “Blind Man’s Forest”, giving a highly improbable origin story. But compare Sanskrit _andhakūpa_, “dark well” or “blind well”, a well covered over with a lid or overgrowth; also the name of a hell.
mn23:1.4	Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Dark Forest, went up to Kassapa the Prince, stood to one side, and said:	The deity offers a series of obscure riddles full of secret meaning, almost like a dream sequence. The deliberate use of obscurity is a hallmark of Brahmanical literature, for “the gods love hidden things” (_parokṣakāmā hi devāḥ_, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 10.6.2.2 and throughout). The sequence is set out as a quest for buried treasure. This mytheme is implicit in the Vedic myth of Indra freeing the cattle and the sun from the Vala cave, an act that liberates the truth. Sometimes it is made explicit, as when Indra is said to bring up the treasures buried deep (Rig Veda 8.66.4). The Aśvins are also associated with unearthing buried gems (Rig Veda 1.117.5) or gold (Rig Veda 1.117.12), imagery ultimately based in mining for the wealth of minerals underground.
mn23:2.1	“Monk, monk! This termite mound fumes by night and flames by day.	Worship of termite mounds and the deadly snakes they harbor is still common in India today and is probably pre-Vedic. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa acknowledges a ritual significance to the anthill as a creative manifestation of the earth upon which offerings may be laid and whose ants were divine (2.6.2.17, 6.3.3.5, 14.1.2.10). In Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.7, Yājñavalkya compares a dead body bereft of soul to the lifeless slough of a snake on an anthill. | While anthills don’t “fume” and “flame”, large termite mounds leverage the temperature differential of day and night to create convection flows that regulate temperature and flush carbon dioxide.
mn23:2.2	The brahmin said,	NA
mn23:2.3	‘Dig, clever one, having picked up the sword!’	The sword is taken up, a symbol whose roots lie in the discovery of metal smelting and the power this grants to the one who wields the sword. But the phrase has a double meaning, for _sattha_ means both “sword” and “sacred treatise”, while _abhikkhaṇa_ means both “dig” (_abhi_ + _√khaṇ_) and “see” (_abhi_ + _√ikkh_; this sense not in Pali, but cf. Vedic _abhikhyā_). Thus, having entered the Dark Wood, the “clever one” (_sumedha_) is urged to use the wisdom of scripture in order to see. This sense is reinforced by the fact that is the “brahmin” who says this.
mn23:2.4	Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a sticking point:	_Laṅgi_ occurs only here, and is glossed by the commentary with _paligha_ (“obstacle”). Such an obscure term must have been selected for a play on words. Sanskrit _lagna_ has the primary sense “to stick, adhere”, while also having a sense of the beginning or coming into contact with something. In modern languages such as Hindi, Marathi, or Kannada it has taken on the sense of “marriage”, and perhaps here we see an anticipation of this. If we are on the right track, the _laṅgi_ would be the initial challenge for a mendicant seeker, namely their attachment to family. This would explain why it is the first obstacle.
mn23:2.5	‘A sticking point, sir!’	NA

mn23:2.7	‘Throw out the sticking point!	NA
mn23:2.8	Dig, clever one, having picked up the sword!’	NA
mn23:2.9	Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a bullfrog:	The male Indian bullfrog possesses a pair of prominent dark-blue vocal sacs that puff up and down as it croaks, hence the Pali name _uddhumāyika_ (“puffer”). | Rig Veda 7.10 is addressed to frogs, who lie fallow in the dry but spring to life in the rains, filling the countryside with their amorous croaks, like the brahmin priests reciting their verses and passing them down to students.

mn23:2.14	Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a forked path:	Rig Veda 10.88.15 speaks of the two paths of gods and mortals (_devānām uta martyānām_), later formalized as the path of the forefathers (_pitṛyāna_) leading to rebirth and that of the gods (_devayāna_) leading to liberation. This corresponds to the twofold choice of the young Siddhattha: to stay at home or to go forth.

mn23:2.19	Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a filter of ash:	_Caṅgavāra_ is a filter through which, according to [ja525:29.2](), water drips away like the brief days of our lives. The commentaries say that such alkaline (_khāra_) filters were used by laundrymen. This refers to the traditional method of creating lye (a soap precursor) for washing, where a barrel is filled with wood ash through which water is passed. No matter how many pots of water are poured in, the commentary adds, it keeps dripping.

mn23:2.24	Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a tortoise:	As described in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 7.5.1, a tortoise was placed on the altar to represent the primordial powers of creation: the sap of life, the sun, the breath, and the act of creation itself. Its lower and upper shells and its body in-between correspond to the three worlds: the earth, the heavens, and the midspace. It therefore connotes the ancient, endless movement of life.

mn23:2.28	Dig, clever one, having taken up the sword!’	NA
mn23:2.29	Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a butcher’s knife and chopping board:	In this brutal simile, _asi_ is a knife and _sūna_ is a place where animals are slaughtered, either a slaughterhouse or, as here, an implement for the slaughter. [mnd1:23.18]() says this phrase has the meaning of “chopping” (_adhikuṭṭanaṭṭhena_). Compare with _asiṁ sūnāṁ_ in the violent, sexually graphic hymn at Rig Veda 10.86.18c. Vedic _sūna_ was a (sewn) “basket” for carrying the flesh of a slaughtered beast (see also Rig Veda 1.161.10), a sense that developed to “chopping block” and “slaughterhouse”. Jamison and Brereton read the Vedic passage as an analogy for the horse sacrifice, at the climax of which the queen has vulgar and very public sex with the dead horse. This cements in the most explicit way possible the oneness of sexual potency with the cycle of life and death.

mn23:2.34	Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a scrap of meat:	Another simile shared with [mn22:3.10](). A _maṁsapesi_ is small enough to be grabbed by a crow ([mn54:16.1]()), or to quickly disintegrate on a stove ([an7.74:7.1]()), thus is a “scrap of meat” rather than a substantial piece. It emphasizes the meanness and poverty of mortal life, our desires and attachments bound up with this transient “scrap of meat” we call a body.

mn23:2.36	The brahmin said,	NA

mn23:2.38	Dig, clever one, having picked up the sword!’	NA
mn23:2.39	Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a cobra:	_Nāga_ here means both a cobra—the literal snake that lives underneath an anthill—and the serpent of mysterious power that is analogous to an arahant, the “spiritual giant”.
mn23:2.40	‘A cobra, sir!’	NA
mn23:2.41	The brahmin said,	NA
mn23:2.42	‘Leave the cobra! Do not disturb the cobra! Worship the cobra!’	NA
mn23:2.43	Mendicant, go to the Buddha and ask him about this riddle. You should remember it in line with his answer.	NA
mn23:2.44	I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to this riddle except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them.”	This is, of course, a direct slight on the brahmins who prided themselves on finding explanations for the most obscure and puzzling passages.

mn24:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	The Bamboo Grove was a major monastery near Rājagaha. According to [pli-tv-kd1:22.16.1](), it was offered by King Bimbisāra as the very first monastery dedicated to the Saṅgha.
mn24:2.1	Then several mendicants who had completed the rainy season residence in their native land went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them:	The commentary says _jātibhūmi_ means the Buddha’s native land, but the word occurs at [an6.54](), [pli-tv-pvr14:2.1](), [ja537:26.1](), and [ja546:43.1](), where it always means “one’s native land”. Given that Puṇṇa, the most famous teacher of their land, was unknown by Sāriputta, it seems likely that it was somewhat remote. One of the Chinese parallels (MA 9) describes him as of light skin and prominent nose, a description that might befit someone from the north-west of India.
mn24:2.2	“In your native land, mendicants, which of the native mendicants is esteemed in this way:	NA
mn24:2.3	‘Personally having few wishes, they speak to the mendicants on having few wishes. Personally having contentment, seclusion, aloofness, energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom, they speak to the mendicants on all these things. They’re an adviser and counselor, one who educates, encourages, fires up, and inspires their spiritual companions.’”	NA
mn24:2.4	“Puṇṇa son of Mantāṇī, sir, is esteemed in this way in our native land.”	Although said to be the foremost Dhamma speaker ([an1.196:1.1](), see [sn14.15:2.14]()), few of his teachings are recorded. At [sn22.83](), Ānanda attributes his initial breakthrough to Puṇṇa, while a single verse is attributed to him at [thag1.4](). | Puṇṇa was evidently from the same maternal clan as Aṅgulimāla ([mn86:12.12]()). This name does not seem to occur in Sanskrit texts, but Mahāvastu 3.377 spells it as Maitrāyaṇī, a name shared with the Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā, the oldest ritual text of the Black Yajurveda.

mn24:3.1	Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far from the Buddha.	NA

mn24:5.3	The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk.	NA
mn24:5.4	Then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, Puṇṇa got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Dark Forest for the day’s meditation.	NA
mn24:6.1	Then a certain mendicant went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and said to him,	NA
mn24:6.2	“Reverend Sāriputta, the mendicant named Puṇṇa, of whom you have often spoken so highly, after being inspired by a talk of the Buddha’s, left for the Dark Forest for the day’s meditation.”	NA
mn24:7.1	Sāriputta quickly grabbed his sitting cloth and followed behind Puṇṇa, keeping sight of his head.	While similar actions are found elsewhere, they are not said to be done “quickly” (_taramānarūpo_). Sāriputta’s urgency here reinforces the impression that Puṇṇa lived somewhere distant and visited the central regions only occasionally.
mn24:7.2	Puṇṇa plunged deep into the Dark Forest and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation.	NA
mn24:7.3	And Sāriputta did likewise.	NA
mn24:8.1	Then in the late afternoon, Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Puṇṇa, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn24:8.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Puṇṇa:	The following seven “purifications” became one of the primary textual sources for the commentarial system of “insight knowledges” (_vipassanañāṇa_) that became central to later Theravada meditation. It would be a mistake, however, to interpret this sutta in light of the insight knowledges, which were developed over a thousand years.
mn24:9.1	“Reverend, is our spiritual life lived under the Buddha?”	Puṇṇa was a stranger, so Sāriputta begins by establishing common ground before asking a series of questions to which he expects a negative answer.
mn24:9.2	“Yes, reverend.”	NA
mn24:9.3	“Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of ethics?”	The questions are framed in an unusual paired syntax: _kiṁ nu kho, āvuso_ alternates with _kiṁ panāvuso_.
mn24:9.4	“Certainly not.”	NA
mn24:9.5	“Well, is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of mind?”	“Purification of mind” is the development of absorption to abandon the hindrances ([an4.194:4.1]()).
mn24:9.6	“Certainly not.”	NA
mn24:9.7	“Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of view?”	“Purified view” is the right view of the stream-enterer who has seen the four noble truths ([an4.194:5.1]()) and rejected the fetter of views of a self (_sakkāyadiṭṭhi_). | Likewise, the five items from here down to “knowledge and vision” all refer to stream-entry. This sutta departs from other early presentations in presenting these as a sequence, whereas normally they are different facets of the experience of stream-entry.
mn24:9.8	“Certainly not.”	NA
mn24:9.9	“Well, is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification by traversing doubt?”	Doubt is one of the fetters overcome by the stream-enterer (eg. [mn64:6.4]()), since they have the confidence born of direct experience of the four noble truths. | At [ud5.7]() “purification by traversing doubt” is said to be achieved by the practice of _jhāna_.
mn24:9.10	“Certainly not.”	NA
mn24:9.11	“Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path?”	From their own experience, a stream-enterer knows what leads to the goal and what does not, hence they give up the fetter of “misapprehension of precepts and observances”. | For _maggāmagga_, see the debate between brahmin students at [dn13:3.1](), which shows that this term is not unique to Buddhism. There is, however, no evidence that the sequence of purifications is found outside of Buddhism.
mn24:9.12	“Certainly not.”	NA
mn24:9.13	“Well, is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision of the practice?”	A stream-enterer not only understands what the correct path is, they have actually practiced it ([sn55.5:3.3]()).

mn24:13.1	“If the Buddha had declared purification of ethics to be extinguishment by not grasping, he would have declared that which has fuel for grasping to be extinguishment by not grasping.	Compare the simile of the raft at [mn22:13.1]().

mn24:13.8	But if extinguishment by not grasping was something apart from these things, an ordinary person would become extinguished.	That is to say, the goal is not the same as the path, but it cannot be attained without the path.
mn24:13.9	For an ordinary person lacks these things.	NA
mn24:14.1	Well then, reverend, I shall give you a simile.	NA
mn24:14.2	For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.	NA
mn24:14.3	Suppose that, while staying in Sāvatthī, King Pasenadi of Kosala had some urgent business come up in Sāketa.	NA
mn24:14.4	Now, between Sāvatthī and Sāketa seven chariots were stationed at the ready for him.	_Rathavinīta_, which lends the sutta its title, is explained by the commentary as “seven chariots with horses at the ready”, where _vinīta_ has its usual sense of “trained, readied”. While the series of chariots forms a relay, the word _vinīta_ does not mean “relay”. The term and the simile are unique to this sutta.
mn24:14.5	Then Pasenadi, having departed Sāvatthī, mounted the first chariot at the ready by the gate of the royal compound. The first chariot at the ready would bring him to the second, where he’d dismount and mount the second chariot.	NA

mn24:14.9	The fifth chariot at the ready would bring him to the sixth …	NA
mn24:14.10	The sixth chariot at the ready would bring him to the seventh, where he’d dismount and mount the seventh chariot.	NA
mn24:14.11	The seventh chariot at the ready would bring him to the gate of the royal compound of Sāketa.	NA
mn24:14.12	And when he was at the gate, friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would ask him:	NA
mn24:14.13	‘Great king, did you come to Sāketa from Sāvatthī by this chariot at the ready?’	NA
mn24:14.14	If asked this, how should King Pasenadi rightly reply?”	NA
mn24:14.15	“The king should reply:	NA
mn24:14.16	‘Well, while staying in Sāvatthī, I had some urgent business come up in Sāketa.	NA
mn24:14.17	Now, between Sāvatthī and Sāketa seven chariots were stationed at the ready for me.	NA

mn24:14.26	That’s how King Pasenadi should rightly reply.”	NA
mn24:15.1	“In the same way, reverend, purification of ethics is only for the sake of purification of mind. Purification of mind is only for the sake of purification of view. Purification of view is only for the sake of purification by traversing doubt. Purification by traversing doubt is only for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path. Purification of knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path is only for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision of the practice. Purification of knowledge and vision of the practice is only for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision. Purification of knowledge and vision is only for the sake of extinguishment by not grasping.	NA
mn24:15.2	The spiritual life is lived under the Buddha for the sake of extinguishment by not grasping.”	NA
mn24:16.1	When he said this, Sāriputta said to Puṇṇa,	NA
mn24:16.2	“What is the venerable’s name? And how are you known among your spiritual companions?”	NA
mn24:16.3	“Reverend, my name is Puṇṇa.	NA
mn24:16.4	And I am known as ‘son of Mantāṇī’ among my spiritual companions.”	NA
mn24:16.5	“It’s incredible, reverend, it’s amazing!	NA
mn24:16.6	Venerable Puṇṇa son of Mantāṇī has answered each deep question point by point, as a learned disciple who rightly understands the teacher’s instructions.	NA
mn24:16.7	It is fortunate for his spiritual companions, so very fortunate,	NA
mn24:16.8	that they get to see Venerable Puṇṇa son of Mantāṇī and pay homage to him.	NA
mn24:16.9	Even if they only got to see him and pay respects to him by carrying him around on their heads on a roll of cloth, it would still be very fortunate for them! And it’s fortunate for me, so very fortunate, that I get to see the venerable and pay homage to him.”	“A roll of cloth” (_celaṇḍuka_) is a unique term, and these are unique words of praise.
mn24:17.1	When he said this, Puṇṇa said to Sāriputta,	NA
mn24:17.2	“What is the venerable’s name? And how are you known among your spiritual companions?”	NA
mn24:17.3	“Reverend, my name is Upatissa.	NA
mn24:17.4	And I am known as Sāriputta among my spiritual companions.”	NA
mn24:17.5	“Goodness! I had no idea I was consulting with *the* Venerable Sāriputta, the disciple who is fit to be compared with the Teacher himself!	“Fit to be compared with the Teacher” (_satthukappa_) is another term that is unique in early Pali.
mn24:17.6	NA	NA
mn24:17.7	If I’d known, I would not have said so much.	NA
mn24:17.8	It’s incredible, reverend, it’s amazing!	NA
mn24:17.9	Venerable Sāriputta has asked each deep question point by point, as a learned disciple who rightly understands the teacher’s instructions.	“Point by point” (_anumassa anumassa_), found several times above, is yet another phrasing unique to this sutta. | This sutta has several features that, taken together, indicate that it is later than the bulk of the four nikāyas: many unique phrases; the hints that Puṇṇa is from a distant land; and most of all, the doctrine. The text here takes the set of four purifications at [an4.194]() and expands “view” into five to make the seven of the current sutta. Now, AN 4.194 lacks any mention of where the Buddha was at the time and hence was likely taught by Ānanda after the Buddha’s death. Then the set is expanded to nine (plus wisdom and freedom) at [dn34:2.2.6](), one of the latest suttas in the nikāyas. Most importantly, the five items pertaining to stream-entry are presented here as a linear sequence, anticipating the detailed analysis of stages of insight in later Theravada. Thus not only are the associated suttas late, this sutta is developed further than them.
mn24:17.10	It is fortunate for his spiritual companions, so very fortunate,	NA
mn24:17.11	that they get to see Venerable Sāriputta and pay homage to him.	NA
mn24:17.12	Even if they only got to see him and pay respects to him by carrying him around on their heads on a roll of cloth, it would still be very fortunate for them! And it’s fortunate for me, so very fortunate, that I get to see the venerable and pay homage to him.”	NA
mn24:17.13	And so these two spiritual giants agreed with each others’ fine words.	See [mn5:33.4]().

mn25:0.2	Sowing	NA
mn25:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn25:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn25:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn25:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn25:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn25:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn25:2.1	“Mendicants, a sower does not sow seed for deer thinking,	“Sower sows seed” renders the triplicated expression _nevāpiko nivāpaṁ nivapati_. The root sense of _vap_ is to “cast down” or “sow” seed; it is also used of offerings for the ancestors in the _śrāddha_ ceremony. It is tempting to translate this phrase as a “trapper” who lays “bait”. But the aim of the “sower” is simply to grow a crop, and to do this they need to keep the deer out. That is the guile of the story: they appear harmless. | For an amicable solution to this problem, see the conclusion to the Rurumigarāja Jātaka ([ja482]()) | _Migajāta_ (“deer”) might be better translated as “wild animals” here.
mn25:2.2	‘May the deer, enjoying this seed, be long-lived and beautiful. May they live long and prosper!’	NA
mn25:2.3	A sower sows seed for deer thinking,	NA
mn25:2.4	‘When these deer encroach on where I sow the seed, they’ll recklessly enjoy eating it. They’ll become indulgent, then they’ll become negligent, and then I’ll be able to do what I want with them on account of this seed.’	NA
mn25:3.1	And indeed, the first herd of deer encroached on where the sower sowed the seed and recklessly enjoyed eating it. They became indulgent, then they became negligent, and then the sower was able to do what he wanted with them on account of that seed.	NA
mn25:3.2	And that’s how the first herd of deer failed to get free from the sower’s power.	NA
mn25:4.1	So then a second herd of deer thought up a plan,	NA
mn25:4.2	‘The first herd of deer became indulgent …	NA
mn25:4.3	NA	NA
mn25:4.4	and failed to get free of the sower’s power.	NA
mn25:4.5	Why don’t we refrain from eating the seed altogether? Avoiding dangerous food, we can venture deep into a wilderness region and live there.’	NA
mn25:4.6	And that’s just what they did.	NA
mn25:4.7	But when it came to the last month of summer, the grass and water ran out. Their bodies became much too thin,	NA
mn25:4.8	and they lost their strength and energy.	NA

mn25:5.20	‘Wow, this third herd of deer is so sneaky and devious, they must be some kind of strange spirits with magical abilities!	The repeated _nāma_ is strongly emphatic. | _Parajana_ sometimes means “stranger” ([mil6.3.1:13.2]()), but the commentary here glosses it as _yakkha_, and a _yakkha_ named Parajana makes an appearance in ([mn31:21.1]()). Presumably it has a sense not dissimilar to _amanussa_, “non-human”. Compare the _itarajanā_ of Atharvaveda Saṁhita 8.10.28a.
mn25:5.21	For they eat the seed we’ve sown without us knowing how they come and go.	NA
mn25:5.22	Why don’t we surround the seed on all sides by staking out high nets? Hopefully we might get to see the lair where they go to hide out.’	_Vākarā_ (variant _vāgurā_, which is also the Sanskrit form) is a net or snare, which here is staked out on sticks. The deer would have to leap over it, revealing their position. | _Gāha_ here is from _√gāh_ (“deep place, hidey-hole”) rather than _√gah_ (“take”).
mn25:5.23	And that’s just what they did.	NA

When Jamāli failed to answer, Mahāvīra stepped in, explaining that both the soul and the world are in one sense eternal since they last forever, but in another sense they are transient since they go through different phases. | The word _loka_ occurs in a number of senses, but here it refers to the entire “cosmos” of countless worlds.

mn25:13.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn25:13.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	NA
mn25:14.1	Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA

mn25:20.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end.	The “cessation of perception and feeling” (_saññāvedayitanirodha_) is a culminating meditation state of supreme subtlety that often leads directly to awakening (but see [an5.166]()). The state itself, like all meditation states, is temporary, but afterwards the defilements can be eliminated forever. This liberating insight is the consequence of the balanced development of all eight factors of the path.
mn25:20.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra, put out his eyes without a trace, and gone where the Wicked One cannot see. And they’ve crossed over clinging to the world.”	NA
mn25:20.3	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn25:20.4	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn26:0.1	Middle Discourses 26	NA
mn26:0.2	The Noble Quest	NA
mn26:1.1	So I have heard.	This discourse is known in Pali manuscripts and commentaries either as “The Noble Quest” or “The Pile of Snares”, whereas the Chinese parallel at MA 204 is titled “The Discourse at Rāma’s Hermitage”. It is one of several discourses in the Majjhima that include a partial account of Siddhattha’s practice before awakening, an account that became one of the key events in the Buddha’s biography. This particular version focuses on his experience with Brahmanical teachers, while [mn36](), [mn85](), and [mn100]() include a long passage detailing his Jain-like fervent austerities.
mn26:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn26:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	NA
mn26:2.2	Then several mendicants went up to Venerable Ānanda and said to him,	NA
mn26:2.3	“Reverend, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.	Why was the Buddha reluctant to teach? This is puzzling because where we find this trope elsewhere there is a clear reason: at [an7.52:1.3]() the Buddha was making one of his rare visits to Campā, while at [sn22.81:3.5]() he had left the squabbling Sangha for the seclusion of the forest. Here, in the central teaching location of Sāvatthī, there is no such reason. Rather, the events are best understood as narrative foreshadowing. His reluctance requires an intervention by others, and when the teaching finally takes place it is not in a Buddhist monastery but on Brahmanical grounds. The story goes on to tell how, after his awakening, he was reluctant to teach until the intervention of Brahmā ([mn26:19.1]()). This narrative mirroring creates a hidden link (_sandhi_) that frames the awakening in a Brahmanical context. The very obscurity of the connection is the point, for “the gods love hidden things”. The theme of reluctance is extended further to the reluctance of the five mendicants to receive the Buddha. It draws on the precedent of Yājñavalkya’s reluctance to teach Janaka (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.1).
mn26:2.4	It would be good if we got to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.”	NA
mn26:2.5	“Well then, reverends, go to the brahmin Rammaka’s hermitage.	Rammaka appears only here, and the commentary offers no information. His name presumably signifies that he was a follower of the teacher Rāma who appears below. This complements [an3.126:3.3](), where the Buddha stays in the hermitage of Bharaṇḍu the Kālāma, who was apparently a student of Āḷāra Kālāma.
mn26:2.6	Hopefully you’ll get to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.”	NA
mn26:2.7	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.	NA
mn26:3.1	Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, the Buddha addressed Ānanda,	The narrative sequence from the Buddha returning from alms round to coming out from his bath is also found at [an6.43:1.3](). There, there is a clear justification for the story, as the discourse concerns a royal elephant parade seen after bathing. Here, once more, the purpose is implicit: a brahmanical student must bathe before any ritual.
mn26:3.2	“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery for the day’s meditation.”	After the Jetavana, this was the best-known monastery in Sāvatthī. It was offered by the lady Visākhā, known as Migāra’s mother.
mn26:3.3	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
mn26:3.4	So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the Eastern Monastery for the day’s meditation.	NA
mn26:3.5	In the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed Ānanda,	NA
mn26:3.6	“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the eastern gate to bathe.”	NA
mn26:3.7	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
mn26:3.8	So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the eastern gate to bathe.	NA
mn26:3.9	When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying his limbs.	NA
mn26:3.10	Then Ānanda said to the Buddha,	NA
mn26:3.11	“Sir, the hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka is nearby.	NA
mn26:3.12	It’s so delightful,	NA
mn26:3.13	so lovely.	NA
mn26:3.14	Please visit it out of sympathy.”	NA
mn26:3.15	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
mn26:4.1	He went to the brahmin Rammaka’s hermitage.	NA
mn26:4.2	Now at that time several mendicants were sitting together in the hermitage talking about the teaching.	Here (and at [mn92:4.1]()) a “hermitage” (_assama_, “ashram”) is a sizable building suitable for gatherings, whereas at [sn11.9:1.4]() it is a gated compound with leaf huts. It is normally used for Brahmanical places.
mn26:4.3	The Buddha stood outside the door waiting for the talk to end.	NA
mn26:4.4	When he knew the talk had ended he cleared his throat and knocked on the door-panel.	As at [an9.4:1.4]().
mn26:4.5	The mendicants opened the door for the Buddha,	NA
mn26:4.6	and he entered the hermitage, where he sat on the seat spread out	NA
mn26:4.7	and addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn26:4.8	“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	NA
mn26:4.9	“Sir, our unfinished discussion on the teaching was about the Buddha himself when the Buddha arrived.”	NA
mn26:4.10	“Good, mendicants!	NA
mn26:4.11	It’s appropriate for gentlemen like you, who have gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, to sit together and talk about the teaching.	NA
mn26:4.12	When you’re sitting together you should do one of two things:	NA
mn26:4.13	discuss the teachings or keep noble silence.	“Noble silence” is narrowly defined as the second absorption ([sn21.1]()).
mn26:5.1	Mendicants, there are these two quests:	The Buddha picks up from the fact that the mendicants were talking about him, but continues in a depersonalized manner. | The substance of this passage is taught more briefly at [an4.255]().
mn26:5.2	the noble quest and the ignoble quest.	These opposing quests (or “searches”, _pariyesanā_) respond to Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.22, which we have already noted as a source for the phrase _so attā so loko_ ([mn22:15.10]()). It says that the wise ones of old, renouncing the search for sons, for wealth, and for the heavenly worlds, lived the mendicant’s life (_putraiṣaṇāyāśca vittaiṣaṇāyāśca lokaiṣaṇāyāśca vyutthāyātha bhikśācaryaṁ caranti_). The inner self sought by the brahmins is described as unborn, made of consciousness, undecaying, unattached, and unaffected by karma; knowing it one becomes a sage.
mn26:5.3	And what is the ignoble quest?	NA
mn26:5.4	It’s when someone who is themselves liable to be reborn seeks what is also liable to be reborn. Themselves liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, they seek what is also liable to these things.	NA
mn26:6.1	And what should be described as liable to be reborn?	The Pali includes “gold and money” among those things subject to birth, old age, and defilement. The Chinese parallel MA 204 (T i 776a7; cf. T 765 at T xvii 679b23) does not mention “birth” but says money and jewelry are subject to old age, defilement, etc. Elsewhere in the suttas, rebirth, old age, and defilement are qualities of sentient beings, not inanimate objects, so this might be a textual corruption. Nonetheless, the commentary offers explanations for why gold and money are included under these specific categories and not the rest, and this, together with the Chinese text, shows that if it is a corruption it is an old one. I give the commentarial explanations.
mn26:6.2	Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants and cattle, and gold and currency are liable to be reborn.	Gold and money are subject to “birth” because they are produced by heat (_utusamuṭṭhāna_). | The word for “gold” here, one of several in Pali, is _jātarūpa_, literally “born form”, i.e. that which is naturally beautiful. In Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.25, a newborn infant  is to be fed mixed curd, honey, and ghee with a piece of _jātarūpa_, thus placing “golden” Vedic speech in him. This rare early instance of _jātarūpa_ shows that it had a felt connection with the idea of birth. Perhaps this connection prompted its inclusion here. From that, “money” (_rajata_) was brought in as the two form a stock phrase, and they were then applied elsewhere in the list.
mn26:6.3	These attachments are liable to be reborn.	NA
mn26:6.4	Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to being reborn, seeks what is also liable to be reborn.	NA
mn26:7.1	And what should be described as liable to grow old?	NA
mn26:7.2	Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants and cattle, and gold and currency are liable to grow old.	Gold and money grow old due to rust or grime.
mn26:7.3	These attachments are liable to grow old.	NA
mn26:7.4	Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to grow old, seeks what is also liable to grow old.	NA
mn26:8.1	And what should be described as liable to fall sick?	NA
mn26:8.2	Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and elephants and cattle are liable to fall sick.	NA
mn26:8.3	These attachments are liable to fall sick.	NA

mn26:11.2	Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants and cattle, and gold and currency are liable to corruption.	Gold and money are liable to corruption by iron, etc.
mn26:11.3	These attachments are liable to corruption.	NA
mn26:11.4	Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to corruption, seeks what is also liable to corruption.	NA
mn26:11.5	This is the ignoble quest.	NA
mn26:12.1	And what is the noble quest?	NA
mn26:12.2	It’s when someone who is themselves liable to be reborn, understanding the drawbacks in being liable to be reborn, seeks that which is free of rebirth, the supreme sanctuary from the yoke, extinguishment. Themselves liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, understanding the drawbacks in these things, they seek that which is free of old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and corruption, the supreme sanctuary from the yoke, extinguishment.	As pointed out by K.R. Norman in his *Mistaken Ideas About Nibbāna* (1994), the epithets _ajātaṁ_ (etc.) don’t mean that Nibbāna is “unborn”, but rather that in Nibbāna there is no rebirth. Likewise, _amata_ does not mean “immortal” or “deathless” but “freedom from death”.
mn26:12.3	This is the noble quest.	NA
mn26:13.1	Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too, being liable to be reborn, sought what is also liable to be reborn. Myself liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, I sought what is also liable to these things.	NA
mn26:13.2	Then it occurred to me:	NA
mn26:13.3	‘Why do I, being liable to be reborn, grow old, fall sick, sorrow, die, and become corrupted, seek things that have the same nature?	NA
mn26:13.4	Why don’t I seek that which is free of rebirth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and corruption, the supreme sanctuary from the yoke, extinguishment?’	NA
mn26:14.1	Some time later, while still with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.	This contrasts with the legend that he slipped away in the dead of night.
mn26:15.1	Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	“To discover what is skillful” (_kiṅkusalagavesī_) might also be translated, “seeking to answer the question, ‘what is good?’.” At this point he did not know the path so he sought an answer from the best teachers of his day. | At [mn102:25.1](), the “supreme state of sublime peace” (_santivarapada_) is said to be “liberation without grasping” (_anupādāvimokkha_). | Āḷāra Kālāma was a senior teacher in the contemplative and renunciate tradition of the Upaniṣads. His meditative prowess is praised by his student Pukkusa the Mallian at [dn16:4.26.1](), but is seen to be inferior to the Buddha’s. At [an3.126:6.2]() an apparent former student of Āḷāra advocates that teachers who teach full understanding of different things are nonetheless leading to the same goal. Thus, in line with Upaniṣadic philosophy, Āḷāra saw the apparent diversity of phenomena as partial manifestations of the immanent cosmic divinity. Āḷāra is usually understood to be named after his people, the Kālāmas. But it is possible we should accept the variant Kālāpa, indicating that he follows the Black Yajurveda.
mn26:15.2	‘Reverend Kālāma, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’	Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.4.1 sets out the initiation (_upanayana_) into “spiritual life” (_brahmacarya_) according to Yājñavalkya. The student says, “I have come for _brahmacarya_” or “Let me be a _brahmacāri_”. The teacher responds by asking, “What is your name” (_ko nāmāsīti_). The same phrase is used in the Buddhist ordination procedure (_kiṁnāmosi_, [pli-tv-kd1:76.1.15]()). But whereas in Buddhism this is merely a personal identification, for the brahmins this naming signifies a mystical identity with the creator Prajāpati, who is _ka_.
mn26:15.3	Āḷāra Kālāma replied,	NA
mn26:15.4	‘Stay, venerable.	Āḷāra Kālāma calls his student _āyasmā_ (Sanskrit _āyuṣmant_), an honorific that in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa is reserved for the god Agni (13.8.4.8–9). By this he indicates the student’s divine status. | Compare with the first phrase used by the Buddha to ordain his students, “Come, mendicant” (_ehi bhikkhu_, [pli-tv-kd1:6.32.3]()).
mn26:15.5	This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’	“Their own tradition” (_sakaṁ ācariyakaṁ_), literally “what belongs to their own teacher” (_ācariya_, Sanskrit _ācarya_). In the Brahmanical initiation, having accepted the student, the brahmin takes him by the hand and says, “Agni is your teacher, I am your teacher” (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.4.2). This claims both the universal authority of the divine lineage as well as the personal lineage of that teacher. | “Their own insight” (_sayaṁ abhiññā_); Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa repeatedly emphasizes that the benefits of initiation are for “one who knows this” (_ya evaṁ veda_, 11.5.4.2, etc.).
mn26:15.6	I quickly memorized that teaching.	The text does not specify the scripture that he learned, but it must have been Brahmanical, for they were the only scriptures known. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.4.13 instructs the new student to first learn the Sāvitrī, specifying the version in Gāyatrī metre (see also Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.14). The Buddha refers to this as the foremost verse ([mn92:26.2]()), and he even specifies the Gāyatrī version ([snp3.4:7.3]()). Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.7 goes on to encourage the student in daily recitation of the four Vedas and ancillary literature.
mn26:15.7	As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.	“I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine” (_ñāṇavādañca vadāmi theravādañca_). Taken together, the sense is that his personal understanding agreed with tradition. A less literal translation might be, “I spoke with knowledge and authority.” | For _ñāṇavāda_, compare such passages as [snp4.3:2.4](), “as you know, so you speak” (_yathā hi jāneyya tathā vadeyya_). In the Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads, knowledge refers to the hidden connections between the Vedas and the world which reveal the divinity immanent in all things. | _Thera_ (Sanskrit _sthavira_) has the senses “steady, strong” (so commentary’s _thirabhāva_) as well as “elder”, for which see Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 26.2.5, where Jātūkarṇya, a teacher of old, is called _sthavira_. I take it to mean the “lasting doctrine of the ancients”. This is the oldest use of the word _theravāda_, long before it was applied to a Buddhist school.
mn26:15.8	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn26:15.9	‘It is not solely by mere faith that Āḷāra Kālāma declares: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”	“Faith” (or “trust”, _saddhā_, Sanskrit _śraddhā_) was regarded as a quality of the “heart” through which one gained remuneration in the form of fees for priestly services (Rig Veda 10.151.4, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.9.21). It is like the “trust” that one would place in a bank: an investment is made in expectation of a reward. | For the syntax here, compare with _kevalaṁ vassagaṇanamattena_ at [an7.43:5.6]().
mn26:15.10	Surely he meditates knowing and seeing this teaching.’	NA
mn26:15.11	So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	NA
mn26:15.12	‘Reverend Kālāma, to what extent do you say you’ve realized this teaching with your own insight?’	NA
mn26:15.13	When I said this, he declared the dimension of nothingness.	This is said to be the best of the four perceptions at ([an10.29:18.1]()). Buddhist texts portray this as a favorite meditation among brahmin contemplatives (eg. [snp5.15:2.1](), [snp5.7:2.1]()). While one might expect that the brahmins would identify their goal in a positive sense, this is not always the case. A text of the Black Yajurveda, Kaṭha Upaniṣad 1.3.11, says that beyond the great Soul, beyond the unmanifest, beyond the Person, is nothing: and that is the ultimate goal (_puruśān na paraṃ kiṃcit_). See too Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.12.1, which illustrate how divinity is too subtle for normal perception. The teacher, breaking the kernel of a seed, asked the student, ““What do you see there?’ ‘Nothing’” (_kimatra paśyasīti, na kiṁcana_). Compare the description of this state at [snp5.15:2.4](), “one sees nothing at all” (_natthi kiñcīti passato_). This is also similar to the teaching of Uddaka ([mn26:16.1]()).
mn26:15.14	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn26:15.15	‘It’s not just Āḷāra Kālāma who has faith,	The Buddha called these the five “faculties” ([sn48.10]()) or “powers” ([an5.14]()). All except “immersion” (_samādhi_) are frequently mentioned in pre-Buddhist texts, but not as a set of five.
mn26:15.16	energy,	NA
mn26:15.17	mindfulness,	NA
mn26:15.18	immersion,	NA
mn26:15.19	and wisdom; I too have these things.	NA
mn26:15.20	Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Āḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insight?’	NA
mn26:15.21	I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.	This phrasing echoes part of the description of arahantship ([mn85:51.12]()).
mn26:15.22	So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	NA
mn26:15.23	‘Reverend Kālāma, is it up to this point that you realized this teaching with your own insight, and declare having achieved it?’	Having achieved that state, Āḷāra Kālāma “declares” (_pavedeti_) it as the teacher, while the Bodhisatta “dwells” in it (_viharati_).
mn26:15.24	‘I have, reverend.’	NA
mn26:15.25	‘I too, reverend, have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’	NA
mn26:15.26	‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate	NA
mn26:15.27	to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!	NA
mn26:15.28	So the teaching that I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it.	NA
mn26:15.29	The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it, I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it.	NA
mn26:15.30	So the teaching that I know, you know, and the teaching that you know, I know.	Almost exactly the same words were spoken by Pokkharasāti to his student Ambaṭṭha ([dn3:1.3.2]()). This connects Pokkharasāti with Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta, suggesting that the uplifting of a talented student in this way was a regular practice of wise brahmins.
mn26:15.31	I am like you and you are like me.	NA
mn26:15.32	Come now, reverend! We should both lead this community together.’	This invitation shows his grace and humility.
mn26:15.33	And that is how my tutor Āḷāra Kālāma placed me, his pupil, on the same position as him, and honored me with lofty praise.	NA
mn26:15.34	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn26:15.35	‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingness.’	It does not fulfill the requirements of the “noble quest”. | Compare the pre-Buddhist meditation practice of Govinda ([dn19:50.9]()), Mātaṅga ([snp1.7:27.6]()), and Maghadeva ([mn83:21.7]()), which in all cases “leads to rebirth in the Brahmā realm” (_brahmalokūpapattiyā_). Kaṭha Upaniṣad 1.3.16, concluding the ancient portion of this text, says that the wise man attains glory in the world of divinity (_medhāvī brahmaloke mahīyate_).
mn26:15.36	Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.	NA
mn26:16.1	I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	Uddaka’s teachings are cited at [sn35.103:1.1]() and [dn29:16.13](). In the former, his obscure verse assumes the identity of “this” (the impersonal cosmic divinity) with himself, while the latter is a distorted reference to Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.4.7. Further, [an10.29:20.1]() implies that he taught the “ultimate purity of the spirit”. While “spirit” (_yakkha_, Sanskrit _yakṣa_) is normally a worldly deity, it is identified with the ultimate Brahman at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.4.1 and Kena Upaniṣad 4.1. Uddaka is apparently the “ascetic Rāmaputta” who was revered by the king, criticized by some brahmins, but defended by Todeyya, a leading brahmin of Kosala often mentioned along with Pokkharasāti ([an4.187:4.2]()).
mn26:16.2	‘Reverend, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’	In contrast with Āḷāra Kālāma, here the name is omitted.
mn26:16.3	Uddaka replied,	NA
mn26:16.4	‘Stay, venerable.	NA
mn26:16.5	This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’	NA
mn26:16.6	I quickly memorized that teaching.	NA
mn26:16.7	As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.	NA
mn26:16.8	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn26:16.9	‘It is not solely by mere faith that Rāma declared: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”	The text shifts from Rāmaputta to just Rāma, while at the same time shifting to the past tense. Uddaka was thus the (spiritual and/or biological) “son of Rāma”. This detail is preserved reliably in the different versions of the text. It seems that Rāmaputta had not personally attained the meditation he was teaching. This would also explain why, just a little below, he invites the Bodhisatta to lead the community  rather than to share leadership like Āḷāra Kālāma ([mn36:16.32]()). [sn35.103:1.6]() shows that he did, however, make claims to being spiritually attained.
mn26:16.10	Surely he meditated knowing and seeing this teaching.’	NA
mn26:16.11	So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	NA
mn26:16.12	‘Reverend, to what extent did Rāma say he’d realized this teaching with his own insight?’	NA
mn26:16.13	When I said this, Uddaka son of Rāma declared the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	In Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12 and 4.5.13, the sage Yājñavalkya says that the true Self is a sheer mass of “consciousness” (_vijñāna_, Pali _viññāṇa_), which is “great, endless, infinite reality”. After realizing this, he says, there is no “perception” (_saṁjñā_, Pali _saññā_). This passage seems to have sparked the conversation at [dn9:6.4](), where the Buddha goes on to speak of meditative training to refine perception. Notably, there he mentions all the _jhānas_ and formless attainments *except* the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, which is beyond the topic of perception under discussion. This meditative state may be related to the state with “no perception” spoken of by Yājñavalkya. However, it is not possible to literally identify such subtle meditative states on such slender evidence. The point is simply that the contemplative brahmins of the Upaniṣadic tradition of Yājñavalkya did indeed describe their highest state in terms of perception.
mn26:16.14	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn26:16.15	‘It’s not just Rāma who had faith,	NA
mn26:16.16	energy,	NA
mn26:16.17	mindfulness,	NA
mn26:16.18	immersion,	NA
mn26:16.19	and wisdom; I too have these things.	NA
mn26:16.20	Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Rāma said he had realized with his own insight?’	NA
mn26:16.21	I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.	NA
mn26:16.22	So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	NA
mn26:16.23	‘Reverend, had Rāma realized this teaching with his own insight up to this point, and declared having achieved it?’	NA
mn26:16.24	‘He had, reverend.’	NA
mn26:16.25	‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’	NA
mn26:16.26	‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate	NA
mn26:16.27	to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!	NA
mn26:16.28	So the teaching that Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it.	NA
mn26:16.29	The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it, Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it.	NA
mn26:16.30	So the teaching that Rāma directly knew, you know, and the teaching you know, Rāma directly knew.	NA
mn26:16.31	Rāma was like you and you are like Rāma.	NA
mn26:16.32	Come now, reverend! You should lead this community.’	NA
mn26:16.33	And that is how my spiritual companion Uddaka son of Rāma placed me in the position of a tutor and honored me with lofty praise.	An _ācariya_ is special teacher who has a close, ongoing relationship with a student, signified by the fact that the student of an _ācāriya_ is called an _antevāsī_, literally “one who lives within” the teacher’s home. This passage confirms that this usage carries over from the Brahmanical tradition, where it is a common term in the same sense. Thus Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.1.2 speaks of “mother, father, and teacher”, while Chāndogya Upaniṣad 2.23.1 enjoins a student to “live with the teacher until death”, and at 4.9.1 ff. we see the journey of a student to their teacher’s house, where he is looked after by the teacher and his wife. The same sense prevails throughout the suttas and Vinaya, so I translate as “tutor” to identify a close personal teacher.
mn26:16.34	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn26:16.35	‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’	NA
mn26:16.36	Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.	NA
mn26:17.1	I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands, I arrived at the town of Senā in Uruvelā.	In modern times this is the pilgrimage site Bodhgaya in the Gaya district of Bihar. It lies by a wide river that is dry in summer but abundant in the rains. Today it is named Līlajan and in Pali Nerañjarā, although that name is not mentioned in this passage. Uruvelā, which aptly means “Broadbanks”, was a locality centered around the market town of Senānigama (“Marshalltown”). There was also a sizable hermitage nearby with matted-hair Brahmanical ascetics (_jaṭilā_) who ritually bathed in the water ([pli-tv-kd1:20.15.1]()). After teaching the five monks in Varanasi, the Buddha returned here to teach them, but there is no record of him visiting subsequently.
mn26:17.2	There I saw a delightful park, a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby was a village to resort to for alms.	The Buddha’s rejection of sensual pleasures does not preclude his appreciation of nature’s beauty. | The local alms villages in Uruvelā are named in Mahāvastu 2.207 as Praskandaka, Balākalpa, Ujjaṁgala, and Jaṁgala.
mn26:17.3	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn26:17.4	‘This park is truly delightful, a lovely grove with a flowing river that’s clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby there’s a village to resort to for alms.	NA
mn26:17.5	This is good enough for striving for a gentleman wanting to strive.’	_Padhāna_ means to “strive”. It is frequently used in the sense of applying oneself to meditation, but here it leads into the painful “striving” of fervent austerity ([mn36:20.7]()).
mn26:17.6	So I sat down right there, thinking,	NA
mn26:17.7	‘This is good enough for striving.’	NA
mn26:18.1	And so, being myself liable to be reborn, understanding the drawbacks in being liable to be reborn, I sought that which is free of rebirth, the supreme sanctuary from the yoke, extinguishment—and I found it. Being myself liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, understanding the drawbacks in these things, I sought that which is free of old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and corruption, the supreme sanctuary from the yoke, extinguishment—and I found it.	While this skips directly from his arrival in Uruvelā to his awakening, other texts describe his practice of fervent austerities here, which must have taken a considerable time ([mn36:16.7](), [mn85:15.1]()). See note on [mn26:18.1]().
mn26:18.2	Knowledge and vision arose in me:	NA
mn26:18.3	‘My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.’	This is the realization of arahantship. Elsewhere the Buddha goes into more detail as to the process of meditation that led to this point.
mn26:19.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn26:19.2	‘This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute.	A similar account is told of Gotama Buddha at [sn6.1:1.4](), [mn85:43.2](), and [pli-tv-kd1:5.2.2](), and of Vipassī at [dn14:3.1.4]().
mn26:19.3	But people like clinging, they love it and enjoy it.	NA
mn26:19.4	It’s hard for them to see this topic; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination.	The Buddha identifies the two most difficult topics in his philosophy: dependent origination and Nibbana.
mn26:19.5	It’s also hard for them to see this topic; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.	NA
mn26:19.6	And if I were to teach this principle, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.’	Up to this point, the Bodhisatta has been solely concerned with finding the answer to his quest, and only now does he think of sharing it with others. The idea that he had made an aspiration for Buddhahood in the long ago past out of a desire to help all sentient beings is not supported in early texts.
mn26:19.7	And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me:	NA
mn26:19.8	‘I’ve struggled hard to realize this,	NA
mn26:19.9	enough with trying to explain it!	NA
mn26:19.10	Those mired in greed and hate	NA
mn26:19.11	can’t really understand this teaching.	NA
mn26:19.12	It goes against the stream, subtle,	NA
mn26:19.13	deep, obscure, and very fine.	NA
mn26:19.14	Those besotted by greed cannot see,	NA
mn26:19.15	for they’re shrouded in a mass of darkness.’	NA
mn26:19.16	So, as I reflected like this, my mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.	Had he followed this inclination he would have been a _paccekabuddha_, a Buddha “awakened for himself”.
mn26:20.1	Then the divinity Sahampati, knowing my train of thought, thought,	While Sahampati features prominently in the suttas, no deity of that name is found in early Brahmanical texts. He seems, however, to be the Buddhist version of Brahmā Svayambhū, the “Self-born Divinity”, to whom Yājñavalkya traces the authority of his teaching lineage (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.6.3, 4.5.3, 6.5.4). Yājñavalkya identifies this “self-born” with the sun (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.9.3.16; see also Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 4.6.6) and with Prajāpati (13.5.3.1). Explaining the origin of the soma rite of the “All-Sacrifice”, he says that Brahmā Svayambhū, while performing fervent austerities, decided to offer his self to all creatures and all creatures to his self, thus establishing lordship (_adhipatya_) over all creatures (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13.7.1.1). The root _pati_ (“lord”) here establishes a linguistic link with _sahampati_. Further, in the earliest use of _svayambhū_ at Rig Veda 10.83.4, the “self-born” deity Manyu “prevails” (_sahuriḥ sahāvān_) in battle. Thus we can identify Sahampati, the “Lord Who Prevails”, with the highest divinity recognized by Yājñavalkya, who originated as victor in battle, whose physical manifestation is the sun, whose spiritual function is to imbue all creatures with divinity, and who serves as the ultimate source of authority. Meanwhile, the epithet _sayambhū_ was taken for the Buddha ([pli-tv-kd11:35.1.37]()).
mn26:20.2	‘Oh lord! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.’	Having surpassed the greatest of the Brahmanical contemplatives, the Buddha’s achievement is recognized by the chief Brahmanical divinity.
mn26:20.3	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared in front of me.	NA
mn26:20.4	He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward me, and said,	NA
mn26:20.5	‘Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma!	NA
mn26:20.6	There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching.	NA
mn26:20.7	There will be those who understand the teaching!’	Sahampati is the one who recognizes the potential in all beings, since it was he who imbued them with divinity. He did this to ensure dominance, but now his motive has transformed into compassion.
mn26:20.8	That’s what the divinity Sahampati said.	NA
mn26:20.9	Then he went on to say:	NA
mn26:20.10	‘Among the Magadhans there appeared in the past	NA
mn26:20.11	an impure teaching thought up by the stained.	The “impure teaching” was, according to the commentary, that of the six ascetic teachers, who are regularly associated with Magadha (eg. [sn2.30](), [snp3.6](), [dn2]()). Less likely it refers to Brahmanical teachers like Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta, who are more closely associated with Kosala and whose system is regarded as passed down rather than “thought up”.
mn26:20.12	Fling open the door to freedom from death!	“Freedom from death” (_amata_, Sanskrit _amṛta_) is yet another Brahmanical term transformed by the Buddha. Its Vedic meaning was “immortality”, and hence the “ambrosia” of soma through which immortality was gained. For the Buddha, as seen in the “noble quest” itself, it was the freedom from the cycles of birth, aging, and death.
mn26:20.13	Let them hear the teaching <j>the immaculate one discovered.	NA
mn26:20.14	Standing high on a rocky mountain,	NA
mn26:20.15	you can see the people all around.	NA
mn26:20.16	In just the same way, All-seer, so intelligent,	NA
mn26:20.17	having ascended the Temple of Truth,	NA
mn26:20.18	rid of sorrow, look upon the people	NA
mn26:20.19	swamped with sorrow,  <j>oppressed by rebirth and old age.	NA
mn26:20.20	Rise, hero! Victor in battle, caravan leader,	Here we see a verbal echo of Sahampati’s martial origins.
mn26:20.21	wander the world cleared of debt.	A “caravan leader” (_satthavāha_) guides their flock through treacherous deserts and wastelands, as illustrated at [dn23:23.3](). | _Anaṇa_ (“debtless”) is a technical term in the Vedic system. According to Manu 6.35–7, a renunciate must first pay off three debts: study of Vedas, begetting a son, and offering of sacrifices. One who goes forth with these debts unpaid is headed for a downfall. The Buddha has indeed paid off all these debts: he studied the Vedas under his former teachers ([mn26:15.6]()); he has a son Rāhula; and his path is regarded as the highest form of sacrifice ([dn5:24.1]()). But in Buddhism the concept is reinterpreted as meaning one has let go of all defilements, becoming a “perfected”, literally “worthy” one, after which one can eat almsfood free of debt ([mn124:38.1](), [sn16.11:13.2]()).
mn26:20.22	Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma!	NA
mn26:20.23	There will be those who understand!’	NA
mn26:21.1	Then, understanding the Divinity’s invitation, I surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, because of my compassion for sentient beings.	NA
mn26:21.2	And I saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not.	Here we see the sense of _indriya_ as “spiritual potential”. Originally it was the state of excited energy produced by soma that allowed Indra to manifest his full power and overcome his foes. It implicitly links back to the five spiritual qualities that the Buddha attributed to his teachers, which he later formalized as “faculties”. Here as there, the idea creates a connection between beings, a recognition of shared qualities that, when properly nurtured, can mature into awakening.
mn26:21.3	It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them.	NA
mn26:21.4	In the same way, I saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes.	NA
mn26:21.5	Then I replied in verse to the divinity Sahampati:	NA
mn26:21.6	‘Flung open are the doors to freedom from death!	NA
mn26:21.7	Let those with ears to hear commit to faith.	_Pamuñcantu saddhaṁ_ has long troubled translators, as the basic sense of _pamuñcantu_ is “release”. Sanskrit variants include _pramodantu_ (“celebrate”) or _praṇudantu kāṅkṣāḥ_ (“dispel doubts”). I think it is a poetic variant of _adhimuñcantu_, to “decide” or “commit” to faith. Pali commonly uses synonymous verbs to reinforce the sense of the noun. In [snp5.19](), _muttasaddho_, _pamuñcassu saddhaṁ_, and _adhimuttacittaṁ_ are all used in this sense.
mn26:21.8	Thinking it would be troublesome, Divinity, <j>I did not teach	NA
mn26:21.9	the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among mankind.’	NA
mn26:21.10	Then the divinity Sahampati, knowing that his request for me to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled me, keeping me on his right, before vanishing right there.	NA
mn26:22.1	Then I thought,	NA
mn26:22.2	‘Who should I teach first of all?	NA
mn26:22.3	Who will quickly understand this teaching?’	NA
mn26:22.4	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn26:22.5	‘That Āḷāra Kālāma is astute, competent, clever, and has long had little dust in his eyes.	NA
mn26:22.6	Why don’t I teach him first of all?	NA
mn26:22.7	He’ll quickly understand the teaching.’	NA
mn26:22.8	But a deity came to me and said,	NA
mn26:22.9	‘Sir, Āḷāra Kālāma passed away seven days ago.’	NA
mn26:22.10	And knowledge and vision arose in me,	NA
mn26:22.11	‘Āḷāra Kālāma passed away seven days ago.’	NA
mn26:22.12	I thought,	NA
mn26:22.13	‘This is a great loss for Āḷāra Kālāma.	NA
mn26:22.14	If he had heard the teaching, he would have understood it quickly.’	NA
mn26:23.1	Then I thought,	NA
mn26:23.2	‘Who should I teach first of all?	NA
mn26:23.3	Who will quickly understand this teaching?’	NA
mn26:23.4	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn26:23.5	‘That Uddaka son of Rāma is astute, competent, clever, and has long had little dust in his eyes.	NA
mn26:23.6	Why don’t I teach him first of all?	NA
mn26:23.7	He’ll quickly understand the teaching.’	NA
mn26:23.8	But a deity came to me and said,	NA
mn26:23.9	‘Sir, Uddaka son of Rāma passed away just last night.’	NA
mn26:23.10	And knowledge and vision arose in me,	NA
mn26:23.11	‘Uddaka son of Rāma passed away just last night.’	NA
mn26:23.12	I thought,	NA
mn26:23.13	‘This is a great loss for Uddaka.	NA
mn26:23.14	If he had heard the teaching, he would have understood it quickly.’	While this passage is clearly heightened for dramatic effect, it is not surprising that they have passed away. It has been several years since he studied with these teachers, and they were probably elderly at the time, as perhaps hinted in their eagerness to appoint Siddhattha as heirs.
mn26:24.1	Then I thought,	NA
mn26:24.2	‘Who should I teach first of all?	NA
mn26:24.3	Who will quickly understand this teaching?’	NA
mn26:24.4	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn26:24.5	‘The group of five mendicants were very helpful to me. They looked after me during my time of resolute striving.	The five mendicants appear abruptly here and the reason for their behavior is only clear in light of the fuller accounts ([mn36:33.4](), [mn85:33.4](), [mn100:30.5]()). The Buddha’s praise for them is more muted than for the Brahmanical teachers, showing how he valued advanced meditation over austerities. | Note that he calls them “mendicants”, a term typically reserved for Buddhist renunciates. For a similar usage, see [mn140:3.4]().
mn26:24.6	Why don’t I teach them first of all?’	NA
mn26:24.7	Then I thought,	NA
mn26:24.8	‘Where are the group of five mendicants staying these days?’	NA
mn26:24.9	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw that the group of five mendicants were staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana.	NA
mn26:24.10	So, when I had stayed in Uruvelā as long as I pleased, I set out for Varanasi.	Several suttas relate further details in this period (eg. [sn47.43](), [ud1.3]()–4, etc.)
mn26:25.1	While I was traveling along the road between Gayā and Bodhgaya, the Ājīvaka ascetic Upaka saw me	For the Ājīvakas, see [mn5:31.7]() and [dn2:20.2](). Upaka is met only here; his name means “nearly there”. | The place of awakening is referred to as _bodhi_. These places are about twenty kilometers apart.
mn26:25.2	and said,	NA
mn26:25.3	‘Reverend, your faculties are so very clear, and your complexion is pure and bright.	Here “faculties” refers to visible features such as bright eyes. Compare Chāndogya Upaniṣad 4.14.2, where a students face is seen as bright and glowing due to their recent insights.
mn26:25.4	In whose name have you gone forth, reverend? Who is your Teacher? Whose teaching do you believe in?’	NA
mn26:25.5	I replied to Upaka in verse:	NA
mn26:25.6	‘I am the champion, the knower of all,	NA
mn26:25.7	unsullied in the midst of all things.	NA
mn26:25.8	I’ve given up all, freed through the ending of craving.	NA
mn26:25.9	Since I know for myself, whose follower should I be?	NA
mn26:25.10	I have no tutor.	NA
mn26:25.11	There is no-one like me.	NA
mn26:25.12	In the world with its gods,	NA
mn26:25.13	I have no rival.	NA
mn26:25.14	For in this world, I am the perfected one;	NA
mn26:25.15	I am the supreme Teacher.	NA
mn26:25.16	I alone am fully awakened,	NA
mn26:25.17	cooled, quenched.	NA
mn26:25.18	I am going to the city of Kāsi	NA
mn26:25.19	to roll forth the Wheel of Dhamma.	NA
mn26:25.20	In this world that is so blind,	NA
mn26:25.21	I’ll beat the drum of freedom from death!’	_Āhañchaṁ_ is first person future singular of _āhanati_, “one beats”.
mn26:25.22	‘According to what you claim, reverend, you ought to be the Infinite Victor.’	“Infinite Victor” (_anantajina_) is unknown elsewhere and may be an Ājīvaka term. It relates to the epithet _jina_ of the teacher Mahāvīra, after which his followers the Jains were named. Mahāvīra and the Ājīvaka founder Gosāla practiced together for six years, so it comes as no surprise that they shared terminology.
mn26:25.23	‘The victors are those who, like me,	NA
mn26:25.24	have reached the ending of defilements.	NA
mn26:25.25	I have conquered bad qualities, Upaka—	NA
mn26:25.26	that’s why I’m a victor.’	NA
mn26:25.27	When I had spoken, Upaka said: ‘If you say so, reverend.’ Shaking his head, he took a wrong turn and left.	NA
mn26:26.1	Traveling stage by stage, I arrived at Varanasi, and went to see the group of five mendicants in the deer park at Isipatana.	NA
mn26:26.2	The group of five mendicants saw me coming off in the distance	NA
mn26:26.3	and stopped each other, saying,	For “they stopped each other” (_aññamaññaṁ saṇṭhapesuṁ_), see [an10.93:2.4]().
mn26:26.4	‘Here comes the ascetic Gotama. He’s so indulgent; he strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence.	NA
mn26:26.5	We shouldn’t bow to him or rise for him or receive his bowl and robe.	NA
mn26:26.6	But we can set out a seat; he can sit if he likes.’	NA
mn26:26.7	Yet as I drew closer, the group of five mendicants were unable to stop themselves as they had agreed.	NA
mn26:26.8	Some came out to greet me and receive my bowl and robe, some spread out a seat, while others set out water for washing my feet.	NA
mn26:26.9	But they still addressed me by name and as ‘reverend’.	These ways of address are suitable for a senior speaking to a junior ([dn16:6.2.2]()).
mn26:27.1	So I said to them,	NA
mn26:27.2	‘Mendicants, don’t address me by name and as “reverend”.	NA
mn26:27.3	The Realized One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn26:27.4	Listen up, mendicants: I have achieved freedom from death! I shall instruct you, I will teach you the Dhamma.	NA
mn26:27.5	By practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’	NA
mn26:27.6	But they said to me,	NA
mn26:27.7	‘Reverend Gotama, even by that conduct, that practice, that grueling work you did not achieve any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. How could you have achieved such a state now that you’ve become indulgent, strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence?’	Where “that practice” appears in [mn12:56.1]() and [mn85:51.7](), it refers to the austere practices that have just been described. Taken together with the abrupt skip at [mn26:18.1]() above, and the equally abrupt mention of the five mendicants at [mn26:24.5](), it seems likely the passage on the austerities has been removed in order to focus on the Brahmanical context.
mn26:27.8	So I said to them,	NA
mn26:27.9	‘The Realized One has not become indulgent, strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence.	NA

mn26:27.11	Listen up, mendicants: I have achieved freedom from death! I shall instruct you, I will teach you the Dhamma.	NA
mn26:27.12	By practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life.’	NA
mn26:27.13	But for a second time they said to me,	NA
mn26:27.14	‘Reverend Gotama … you’ve returned to indulgence.’	NA
mn26:27.15	So for a second time I said to them,	NA
mn26:27.16	‘The Realized One has not become indulgent …’	NA
mn26:27.17	NA	NA
mn26:27.18	But for a third time they said to me,	NA
mn26:27.19	‘Reverend Gotama, even by that conduct, that practice, that grueling work you did not achieve any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. How could you have achieved such a state now that you’ve become indulgent, strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence?’	NA
mn26:28.1	So I said to them,	NA
mn26:28.2	‘Mendicants, have you ever known me to speak like this before?’	NA
mn26:28.3	‘No sir, we have not.’	Here they adopt the more respectful term of address _bhante_ (“sir”).
mn26:28.4	‘The Realized One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn26:28.5	Listen up, mendicants: I have achieved freedom from death! I shall instruct you, I will teach you the Dhamma.	NA
mn26:28.6	By practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’	NA
mn26:29.1	I was able to persuade the group of five mendicants.	Again the narrative skips. Here the Buddha taught the “Rolling Forth of the Wheel of the Dhamma” ([sn56.11]()). The full sequence of events is related in [pli-tv-kd1:6.16.9]().
mn26:29.2	Then sometimes I advised two mendicants, while the other three went for alms.	NA
mn26:29.3	Then those three would feed all six of us with what they brought back.	NA
mn26:29.4	Sometimes I advised three mendicants, while the other two went for alms.	NA
mn26:29.5	Then those two would feed all six of us with what they brought back.	NA
mn26:30.1	As the group of five mendicants were being advised and instructed by me like this, being themselves liable to be reborn, understanding the drawbacks in being liable to be reborn, they sought that which is free of rebirth, the supreme sanctuary from the yoke, extinguishment—and they found it. Being themselves liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, understanding the drawbacks in these things, they sought that which is free of old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and corruption, the supreme sanctuary from the yoke, extinguishment—and they found it.	NA
mn26:30.2	Knowledge and vision arose in them:	NA
mn26:30.3	‘Our freedom is unshakable; this is our last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.’	This occurred with the teaching of the “Discourse on the Characteristic of Not Self” ([sn22.59]()).
mn26:31.1	Mendicants, there are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.	The Buddha rather abruptly returns to a direct teaching for the mendicants in Rammaka’s hermitage. The topic harks back to the simile of the sappy log, absent from here, but which in [mn36:17.1]() is introduced as the Bodhisatta undertook striving at Uruvelā.
mn26:31.2	What five?	NA
mn26:31.3	Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	NA

mn26:31.8	These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	NA
mn26:32.1	There are ascetics and brahmins who enjoy these five kinds of sensual stimulation tied, infatuated, attached, blind to the drawbacks, and not understanding the escape. You should understand that they	The Pali word _paribhuñjati_ means “to have something satisfying” as well as “to take pleasure in”, much like the English word “enjoys”.
mn26:32.2	have met with calamity and disaster, and the Wicked One can do with them what he wants.	NA
mn26:32.3	Suppose a deer in the wilderness was lying caught on a pile of snares.	This image and the teaching that follows links this sutta with the previous.
mn26:32.4	You’d know that it	NA

mn26:34.1	Suppose there was a wild deer wandering in the forest that walked, stood, sat, and laid down in confidence.	NA
mn26:34.2	Why is that?	NA
mn26:34.3	Because it’s out of the hunter’s range.	NA
mn26:34.4	In the same way, a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn26:34.5	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra, put out his eyes without a trace, and gone where the Wicked One cannot see.	NA
mn26:35.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn26:35.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	NA
mn26:36.1	Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA
mn26:36.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	NA
mn26:37.1	Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
mn26:37.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	NA
mn26:38.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.	NA
mn26:38.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	NA
mn26:39.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness.	NA
mn26:39.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	NA
mn26:40.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.	This passage and the next affirm that these meditations, learned under Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta, were adopted by the Buddha as part of his practice.
mn26:40.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	NA
mn26:41.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	NA

mn26:42.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end.	NA
mn26:42.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra, put out his eyes without a trace, and gone where the Wicked One cannot see.	NA
mn26:42.3	They’ve crossed over clinging to the world. And they walk, stand, sit, and lie down in confidence.	NA
mn26:42.4	Why is that?	NA
mn26:42.5	Because they’re out of the Wicked One’s range.”	NA
mn26:42.6	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn26:42.7	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn27:0.1	Middle Discourses 27	NA
mn27:0.2	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint	NA
mn27:1.1	So I have heard.	This sutta urges against drawing rash conclusions, insisting on a cautious and pragmatic approach to the truth. The theme of epistemological caution is further developed in such suttas as [mn47](), [mn60](), and [mn99](). | According to the Sinhalese chronicle Mahāvaṁsa 14.22, this was the first discourse taught by the arahant Mahinda to King Devanampiyatissa, leading to his conversion and the spread of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. This would have been around 250 BCE.
mn27:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn27:2.1	Now at that time the brahmin Jānussoṇi drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day in an all-white chariot drawn by mares.	A chariot drawn by mares was the preferred vehicle of Jānussoṇi ([mn99:30.1](), [sn45.4:1.3]()), as well as the brahmin student Ambaṭṭha [dn3:1.6.1](). Chāndogya Upaniṣad 4.2.1 depicts Jānaśruti’s wealth as including cows, gold, and a chariot drawn by mules.
mn27:2.2	He saw the wanderer Pilotika coming off in the distance,	Pilotika Vacchāyana is not mentioned elsewhere. His first name means “patch” and may be a reference to his patchwork robe (cp. “Ajita of the hair-blanket”). Vacchāyana is a patronymic, possibly indicating he was of the lineage of Vātsya, a student of Yājñavalkya (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 9.5.1.62, Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa 2.35.29).
mn27:2.3	and said to him,	NA
mn27:2.4	“So, worthy Vacchāyana, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”	NA
mn27:2.5	“Just now, good fellow, I’ve come from the presence of the ascetic Gotama.”	NA
mn27:2.6	“What do you think of the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom? Do you think he’s astute?”	NA
mn27:2.7	“My good man, who am I to judge the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom?	As at [mn99:30.7]() and [an5.194:2.4](). The Buddha speaks of his own lucidity of wisdom at [mn12:62.6]().
mn27:2.8	You’d really have to be on the same level to judge his lucidity of wisdom.”	NA
mn27:2.9	“Worthy Vacchāyana praises the ascetic Gotama with lofty praise indeed.”	NA
mn27:2.10	“Who am I to praise the ascetic Gotama?	NA
mn27:2.11	He is praised by the praised as the first among gods and humans.”	NA
mn27:2.12	“But for what reason are you so devoted to the ascetic Gotama?”	NA
mn27:3.1	“Suppose that a skilled bull elephant tracker were to enter a bull elephant wood.	The text differentiates “bull elephant” (_nāga_), “elephant” (_hatthi_), and “cow elephant” (_hatthinī_). This is essential to the parable, as the tracker is specifically seeking a bull.
mn27:3.2	There he’d see a large elephant’s footprint, long and broad.	NA
mn27:3.3	He would come to the conclusion,	The Pali phrase _niṭṭhaṁ gaccheyya_ is an exact match for the English idiom “come to a conclusion”.
mn27:3.4	‘This must be a big bull elephant.’	NA
mn27:3.5	In the same way, because I saw four footprints of the ascetic Gotama I came to the conclusion,	NA
mn27:3.6	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	NA
mn27:4.1	What four?	NA
mn27:4.2	Firstly, I see some clever aristocrats who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters. You’d think they live to demolish convictions with their intellect.	NA
mn27:4.3	They hear,	NA
mn27:4.4	‘So, gentlemen, that ascetic Gotama will come down to such and such village or town.’	NA

mn27:4.10	he has come down	NA
mn27:4.11	they approach him.	NA
mn27:4.12	The ascetic Gotama educates, encourages, fires up, and inspires them with a Dhamma talk.	NA

mn27:7.12	And he gives them the going-forth.	NA
mn27:7.13	Soon after going forth, living withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, they realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. They live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn27:7.14	They say,	NA
mn27:7.15	‘We were almost lost! We almost perished!	NA
mn27:7.16	For we used to claim that we were ascetics, brahmins, and perfected ones, but we were none of these things.	NA
mn27:7.17	But now we really are ascetics, brahmins, and perfected ones!’	NA
mn27:7.18	When I saw this fourth footprint of the ascetic Gotama, I came to the conclusion,	NA

mn27:7.20	It’s because I saw these four footprints of the ascetic Gotama that I came to the conclusion,	NA
mn27:7.21	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’”	NA
mn27:8.1	When he had spoken, Jānussoṇi got down from his chariot, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times:	NA
mn27:8.2	“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	NA
mn27:8.3	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	NA
mn27:8.4	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	NA
mn27:8.5	Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet the worthy Gotama, and we can have a discussion.”	NA
mn27:9.1	Then the brahmin Jānussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn27:9.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,	NA
mn27:9.3	and informed the Buddha of all he had discussed with the wanderer Pilotika.	NA
mn27:9.4	When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,	NA

mn27:9.7	listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn27:9.8	“Yes, worthy sir,” Jānussoṇi replied.	NA
mn27:9.9	The Buddha said this:	NA

mn27:10.3	A skilled bull elephant tracker does not yet come to the conclusion,	NA
mn27:10.4	‘This must be a big bull elephant.’	NA
mn27:10.5	Why not?	NA
mn27:10.6	Because in an elephant wood there are dwarf cow elephants with big footprints, and this footprint might be one of theirs.	This passage names three kinds of cow elephants unknown elsewhere. From the context they must be of ascending height. The first is the “dwarf” (_vāmanikā_).
mn27:10.7	NA	NA
mn27:10.8	They keep following the track until they see a big footprint, long and broad, and traces high up.	NA
mn27:10.9	A skilled bull elephant tracker does not yet come to the conclusion,	NA
mn27:10.10	‘This must be a big bull elephant.’	NA
mn27:10.11	Why not?	NA
mn27:10.12	Because in an elephant wood there are tall lofty cow elephants with big footprints, and this footprint might be one of theirs.	_Kāḷārikā_ is related to Sanskrit _karāla_, which may mean “lofty” or “with gaping teeth”. The commentary applies the latter meaning, but surely the former fits the context.
mn27:10.13	NA	NA
mn27:10.14	They keep following the track until they see a big footprint, long and broad, and traces and tusk-marks high up.	NA
mn27:10.15	A skilled bull elephant tracker does not yet come to the conclusion,	NA
mn27:10.16	‘This must be a big bull elephant.’	NA
mn27:10.17	Why not?	NA
mn27:10.18	Because in an elephant wood there are tall matriarch cow elephants with big footprints, and this footprint might be one of theirs.	One of the many Indic names for elephants, especially cows, is _kareṇu_ (Pali _kaṇeru_ by metathesis), which, being from the root _kara_ (“doer” = “hand”), has the same meaning as the more common _hatthi_, namely “handy”. I think the _kaṇerukā_ is the “leader of the cows”, i.e. the matriarch.
mn27:10.19	NA	NA
mn27:10.20	They keep following the track until they see a big footprint, long and broad, and traces, tusk-marks, and broken branches high up.	NA
mn27:10.21	And they see that bull elephant walking, standing, sitting, or lying down at the root of a tree or in the open.	NA
mn27:10.22	Then they’d come to the conclusion,	NA
mn27:10.23	‘This is that big bull elephant.’	NA
mn27:11.1	In the same way, brahmin, a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.	This is the start of the teaching on the Gradual Training, encompassing ethics (_sīla_), meditation (_samādhi_), and wisdom (_paññā_).
mn27:11.2	He realizes with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	NA
mn27:11.3	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely complete and pure.	NA
mn27:12.1	A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in a good family.	NA
mn27:12.2	They gain faith in the Realized One,	NA
mn27:12.3	and reflect,	NA
mn27:12.4	‘Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide open.	NA
mn27:12.5	It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	NA
mn27:12.6	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	NA
mn27:12.7	After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn27:13.1	Once they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings.	The first and most important precept. It is not just the negative injunction to avoid killing, but also the positive injunction to have compassion for all creatures. If a monastic murders a human being they are immediately and permanently expelled.
mn27:13.2	They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving.	To steal anything of substantial value is an expulsion offence.
mn27:13.3	They give up unchastity. They are chaste, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex.	“Chastity” is _brahmacariya_, literally “divine conduct”. Here it is used in the narrow sense of refraining from sex, but more commonly it has a broader sense of “spiritual life”.  Buddhist monastics are forbidden from any form of sexual activity. To engage in penetrative intercourse is an expulsion offence.
mn27:13.4	They give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and dependable, and don’t trick the world with their words.	This is the first of the four kinds of right speech. Just as the precept of not killing implies the positive injunction to live with compassion, the precepts on speech enjoin a positive and constructive use of speech. If a monastic falsely claims states of enlightenment or deep meditation they are expelled.
mn27:13.5	They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.	“Harmony” (or “unanimity”, _samagga_) does not excuse untrue, bigoted, or otherwise harmful speech. True harmony is only achieved in the presence of the Dhamma.
mn27:13.6	They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable, and agreeable to the people.	NA
mn27:13.7	They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.	_Attha_ is a polyvalent term, here taking the senses  “meaningful” and “beneficial”. Elsewhere it means “goal”, “need”, “purpose”, “lawsuit”, or “ending”, and the senses are not always easy to untangle.
mn27:13.8	They refrain from injuring plants and seeds.	Buddhists generally do not regard plants as sentient, but value them as part of the ecosystem that supports all life.
mn27:13.9	They eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and at the wrong time.	From [mn66:6.4]() and [mn70:4.8]() we can see that “at night” means after dark, while “at the wrong time” means in the afternoon. More explicitly, these are the “wrong time at night” and the “wrong time in the day”, in which case they are both the “wrong time”.
mn27:13.10	They refrain from seeing shows of dancing, singing, and music.	Such sensual entertainments distract and excite the mind. This and the next three precepts encourage peace of mind for meditation.
mn27:13.11	They refrain from beautifying and adorning themselves with garlands, fragrance, and makeup.	This was ignored by the Buddha’s cousin, Nanda ([sn21.8:1.2]()).
mn27:13.12	They refrain from high and luxurious beds.	To avoid sleeping too much.
mn27:13.13	They refrain from receiving gold and currency,	Literally “gold and silver” (_jātarūparajata_), but _rajata_ is explained in [pli-tv-bu-vb-np18:2.8]() as currency of any kind.
mn27:13.14	raw grains,	Mendicants receive only the day’s meal and do not store or cook food.
mn27:13.15	raw meat,	NA
mn27:13.16	women and girls,	NA
mn27:13.17	male and female bondservants,	According to ancient Indian law (Arthaśāstra 3.13), a person in a time of trouble may bind themselves in service for a fee. Such bondservants were protected against cruelty, sexual abuse, and unfair work. After earning back the fee of their indenture they were freed, retaining their original inheritance and status.
mn27:13.18	goats and sheep,	These are animals raised for food.
mn27:13.19	chickens and pigs,	NA
mn27:13.20	elephants, cows, horses, and mares,	NA
mn27:13.21	and fields and land.	Land for a monastery may be accepted by the Saṅgha as a community, but not by individual mendicants.
mn27:13.22	They refrain from running errands and messages;	These items are discussed in detail below. | Acting as a go-between for lay business was tempting due to the mendicants’ wandering lifestyle. However, it exposes them to risk if the message is not delivered or if it is bad news.
mn27:13.23	buying and selling;	For example, trading in monastery property.
mn27:13.24	falsifying weights, metals, or measures;	NA
mn27:13.25	bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity;	NA
mn27:13.26	mutilation, murder, abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence.	NA
mn27:14.1	They’re content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.	A Buddhist monk has three robes: a lower robe (sabong or sarong), an upper robe, and an outer cloak. | Here begins the series of practices that build on moral fundamentals to lay the groundwork for meditation. The sequence of contentment, mindfulness, and sense restraint sometimes varies (eg. [dn2:64.1]()).
mn27:14.2	They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden.	NA
mn27:14.3	In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.	NA
mn27:14.4	When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves.	As at [dn2:63.4](). This phrase perhaps belongs before contentment.
mn27:15.1	When they see a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.	NA
mn27:15.2	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.	It is not that one cannot see things, but that, mindful of its effect, one avoids unnecessary stimulation. | “Covetousness and bitterness” (_abhijjhā domanassā_) are the strong forms of desire and aversion caused by lack of restraint.
mn27:15.3	When they hear a sound with their ears …	NA
mn27:15.4	When they smell an odor with their nose …	NA
mn27:15.5	When they taste a flavor with their tongue …	NA
mn27:15.6	When they feel a touch with their body …	NA
mn27:15.7	When they know an idea with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.	NA
mn27:15.8	If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint.	NA
mn27:15.9	When they have this noble sense restraint, they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves.	As at [dn2:64.10](), their happiness deepens, as they see that not only their actions but also their mind is becoming free of anything unwholesome.
mn27:16.1	They act with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.	Situational awareness is a psychological term popularized in the 1990s. It has to do with the perception of environmental phenomena and the comprehension of their meaning, which is very close to the sense of the Pali term _sampajañña_. | These acts describe the daily life of  a mendicant: going into the village for alms, at which time there are many distracting sights. Then they return, eat their meal, and spend their day in meditation.
mn27:17.1	When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, this noble contentment, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness,	NA
mn27:17.2	they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.	The Jain Ācārāṅgasūtra 1.8.2 notes many places used by Mahāvīra for meditation, including a charnel ground, an empty hut, and the root of a tree.
mn27:18.1	After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in their presence.	For _parimukha_ (“in their presence”) we find _pratimukha_ in Sanskrit, which can mean “presence” or the reflection of the face. Late canonical Pali explains _parimukha_ as “the tip of the nose or the reflection of the face (_mukhanimitta_)”. _Parimukha_ in Sanskrit is rare, but it appears in Pāṇini 4.4.29, which the commentary illustrates with the example of a servant “in the presence” of their master (cp. [sn47.8]()). So it seems the sense is “before the face” or more generally “in the presence”. | To “establish mindfulness” (_satiṁ upaṭṭhapetvā_) is literally to “do satipaṭṭhāna”.
mn27:18.2	Giving up covetousness for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness.	Covetousness (_abhijjha_) has been curbed by sense restraint, and now is fully abandoned.
mn27:18.3	Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of sympathy for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will.	Likewise ill will (_byāpādapadosa_), which was called _domanassa_ in the formula for sense restraint.
mn27:18.4	Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness.	“Mindfulness and situational awareness” has a prominent role in abandoning dullness.
mn27:18.5	Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.	Restlessness hankers for the future and is countered by contentment. Remorse digs up the past and is countered by ethical purity.
mn27:18.6	Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.	The meditator set out on their path after gaining faith in the Buddha.
mn27:19.1	They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.	The five hindrances remain a pillar of meditation teaching. The root sense means to “obstruct” but also to “obscure, darken, veil”.
mn27:19.2	Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn27:19.3	This, brahmin, is that which is called ‘a footprint of the Realized One’ and also ‘a trace of the Realized One’ and also ‘a mark of the Realized One’.	The first true footprint of the Buddha is jhāna, not skill in debate or conversion, nor even ethical conduct. Compare [dn2:76.3](), where jhāna was the first superior fruit of the spiritual life.
mn27:19.4	But a noble disciple does not yet come to the conclusion,	Just as the bull elephant tracker does not come to a conclusion until they have found a bull elephant, here the meditator has not confirmed that the Buddha’s teaching leads to the goal that was promised.
mn27:19.5	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	NA
mn27:20.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn27:20.2	This too is what is called ‘a footprint of the Realized One’ …	NA
mn27:20.3	NA	NA
mn27:21.1	Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA
mn27:21.2	This too is what is called ‘a footprint of the Realized One’ …	NA
mn27:21.3	NA	NA
mn27:22.1	Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
mn27:22.2	This too is what is called ‘a footprint of the Realized One’ …	NA
mn27:22.3	NA	NA
mn27:22.4	NA	NA
mn27:23.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives.	NA
mn27:23.2	They recollect many kinds of past lives, that is, one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. … They recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.

mn27:24.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human, they understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	NA

mn27:24.4	NA	NA
mn27:24.5	NA	NA
mn27:25.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	NA
mn27:25.2	They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’	NA
mn27:25.3	They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements.’	NA
mn27:25.4	This, brahmin, is what is called ‘a footprint of the Realized One’ and also ‘a trace of the Realized One’ and also ‘a mark of the Realized One’.	NA
mn27:25.5	At this point a noble disciple has not yet come to a conclusion, but they are coming to the conclusion,	They are in the culminating stages of the path.
mn27:25.6	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	NA
mn27:26.1	Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	NA
mn27:26.2	When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.	NA
mn27:26.3	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’	NA
mn27:26.4	This, brahmin, is what is called ‘a footprint of the Realized One’ and also ‘a trace of the Realized One’ and also ‘a mark of the Realized One’.	NA
mn27:26.5	At this point a noble disciple has come to the conclusion,	Faith, reason, evidence, and experience have all played a role in the discovery of truth. But there can be no certainty until the truth has accomplished its ultimate function, freedom from suffering.
mn27:26.6	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	NA
mn27:26.7	And it is at this point that the simile of the elephant’s footprint has been completed in detail.”	NA
mn27:27.1	When he had spoken, the brahmin Jānussoṇi said to the Buddha,	NA
mn27:27.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	NA
mn27:27.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA

mn28:0.2	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint	NA
mn28:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn28:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn28:1.3	There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants,	This sutta is a masterclass on the methods employed by the Buddha’s greatest student, Sāriputta. He begins with the four noble truths, then proceeds to unpack them systematically, leading to a lengthy analysis of the four elements. But the unpacking takes surprising directions as Sāriputta draws on unexpected layers of the Dhamma to illustrate a familiar teaching in new ways. All the while, he conveys warmth and compassion, illustrating in his manner of teaching the connection that is also the topic of the teaching.
mn28:1.4	“Reverends, mendicants!”	NA
mn28:1.5	“Reverend,” they replied.	NA
mn28:1.6	Sāriputta said this:	NA
mn28:2.1	“The footprints of all creatures that walk can fit inside an elephant’s footprint, so an elephant’s footprint is said to be the biggest of them all.	NA
mn28:2.2	In the same way, all skillful qualities are included in the four noble truths.	Sāriputta’s emphasis on the four noble truths is also shown in [mn141](), where he is said to focus on teaching new students as far as stream-entry. The current sutta illustrates how he did this, carefully explaining fundamental concepts and showing their real world impacts, while offering pragmatic and reassuring advice. Along the way, he introduces all the major wisdom teachings of Buddhism, demonstrating exactly how they fit into the four noble truths. | The idea of “inclusion” (_saṅgaha_) became a fundamental method of the Abhidhamma Piṭaka, especially the Dhātukathā, which systematized the mapping of inclusion or exclusion regarding all phenomena (see too [mn44:11.1]()).
mn28:2.3	What four?	NA
mn28:2.4	The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.	NA
mn28:3.1	And what is the noble truth of suffering?	NA
mn28:3.2	Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering.	NA
mn28:3.3	And what are the five grasping aggregates?	NA
mn28:3.4	They are as follows: the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.	NA
mn28:4.1	And what is the grasping aggregate of form?	NA
mn28:4.2	The four principal states, and form derived from the four principal states.	The Buddha’s use of _mahābhūtā_ (“principal states”) responds to Yājñavalkya’s core teaching at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12, where the several “states” or “real entities” (_bhūtā_)—namely the diverse manifestations of creation—arise from and dissolve into the “principal state” (_mahābhūta_) of the Self, singular and infinite. For the Buddha, the “principal states” are themselves plural, as there is no underlying singular reality. Later Sanskrit literature lists the “five states” (_pañcabhūta_) as earth, water, fire, air, and space.
mn28:5.1	And what are the four principal states?	Delving into the four noble truths leads us to the actual topic, the four elements. But in this topic we will find not just matter, but connections that lead us back to the four noble truths.
mn28:5.2	The elements of earth, water, fire, and air.	Each of these “elements” was a major deity of the Vedas, called by many names in addition to the obvious Pṛthivī, Agni, Āpas, and Vāyu. Nature was a realm of divine powers invoked and hopefully tamed by hymn and ritual. The Buddha treated elements as natural phenomena rather than divinities, but this creates a potential problem. If prayer and sacrifice is no longer effective, are we just victims of the arbitrary threats of an uncaring world? Our modern solution is to subjugate the world of nature, to set ourselves above it and beat it into submission with our technology. For the Buddha, the solution was, rather, to dissolve the difference between self and other: if we are no more than elements, elements are no less than us. While the impermanence of the elements was inescapable, we can master our own responses. Thus we do not live in a world stripped of meaning, but one full of the potential for freedom.
mn28:6.1	And what is the earth element?	NA
mn28:6.2	The earth element may be interior or exterior.	That is to say, inside oneself or in the world outside oneself.
mn28:6.3	And what is the interior earth element?	NA
mn28:6.4	Anything internal, pertaining to an individual, that’s hard, solid, and appropriated. This includes:	“Appropriated” (_upādinna_) is a technical term referring to matter that has been “taken up” or “grasped” at birth, namely the organic body.
mn28:6.5	head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces; or anything else internal, pertaining to an individual, that’s hard, solid, and appropriated.	The phrase “or anything else” (_yaṁ vā panaññampi kiñci_) indicates that the analysis is meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive. Early Buddhism makes no claim to list all the different manifestations of the elements.
mn28:6.6	This is called the interior earth element.	NA
mn28:6.7	The interior earth element and the exterior earth element are just the earth element.	The exterior element is not defined here. Rather, the sutta moves by collapsing the distinction between interior and exterior.
mn28:6.8	This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	Since what is “in here” and what is “out there” are the same element, how can it be “my” body? | In this standard reflection on not-self, “this is not mine” counters craving due to a sense of ownership; “I am not this” counters the conceit of identification; and “this is not my self” counters views based on speculation.
mn28:6.9	When you truly see with right understanding, you grow disillusioned with the earth element, detaching the mind from the earth element.	NA
mn28:7.1	There comes a time when the exterior water element flares up.	This is in reference to the belief that the earth rests upon water, and if the water is disturbed it shakes the earth ([an8.70:14.3](), [dn16:3.13.3]()). Thus this is a reference to calamity by earthquake rather than flood. Apparently it was believed that an extreme earthquake could shake apart the whole earth.
mn28:7.2	At that time the exterior earth element vanishes.	NA
mn28:7.3	So for all its great age, the earth element will be revealed as impermanent, liable to end, vanish, and perish.	Read _mahallikā_ as “old” rather than “large”. | Note that “impermanence” in the suttas is not reduced to “momentariness”. It applies equally to the largest and smallest scales, as well as the living scale of the human life.
mn28:7.4	What then of this ephemeral body appropriated by craving? Rather than ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘I am’, they consider it to be none of these things.	The key to this difficult sentence is recognizing that _atha kho_ here is adversative (compare [dn23:8.1](): “Even though Master Kassapa says this, nonetheless I think that”, _kiñcāpi bhavaṁ kassapo evamāha, atha kho evaṁ me ettha hoti_). | _Notevettha hoti_ resolves as follows: _not(i)_ is the negative, which is distributed across the three terms, I, mine, I am; _ev(a)_ conveys exclusivity; _ettha_ with _hoti_ and the genitive means “think about that” (eg. [mn38:18.4]()). | “Ephemeral” is _mattaṭṭhaka_, “standing” (_(ṭ)ṭha_) for “a while” (_matta_).
mn28:8.1	If others abuse, attack, harass, and trouble that mendicant, they understand:	The motif of mendicants being attacked is found occasionally in the suttas, but more commonly in texts of the Jains, who went naked and did not bathe.
mn28:8.2	‘This painful feeling born of ear contact has arisen in me.	Sāriputta brings in a reflection on conditionality, not as a philosophy, but as a skillful method of defusing reactive emotions.
mn28:8.3	That’s dependent, not independent.	NA
mn28:8.4	Dependent on what?	NA
mn28:8.5	Dependent on contact.’	NA
mn28:8.6	They see that contact, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent.	With the previously-mentioned form, now all five aggregates are included.
mn28:8.7	Based on that element alone, their mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes decided.	Here the elements serve for calming the mind (_samatha_) as earlier they served for insight (_vipassanā_) | _Ārammaṇa_ does not mean “object”, an Abhidhamma concept foreign to the suttas: existence is relational, not objective. Rather, it is a “support” upon which the mind relies. The “support” itself is impermanent and conditioned, but it serves to achieve the purpose. | The phrase _pakkhandati pasīdati santiṭṭhati adhimuccati_ is stock, so _pakkhandati_ does not mean to “enter into” but rather to be “secure”.
mn28:9.1	Others might treat that mendicant with disliking, loathing, and detestation,	NA
mn28:9.2	striking them with fists, stones, sticks, and swords.	NA
mn28:9.3	They understand:	NA
mn28:9.4	‘This body is such that fists, stones, sticks, and swords strike it.	NA
mn28:9.5	But the Buddha has said in the Advice on the Simile of the Saw:	Sāriputta is quoting from [mn21:21.1]().
mn28:9.6	“Even if low-down bandits were to sever you limb from limb with a two-handed saw, anyone who had a malevolent thought on that account would not be following my instructions.”	NA
mn28:9.7	My energy shall be roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness established and lucid, my body tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind immersed in samādhi and unified.	NA
mn28:9.8	Gladly now, let fists, stones, sticks, and swords strike this body! For this is how the instructions of the Buddhas are followed.’	NA
mn28:10.1	While recollecting the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful may not become stabilized in them.	Again the teaching is pragmatic rather than theoretical, as Sāriputta is reassuring young students. It often happens in the course of practice that even when doing what is said to be the right thing, the results are not what you hoped.
mn28:10.2	In that case they stir up a sense of urgency:	NA
mn28:10.3	‘It’s my loss, my misfortune,	NA
mn28:10.4	that while recollecting the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful does not become stabilized in me.’	NA
mn28:10.5	They’re like a daughter-in-law who stirs up a sense of urgency when they see their father-in-law.	This alludes to the idea that a newlywed bride moving in to her husband’s home would be on her best behavior.
mn28:10.6	NA	NA
mn28:10.7	NA	NA
mn28:10.8	But if, while recollecting the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful does become stabilized in them, they’re happy with that.	NA
mn28:10.9	At this point, much has been done by that mendicant.	Sāriputta offers positive reinforcement. Even an apparently small instance of overcoming anger is a significant step in mental training.
mn28:11.1	And what is the water element?	NA
mn28:11.2	The water element may be interior or exterior.	NA
mn28:11.3	And what is the interior water element?	NA
mn28:11.4	Anything internal, pertaining to an individual, that’s water, watery, and appropriated. This includes:	NA
mn28:11.5	bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine; or anything else internal, pertaining to an individual, that’s water, watery, and appropriated.	NA

mn28:11.9	When you truly see with right understanding, you grow disillusioned with the water element, detaching the mind from the water element.	NA
mn28:12.1	There comes a time when the exterior water element flares up.	NA
mn28:12.2	It sweeps away villages, towns, cities, countries, and regions.	Flood was and remains an ever-present threat in the Indo-Gangetic Plain. | I am writing this note in eastern Australia in 2023, where, due to the impermanence of the elements driven by human greed, we have just endured multiple devastating floods and now face summers of fire.
mn28:12.3	There comes a time when the water in the ocean sinks down a hundred leagues, or two, three, four, five, six, up to seven hundred leagues.	NA
mn28:12.4	There comes a time when the water in the ocean stands just seven palm trees deep, or six, five, four, three, two, or even just one palm tree deep.	NA
mn28:12.5	There comes a time when the water in the ocean stands just seven fathoms deep, or six, five, four, three, two, or even just one fathom deep.	NA
mn28:12.6	There comes a time when the water in the ocean stands just half a fathom deep, or waist deep, or knee deep, or even just ankle deep.	NA
mn28:12.7	There comes a time when there’s not even enough water left in the great ocean to wet the tip of the toe.	NA
mn28:12.8	So for all its great age, the water element will be revealed as impermanent, liable to end, vanish, and perish.	NA

mn28:22.1	There comes a time when the exterior air element flares up.	NA
mn28:22.2	It sweeps away villages, towns, cities, countries, and regions.	NA
mn28:22.3	There comes a time, in the last month of summer, when they look for wind by using a palm-leaf or fan, and even the grasses in the drip-fringe of a thatch roof don’t stir.	NA
mn28:22.4	So for all its great age, the air element will be revealed as impermanent, liable to end, vanish, and perish.	NA
mn28:22.5	What then of this ephemeral body appropriated by craving? Rather than ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘I am’, they consider it to be none of these things.	NA
mn28:23.1	If others abuse, attack, harass, and trouble that mendicant, they understand:	NA
mn28:23.2	‘This painful feeling born of ear contact has arisen in me.	NA
mn28:23.3	That’s dependent, not independent.	NA
mn28:23.4	Dependent on what?	NA
mn28:23.5	Dependent on contact.’	NA
mn28:23.6	They see that contact, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent.	NA
mn28:23.7	Based on that element alone, their mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes decided.	NA
mn28:24.1	Others might treat that mendicant with disliking, loathing, and detestation, striking them with fists, stones, sticks, and swords.	NA
mn28:24.2	They understand: ‘This body is such that fists, stones, sticks, and swords strike it.	NA
mn28:24.3	But the Buddha has said in the Advice on the Simile of the Saw: “Even if low-down bandits were to sever you limb from limb with a two-handed saw, anyone who had a thought of hate on that account would not be following my instructions.”	NA

mn28:24.5	Gladly now, let fists, stones, sticks, and swords strike this body! For this is how the instructions of the Buddhas are followed.’	NA
mn28:25.1	While recollecting the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful may not become stabilized in them.	NA
mn28:25.2	In that case they stir up a sense of urgency:	NA
mn28:25.3	‘It’s my loss, my misfortune,	NA
mn28:25.4	that while recollecting the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful does not become stabilized in me.’	NA

mn28:26.1	When a space is enclosed by sticks, creepers, grass, and mud it becomes known as a ‘building’.	Sāriputta extends the teaching in a new way by including the space element. But this is not arbitrarily added to the previous discussion. Rather, he begins by defining space as that which is physically delimited by the other elements. Thus space is considered as a kind of “derived form” (_upādāyarūpa_). This point was contested by some later schools of Buddhism, who believed that space was unconditioned.
mn28:26.2	In the same way, when a space is enclosed by bones, sinews, flesh, and skin it becomes known as a ‘form’.	NA
mn28:27.1	Reverends, though the eye is intact internally, so long as exterior sights don’t come into range and there’s no corresponding engagement, there’s no manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness.	This expands the normal explanation of sense experience, found for example at [mn148:7.3]().

mn28:28.1	The form produced in this way is included in the grasping aggregate of form. The feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness produced in this way are each included in the corresponding grasping aggregate.	Sāriputta shows the connection between the six senses and the five aggregates.
mn28:28.2	They understand:	NA
mn28:28.3	‘So this is how there comes to be inclusion, gathering together, and joining together into these five grasping aggregates.	NA
mn28:28.4	But the Buddha has said:	This statement is not found in the Pali canon.
mn28:28.5	“One who sees dependent origination sees the teaching.	Bringing in dependent origination, Sāriputta integrates in a single discourse all the major wisdom frameworks: the truths, aggregates, senses, elements, and dependent origination. This is especially useful for students, as they would have heard these individual teachings many times, but might be unclear how they are connected.
mn28:28.6	One who sees the teaching sees dependent origination.”	NA
mn28:28.7	And these five grasping aggregates are indeed dependently originated.	NA
mn28:28.8	The desire, clinging, attraction, and attachment for these five grasping aggregates is the origin of suffering.	He brings the teaching back around to the four noble truths.

mn28:37.1	mind is intact internally, so long as exterior ideas don’t come into range and there’s no corresponding engagement, there’s no manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness.	The “mind” (_mano_, Sanskrit _manas_) here is presumably what is elsewhere called the “mind element” (_manodhātu_, eg. [mn155:4.8]()), since both are connected with “ideas” (_dhammā_) and “mind consciousness” (_manoviññāṇa_). The exact nature of _mano_ here is not specified in early texts. Judging from this sutta, it parallels the physical basis for the other five kinds of consciousness (already in Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.1.8: “seeing through the eye, hearing through the ear, knowing through the mind”), in which case it might be the physical basis for consciousness. The suttas do not specify what this is; tradition calls it the _hadayavatthu_, the “heart basis”, while today we would recognize it as the brain. Compare Aitareya Upaniṣad, which says that the mind (_manas_) creates the heart, which in turn creates the moon (1.1.4); when man was formed, the moon, having become _manas_, entered the heart (1.2.4); mind and heart are then said to be the same (3.2). As with the other senses, the mind remains inert until actuated by the Self. Leaving aside the metaphysics, the conception of _manas_ as the underlying potential for consciousness is similar, regardless of whether this was a physical organ, or a process of ongoing consciousness awaiting stimulation per the commentary (_bhavaṅgacitta_).

mn29:0.2	The Longer Simile of the Heartwood	NA
mn29:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn29:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain, not long after Devadatta had left.	Devadatta was the Buddha’s cousin and nemesis. After going forth together with several other relatives of the Buddha ([pli-tv-kd17:1.4.1]()), his initial success in meditation was corrupted by his desire for gains and fame ([sn17.35]()). He tried to take over the Saṅgha but was denounced by the Buddha. His attempt to create a schismatic faction failed and he died in disgrace.
mn29:1.3	There the Buddha spoke to the mendicants about Devadatta:	NA
mn29:2.1	“Mendicants, take the case of a gentleman who has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, thinking,	NA
mn29:2.2	‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.	NA
mn29:2.3	Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’	NA
mn29:2.4	When they’ve gone forth they generate possessions, honor, and popularity.	NA
mn29:2.5	They’re happy with that, and they’ve got all they wished for.	NA
mn29:2.6	And they glorify themselves and put others down because of that:	NA
mn29:2.7	‘I’m the one with possessions, honor, and popularity. These other mendicants are obscure and insignificant.’	NA
mn29:2.8	And so they become indulgent and fall into negligence on account of those possessions, honor, and popularity. And being negligent they live in suffering.	The Chinese parallel at EA 43.4 says that this discourse was given during the time he was being lavishly supported by Prince Ajātasattu ([sn17.36](), [pli-tv-kd17:2.1.1]()).
mn29:2.9	Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But, passing over the heartwood, softwood, bark, and shoots, he’d cut off the branches and leaves and depart imagining they were heartwood.	Compare the “noble quest” on [mn26]() and the search for a “bull elephant” in [mn27](). In each case the metaphor emphasizes the specific and uncompromising nature of the goal. The moral is to not stop until the journey is truly complete.

It seems that when these attainments came to be included in the _Vimokkha_ Chapter of the Paṭisambhidāmagga (a late canonical Abhidhamma-style text), they were renamed _vimokkha_ to fit the context ([ps1.5:2.10]()).

mn30:12.20	And what are those things that are better and finer than knowledge and vision?	NA
mn30:13.1	Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	Where the previous sutta went directly from “knowledge and vision” to final liberation ([mn29:6.16]()), the current sutta adds an extensive passage on the nine attainments.   Several details indicate that this passage is a later insertion. First, the _jhānas_ are already included under immersion above ([mn30:10.12]()). There, immersion leads to knowledge and vision following the normal sequence (eg. [dn2:83.1]()), rather than being superior to it as here. Further, this discourse is distinguished as “short” compared to the previous “large” discourse, but it is in fact longer due to this extra material, which was presumably added after the title was established. EA 43.4, which is the only Chinese parallel to both these discourses, also lacks this extra passage.
mn30:13.2	This is something better and finer than knowledge and vision.	NA
mn30:14.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn30:14.2	This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision.	NA
mn30:15.1	Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA
mn30:15.2	This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision.	NA
mn30:16.1	Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
mn30:16.2	This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision.	NA
mn30:17.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.	NA
mn30:17.2	This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision.	NA
mn30:18.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness.	NA
mn30:18.2	This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision.	NA
mn30:19.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.	NA
mn30:19.2	This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision.	NA
mn30:20.1	Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	NA
mn30:20.2	This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision.	NA
mn30:21.1	Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end.	NA
mn30:21.2	This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision.	NA
mn30:21.3	These are the things that are better and finer than knowledge and vision.	NA
mn30:22.1	Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood. He’d cut out just the heartwood and depart knowing it was heartwood.	NA

mn31:0.1	Middle Discourses 31	NA
mn31:0.2	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga	NA
mn31:1.1	So I have heard.	This discourse is a favorite among monastics, depicting an ideal life of simplicity and friendship. The introduction recurs at [pli-tv-kd10:4.2.1]() and, with a different teaching portion, at [mn128:81](). In both those cases it is set after the Buddha left the quarreling monks of Kosambī. | This discourse and [mn128]() appear to be influenced by Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3, a famous dialogue where an unusually reluctant Yājñavalkya is repeatedly pressed by King Janaka to reveal the true nature of a person’s light. At [sn7.9:14.4]() this passage is alluded to directly.
mn31:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying at Ñātika in the brick house.	Ñātika (also spelled _nātika_, or _nādika_; Sanskrit _jñātṛka_; Prākrit _nāyika_) was the clan to which the Jain leader Mahāvīra (called Nāṭaputta, i.e. Ñātiputta) belonged. This is the chief town of the clan. It was part of the Vajjian Federation (See [dn16:2.5.1]()). | Over a millennium previously, the Indus Valley Civilization had built cities of fired brick with standardized size and construction methods, but in the Buddha’s day most buildings were wood. This is the only brick building mentioned in the suttas, although brick construction is also discussed in the Vinaya.
mn31:2.1	Now at that time the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila were staying in the sal forest park at Gosiṅga.	Anuruddha was the brother of Ānanda and Mahānāma ([pli-tv-kd17:1.1.3]()) which, according to the commentary, makes the Buddha his cousin. He was an exponent of mindfulness meditation ([sn52.1](), etc.) and master of clairvoyance ([an1.192:1.1](). | Kimbila was one of the seven leading Sakyans, including Anuruddha and Ānanda, who went forth together ([pli-tv-kd17:1.4.1]()). | Several Nandiyas are known in the suttas, one of whom was a Sakyan ([sn55.40](), [an11.13](); the root _nand_ (“joy”) was a popular choice for Sakyan names: Ānanda, Nanda, Upananda). While Nandiya is not mentioned as having gone forth with the seven, Kimbila refers to their group as the “Sakyan friends” in his verses at [thag2.18](), so it seems likely he was indeed the Sakyan Nandiya; perhaps he went forth later than his friends.
mn31:3.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to that park.	NA
mn31:3.2	The park keeper saw the Buddha coming off in the distance	This is one of several instances showing that the Buddha looked like an ordinary ascetic (see also [dn2:11.2](), [mn140:5.11]()).
mn31:3.3	and said to him,	NA
mn31:3.4	“Don’t come into this park, ascetic.	NA
mn31:3.5	There are three gentlemen staying here whose nature is to desire self-knowledge.	_Attakāmarūpa_ is glossed by the commentary as “those whose nature is to desire their own welfare”. In the Vinaya (_attakāma_) means to serve “one’s own desires” ([pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4]()). But here it draws on Yājnavalkya’s description of one whose form is such that, having attained their only desire, the Self, they have become without desire (_ātmakāmam āptakāmam akāmaṁ rūpaṁ_, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 14.7.1.21, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.21. Cf. _niṣkāma āptakāma ātmakāmo_, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 14.7.2.8, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.6. In both cases the Bṛhadāraṇyaka reverses the sequence of _āpta_ … _ātma_.) This describes a sage who is fully immersed in the realization of Brahman in death or dreamless sleep. Such realization is a form of “knowledge” (_veda_). Here the suffix _-rūpa_ does not mean “seemingly”, nor is it to be discarded as a mere idiom, but has the sense given in the commentary, a person’s true form or true nature (_sabhāva_). This is, of course, not a Buddhist concept. But it is spoken by the keeper of a park (not a monastery) who fails to even recognize the Buddha. There is no reason he should be Buddhist. To this day, Buddhist monastics are received with kindness and unhesitatingly supported by Hindus, who readily interpret and describe the monastics’ practice in their own terms.
mn31:3.6	Do not disturb them.”	NA
mn31:4.1	Anuruddha heard the park keeper conversing with the Buddha,	NA
mn31:4.2	and said to him,	NA
mn31:4.3	“Don’t keep the Buddha out, good park keeper!	NA
mn31:4.4	Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has arrived.”	NA
mn31:4.5	Then Anuruddha went to Nandiya and Kimbila, and said to them,	NA
mn31:4.6	“Come forth, venerables, come forth! Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has arrived!”	NA
mn31:5.1	Then Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila came out to greet the Buddha.	NA
mn31:5.2	One received his bowl and robe, one spread out a seat, and one set out water for washing his feet.	NA
mn31:5.3	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,	NA
mn31:5.4	and washed his feet.	NA
mn31:5.5	Those venerables bowed and sat down to one side.	NA
mn31:5.6	The Buddha said to Anuruddha,	NA
mn31:5.7	“I hope you’re keeping well, Anuruddha and friends; I hope you’re all right. And I hope you’re having no trouble getting almsfood.”	The text refers to “Anuruddhas” in plural. It was apparently the custom to refer to the group by their most senior member.
mn31:5.8	“We’re keeping well, Blessed One, we’re getting by. And we have no trouble getting almsfood.”	NA
mn31:6.1	“I hope you’re living in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes?”	The emphasis on harmonious living fits the accounts in [pli-tv-kd10:4.2.1]() and [mn128](), where the Buddha had just left the quarreling community of Kosambī. This suggests that the introduction belongs there, when the three friends were practicing together in the Eastern Bamboo Park near Kosambī. The current sutta is set around 400 kms to the east near Vesālī, and it is hardly likely that the Buddha went straight there after leaving Kosambī. In addition, in [mn128]() the three friends are still developing their meditation, whereas in the current sutta they have already achieved arahantship. It seems that the popular introduction of [mn128]() was reused to frame a later conversation with the three friends, despite the implausibility of the same events happening in the same way twice.
mn31:6.2	“Indeed, sir, we live in harmony like this.”	NA
mn31:6.3	“But how do you live this way?”	NA
mn31:7.1	“In this case, sir, I think,	NA
mn31:7.2	‘I’m fortunate, so very fortunate,	NA
mn31:7.3	to live together with spiritual companions such as these.’	NA
mn31:7.4	I consistently treat these venerables with kindness by way of body, speech, and mind, both in public and in private.	These are three of the six “warm-hearted qualities” of [mn48:6.2]() and [an6.11:1.1]().
mn31:7.5	NA	NA
mn31:7.6	NA	NA
mn31:7.7	I think,	NA
mn31:7.8	‘Why don’t I set aside my own ideas and just go along with these venerables’ ideas?’	NA
mn31:7.9	And that’s what I do.	NA
mn31:7.10	Though we’re different in body, sir, we’re one in mind, it seems to me.”	NA
mn31:7.11	And the venerables Nandiya and Kimbila spoke likewise, and they added:	NA

mn31:8.1	“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!	NA
mn31:8.2	But I hope you’re living diligently, keen, and resolute?”	Normally I render _viharati_ in such instances as “meditate”. But Anuruddha’s response avoids talking about meditation. I think he is deliberately avoiding the topic, skirting the obvious intended meaning by seizing on an ambiguity. His reticence echoes Yājñavalkya’s reticence to answer Janaka on the topic of a person’s light (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.1).
mn31:9.1	“Indeed, sir, we live diligently.”	NA
mn31:9.2	“But how do you live this way?”	NA
mn31:9.3	“In this case, sir, whoever returns first from almsround prepares the seats, and puts out the drinking water and the rubbish bin.	NA
mn31:9.4	If there’s anything left over, whoever returns last eats it if they like. Otherwise they throw it out where there is little that grows, or drop it into water that has no living creatures.	NA
mn31:9.5	Then they put away the seats, drinking water, and rubbish bin, and sweep the refectory.	NA
mn31:9.6	If someone sees that the pot of water for washing, drinking, or the toilet is empty they set it up.	NA
mn31:9.7	If he can’t do it, he summons another with a wave of the hand, and they set it up by lending each other a hand to lift. But we don’t break into speech for that reason.	For _hatthavilaṅghaka_ (“lending a hand up”) see [mn125:9.2](). | The Chinese parallels (MA 128 at T i 729c9 and EA 24.8 at T ii 629a23) both add that they then retire for meditation.
mn31:9.8	And every five days we sit together for the whole night and discuss the teachings.	That is, three times in each _uposatha_ period lasting a fortnight. | The Chinese parallels add that they might also sit in noble silence (in accord with [mn26:4.13]()).
mn31:9.9	That’s how we live diligently, keen, and resolute.”	Here the Vinaya account ends, as it is concerned with the settlement of the quarrel among the monks of Kosambī.
mn31:10.1	“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!	NA
mn31:10.2	But as you live diligently like this, have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a comfortable meditation?”	NA
mn31:10.3	“How could we not, sir?	NA
mn31:10.4	Whenever we want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, we enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	The first absorption is defined at [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:4.1.3.1]() as the most basic “superhuman distinction”. Thus Anuruddha is answering the question directly but humbly, revealing as little as possible.
mn31:10.5	This is a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a comfortable meditation, that we have achieved while living diligent, keen, and resolute.”	NA

mn31:17.3	“How could we not, sir?	NA
mn31:17.4	Whenever we want, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, we enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness. …	NA
mn31:17.5	going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, we enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. …	NA
mn31:17.6	going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, we enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	NA
mn31:17.7	This is another superhuman distinction that we have achieved for going beyond and stilling that meditation.”	NA
mn31:18.1	“Good, good!	NA
mn31:18.2	But have you achieved any other superhuman distinction for going beyond and stilling that meditation?”	NA
mn31:18.3	“How could we not, sir?	NA
mn31:18.4	Whenever we want, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, we enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, our defilements have come to an end.	NA
mn31:18.5	This is another superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a comfortable meditation, that we have achieved for going beyond and stilling that meditation.	NA
mn31:18.6	And we don’t see any better or finer way of meditating comfortably than this.”	NA
mn31:18.7	“Good, good!	NA
mn31:18.8	There is no better or finer way of meditating comfortably than this.”	NA
mn31:19.1	Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.	NA
mn31:20.1	The venerables then accompanied the Buddha for a little way before turning back. Nandiya and Kimbila said to Anuruddha,	NA
mn31:20.2	“Did we ever tell you that we had	NA
mn31:20.3	gained such and such meditations and attainments, up to the ending of defilements, as you revealed to the Buddha?”	Even such close monks did not reveal their attainments to each other, a testament to their character. This is a reminder of the virtue of discretion when speaking of such subtle matters. They are not things to be bandied about in common conversation.
mn31:20.4	“The venerables did not tell me that they had	NA
mn31:20.5	gained such meditations and attainments. But I discovered it by comprehending your minds,	NA
mn31:20.6	NA	NA
mn31:20.7	and deities also told me.	NA
mn31:20.8	NA	NA
mn31:20.9	I answered when the Buddha directly asked about it.”	NA
mn31:21.1	Then the native spirit Dīgha Parajana went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	_Parajana_ means “stranger” ([mil6.3.1:13.2]()) or “strange spirit” ([mn25:5.20]()). The commentary identifies him with the Dīgha of [dn32:10.18](). He must have been the deity of a local shrine. This passage shows how the intercession of even such a humble spirit can resound among all the gods.
mn31:21.2	“The Vajjis are lucky! The Vajjian people are so very lucky	The praise that follows is unusually effusive and can be compared with the equally unusual recounting of the enlightened devotees of Ñātika ([dn16:2.5.1]()). Both passages serve to extol Buddhism in the home of Mahāvīra, the Buddha’s elder rival.
mn31:21.3	that the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha stays there, as well as these three gentlemen,	NA
mn31:21.4	the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila.”	NA
mn31:21.5	Hearing the cry of Dīgha Parajana, the earth gods raised the cry …	NA
mn31:21.6	NA	NA
mn31:21.7	NA	NA
mn31:21.8	NA	NA
mn31:21.9	Hearing the cry of the earth gods, the gods of the four great kings …	NA
mn31:21.10	the gods of the thirty-three …	NA
mn31:21.11	the gods of Yama …	NA
mn31:21.12	the joyful gods …	NA
mn31:21.13	the gods who love to imagine …	NA
mn31:21.14	the gods who control what is imagined by others …	NA
mn31:21.15	the gods of the Divinity’s host raised the cry,	NA
mn31:21.16	“The Vajjis are lucky! The Vajjian people are so very lucky	NA
mn31:21.17	that the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha stays there, as well as these three gentlemen,	NA
mn31:21.18	the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila.”	NA
mn31:21.19	And so at that moment, that second, that hour, those venerables were known as far as the realm of divinity.	NA
mn31:22.1	“That’s so true, Dīgha! That’s so true!	NA
mn31:22.2	If the family from which those three gentlemen went forth from the lay life to homelessness were to recollect those venerables with confident heart, that would be for that family’s lasting welfare and happiness.	NA

mn31:22.13	See, Dīgha, how those three gentlemen are practicing for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!”	NA
mn31:22.14	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn31:22.15	Satisfied, the native spirit Dīgha Parajana approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn32:0.1	Middle Discourses 32	NA
mn32:0.2	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga	NA
mn32:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn32:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the sal forest park at Gosiṅga, together with several well-known senior disciples, such as	From [mn31:3.1]() we know that this park was near Ñātika in the Vajjian country.
mn32:1.3	the venerables Sāriputta, Mahāmoggallāna, Mahākassapa, Anuruddha, Revata, Ānanda, and others.	NA
mn32:2.1	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna came out of retreat, went to Venerable Mahākassapa, and said,	NA
mn32:2.2	“Come, Reverend Kassapa, let’s go to Venerable Sāriputta to hear the teaching.”	NA
mn32:2.3	“Yes, reverend,” Mahākassapa replied.	NA
mn32:2.4	Then, together with Venerable Anuruddha, they went to Sāriputta to hear the teaching.	NA
mn32:3.1	Seeing them, Venerable Ānanda	NA
mn32:3.2	went to Venerable Revata, told him what was happening,	NA
mn32:3.3	and invited him also.	NA
mn32:3.4	NA	NA
mn32:3.5	NA	NA
mn32:3.6	NA	NA
mn32:4.1	Sāriputta saw them coming off in the distance	NA
mn32:4.2	and said to Ānanda,	NA
mn32:4.3	“Come, Venerable Ānanda.	NA
mn32:4.4	Welcome to Ānanda, the Buddha’s attendant, who is so close to the Buddha.	NA
mn32:4.5	Ānanda, the sal forest park at Gosiṅga is lovely, the night is bright, the sal trees are in full blossom, and heavenly scents seem to float on the air.	NA
mn32:4.6	What kind of mendicant would beautify this park?”	NA
mn32:4.7	“Reverend Sāriputta, it’s a mendicant who is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, rehearsing them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.	Ānanda was renowned as the most learned monk in the Sangha ([an1.219]()).
mn32:4.8	And they teach the four assemblies in order to uproot the underlying tendencies with well-rounded and coherent words and phrases.	Typically inclusive, Ānanda mentions the four assemblies of monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.
mn32:4.9	That’s the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park.”	NA
mn32:5.1	When he had spoken, Sāriputta said to Revata,	NA
mn32:5.2	“Reverend Revata, Ānanda has answered by speaking from his heart.	NA
mn32:5.3	And now we ask you the same question.”	NA
mn32:5.4	NA	NA
mn32:5.5	NA	NA
mn32:5.6	“Reverend Sāriputta, it’s a mendicant who enjoys retreat and loves retreat. They’re committed to inner serenity of the heart, they don’t neglect absorption, they’re endowed with discernment, and they frequent empty huts.	There were two prominent Revatas in the early Sangha. There was Revata of the Acacia Wood, who was said to be the foremost of forest dwellers ([an1.203](), [thag14.1](), [thag1.42]()). But this is probably Revata the Doubter, who was the most skilled in _jhāna_ ([an1.204](), [thag1.3]()). Early in his monastic life he struggled with doubt over small maters ([pli-tv-kd6:16.1.1]()). He overcame this ([ud5.7]()), but the name stuck.
mn32:5.7	That’s the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park.”	NA
mn32:6.1	When he had spoken, Sāriputta said to Anuruddha,	NA
mn32:6.2	“Reverend Anuruddha, Revata has answered by speaking from his heart.	NA
mn32:6.3	And now we ask you the same question.”	NA
mn32:6.4	NA	NA
mn32:6.5	NA	NA
mn32:6.6	“Reverend Sāriputta, it’s a mendicant who surveys a thousandfold galaxy with clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human,	Anuruddha is identified as foremost in clairvoyance at [an1.192](). | The verb _voloketi_ (“surveys”) is an elevated usage, only used of Anuruddha’s ability (see [an3.130:2.2]()) and when describing a Buddha “surveying” the world ([mn26:21.1]()).
mn32:6.7	just as a person with clear eyes could survey a thousand orbits from the upper floor of a royal longhouse.	This power is compared (in the Majjhima) with a man standing between two doors watching people come to and fro ([mn39:20.3](), [mn77:35.2](), [mn130:2.1]()), and (in the Dīgha) with someone in a longhouse watching people move about in the town square ([dn2:96.1](), [dn10:2.33.1]()). The unique phrasing here evokes the Wheel that manifests to a Wheel-Turning Monarch as he stands upstairs in the royal longhouse, which is thousand-spoked and complete with rim (_sahassāraṁ sanemikaṁ_, [mn129:34.2](), [dn26:4.9]()). The simile was evidently unclear to the ancients, as one Chinese parallel has instead “a thousand bricks” (presumably laid out to dry in the sun, MA 184 at T i 727b14). In the Pali tradition, _nemimaṇḍala_ is the outer cladding of a wheel rim, often iron (see commentary to [ja475]()). However, normally sutta similes draw directly from experience, and it is hard to imagine how one would survey a thousand wheel rims (unless perhaps a king overseeing chariot construction in his forecourt?) On the other hand, the Wheel is a solar symbol and _nemimaṇḍala_ could easily refer to the orbits of the stars, which would explain “looking at the sky” of EA 37.3 ( at T ii 711a3). On balance, I think the simile refers to a star-gazing king.

mn32:6.9	That’s the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park.”	NA
mn32:7.1	When he had spoken, Sāriputta said to Mahākassapa,	NA

mn32:7.5	NA	NA
mn32:7.6	“Reverend Sāriputta, it’s a mendicant who lives in the wilderness, eats only almsfood, wears rag robes, and owns just three robes; and they praise these things. They are of few wishes, content, secluded, aloof, and energetic; and they praise these things. They are accomplished in ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom; and they praise these things.	Mahākassapa’s austere lifestyle was renowned ([an1.191]()).
mn32:7.7	That’s the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park.”	NA
mn32:8.1	When he had spoken, Sāriputta said to Mahāmoggallāna,	NA

mn32:8.4	NA	NA
mn32:8.5	NA	NA
mn32:8.6	“Reverend Sāriputta, it’s when two mendicants engage in discussion about the teaching. They question each other and answer each other’s questions without faltering, and their discussion on the teaching flows on.	In the suttas, _abhidhamma_ means “about the teaching”. Here the prefix _abhi-_ conveys the same sense as the English “meta-”. | This is a surprising topic for Moggallāna, and all three Chinese parallels as well as Sanskrit fragments say Moggallāna praised psychic powers, in which he was the recognized expert ([an1.190]()). It seems certain the Pali is corrupt here, and MA 185 more plausibly attributes discussion on the teaching to Mahākaccāna.
mn32:8.7	That’s the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park.”	NA
mn32:9.1	Then Mahāmoggallāna said to Sāriputta,	NA

mn32:9.5	What kind of mendicant would beautify this park?”	NA
mn32:9.6	“Reverend Moggallāna, it’s when a mendicant masters their mind and is not mastered by it.	While one might expect Sāriputta to praise wisdom, all the parallels agree on this point. Indeed, Sāriputta also speaks in a similar way on mental mastery at [sn46.4]().

mn32:10.5	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.	NA
mn32:10.6	Then those venerables went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Venerable Sāriputta told the Buddha of how the mendicants had come to see him, and how he had asked Ānanda:	NA

mn33:0.1	Middle Discourses 33	NA
mn33:0.2	The Longer Discourse on the Cowherd	NA
mn33:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn33:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn33:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn33:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn33:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn33:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn33:2.1	“Mendicants, a cowherd with eleven factors can’t maintain and expand a herd of cattle.	Since organizing teachings by number is the hallmark of the Aṅguttara Nikāya, it comes as no surprise to see this pattern repeated in the Book of the Elevens at [an11.17](), [an11.22-29](), and [an11.502-981]().
mn33:2.2	What eleven?	NA
mn33:2.3	It’s when a cowherd doesn’t know form, is unskilled in characteristics, doesn’t pick out flies’ eggs, doesn’t dress wounds, doesn’t spread smoke, doesn’t know the ford, doesn’t know satisfaction, doesn’t know the trail, is not skilled in ranges, milks dry, and doesn’t show extra respect to the bulls who are fathers and leaders of the herd.	“Knowing form” (_rūpaññū _) means being able to keep track of the herd by reckoning or recognizing them. A better translation would be “appearance”, but I use “form” for consistency. | “Ford” (_tittha_) is a way across the river. | “Spreads smoke” (_dhūmaṁ kattā_) is the traditional practice of warding off flies and other  pests by burning cow dung, etc. | “Satisfy” (_pīta_) is less literal than “drink”, but clarifies the simile later on.
mn33:2.4	A cowherd with these eleven factors can’t maintain and expand a herd of cattle.	NA
mn33:3.1	In the same way, a mendicant with eleven qualities can’t achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training.	NA
mn33:3.2	What eleven?	NA
mn33:3.3	It’s when a mendicant doesn’t know form, is unskilled in characteristics, doesn’t pick out flies’ eggs, doesn’t dress wounds, doesn’t spread smoke, doesn’t know the ford, doesn’t know satisfaction, doesn’t know the trail, is not skilled in ranges, milks dry, and doesn’t show extra respect to senior mendicants of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha.	NA
mn33:4.1	And how does a mendicant not know form?	NA
mn33:4.2	It’s when a mendicant doesn’t truly understand that all form is the four principal states, or form derived from the four principal states.	NA
mn33:4.3	That’s how a mendicant doesn’t know form.	NA
mn33:5.1	And how is a mendicant not skilled in characteristics?	NA
mn33:5.2	It’s when a mendicant doesn’t understand that a fool is characterized by their deeds, and an astute person is characterized by their deeds.	NA
mn33:5.3	That’s how a mendicant isn’t skilled in characteristics.	NA
mn33:6.1	And how does a mendicant not pick out flies’ eggs?	NA
mn33:6.2	It’s when a mendicant tolerates a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen. They tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen. They don’t give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them.	NA

mn34:0.2	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd	NA
mn34:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn34:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Vajjis near Ukkacelā on the bank of the Ganges river.	The Buddha also gave a discourse here shortly after the deaths of Sāriputta and Moggallāna ([sn47.14:1.1]()).
mn34:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn34:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn34:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn34:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn34:2.1	“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was an unintelligent Magadhan cowherd. In the last month of the rainy season, in autumn, without inspecting the near shore or the far shore, he drove his cattle across a place with no ford on the Ganges river to the northern shore among the Suvidehans.	Thus illustrating the need to “know the ford” in the previous sutta ([mn33:2.3]()). | The Suvidehans are not mentioned anywhere else, and the commentary simply treats them as Videhans. But Videha lay to the north-east of Vajjī, and since the expansion of Vajjī and contraction of Videha before the Buddha’s time, it is unlikely that it bordered the Ganges opposite Magadha. Perhaps this story stems from a time when Videha did expand to the river, or perhaps there were folks who called themselves “good Videhans” after the eclipse of the kingdom.
mn34:3.1	But the cattle bunched up in mid-stream and came to ruin right there.	NA
mn34:3.2	Why is that?	NA
mn34:3.3	Because the unintelligent cowherd failed to inspect the shores before driving the cattle across at a place with no ford.	NA
mn34:3.4	In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who are unskilled in this world and the other world, unskilled in Māra’s dominion and its opposite, and unskilled in Death’s dominion and its opposite.

mn34:4.1	Once upon a time, mendicants, there was an intelligent Magadhan cowherd. In the last month of the rainy season, in autumn, after inspecting the near shore and the far shore, he drove his cattle across a ford on the Ganges river to the northern shore among the Suvidehans.	NA
mn34:5.1	First he drove across the bulls, the fathers and leaders of the herd.	NA
mn34:5.2	They breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shore.	NA

mn34:12.1	That is what the Buddha said.	NA

mn35:0.1	Middle Discourses 35	NA
mn35:0.2	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka	NA
mn35:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn35:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	NA
mn35:2.1	Now at that time Saccaka, the son of Jain parents, was staying in Vesālī. He was a debater and clever speaker deemed holy by many people.	Saccaka is called _nigaṇṭhaputta_, being the only person so described. The _nigaṇṭhas_ (“knotless ones”) were Jain ascetics and their followers were _nigaṇṭhasāvaka_ ([sn42.9:2.3]()). The commentary says he was the son of Jain parents. From the ending of this sutta, where he makes an offering of food, we can see he was not an ascetic, and from [mn36:48.11]() it is clear he was not a Jain. | This sutta includes a number of images, phrases, and allusions that appear reminiscent of the Brahmanical teacher Uddālaka Āruṇi, although none of the references are definitive. The bulk of Uddālaka’s teachings were to his son Śvetaketu, who became arrogant due to his learning (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.1.2), paralleling Saccaka’s arrogance.
mn35:2.2	He was telling a crowd in Vesālī,	NA
mn35:2.3	“I don’t see any ascetic or brahmin who would not shake and rock and tremble, sweating from the armpits, were I to take them on in debate—not a leader of an order or a community, or the tutor of a community, and not even one who claims to be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn35:2.4	Even an insentient post would shake and rock and tremble were I to take it on in debate.	NA
mn35:2.5	How much more then a human being!”	NA
mn35:3.1	Then Venerable Assaji robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.	Assaji was one the group of five mendicants who received the Buddha’s first discourse ([pli-tv-kd1:6.36.1]()). Shortly afterwards he inspired Sāriputta with a classic epitome of the teaching ([pli-tv-kd1:23.2.1]()). Note that Sāriputta waited politely until almsround was complete before approaching, whereas Saccaka just goes right ahead. We hear of a grave illness Assaji suffered later ([sn22.88]()). | Another Assaji, who is always paired with his friend Punabbasuka, was a lazy and indulgent monk ([mn70:4.1]()).
mn35:3.2	As Saccaka was going for a walk he saw Assaji coming off in the distance.	NA
mn35:3.3	He approached him and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn35:3.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, Saccaka stood to one side and said to Assaji,	NA
mn35:4.1	“Worthy Assaji, how does the ascetic Gotama guide his disciples? And on what topics does instruction to his disciples generally proceed?”	_Sāvake vineti_ (“guide his disciples”) is typically used by non-Buddhists. | The phrase _kathaṁbhāgā_ (and its counterpart _evaṁbhāgā_ in the next line) are unique. The literal sense is “with what portion”, and given the answer I think Saccaka is asking for a list of topics.
mn35:4.2	“Aggivessana, this is how the ascetic Gotama guides his disciples, and his instructions to disciples generally proceed on these topics:	Saccaka is addressed with the Bramanical clan name Aggivessana, probably after the lineage of his clan’s _purohita_, just as the Sakyans are called Gotama and the Mallas Vāseṭṭha.
mn35:4.3	‘Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent.	The five aggregates are mentioned as if the listener is expected to know them.
mn35:4.4	Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self.	NA
mn35:4.5	All conditions are impermanent. All things are not-self.’	NA
mn35:4.6	This is how the ascetic Gotama guides his disciples, and how instruction to his disciples generally proceeds.”	Despite this, this teaching that omits “suffering” (_dukkha_) is not taught by the Buddha at all. It only appears in one other sutta, where it is spoken by the mendicants after the Buddha’s passing ([sn22.90:2.2](); but see below at [mn35:9.5]()). Strikingly, both the current sutta and SN 22.90 share a common narrative pattern. In both cases, an interlocuter (Saccaka or Channa, both known for their conceit) asks for teaching from a lesser teacher (Assaji or unnamed mendicants). Their reply omits suffering, but this fails. So they seek a better teacher (the Buddha, Ānanda) who not only includes suffering, but specially emphasizes it ([mn35:21.2](), [sn22.90:9.7]()). This teaching is successful. This narrative journey mirrors that of Śvetaketu, who studied with others for twelve years before being shown true wisdom by his father Uddālaka. If we are on the right track, the point of the narrative is that it is essential to include suffering. This suggests that the Chinese parallels (SA 110 at T ii 35b4 and EA 37.10 at T ii 715b4), which do include the characteristic of _dukkha_ here, would be a product of later expansion and normalization.
mn35:4.7	“It’s sad to hear, worthy Assaji, that the ascetic Gotama has such a doctrine.	NA
mn35:4.8	Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet the worthy Gotama, and we can have a discussion. And hopefully I can dissuade him from this harmful misconception.”	NA
mn35:5.1	Now at that time around five hundred Licchavis were sitting together at the town hall on some business.	The Licchavis, whose name is derived from “bear”, dominated the Vajji Federation.
mn35:5.2	Then Saccaka went up to them and said,	NA
mn35:5.3	“Come forth, good Licchavīs, come forth! Today I am going to have a discussion with the ascetic Gotama.	NA
mn35:5.4	If he stands by the position stated to me by one of his well-known disciples—a mendicant named Assaji—I’ll take him on in debate and drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong man would grab a fleecy sheep and drag it to and fro and round about!	NA
mn35:5.5	NA	NA

mn35:5.9	NA	NA
mn35:5.10	I’ll play a game of hemp-washing with the ascetic Gotama, like a sixty-year-old elephant would plunge into a deep lotus pond and play a game of hemp-washing!

mn35:5.12	Come forth, good Licchavīs, come forth! Today I am going to have a discussion with the ascetic Gotama.”	NA
mn35:6.1	At that, some of the Licchavis said,	NA
mn35:6.2	“How can the ascetic Gotama refute Saccaka’s doctrine, when it is Saccaka who will refute Gotama’s doctrine?”	NA
mn35:6.3	But some of the Licchavis said,	NA
mn35:6.4	“Who is Saccaka to refute the Buddha’s doctrine, when it is the Buddha who will refute Saccaka’s doctrine?”	NA
mn35:6.5	Then Saccaka, escorted by the five hundred Licchavis, went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.	NA
mn35:7.1	At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air.	NA
mn35:7.2	Then Saccaka went up to them and said,	NA
mn35:7.3	“Good fellows, where is the worthy Gotama at present?	NA
mn35:7.4	For we want to see him.”	NA
mn35:7.5	“Aggivessana, the Buddha has plunged deep into the Great Wood and is sitting at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation.”	NA
mn35:8.1	Then Saccaka, together with a large group of Licchavis, went to see the Buddha in the Great Wood, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn35:8.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.	NA
mn35:8.3	Before sitting down to one side, some of the Licchavīs bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.	NA
mn35:9.1	Then Saccaka said to the Buddha,	NA
mn35:9.2	“I’d like to ask the worthy Gotama about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”	NA
mn35:9.3	“Ask what you wish, Aggivessana.”	NA
mn35:9.4	“How does the worthy Gotama guide his disciples? And on what topics does instruction to his disciples generally proceed?”	NA
mn35:9.5	“This is how I guide my disciples, and my instructions to disciples generally proceed on these topics:	If, as I have argued, Assaji’s presentation is meant to be inadequate, why does the Buddha endorse it here? The Buddha commonly endorses answers given by disciples, and this could have been a product of editorial standardization. After all, it remains the fact that it simply is not true that the Buddha normally teaches in this way.

mn35:10.3	“All the plants and seeds that achieve growth, increase, and maturity do so depending on the earth and grounded on the earth.	Saccaka argues by naturalistic analogy from singularity to plurality. Likewise Uddālaka, observing the natural world, pointed to the way that multiplicity emerges from singleness. When asked who he worships as self, Uddālaka answers the “earth”, which is said to be the “ground” (_pratiṣṭhā_, Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.17); due to this worship he enjoys food and offspring. However, he points to water rather than earth as the origin of _anna_, which is (plant) food but also stands for solidity in general (6.2.4; see too 6.11.1–2).

mn35:10.5	All the hard work that gets done depends on the earth and is grounded on the earth.	NA
mn35:10.6	NA	NA
mn35:10.7	In the same way, an individual’s self is form. Grounded on form they create merit and wickedness. An individual’s self is feeling … perception … choices … consciousness. Grounded on consciousness they create merit and wickedness.”	Saccaka treats the five aggregates as categories for classifying the self. And indeed elsewhere, such as [dn1](), we find various theorists describe the self as “form”, experiencing “feelings”, being “percipient”, etc. In identifying each of the five aggregates as self, Saccaka follows the method of “affirmation” whereby multiple phenomena are affirmed to be the self at deeper and deeper levels, in contrast with the method of “negation” where potential candidates for the self are denied until the final self is revealed. Uddālaka also preferred the method of affirmation, arguing that existence comes first and that the divinity pours itself in all the manifold forms of the world (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.2.2 ff.).
mn35:11.1	“Aggivessana, are you not saying this:	NA
mn35:11.2	‘Form is my self, feeling is my self, perception is my self, choices are my self, consciousness is my self’?”	NA
mn35:11.3	“Indeed, worthy Gotama, that is what I am saying.	NA
mn35:11.4	And this big crowd agrees with me!”	NA
mn35:11.5	“What has this big crowd to do with you?	NA
mn35:11.6	Please just unpack your own statement.”	NA
mn35:11.7	“Then, worthy Gotama, what I am saying is this:	NA
mn35:11.8	‘Form is my self, feeling is my self, perception is my self, choices are my self, consciousness is my self’.”	NA
mn35:12.1	“Well then, Aggivessana, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.	NA
mn35:12.2	What do you think, Aggivessana?	NA
mn35:12.3	Consider an anointed aristocratic king such as Pasenadi of Kosala or Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha.	NA
mn35:12.4	Would they have the power in their own realm to execute those who have incurred execution, fine those who have incurred fines, or banish those who have incurred banishment?”	The Pali uses the future passive participle, sometimes interpreted as “deserving of execution”. But this would imply that the Buddha endorsed capital punishment, which is unsupported elsewhere and contradicts his ethical principles. Rather, read in its weaker literal sense, “execute those to be executed”, i.e. those who have been found guilty of a crime incurring capital punishment. It is an acknowledgment of the king’s powers, not an endorsement of them.
mn35:12.5	“An anointed king would have such power, worthy Gotama.	NA
mn35:12.6	NA	NA
mn35:12.7	Even federations such as the	NA
mn35:12.8	Vajjis and Mallas	NA
mn35:12.9	have such power in their own realm.	Saccaka cannily appeals to the Licchavis by asserting their right to rule.
mn35:12.10	NA	NA
mn35:12.11	So of course an anointed king such as Pasenadi or Ajātasattu	NA
mn35:12.12	would wield such power, as is their right.”	Overstepping the Buddha’s position, Saccaka’s endorsement of capital punishment shows how far he has drifted from the non-violent doctrine of his Jain parents.
mn35:13.1	“What do you think, Aggivessana?	NA
mn35:13.2	When you say,	NA
mn35:13.3	‘Form is my self,’ do you have power over that form to say:	NA
mn35:13.4	‘May my form be like this! May it not be like that’?”	Also at [sn22.59:2.3](). This responds to the “inner controller” (_antaryāmin_) of Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.7. Uddālaka learned this from the centaur Kabandha in Madra (near modern Islamabad). He challenges Yājñavalkya, who explains it as the self who lives in the midst of all things, unknown but knowing, controlling all from within.
mn35:13.5	When he said this, Saccaka kept silent.	NA
mn35:13.6	The Buddha asked the question a second time,	NA
mn35:13.7	NA	NA
mn35:13.8	NA	NA
mn35:13.9	NA	NA
mn35:13.10	but Saccaka still kept silent.	NA
mn35:13.11	So the Buddha said to Saccaka,	NA
mn35:13.12	“Answer now, Aggivessana. Now is not the time for silence.	NA
mn35:13.13	If someone fails to answer a legitimate question when asked three times by the Buddha, their head explodes into seven pieces there and then.”	The threat of losing one’s head is found at eg. Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1.8.6 and Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.3.24, or at 3.9.26 when it actually did fall off. I cannot trace the detail of heads being split in seven to any early Sanskrit texts, but it is found in later texts such as Rāmāyaṇa 7.26.44c and Mahābhārata 14.7.2c.
mn35:14.1	Now at that time the spirit Vajirapāṇī, taking up a burning iron thunderbolt, blazing and glowing, stood in the air above Saccaka, thinking,	Vajirapāṇī (“lightning-bolt in hand”) appears here and in the parallel passage at [dn3:1.21.1](). The synonymous Vajrahasta (Pali _vajirahattha_, [dn20:12.1]()) is a frequent epithet of Indra in the Vedas (eg. _indro vajrahastaḥ_, Rig Veda 1.173.10a), confirming the commentary’s identification with Sakka. Much later, Mahayana texts adopted the name for a fierce Bodhisattva who was protector of the Dhamma.
mn35:14.2	“If this Saccaka doesn’t answer when asked a third time, I’ll blow his head into seven pieces there and then!”	NA
mn35:14.3	And both the Buddha and Saccaka could see Vajirapāṇī.	NA
mn35:14.4	Saccaka was terrified, shocked, and awestruck. Looking to the Buddha for shelter, protection, and refuge, he said,	NA
mn35:14.5	“Ask me, worthy Gotama. I will answer.”	NA

mn35:20.9	“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:	NA
mn35:20.10	‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”	This phrasing echoes Uddālaka’s famous description of the “subtlest’ self: “all that is the truth, that is the self, you are that” (_sarvaṁ tatsatyaṁ sa ātmā tattvamasi_, Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.8.7, etc.). In particular the phrase _tattvamasi_ is an exact parallel (in second person) to the Pali _esohamasmi_.  See too Uddālaka’s, “I am that, I indeed am that” (_iyam aham asmīyam aham asmīti_, Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.10.1; cf. 4.11.1, 4.12.1, 8.11.1–2). Likewise it is said, “I myself am that person” (_yo’sāvasau puruṣaḥ so’hamasmi_, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.15 = Īśā Upaniṣad 16). Depending on context, similar phrases might also depict the one who is attached to a false, limited self, thinking “I am he”, “this is mine” (_ahaṁ so, mamedaṁ_, Maitrī Upaniṣad 3.2).

mn35:21.2	Consider someone who resorts, draws near, and clings to suffering, regarding it thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’ Would such a person be able to completely understand suffering themselves, or live having wiped out suffering?”	NA
mn35:21.3	“How could they?	NA
mn35:21.4	No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
mn35:21.5	“What do you think, Aggivessana?	NA

mn35:21.7	NA	NA
mn35:21.8	“How could I not?	NA
mn35:21.9	Yes, worthy Gotama.”	NA
mn35:22.1	“Suppose, Aggivessana, there was a person in need of heartwood. Wandering in search of heartwood, they’d take a sharp axe and enter a forest.	NA
mn35:22.2	There they’d see a big banana tree, straight and young and grown free of defects.	NA
mn35:22.3	They’d cut it down at the base, cut off the top, and unroll the coiled sheaths.	NA
mn35:22.4	But they wouldn’t even find sapwood, much less heartwood.	NA
mn35:22.5	In the same way, when pursued, pressed, and grilled by me on your own doctrine, you turn out to be vacuous, hollow, and mistaken.	NA
mn35:22.6	But it was you who stated before the assembly of Vesālī:	NA
mn35:22.7	‘I don’t see any ascetic or brahmin who would not shake and rock and tremble, sweating from the armpits, were I to take them on in debate—not a leader of an order or a community, or the tutor of a community, and not even one who claims to be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn35:22.8	Even an insentient post would shake and rock and tremble were I to take it on in debate.	NA
mn35:22.9	How much more then a human being!’	NA
mn35:22.10	But sweat is pouring from your forehead; it’s soaked through your robe and drips on the ground.	The oddly prominent role of sweat in the discourse finds its parallel in Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.2.3, where Uddālaka argues that existence (_sat_) produces fire (_tejas_) and fire produces water, which is why you sweat when hot.
mn35:22.11	While I now have no sweat on my body.”	NA
mn35:22.12	So the Buddha revealed his golden body to the assembly.	NA
mn35:22.13	When this was said, Saccaka sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.	NA
mn35:23.1	Knowing this, the Licchavi Dummukha said to the Buddha,	Dummukha the Licchavi appears only here. The name, meaning “Ugly Face” seems odd, but it is also a term for a horse. A number of individuals of this name appear in Sanskritic literature, including one from Uddālaka’s home country of Pañcāla (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 8.23).
mn35:23.2	“A simile strikes me, Blessed One.”	NA
mn35:23.3	“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha.	NA
mn35:23.4	“Sir, suppose there was a lotus pond not far from a town or village,	The same simile appears at [sn4.24:8.1]().
mn35:23.5	and a crab lived there.	NA
mn35:23.6	Then several boys or girls would leave the town or village and go to the pond, where they’d pull out the crab and put it on dry land.	NA
mn35:23.7	Whenever that crab extended a claw, those boys or girls would snap, crack, and break it off with a stick or a stone.	The crab “extends” a claw as a meditator after absorption “extends” the mind to insight ([mn4:27.1]()). See too the simile at [sn35.240]().
mn35:23.8	And when that crab’s claws had all been snapped, cracked, and broken off it wouldn’t be able to return down into that lotus pond.	NA
mn35:23.9	In the same way, sir, the Buddha has snapped, cracked, and broken off all Saccaka’s twists, ducks, and dodges.	NA
mn35:23.10	Now he can’t get near the Buddha again looking for a debate.”	NA
mn35:24.1	But Saccaka said to him,	NA
mn35:24.2	“Hold on, Dummukha, hold on! I wasn’t talking with you, I was talking with the worthy Gotama.	NA
mn35:24.3	Worthy Gotama, leave aside that statement I made—as did various other ascetics and brahmins—	NA
mn35:24.4	it was, like, just a bit of nonsense.	Saccaka tries to wriggle out of his initial statement, just as modern trolls claim to speak in irony or humor.
mn35:24.5	How do you define a disciple of the worthy Gotama who follows instructions and responds to advice; who has gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, gained assurance, and is independent of others in the Teacher’s instructions?”	NA
mn35:24.6	“It’s when one of my disciples truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	This is the trainee (_sekha_). Knowing Saccaka’s attachment to his self theories, the Buddha frames his response with the standard passage on not-self.

mn35:25.1	“But how do you define a mendicant who is a perfected one, with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment?”	NA
mn35:25.2	“It’s when a mendicant truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ And having seen this with right understanding they’re freed by not grasping.

NA
mn35:25.7	That’s how to define a mendicant who is a perfected one, with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment.	NA
mn35:26.1	A mendicant whose mind is freed like this has three unsurpassable qualities:	NA
mn35:26.2	unsurpassable seeing, practice, and freedom.	Also at [dn33:1.10.119](), which is doubtless lifted from the current passage. A list of six unsurpassables is found at [an6.30](), but the only common item is “seeing” (_dassana_), which is defined as seeing the Buddha and his disciples. Here “seeing” is either seeing the Buddha which gives rise to faith, or else “seeing” the four noble truths; practice is the noble eightfold path; and freedom is the result of that path, arahantship. | As to why this unique set is chosen here, it is perhaps notable that three of the final similes of Uddālaka’s “subtlest” self (as above, [mn35:20.10]()) in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad speak of *seeing* (the kernel of a seed, 6.12.1–2), *walking* (from one village to the next, 6.14.2), and *freedom* (from punishment, 6.16.2).
mn35:26.3	They honor, respect, esteem, and venerate only the Realized One:	NA
mn35:26.4	‘The Blessed One is awakened, tamed, serene, crossed over, and quenched. And he teaches Dhamma for awakening, self-control, serenity, crossing over, and extinguishment.’”	NA
mn35:27.1	When he had spoken, Saccaka said to him,	NA
mn35:27.2	“Worthy Gotama, it was rude and impudent of me to imagine I could attack you in debate.	NA
mn35:27.3	For a person might find safety after attacking a rutting elephant, but not after attacking the worthy Gotama.	NA
mn35:27.4	A person might find safety after attacking a blazing mass of fire, but not after attacking the worthy Gotama.	NA
mn35:27.5	They might find safety after attacking a poisonous viper, but not after attacking the worthy Gotama.	NA
mn35:27.6	It was rude and impudent of me to imagine I could attack you in debate.	NA
mn35:27.7	Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”	NA
mn35:27.8	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
mn35:28.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Saccaka addressed those Licchavis,	NA
mn35:28.2	“Listen, gentlemen. I have invited the ascetic Gotama together with the Saṅgha of mendicants for tomorrow’s meal.	NA
mn35:28.3	You may all bring me what you think is suitable.”	NA
mn35:29.1	Then, when the night had passed, those Licchavis presented Saccaka with an offering of five hundred servings of food.	The idiom “presented with servings of food” (_thālipākaā bhattābhihāraṁ_) is elevated, occurring only in the context of aristocracy and sacrifice.
mn35:29.2	And Saccaka had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own park. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	NA
mn35:29.3	“It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.”	NA
mn35:30.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Saccaka’s park, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.	NA
mn35:30.2	Then Saccaka served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	NA
mn35:30.3	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Saccaka took a low seat and sat to one side.	NA
mn35:30.4	Then Saccaka said to the Buddha,	NA
mn35:30.5	“Worthy Gotama, may the merit and the growth of merit in this gift be for the happiness of the donors.”	_Puññamahī_ (“flourishing of merit”), for which there are several variants in text and commentary, is found only here and at [an7.53:6.10](), where it also concerns the dedication of merit to another. It might refer to the glorious results of merit, for which compare Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.2, “endowed with that (divine fruit for which he wished) he flourishes (_tena sampanno mahīyate_). Or else it might invoke the idea that merit flourishes depending on the recipient ([mn142]()), like a seed on the earth (_mahī_; cp. _puññakkhetta_), which fits nicely with the Buddha’s response here. | Bhikkhu Bodhi’s  remark that Saccaka “must have still considered himself a saint” is unwarranted, as the same phrase at AN 7.53 is used by a devoted lay follower. Clearly he was arrogant, but it was others who called him _sādhu_.
mn35:30.6	“Aggivessana, whatever comes from giving to a recipient of a religious donation such as yourself—who is not free of greed, hate, and delusion—will accrue to the donors.	According to one of the Chinese parallels, this statement was made by the Buddha in answer to a question by the mendicants after returning to the monastery (SA 110 at T ii 37b22).
mn35:30.7	Whatever comes from giving to a recipient of a religious donation such as myself—who is free of greed, hate, and delusion—will accrue to you.”	NA

mn36:0.2	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka	NA
mn36:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn36:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	NA
mn36:2.1	Now at that time in the morning the Buddha, being properly dressed, took his bowl and robe, wishing to enter Vesālī for alms.	NA
mn36:3.1	Then as Saccaka, the son of Jain parents, was going for a walk he approached the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.	This discourse appears to be set after the previous. In both suttas, while Saccaka is impressed by the Buddha, he does not go for refuge or indicate that he has been persuaded by his teachings.
mn36:3.2	Venerable Ānanda saw him coming off in the distance,	NA
mn36:3.3	and said to the Buddha,	NA
mn36:3.4	“Sir, Saccaka, the son of Jain parents, is coming. He’s a debater and clever speaker deemed holy by many people.	NA
mn36:3.5	He wants to discredit the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.	NA
mn36:3.6	Please, sir, sit for an hour out of sympathy.”	NA
mn36:3.7	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out.	NA
mn36:3.8	Then Saccaka went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,	NA
mn36:4.1	“Worthy Gotama, there are some ascetics and brahmins who live committed to the practice of developing physical endurance, without developing the mind.	“Development of physical endurance” is _kāyabhāvanā_, which is not a normal Buddhist term. It is introduced by Saccaka here and collected in [dn33:1.10.117](). The literal meaning is “development of the body”, but I translate in accord with the sense.
mn36:4.2	They suffer painful physical feelings.	NA
mn36:4.3	This happened to someone once. Their thighs became paralyzed, their heart burst, hot blood gushed from their mouth, and they went mad and lost their mind.	NA

mn36:4.12	Because their physical endurance was not developed.	Saccaka’s question shows he was aware of the danger of pursuing of extreme practices and the need for balance. It remains the case today that imbalanced and excessive practices lead to physical and mental breakdowns.
mn36:4.13	It occurs to me that	NA
mn36:4.14	The worthy Gotama’s disciples must live committed to the practice of developing the mind, without developing physical endurance.”	NA
mn36:5.1	“But Aggivessana, what have you heard about the development of physical endurance?”	NA
mn36:5.2	“Take, for example,	NA
mn36:5.3	Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saṅkicca, and the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla.	Described as prominent sages of the Ājīvakas at [mn76:53.6]() and [an6.57:7.1](). Gosāla was one of the oft-mentioned six ascetic teachers (see below [mn36:48.7]()), while the other two are unknown outside of these passing mentions. But the phrasing of this passage suggests that they too, like Gosāla, were contemporaries of the Buddha.
mn36:5.4	They go naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on their behalf, or an invitation for a meal.	NA
mn36:5.5	They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who lives with a man; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or beer or wine, and drink no fermented gruel.	NA
mn36:5.6	They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls.	NA
mn36:5.7	They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day.	NA
mn36:5.8	They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals.”	The earliest Jain text speaks of Mahāvīra eating “only every sixth meal, or eighth, or tenth, or twelfth” (Ācāraṅgasūtra 1.8.4.7).
mn36:6.1	“But Aggivessana, do they get by on so little?”	NA
mn36:6.2	“No, worthy Gotama.	NA
mn36:6.3	Sometimes they eat luxury fresh and cooked foods and drink a variety of luxury beverages.	NA
mn36:6.4	They gather their body’s strength, build it up, and get fat.”	NA
mn36:6.5	“What they earlier gave up, they later got back. That is how there is the increase and decrease of this body.	NA
mn36:6.6	But Aggivessana, what have you heard about development of the mind?”	NA
mn36:6.7	When Saccaka was questioned by the Buddha about development of the mind, he was stumped.	While pre-Buddhist texts describe a contemplative and reflective culture, they do not contain clear instructions for meditation. It seems that the practice of explicitly teaching meditation methods was an innovation of the Buddha.
mn36:7.1	So the Buddha said to Saccaka,	NA
mn36:7.2	“The development of physical endurance that you have described is not the legitimate development of physical endurance in the noble one’s training.	NA
mn36:7.3	And since you don’t even understand the development of physical endurance, how can you possibly understand the development of the mind?	NA
mn36:7.4	Still, as to how someone is undeveloped in physical endurance and mind, and how someone is developed in physical endurance and mind,	NA
mn36:7.5	listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn36:7.6	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Saccaka.	NA
mn36:7.7	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn36:8.1	“And how is someone undeveloped in physical endurance and mind?	NA
mn36:8.2	Take an unlearned ordinary person who has a pleasant feeling.	NA
mn36:8.3	When they experience a pleasant feeling they become full of lust for it.	NA
mn36:8.4	Then that pleasant feeling ceases.	NA
mn36:8.5	And when it ceases, a painful feeling arises.	NA
mn36:8.6	When they suffer painful feeling, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.	NA
mn36:8.7	Because their physical endurance is undeveloped, pleasant feelings occupy the mind. And because their mind is undeveloped, painful feelings occupy the mind.	NA
mn36:8.8	Anyone whose mind is occupied by both pleasant and painful feelings like this is undeveloped both in physical endurance and in mind.	NA
mn36:9.1	And how is someone developed in physical endurance and mind?	NA
mn36:9.2	Take a learned noble disciple who has a pleasant feeling.	NA
mn36:9.3	When they experience a pleasant feeling they don’t become full of lust for it.	NA
mn36:9.4	Then that pleasant feeling ceases.	NA
mn36:9.5	And when it ceases, painful feeling arises.	NA
mn36:9.6	When they suffer painful feelings they don’t sorrow or wail or lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.	NA
mn36:9.7	Because their physical endurance is developed, pleasant feelings don’t occupy the mind. And because their mind is developed, painful feelings don’t occupy the mind.	NA
mn36:9.8	Anyone whose mind is not occupied by both pleasant and painful feelings like this is developed both in physical endurance and in mind.”	NA
mn36:10.1	“I am quite confident that the worthy Gotama	NA
mn36:10.2	is developed in physical endurance and in mind.”	NA
mn36:10.3	“Your words are clearly invasive and intrusive, Aggivessana.	This is a standard response to someone making unwarranted assumptions about personal spiritual development ([an3.60:18.1](), [an4.35:5.1](), [mn127:17.8]()).
mn36:10.4	Nevertheless, I will answer you.	NA
mn36:10.5	Ever since I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness, it has not been possible for any pleasant or painful feeling to occupy my mind.”	The Buddha is not speaking about enlightenment, but about his determination to persevere.
mn36:11.1	“Worthy Gotama mustn’t have experienced the kind of pleasant or painful feelings that would occupy the mind.”	For the idiom _na hi nūna_, compare [an8.86:5.3]() and [an4.67:2.1]().
mn36:12.1	“How could I not, Aggivessana?	NA
mn36:12.2	Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought:	NA
mn36:12.3	‘Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide open.	NA
mn36:12.4	It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	NA
mn36:12.5	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	NA
mn36:13.1	Some time later, while still with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn36:13.2	Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	See [mn26:14.1]() ff. for notes.
mn36:13.3	‘Reverend Kālāma, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’	NA
mn36:13.4	Āḷāra Kālāma replied,	NA
mn36:13.5	‘Stay, venerable.	NA
mn36:13.6	This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’	NA
mn36:13.7	I quickly memorized that teaching.	NA
mn36:13.8	As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.	NA
mn36:13.9	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn36:13.10	‘It is not solely by mere faith that Āḷāra Kālāma declares: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”	NA
mn36:13.11	Surely he meditates knowing and seeing this teaching.’	NA
mn36:13.12	So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	NA
mn36:13.13	‘Reverend Kālāma, to what extent do you say you’ve realized this teaching with your own insight?’	NA
mn36:13.14	When I said this, he declared the dimension of nothingness.	NA
mn36:13.15	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn36:13.16	‘It’s not just Āḷāra Kālāma who has faith,	NA
mn36:13.17	energy,	NA
mn36:13.18	mindfulness,	NA
mn36:13.19	immersion,	NA
mn36:13.20	and wisdom; I too have these things.	NA
mn36:13.21	Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Āḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insight?’	NA
mn36:13.22	I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.	NA
mn36:14.1	So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	NA
mn36:14.2	‘Reverend Kālāma, is it up to this point that you realized this teaching with your own insight, and declare having achieved it?’	NA
mn36:14.3	‘I have, reverend.’	NA
mn36:14.4	‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’	NA
mn36:14.5	‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate	NA
mn36:14.6	to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!	NA
mn36:14.7	So the teaching that I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it.	NA
mn36:14.8	The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it, I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it.	NA
mn36:14.9	So the teaching that I know, you know, and the teaching you know, I know.	NA
mn36:14.10	I am like you and you are like me.	NA
mn36:14.11	Come now, reverend! We should both lead this community together.’	NA
mn36:14.12	And that is how my tutor Āḷāra Kālāma placed me, his pupil, on the same position as him, and honored me with lofty praise.	NA
mn36:14.13	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn36:14.14	‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingness.’	NA
mn36:14.15	Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.	NA
mn36:15.1	I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	NA
mn36:15.2	‘Reverend, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’	NA
mn36:15.3	Uddaka replied,	NA
mn36:15.4	‘Stay, venerable.	NA
mn36:15.5	This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’	NA
mn36:15.6	I quickly memorized that teaching.	NA
mn36:15.7	As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.	NA
mn36:15.8	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn36:15.9	‘It is not solely by mere faith that Rāma declared: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”	NA
mn36:15.10	Surely he meditated knowing and seeing this teaching.’	NA
mn36:15.11	So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	NA
mn36:15.12	‘Reverend, to what extent did Rāma say he’d realized this teaching with his own insight?’	NA
mn36:15.13	When I said this, Uddaka son of Rāma declared the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	NA
mn36:15.14	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn36:15.15	‘It’s not just Rāma who had faith,	NA
mn36:15.16	energy,	NA
mn36:15.17	mindfulness,	NA
mn36:15.18	immersion,	NA
mn36:15.19	and wisdom; I too have these things.	NA
mn36:15.20	Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Rāma said he had realized with his own insight?’	NA
mn36:15.21	I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.	NA
mn36:15.22	So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	NA
mn36:15.23	‘Reverend, had Rāma realized this teaching with his own insight up to this point, and declared having achieved it?’	NA
mn36:15.24	‘He had, reverend.’	NA
mn36:15.25	‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’	NA
mn36:15.26	‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate	NA
mn36:15.27	to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!	NA
mn36:15.28	The teaching that Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it, you have realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it. The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it, Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it.	NA
mn36:15.29	So the teaching that Rāma directly knew, you know, and the teaching you know, Rāma directly knew.	NA
mn36:15.30	Rāma was like you and you are like Rāma.	NA
mn36:15.31	Come now, reverend! You should lead this community.’	NA
mn36:15.32	And that is how my spiritual companion Uddaka son of Rāma placed me in the position of a tutor and honored me with lofty praise.	NA
mn36:15.33	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn36:15.34	‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’	NA
mn36:15.35	Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.	NA
mn36:16.1	I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands, I arrived at the town of Senā in Uruvelā.	NA
mn36:16.2	There I saw a delightful park, a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby was a village to resort to for alms.	NA
mn36:16.3	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn36:16.4	‘This park is truly delightful, a lovely grove with a flowing river that’s clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby there’s a village to resort to for alms.	NA
mn36:16.5	This is good enough for striving for a gentleman wanting to strive.’	NA
mn36:16.6	So I sat down right there, thinking:	NA
mn36:16.7	‘This is good enough for striving.’	NA
mn36:17.1	And then these three similes, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me.	Also at [mn85:15.1]() and [mn100:14.1](). These similes, which illustrate the importance of detachment from sensual pleasures and the uselessness of fervent austerities, would fit better below, after the austerities and before _jhāna_ ([mn36:30.1]()). A parallel to this passage preserved in a fragmentary Sanskrit manuscript of the Dīrgha Āgama does indeed place these similes there, while other parallels vary the content or position of the similes to a degree.
mn36:17.2	Suppose there was a green, sappy log, and it was lying in water.	NA
mn36:17.3	Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking	NA
mn36:17.4	to light a fire and produce heat.	NA
mn36:17.5	What do you think, Aggivessana?	NA
mn36:17.6	By drilling the stick against that green, sappy log lying in the water, could they light a fire and produce heat?”	_Abhimanthento_ must be “drilling” rather than “rubbing”, which does not produce fire. See too the simile of the man “drilling” into the head below ([mn36:22.5]()).
mn36:17.7	“No, worthy Gotama.	NA
mn36:17.8	Why not?	NA
mn36:17.9	Because it’s a green, sappy log, and it’s lying in the water.	NA
mn36:17.10	That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.”	NA
mn36:17.11	“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who don’t live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures. They haven’t internally given up or stilled desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and passion for sensual pleasures. Regardless of whether or not they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion, they are incapable of knowledge and vision, of supreme awakening.	NA
mn36:17.12	NA	NA
mn36:17.13	This was the first example that occurred to me.	NA
mn36:18.1	Then a second example occurred to me.	NA
mn36:18.2	Suppose there was a green, sappy log, and it was lying on dry land far from the water.	NA
mn36:18.3	Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking	NA
mn36:18.4	to light a fire and produce heat.	NA
mn36:18.5	What do you think, Aggivessana?	NA
mn36:18.6	By drilling the stick against that green, sappy log on dry land far from water, could they light a fire and produce heat?”	NA
mn36:18.7	“No, worthy Gotama.	NA
mn36:18.8	Why not?	NA
mn36:18.9	Because it’s still a green, sappy log, despite the fact that it’s lying on dry land far from water.	NA
mn36:18.10	That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.”	NA
mn36:18.11	“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures. But they haven’t internally given up or stilled desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and passion for sensual pleasures. Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion, they are incapable of knowledge and vision, of supreme awakening.	NA
mn36:18.12	This was the second example that occurred to me.	NA
mn36:19.1	Then a third example occurred to me.	NA
mn36:19.2	Suppose there was a dried up, withered log, and it was lying on dry land far from the water.	NA
mn36:19.3	Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking	NA
mn36:19.4	to light a fire and produce heat.	NA
mn36:19.5	What do you think, Aggivessana?	NA
mn36:19.6	By drilling the stick against that dried up, withered log on dry land far from water, could they light a fire and produce heat?”	NA
mn36:19.7	“Yes, worthy Gotama.	NA
mn36:19.8	Why is that?	NA
mn36:19.9	Because it’s a dried up, withered log, and it’s lying on dry land far from water.”	NA
mn36:19.10	“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures. And they have internally given up and stilled desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and passion for sensual pleasures. Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion, they are capable of knowledge and vision, of supreme awakening.	NA
mn36:19.11	This was the third example that occurred to me.	NA
mn36:19.12	These are the three similes, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, that occurred to me.	NA
mn36:20.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn36:20.2	‘Why don’t I, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, squeeze, squash, and scorch mind with mind?’	This, the most gentle of the austere practices, was occasionally recommended by the Buddha as a last resort ([mn20:7.2]()).
mn36:20.3	So that’s what I did,	NA
mn36:20.4	until sweat ran from my armpits.	NA
mn36:20.5	It was like when a strong man grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes, squashes, and crushes them.	NA
mn36:20.6	In the same way, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, I squeezed, squashed, and crushed mind with mind until sweat ran from my armpits.	NA
mn36:20.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	NA
mn36:20.8	But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind.	NA
mn36:21.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn36:21.2	‘Why don’t I practice the breathless absorption?’	This practice seems like an extreme form of “breath control” (_prāṇayāma_) which was a prominent feature of later Yoga. While the breath played an extremely important role in pre-Buddhist texts, no corresponding practice is detailed. However, precursors may be seen in passages such as Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.7.16, where in response to Uddālaka’s question, Yājnavalkya says, “He who controls the breath within is the self, the inner controller, the immortal” (_yaḥ prāṇamantaro yamayati, eṣa ta ātmāntaryāmyamṛtaḥ_). Jaiminīya Brāhmaņa 1.42 describes a practice of deliberate asphyxiation to induce a near-death experience. Varuṇa deprived his son Bhṛgu of breath in order to send him on a journey to the “other world”. There Bhṛgu saw men cutting other men to pieces and eating them, and other sights both horrifying and beautiful, all the while wondering if what he saw was real, before his breath was returned to him.
mn36:21.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose.	NA
mn36:21.4	But then winds came out my ears making a loud noise,	NA
mn36:21.5	like the puffing of a blacksmith’s bellows.	NA
mn36:21.6	NA	NA
mn36:21.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	NA
mn36:21.8	But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind.	NA
mn36:22.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn36:22.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	NA
mn36:22.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears.	NA
mn36:22.4	But then strong winds ground my head,	NA
mn36:22.5	like a strong man was drilling into my head with a sharp point.	NA
mn36:22.6	NA	NA
mn36:22.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	NA
mn36:22.8	But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind.	NA
mn36:23.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn36:23.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	NA
mn36:23.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears.	NA
mn36:23.4	But then I got a severe headache,	NA
mn36:23.5	like a strong man was tightening a tough leather strap around my head.	NA
mn36:23.6	NA	NA
mn36:23.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	NA
mn36:23.8	But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind.	NA
mn36:24.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn36:24.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	NA
mn36:24.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears.	NA
mn36:24.4	But then strong winds carved up my belly,	NA
mn36:24.5	like a deft butcher or their apprentice was slicing my belly open with a sharp meat cleaver.	NA
mn36:24.6	NA	NA
mn36:24.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	NA
mn36:24.8	But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind.	NA
mn36:25.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn36:25.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	NA
mn36:25.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears.	NA
mn36:25.4	But then there was an intense burning in my body,	NA
mn36:25.5	like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals.	NA
mn36:25.6	NA	NA
mn36:25.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	NA
mn36:25.8	But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind.	NA
mn36:26.1	Then some deities saw me and said,	NA
mn36:26.2	‘The ascetic Gotama is dead.’	NA
mn36:26.3	Others said,	NA
mn36:26.4	‘He’s not dead, but he’s dying.’	NA
mn36:26.5	Others said,	NA
mn36:26.6	‘He’s not dead or dying. The ascetic Gotama is a perfected one, for that is how the perfected ones live.’	NA
mn36:27.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn36:27.2	‘Why don’t I practice completely cutting off food?’	NA
mn36:27.3	But deities came to me and said,	NA
mn36:27.4	‘Good fellow, don’t practice totally cutting off food.	NA
mn36:27.5	If you do, we’ll infuse heavenly nectar into your pores and you will live on that.’	NA
mn36:27.6	Then I thought,	NA
mn36:27.7	‘If I claim to be completely fasting while these deities are infusing heavenly nectar in my pores, that would be a lie on my part.’	NA
mn36:27.8	So I dismissed those deities, saying, ‘There’s no need.’	NA
mn36:28.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn36:28.2	‘Why don’t I just take a little bit of food each time, a handful of broth made from mung beans, horse gram, chickpeas, or green gram?’	NA
mn36:28.3	So that’s what I did,	NA
mn36:28.4	until my body became extremely emaciated.	NA
mn36:28.5	Due to eating so little, my major and minor limbs became like the joints of an eighty-year-old or a dying man,	NA
mn36:28.6	my bottom became like a camel’s hoof,	NA
mn36:28.7	my vertebrae stuck out like beads on a string,	NA
mn36:28.8	and my ribs were as gaunt as the broken-down rafters on an old barn.	NA
mn36:28.9	Due to eating so little, the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets, like the gleam of water sunk deep down a well.	NA
mn36:28.10	Due to eating so little, my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bitter-gourd in the wind and sun.	NA
mn36:28.11	Due to eating so little, the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone, so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone, and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my belly.	NA
mn36:28.12	Due to eating so little, when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right there.	NA
mn36:28.13	Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out.	NA
mn36:29.1	Then some people saw me and said: ‘The ascetic Gotama is black.’	NA
mn36:29.2	Some said: ‘He’s not black, he’s brown.’	NA
mn36:29.3	Some said: ‘He’s neither black nor brown. The ascetic Gotama has tawny skin.’	NA
mn36:29.4	That’s how far the pure, bright complexion of my skin had been ruined by taking so little food.	NA
mn36:30.1	Then I thought,	NA
mn36:30.2	‘Whatever ascetics and brahmins have experienced painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion—whether in the past, future, or present—this is as far as it goes, no-one has done more than this.	NA
mn36:30.3	NA	NA
mn36:30.4	NA	NA
mn36:30.5	But I have not achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones by this severe, grueling work.	NA
mn36:30.6	Could there be another path to awakening?’	NA
mn36:31.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn36:31.2	‘I recall sitting in the cool shade of a black plum tree while my father the Sakyan was off working. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	The gentle and pleasant practice of _jhāna_ is contrasted with the fiery austerities. The Bodhisatta had previously developed meditation under his former teachers, which included the practice of _jhāna_. But there the practice was embedded in theory, since he first memorized scripture, which would have taught him that such states were a revelation of the true self as the cosmic divinity of sheer consciousness. Thus what he rejected was “that teaching”, i.e. the system of philosophy and practice as a whole, which leads only to rebirth in a realm that, for all its sublimity, is still conditioned. Now he recalls entering deep meditation with the innocence of youth, following no system or philosophy. This showed him that peace of mind is a natural process of letting go, not dependent on (Upaniṣadic) metaphysics.
mn36:31.3	Could that be the path to awakening?’	NA
mn36:31.4	Stemming from that memory came the understanding:	NA
mn36:31.5	‘*That* is the path to awakening!’	Compare [dhp274:1]().
mn36:32.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn36:32.2	‘Why am I afraid of that pleasure, for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities?’	NA
mn36:32.3	Then I thought,	NA
mn36:32.4	‘I’m not afraid of that pleasure, for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities.’	NA
mn36:33.1	Then I thought,	NA
mn36:33.2	‘I can’t achieve that pleasure with a body so excessively emaciated. Why don’t I eat some solid food, some rice and porridge?’	The dependence of the mind on food was proven by Uddālaka when he asked Śvetaketu to go without food for fifteen days, after which he could not recall any of the hymns (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.7). | Note how this contrasts with the unhealthy cycle of starving and fattening described above ([mn36:6.5]()).
mn36:33.3	So I ate some solid food.	NA
mn36:33.4	Now at that time the five mendicants were attending on me, thinking,	NA
mn36:33.5	‘The ascetic Gotama will tell us of any truth that he realizes.’	NA
mn36:33.6	But when I ate some solid food, they left disappointed in me, saying,	NA
mn36:33.7	‘The ascetic Gotama has become indulgent; he has strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence.’	NA
mn36:34.1	After eating solid food and gathering my strength, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn36:34.2	But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind.	NA
mn36:35-37.1	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn36:35-37.2	But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind.	NA
mn36:35-37.3	And with the fading away of rapture, I entered and remained in the third absorption, where I meditated with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA
mn36:35-37.4	But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind.	NA
mn36:35-37.5	With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I entered and remained in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
mn36:35-37.6	But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind.	NA
mn36:38.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward recollection of past lives.	NA
mn36:38.2	I recollected my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	NA
mn36:39.1	This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the night.	NA
mn36:39.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	NA
mn36:39.3	But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind.	NA
mn36:40.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	NA
mn36:40.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	NA
mn36:41.1	This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of the night.	NA
mn36:41.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	NA
mn36:41.3	But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind.	NA
mn36:42.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	NA
mn36:42.2	I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’	NA
mn36:42.3	I truly understood: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements.’	NA
mn36:43.1	Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	NA
mn36:43.2	When it was freed, I knew it was freed.	NA
mn36:43.3	I understood: ‘Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.’	NA
mn36:44.1	This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the last watch of the night.	NA
mn36:44.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	NA
mn36:44.3	But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind.	NA
mn36:45.1	Aggivessana, I recall teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of many hundreds,	This passage is unique and its purpose here unclear,
mn36:45.2	and each person thought	NA
mn36:45.3	that I was teaching the Dhamma especially for them.	NA
mn36:45.4	But it should not be seen like this.	NA
mn36:45.5	The Realized One teaches others only so that they can understand.	NA
mn36:45.6	When that talk was finished, I stilled, settled, unified, and immersed my mind in samādhi internally, using the same meditation subject as a basis of immersion that I used before, which I regularly use to meditate.”	Here _samādhinimitta_ as usual means the subject of meditation, probably the breath.
mn36:45.7	“I’d believe that of the worthy Gotama, just like a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha.	Saccaka is not saying that the Buddha *is* enlightened, merely he is *like* one who is enlightened (_yathā taṁ arahato_).
mn36:45.8	But do you ever recall sleeping during the day?”	Saccaka reveals his bad faith; he is more interested in trapping the Buddha than in learning.
mn36:46.1	“I do recall that in the last month of the summer, I have spread out my outer robe folded in four and lain down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware.”	NA
mn36:46.2	“Some ascetics and brahmins call that a deluded abiding.”	He deflects by pointing to others, as he also did at [mn35:11.4]().
mn36:46.3	“That’s not how to define whether someone is deluded or not.	NA
mn36:46.4	But as to how to define whether someone is deluded or not,	NA
mn36:46.5	listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn36:46.6	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Saccaka.	NA
mn36:46.7	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn36:47.1	“Anyone who has not given up the defilements that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death is deluded, I say.	NA
mn36:47.2	For it’s not giving up the defilements that makes you deluded.	NA
mn36:47.3	Anyone who has given up the defilements that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death—is not deluded, I say.	NA
mn36:47.4	For it’s giving up the defilements that makes you not deluded.	NA
mn36:47.5	The Realized One has given up the defilements that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death. He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future.	NA
mn36:47.6	Just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth,	NA
mn36:47.7	in the same way, the Realized One has given up the defilements so they are unable to arise in the future.”	NA
mn36:48.1	When he had spoken, Saccaka said to him,	NA
mn36:48.2	“It’s incredible, worthy Gotama, it’s amazing!	NA
mn36:48.3	How when the worthy Gotama is repeatedly attacked with inappropriate and intrusive criticism, the complexion of his skin brightens and the color of his face becomes clear, just like a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha!	NA
mn36:48.4	I recall taking on Pūraṇa Kassapa in debate.	NA
mn36:48.5	He dodged the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points, and displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness.	NA
mn36:48.6	But when the worthy Gotama is repeatedly attacked with inappropriate and intrusive criticism, the complexion of his skin brightens and the color of his face becomes clear, just like a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn36:48.7	I recall taking on the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla,	NA
mn36:48.8	Ajita of the hair blanket,	NA
mn36:48.9	Pakudha Kaccāyana,	NA
mn36:48.10	Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta,	NA
mn36:48.11	and the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan in debate.	This shows that despite his Jain parentage, and despite his citation of Ājīvakas above, Saccaka was no adherent of these philosophies. It seems that he was a contrarian at heart.
mn36:48.12	They all dodged the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points, and displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness.	NA
mn36:48.13	But when the worthy Gotama is repeatedly attacked with inappropriate and intrusive criticism, the complexion of his skin brightens and the color of his face becomes clear, just like a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn36:48.14	Well, now, worthy Gotama, I must go.	NA
mn36:48.15	I have many duties, and much to do.”	NA
mn36:48.16	“Please, Aggivessana, go at your convenience.”	NA
mn36:48.17	Then Saccaka, the son of Jain parents, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got up from his seat and left.	NA
mn37:0.1	Middle Discourses 37	NA
mn37:0.2	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving	NA
mn37:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn37:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.	NA
mn37:2.1	And then Sakka, lord of gods, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:	A long account of Sakka’s first meeting with the Buddha and conversion is found at [dn21](). There he is said to have attained stream-entry, and so is destined for full awakening. Yet even a stream-enterer may slow their progress by negligence ([snp2.1:9.3]()) | Sakka’s epithet “lord of gods” (_devānamindo_) evokes his more familiar Sanskrit name, Indra.
mn37:2.2	“Sir, how do you briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans?”	This question directly follows on from the final question at [dn21:2.6.9](), where Sakka asks *whether* all ascetics and brahmins have reached the ultimate goal. Here he delves deeper into what that means. | Now that he is a confirmed Buddhist, Sakka switches from “ascetics and brahmins” to “mendicants”. | This passage has an exact parallel at [an7.61:12.2](), and a variation at [sn35:80.1]().
mn37:3.1	“lord of gods, take a mendicant who has heard:	NA
mn37:3.2	‘Nothing is worth insisting on.’	The Buddha is calling back to the previous conversation, where immediately before asking about the ultimate goal, Sakka had asked why all ascetics did not share a common doctrine ([dn21:2.6.6]()). The Buddha answered that, though the world has many and diverse elements, ascetics tend to fixate on one aspect and “insist” it is the only truth.
mn37:3.3	When a mendicant has heard that	NA
mn37:3.4	nothing is worth insisting on,	NA
mn37:3.5	they directly know all things. Directly knowing all things, they completely understand all things. Completely understanding all things, when they experience any kind of feeling—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—	One who has learned the theory of non-attachment is still liable to become attached, so they apply their knowledge to experiential insight into “all things”. Normally “complete understanding” (_pariññā_) indicates arahantship, but here it reinforces “direct knowledge” (_abhiññā_) as the wisdom of stream-entry. However, the force of attachment is so deeply ingrained that even a stream-enterer, such as Sakka, with both theoretical and experiential wisdom is still not free. So they must then continue to meditate on the feelings in order to let go fully.
mn37:3.6	they meditate observing impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in those feelings.	NA
mn37:3.7	Meditating in this way, they don’t grasp at anything in the world.	NA
mn37:3.8	Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.	NA
mn37:3.9	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’	NA
mn37:3.10	That’s how I briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans.”	NA
mn37:4.1	Then Sakka, lord of gods, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.	NA
mn37:5.1	Now at that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was sitting not far from the Buddha.	NA
mn37:5.2	He thought,	NA
mn37:5.3	“Did that spirit comprehend what the Buddha said when he agreed with him, or not?	Moggallāna refers to Sakka as a “spirit” (_yakkha_).
mn37:5.4	Why don’t I find out?”	NA
mn37:5.5	NA	NA
mn37:6.1	And then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Eastern Monastery and reappeared among the gods of the thirty-three.	Moggallāna was the foremost in psychic powers.
mn37:7.1	Now at that time Sakka was amusing himself in the Single Lotus Park, supplied and provided with a heavenly orchestra.	A _pañcaṅgikatūriya_ is a band of five musicians, a “quintet”. Here it is amplified a hundredfold, so I translate “orchestra”. | “Single lotus” (_ekapuṇḍarīka_) appears as an auspicious epithet in a prayer for wealth at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.3.6.
mn37:7.2	Seeing Mahāmoggallāna coming off in the distance,	NA
mn37:7.3	he dismissed the orchestra, approached Mahāmoggallāna, and said,	NA
mn37:7.4	“Come, my good Moggallāna! Welcome, good fellow!	NA
mn37:7.5	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.	NA
mn37:7.6	Sit, my good Moggallāna, this seat is for you.”	NA
mn37:7.7	Mahāmoggallāna sat down on the seat spread out,	NA
mn37:7.8	while Sakka took a low seat and sat to one side.	NA
mn37:7.9	Mahāmoggallāna said to him,	NA
mn37:8.1	“Kosiya, how did the Buddha briefly explain freedom through the ending of craving?	Moggallāna refers to Sakka as “Kosiya” rather than the Buddha’s “lord of gods”. Old gods like Sakka tend to accrue many names. The word _kosiya_ is explained by the commentaries as “owl”, which, if correct, would have been the totem for a clan of that name. It is, however, a patronymic: Rig Veda 1.10.11 has _indra kauśika_ which means “Indra, son of Kuśika (or Kuśa)”. _Kuśa_ grass is critical to the performance of Vedic rites, and the label probably initially implied “Brahmanized”, i.e. a king whose reign was authorized according to Vedic ritual. Kosiya is said to be a low class family name ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:2.1.18]()).
mn37:8.2	Please share this talk with me so that I can also get to hear it.”	NA
mn37:8.3	“My good Moggallāna, I have many duties, and much to do,	NA
mn37:8.4	not only for myself, but also for the gods of the thirty-three.	NA
mn37:8.5	Still, what is properly heard, learned, attended, and memorized does not vanish all of a sudden.	The commentary reads _no_ as a personal pronoun (_amhākaṁ_) which results in the sense, “Even what I have well remembered quickly vanishes.” This is logically dubious—how is it “properly learned” if it quickly vanishes?—and contradicted below where Sakka shows that he does in fact remember perfectly well ([mn37:12.5]()). Instead, read _no_ as negative particle. Sakka is brushing Moggallāna off by insisting he has learned his lesson, without taking the trouble to actually remember it.
mn37:8.6	Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the titans.	He tries to distract Moggallāna with talk of his glory days, rehashing vendettas that were old even in the Vedas.
mn37:8.7	In that battle the gods won and the titans lost.	NA
mn37:8.8	When I returned from that battle as a conqueror, I created the Palace of Victory.	NA
mn37:8.9	The Palace of Victory has a hundred towers.	NA
mn37:8.10	Each tower has seven hundred chambers.	NA
mn37:8.11	Each chamber has seven nymphs.	NA
mn37:8.12	Each nymph has seven maids.	NA
mn37:8.13	Would you like to see the lovely Palace of Victory?”	NA
mn37:8.14	Mahāmoggallāna consented with silence.	NA
mn37:9.1	Then, putting Venerable Mahāmoggallāna in front, Sakka, lord of gods, and Vessavaṇa, the Great King, went to the Palace of Victory.	Also known as Kuvera ([dn20:9.31](), [snp2.14:6.1]()), the name Vessavaṇa means “Son of the Renowned” from his father Viśrava, although [dn32:7.40]() explains it as from the name of his city. He is one of the four great kings and guards the northern quarter.
mn37:9.2	When they saw Moggallāna coming off in the distance, Sakka’s maids,	NA
mn37:9.3	being discreet and prudent, each went to her own bedroom.	The maids are described as possessing the cardinal virtues of _hiri_ (conscience, discretion) and _otappa_ (prudence), the “guardians of the world” and the foundations of moral integrity. Former translators have rendered this as if the maids were “embarrassed and ashamed”, but this is unwarranted. The maids were born in this realm as the result of their good kamma in past lives and are simply residing there in their own home. Unlike Sakka, who neglected his lesson and then tried to distract attention when reminded of it, they have nothing to be ashamed of.
mn37:10.1	They were just like a daughter-in-law who is discreet and prudent when they see their father-in-law.	NA
mn37:10.2	NA	NA
mn37:10.3	Then Sakka and Vessavaṇa encouraged Moggallāna to wander and explore the palace, saying,	This is a good example of _(anu)-vicāra_ in the sense of “explore”.
mn37:10.4	“See, in the palace, my good Moggallāna, this lovely thing!	NA
mn37:10.5	And that lovely thing!”	The gods are pointing out various pretty features in the palace.
mn37:10.6	“That looks beautiful for the venerable Kosiya, as befits one who has made merit in the past.	After Sakka’s disappointing response, Moggallāna is trying to say something nice. At the same time, he subtly implies the difference between his past merit and present negligence.
mn37:10.7	Humans, when they see something lovely, also say:	NA
mn37:10.8	‘It looks beautiful enough for the gods of the thirty-three!’	NA
mn37:10.9	That looks beautiful for the venerable Kosiya, as befits one who has made merit in the past.”	NA
mn37:11.1	Then Moggallāna thought,	NA
mn37:11.2	“This spirit lives much too negligently.	NA
mn37:11.3	Why don’t I stir up a sense of urgency in him?”	NA
mn37:11.4	Then Moggallāna used his psychic power to make the Palace of Victory shake and rock and tremble with his big toe.	Referred to at [thag20.1:55.1](). Moggallāna displayed a similar wonder at [sn51.14:3.1](), also a means of last resort in the face of negligence.
mn37:11.5	Then Sakka, Vessavaṇa, and the gods of the thirty-three, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought,	NA
mn37:11.6	“Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!	NA
mn37:11.7	The ascetic has such power and might that he makes the god’s home shake and rock and tremble with his big toe!”	NA
mn37:12.1	Knowing that Sakka was shocked and awestruck, Moggallāna said to him,	NA
mn37:12.2	“Kosiya, how did the Buddha briefly explain freedom through the ending of craving?	NA
mn37:12.3	Please share this talk with me so that I can also get to hear it.”	NA
mn37:12.4	“My dear Moggallāna, I approached the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	NA
mn37:12.5	‘Sir, how do you briefly define a mendicant who is freed with the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans?’	NA
mn37:13.1	When I had spoken the Buddha said to me:	NA
mn37:13.2	‘lord of gods, it’s when a mendicant has heard:	NA
mn37:13.3	“Nothing is worth insisting on”	NA
mn37:13.4	When a mendicant has heard that	NA
mn37:13.5	nothing is worth insisting on,	NA
mn37:13.6	they directly know all things. Directly knowing all things, they completely understand all things. Having completely understood all things, when they experience any kind of feeling—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—	NA
mn37:13.7	they meditate observing impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in those feelings.	NA
mn37:13.8	Meditating in this way, they don’t grasp at anything in the world.	NA
mn37:13.9	Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.	NA
mn37:13.10	They understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.”	NA
mn37:13.11	That’s how I briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans.’	NA
mn37:13.12	That’s how the Buddha briefly explained freedom through the ending of craving to me.”	NA
mn37:14.1	Moggallāna approved and agreed with what Sakka said. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from among the gods of the thirty-three and reappeared in the Eastern Monastery.	NA
mn37:14.2	Soon after Moggallāna left, Sakka’s maids said to him,	NA
mn37:14.3	“Good fellow, was that the Blessed One, your Teacher?”	NA
mn37:14.4	“No, it was not.	NA
mn37:14.5	That was my spiritual companion Venerable Mahāmoggallāna.”	“Spiritual companion” (_sabrahmacārī_) normally refers to a fellow monastic, but here it alludes to the fact that both of them have seen the Dhamma.
mn37:14.6	“You’re fortunate, good fellow, so very fortunate,	NA
mn37:14.7	to have a spiritual companion of such power and might!	NA
mn37:14.8	We can’t believe that’s not the Blessed One, your Teacher!”	NA
mn37:15.1	Then Mahāmoggallāna went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
mn37:15.2	“Sir, do you recall briefly explaining freedom through the ending of craving to a certain well-known and illustrious spirit?”	It is unclear why Moggallāna asked for a repetition of the teaching at which he was present. One might have expected that he would report to the Buddha the events at Sakka’s palace.
mn37:15.3	“I do, Moggallāna.” And the Buddha retold all that happened when Sakka came to visit him, adding:	NA

mn38:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn38:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn38:2.1	Now at that time a mendicant called Sāti, the fisherman’s son, had the following harmful misconception:	The opening of this sutta is similar to [mn22]().
mn38:2.2	“As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.”	Sāti attributes three teachings to the Buddha. First, that there is a “transmigration” (_saṁsāra_) from one life to another. Second, that the primary locus of transmigration is “consciousness” (_viññāṇa_). And thirdly, that the consciousness that transmigrates remains “this very same” (_tadevidaṁ_), not another (_anaññaṁ_); in other words, it retains its self-same identity through the process of rebirth. The Buddha did in fact teach the first two of these ideas, but not the third, as he will explain below. | The Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad says that as death approaches, the senses and vital energies withdraw into the heart (_hṛdaya_), from the top of which the self departs. That same consciousness proceeds to a new body (4.4.2: _savijñāno bhavati, savijñānamevānvavakrāmati_). This core Upaniṣadic chapter on rebirth reflects Sāti’s wording as well as his meaning. Sāti asserts emphatic identity using doubled demonstrative pronouns conjoined with _(e)va_ (_tadevidaṁ_), and identical constructions are found throughout the Bṛhadāraṇyaka chapter: _sa vā ayam_ (4.4.5), _sa vā eṣa_ (4.4.22, 4.4.24, 4.4.25); see also _tameva_ (4.4.17). For _anaññaṁ_ we find the inverse _anya_ for the “other” body (4.4.3, 4.4.4). For the Pali verbs _sandhāvati saṁsarati_ we have instead _avakrāmati_ (4.4.1, 4.4.2). But the connection with _saṁsarati_ is made in the Brahmanical tradition itself, for it says below, “That self is indeed divinity, made of consciousness” (_sa vā ayamātmā brahma vijñānamayo_; 4.4.5, see too 4.4.22), which the commentator Śaṅkara explains as “the transmigrating self” (_saṁsaratyātmā_).
mn38:3.1	Several mendicants heard about this.	NA
mn38:3.2	NA	NA
mn38:3.3	NA	NA
mn38:3.4	They went up to Sāti and said to him,	NA
mn38:3.5	“Is it really true, Reverend Sāti, that you have such a harmful misconception:	NA
mn38:3.6	‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another’?”	NA
mn38:3.7	“Absolutely, reverends. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.”	NA
mn38:3.8	Then, wishing to dissuade Sāti from his view, the mendicants pursued, pressed, and grilled him,	NA
mn38:3.9	“Don’t say that, Sāti! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that.	NA
mn38:3.10	In many ways the Buddha has said that consciousness is dependently originated, since without a cause, consciousness does not come to be.”	If consciousness is dependent it is changeable and cannot be “that very same”. The Buddha spoke of consciousness as a process of phenomena evolving and flowing, ever changing like a stream.
mn38:3.11	But even though the mendicants pressed him in this way, Sāti obstinately stuck to his misconception and insisted on it.	NA
mn38:3.12	NA	NA
mn38:4.1	When they weren’t able to dissuade Sāti from his view, the mendicants went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	NA

mn38:5.1	So the Buddha addressed one of the monks,	NA
mn38:5.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Sāti that	NA
mn38:5.3	the teacher summons him.”	NA
mn38:5.4	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Sāti and said to him,	NA
mn38:5.5	“Reverend Sāti, the teacher summons you.”	NA
mn38:5.6	“Yes, reverend,” Sāti replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	NA
mn38:5.7	“Is it really true, Sāti, that you have such a harmful misconception:	NA
mn38:5.8	‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another’?”	NA
mn38:5.9	“Absolutely, sir. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.”	NA
mn38:5.10	“Sāti, what is that consciousness?”	NA
mn38:5.11	“Sir, he is the speaker, the knower who experiences the results of good and bad deeds in all the different realms.”	See [mn2:8.8]().
mn38:5.12	“Futile man, who on earth have you ever known me to teach in that way?	NA
mn38:5.13	Haven’t I said in many ways that consciousness is dependently originated, since consciousness does not arise without a cause?	NA
mn38:5.14	But still you misrepresent me by your wrong grasp, harm yourself, and create much wickedness.	NA
mn38:5.15	This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.”	NA
mn38:6.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,	NA
mn38:6.2	“What do you think, mendicants?	NA
mn38:6.3	Has this mendicant Sāti kindled even a spark of ardor in this teaching and training?”	See [mn22:7.3]().
mn38:6.4	“How could that be, sir?	NA
mn38:6.5	No, sir.”	NA
mn38:6.6	When this was said, Sāti sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.	NA
mn38:6.7	Knowing this, the Buddha said,	NA
mn38:6.8	“Futile man, you will be known by your own harmful misconception.	NA
mn38:6.9	I’ll question the mendicants about this.”	NA
mn38:7.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,	NA
mn38:7.2	“Mendicants, do you understand my teachings as Sāti does, when he misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and creates much wickedness?”	NA
mn38:7.3	“No, sir.	NA
mn38:7.4	For in many ways the Buddha has told us that consciousness is dependently originated, since without a cause, consciousness does not come to be.”	NA
mn38:7.5	“Good, good, mendicants!	NA
mn38:7.6	It’s good that you understand my teaching like this.	NA
mn38:7.7	For in many ways I have told you that consciousness is dependently originated, since without a cause, consciousness does not come to be.	NA
mn38:7.8	But still this Sāti misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and creates much wickedness.	NA
mn38:7.9	This will be for his lasting harm and suffering.	NA
mn38:8.1	Consciousness is reckoned according to the very same condition dependent upon which it arises.	The Buddha’s use of duplicated pronouns with _eva_ here echoes Sāti’s language, but to the opposite effect. Rather than emphasizing the self-sameness of transmigrating consciousness, the Buddha states with equal emphasis the dependence of consciousness on specific conditions, whatever they may be.
mn38:8.2	Consciousness that arises dependent on the eye and sights is reckoned as eye consciousness.	NA
mn38:8.3	Consciousness that arises dependent on the ear and sounds is reckoned as ear consciousness.	NA

The word _āhāra_ (“fuel”, “food”, “nutriment”) means literally “intake”, and is etymologically parallel to _upādāna_, “grasping”, “uptake”. Both terms have dual senses, on the one hand denoting fuel or sustenance, and on the other grasping and attachment. That is why here (as at [mn9:11.5]()), _āhāra_ is created by craving, just like _upādāna_ in the standard sequence ([mn38:17.8]()).

mn38:16.15	And what is the source of choices?	NA
mn38:16.16	Ignorance.	NA
mn38:17.1	So, ignorance is a condition for choices.	Here begins the full presentation of the standard sequence of dependent origination in forward order. Formal definitions are found at [sn12.2](). Here I briefly indicate the nature of the conditioned links. | Because we are ignorant of the four noble truths, we make morally potent choices by body, speech, and mind.
mn38:17.2	Choices are a condition for consciousness.	These choices are creative forces or energies in the mind that sustain the ongoing stream of sense consciousness from one life to the next.
mn38:17.3	Consciousness is a condition for name and form.	Consciousness functions in relation to a cluster of phenomena both mental—feeling, perception, intention, contact, and application of mind—and physical—the four elements. These form an organism that grows and evolves.
mn38:17.4	Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields.	The sentient organism of the body requires senses to feed it stimuli.
mn38:17.5	The six sense fields are conditions for contact.	Through these the sentient organism encounters the world outside and learns to make sense of it.
mn38:17.6	Contact is a condition for feeling.	It distinguishes experiences that are pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral.
mn38:17.7	Feeling is a condition for craving.	It reacts by wanting to have more pleasure and to escape pain.
mn38:17.8	Craving is a condition for grasping.	Grasping at pleasures, view, observances, and theories of self, one makes sense of the world so as to optimize the capacity of oneself to experience pleasure.
mn38:17.9	Grasping is a condition for continued existence.	This grasping binds one to time, to a continuity of existence in the realms of the senses or those of refined consciousness.
mn38:17.10	Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.	Shedding the body one takes up a new one in one of the realms of existence, perpetuating the cycle.
mn38:17.11	Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be.	Being born, it is inevitable that one will experience the pains of broken teeth, wrinkled skin, crooked back, and ultimately the failure of the body that we call death.
mn38:17.12	That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.	NA
mn38:18.1	‘Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’ That’s what I said.	The Buddha grills his students, reinforcing learning by making sure they understand each point.

This is a form of necessary condition—without one thing, the other cannot be. But it is stronger than mere necessity, as each condition is a close and vital support for its descendant.

PTS and BJT have here _ādhav-_ with _paṭidhāv-_ as variant. At [sn12.20:5.3]() all three editions have _upadhāv-_, with _apadhāv-_ as variant in PTS. Whatever the correct reading might be, it is clear the intent is convey the opposite direction.

mn38:24.12	“Knowing and seeing in this way, would you believe that the observances and boisterous, superstitious rites of the various ascetics and brahmins are essential?”	In Buddhism, performance of rituals is not in itself forbidden; the main point is that they are not considered “essential” (_sārato_). Note that rituals were regarded as efficacious acts, and hence correspond to “choices” (_saṅkhārā_), a word that can also mean “rite”. | “Boisterous” (_kotūhala_) is literally “whence the hubbub?” This basic sense comes across clearly in the Arthaśāstra, which describes a spy’s spell for putting to sleep the men or dogs that guard a village, who are always listening out for sounds (14.3.21cd, 14.3.37ab).

mn38:26.1	Mendicants, when three things come together an embryo is conceived.	This section illustrates dependent origination by way of the birth and physical and psychological development of a person from conception to adulthood. From passages such as [dn15:21.2](), we know that conception occurs at the nexus of “consciousness” and “name and form” in dependent origination. Since it starts with this life only, the first two factors, ignorance and choices, are omitted here, but are implicitly covered in the preceding passage. | For the “conception” or more literally “descent” of the embryo, the Buddha uses the same term _avakkanti_ that, as we have noted ([mn38:2.2]()), was preferred by Yajñavālkya in the same context.
mn38:26.2	In a case where the mother and father come together, but the mother is not in the fertile phase of her menstrual cycle, and the virile spirit is not ready, the embryo is not conceived.	According to [mn93:18.61]() this was a doctrine of the brahmins, and it was evidently adopted in this sutta as a popular theory of conception. I discuss the role of the _gandhabba_ in my notes there. | _Utu_ (“the fertile phase of her menstrual cycle”) literally means “season”. As the earth needs rain, a womb is dry and infertile until it is moistened by blood, for the fortnight following which it is fertile and “in season”. Thus _utu_ can be both menstruation, during which sex was taboo for the brahmins, as well as the fertile fortnight that follows, outside of which sex was also taboo ([snp2.7:9.2]()). Atharvaveda 14.2.37a speaks of parents coming together “in season”. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.6 expresses the same idea by saying the woman should be approached for sex when she has removed her soiled garments (since she may not change clothes while menstruating, 6.4.13).
mn38:26.3	In a case where the mother and father come together, the mother is in the fertile phase of her menstrual cycle, but the virile spirit is not ready, the embryo is not conceived.	NA
mn38:26.4	But when these three things come together—the mother and father come together, the mother is in the fertile phase of her menstrual cycle, and the virile spirit is ready—an embryo is conceived.	NA
mn38:27.1	The mother nurtures the embryo in her womb for nine or ten months at great risk to her heavy burden.	“At great risk” is _mahatā saṁsayena_. | A term of pregnancy of “nine or ten months” is also found at Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.9.1. | For “heavy burden” (_garubhāra_) see [pli-tv-bi-vb-pc61:1.5]().
mn38:27.2	When nine or ten months have passed, the mother gives birth at great risk to her heavy burden.	NA
mn38:27.3	When the infant is born she nourishes it with her own blood.	NA
mn38:27.4	For mother’s milk is regarded as blood in the training of the Noble One.	The Buddha’s claim that this idea is distinct to him seems to be borne out, as I cannot locate it in non-Buddhist texts.
mn38:28.1	That boy grows up and his faculties mature.	This shows that dependent origination does not happen all at once; it is a process of growth and maturation. A child, whose faculties are not developed, does not perpetuate the cycle because they have no formed moral intentions.
mn38:28.2	He accordingly plays childish games such as toy plows, tipcat, somersaults, pinwheels, toy measures, toy carts, and toy bows.	A more extensive list of games is found at [dn1:1.14.2]().
mn38:29.1	That boy grows up and his faculties mature further.	NA
mn38:29.2	He accordingly amuses himself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	NA
mn38:29.3	Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	In dependent origination, this parallels contact through the senses giving rise to feelings.

mn38:30.1	When they see a sight with their eyes, if it’s pleasant they desire it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and their heart restricted.	In dependent origination, feeling gives rise to craving. | Parallel passages in the Saṁyutta (eg. [sn35.132:12.3]()) in parallels for this passage have _adhimuccati_ (‘commits to, holds on to”) rather than _sārajjati_ (“desires”).
mn38:30.2	And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.	NA
mn38:30.3	Being so full of favoring and opposing, when they experience any kind of feeling—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—they approve, welcome, and keep clinging to it.	NA
mn38:30.4	This gives rise to relishing.	NA
mn38:30.5	Relishing feelings is grasping. Their grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be.	Now we rejoin the standard sequence of dependent origination.

mn38:41.11	Mendicants, you should memorize this brief statement on freedom through the ending of craving. But the mendicant Sāti, the fisherman’s son, is caught in a vast net of craving, a tangle of craving.”	The mention of the “brief statement” at the end of a long discourse is puzzling. A similar exhortation to “memorize” a “brief” passage is found in only one other passage, where it is in reference to the short summary passage around which the sutta is based ([mn140:32.3]()). Compare the preceding sutta, [mn37](), which revolves around a short passage for memorization that is fittingly described as “brief” throughout. That “brief” passage opens by saying “nothing is worth insisting on”, advice that is disregarded by Sāti who “insists” on his own view ([mn38:3.11]()). No “brief statement” is mentioned in the Chinese parallel (MA 201 at T i 769c28), which speaks instead of the shaking of the three-thousand-fold world system.

mn39:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅgas, near the Aṅgan town named Assapura.	Assapura, the “horse fort”, appears to be unknown apart from its mention here and the next sutta. Contra *Dictionary of Pali Proper Names*, this is not the same Assapura referred to in [ja422](), as that lay south of Ceti, far to the west. An Aśvapura is mentioned in Jain legends, but there is nothing to link this with the Aṅgan town. | Aṅga lay to the east of Magadha on the Ganges, towards modern Bengal.
mn39:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn39:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn39:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn39:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn39:2.1	“Mendicants, people label you as ascetics.	NA
mn39:2.2	And when they ask you what you are, you claim to be ascetics.	This sutta deals with the difference between outer perception and inner reality, addressing what we call “imposter syndrome”. The Buddha inspires students to aspire to the highest ideal through the practice of the Gradual Training so that they live up to their labels and claims.
mn39:2.3	Given this label and this claim, you should train like this: ‘We will undertake and follow the things that make one an ascetic and a brahmin. That way our label will be accurate and our claim correct.	NA

mn39:4.2	You should train like this: ‘Our bodily behavior will be pure, clear, open, neither inconsistent nor secretive.	_Chiddavā_ (“inconsistent”) is more literally “full of holes”. Its opposite (_acchidda_) is one of the standard descriptors of “impeccable” precepts (eg. [mn48:6.12]()). | _Saṁvuta_ (past participle of _saṁvara_) can mean either “restrained” or “hidden, secretive”. The sense depends on the syntax; the two instances of _ca_ split the listed items into three plus two, with the negative distributed over the last two items. This agrees with the commentary, which explains “secretive” as “concealing one’s faults”. _Saṁvara_ appears in the sense of sense restraint below ([mn39:8.4]()).

As a meditator proceeds, their subjective experience of the “body” evolves from tactile sense impressions (_phoṭṭhabba_), to the interior mental experience of bliss and light (_manomayakāya_), to the direct personal realization of highest truth ([mn70:23.2](): _kāyena ceva paramasaccaṁ sacchikaroti_).
mn39:15.4	It’s like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out.	The kneading is the “placing the mind and keeping it connected”, the water is bliss, while the lack of leaking speaks to the contained interiority of the experience.

But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads throughout the lake. There’s no part of the lake that’s not spread through with cool water.	The simile emphasizes the water as bliss, while the lack of inflow expresses containment and unification. The water welling up is the rapture, which is the uplifting emotional response to the experience of bliss.

The meditator is utterly immersed in stillness and bliss.

mn39:22.1	This mendicant is one who is called an ‘ascetic’, a ‘brahmin’, a ‘bathed initiate’, a ‘knowledge master’, a ‘scholar’, a ‘noble one’, and also a ‘perfected one’.	This series of epithets is also found at [an7.85]()–92, split over separate suttas, and with other terms and explanations in [snp3.6](). The explanations here rely on puns, the feel of which I have tried to echo in English.
mn39:23.1	And how is a mendicant an ascetic?	_Samaṇa_ (“ascetic”) is from a root meaning to exert or weary oneself, but here is explained as if related to _samita_ (“assuaged”, “calmed”).
mn39:23.2	They have assuaged the bad, unskillful qualities that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.	NA
mn39:23.3	That’s how a mendicant is an ascetic.	NA
mn39:24.1	And how is a mendicant a brahmin?	The root sense of _brah-_ is to “amplify” or “empower”, but is explained as _bāhita_ (“banished”, “expelled”). This is a common play on words, eg. [ud1.4:4.1](), [dhp388:1]().
mn39:24.2	They have banished the bad, unskillful qualities.	NA
mn39:24.3	That’s how a mendicant is a brahmin.	NA
mn39:25.1	And how is a mendicant a bathed initiate?	A _nhātaka_ (Sanskrit _snātaka_) is one who has performed the ritual ablutions on the completion of his studies.
mn39:25.2	They have bathed off the bad, unskillful qualities.	NA
mn39:25.3	That’s how a mendicant is a bathed initiate.	NA
mn39:26.1	And how is a mendicant a knowledge master?	The “knowledge” in _vedagū_ is the Vedas in Brahmanism and the three knowledges in Buddhism. Curiously, it is not an attested term in Brahmanical texts. Perhaps it arose by contraction from _(tiṇṇaṁ) vedānaṁ pāragū_ (cf. Sanskrit _vedapāraga_).
mn39:26.2	They have known the bad, unskillful qualities.	NA
mn39:26.3	That’s how a mendicant is a knowledge master.	NA
mn39:27.1	And how is a mendicant a scholar?	_Sottiya_ (“scholar”) is from the root “to hear”, as is the more familiar Pali term _sāvaka_ (“disciple”, “student”, literally “hearkener”). In Brahmanism _śrotrīya_ refers to one who is well versed in the Vedas. Here, however, it is connected with the root _su_ (“to flow”), as in one who has “rinsed off” or “scoured off” bad things.
mn39:27.2	They have scoured off the bad, unskillful qualities.	NA
mn39:27.3	That’s how a mendicant is a scholar.	NA
mn39:28.1	And how is a mendicant a noble one?	Both _ariya_ and _arahant_ are explained with the same word _āraka_, meaning “far from (defilements)”. The commentary gives _āraka_ in both cases, but explains _ariya_ as “slayer” and _arahant_ as “far from”. At [an7.91](), PTS has _arīhatattā_, “foe-slayer” for _ariya_ (BJT omits, while at least one more variant is attested). This is a slightly better pun for _ariya_ than _āraka_, although at [snp3.6:38.1]() _ariya_ is punned with _ālaya_ (“clinging”), which is better than both. Where both MA 182 and the parallel to [mn40]() at MA 183 at T i 726c13 mention the _ariya_, the Indic pun underlying EA 49.8 seems to be that a _kṣatriya_ is so called because they “end” (Sanskit _kṣaya_) the defilements. Neither of the Chinese parallels (MA 182 at T i 725c4, EA 49.8 at T ii 802b4) mentions the _arahant_, suggesting it was added later, which would explain the duplication of _āraka_. However, given that “far from” is consistently attested for the _arahant_ in all editions and commentary; that “foe-slayer” is attested for _ariya_ in some texts and commentaries; and that _kṣatriya_ in the sense of “warrior” is loosely in the same semantic realm as “foe-slayer”, I translate accordingly.
mn39:28.2	They have nobbled their foes, the bad, unskillful qualities.	NA
mn39:28.3	That’s how a mendicant is a noble one.	NA
mn39:29.1	And how is a mendicant a perfected one?	_Arahant_ (“perfected one”) has the root sense “worthy” and in Buddhism has the sense of one who has perfectly or “impeccably” removed all defilements.
mn39:29.2	They are impeccably remote from the bad, unskillful qualities that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.	NA
mn39:29.3	That’s how a mendicant is a perfected one.”	NA
mn39:29.4	That is what the Buddha said.	NA

mn40:3.1	And how does a mendicant not practice in the way that is proper for an ascetic?	These are forms of “misapprehension of precepts and observances” which do not in and of themselves signify spiritual purity.

mn40:3.3	is not practicing in the way that is proper for an ascetic, I say. And that is due to not giving up these stains, defects, and dregs of an ascetic, these grounds for rebirth in places of loss, to be experienced in bad places.	NA
mn40:4.1	I say that such a mendicant’s going forth may be compared to the kind of weapon called ‘deadborn’—double-edged, whetted with yellow arsenic—that has been covered and wrapped in an outer robe.	“Deadborn” (_mataja_) is explained by the commentary as meaning forged from iron filings recovered from the corpse of a dead heron, which was force-fed them for that purpose. It sounds bizarre, and I have not been able to trace this practice elsewhere, but people do a lot of bizarre things. | _Pītanisita_ may mean “sharpened with a wet (_pīta_) stone” per the commentary, or else “sharpened with yellow arsenic” (_pīta_). Arthaśāstra 2.14.48 describes how metals may be rubbed with yellow arsenic (here = _haritāla_) to disguise them. This fits the context, where a supposed monk wrapped in the ocher robe is like the metal, outwardly shiny yellow, but inside is deadly.

mn40:5.10	You don’t deserve the label ‘matted-hair ascetic’ just because you have matted hair.	Such “matted-hair ascetics” are apparently the “forest hermits” (_vānaprastha_) whose lifestyle Kauṭilya describes as “celibacy, sleeping on the ground, wearing matted hair and antelope skin, offering daily fire sacrifice, bathing, venerating gods, ancestors, and guests, and eating forest produce” (Arthaśāstra 1.3.11, Olivelle’s translation).
mn40:6.1	Imagine that just by wearing an outer robe someone with covetousness, ill will, irritability, acrimony, disdain, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deviousness, deceit, corrupt wishes, and wrong view could give up these things.

mn40:6.2	‘Please, dearest, wear an outer robe! By doing so you will give up covetousness, ill will, irritability, acrimony, disdain, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deviousness, deceit, corrupt wishes, and wrong view.’	_Bhadramukha_ is used here by family for a child. Elsewhere, by lay people addressing monks ([mn81:21.1]()); by a laywoman addressing a deity ([an7.53:3.4]()); by a king of his grown son ([sn3.7:1.5]()); and, with the addition of the familiar _tāta_, by a brahmin wife to her husband ([mn100:3.5]()). The term is of Sanskritic form and is found commonly in the Avadāna literature. Turning to later Sanskrit sources, Nāṭyaśāstra 19.12 says it should be used when addressing inferiors, while Sāhityadarpaṇa 6.154 says it is used when addressing a prince (see SN 3.7 above). The early Pali usage, however, suggests it was an affectionate and respectful term of somewhat elevated usage, but not restricted by status. Since _bhadda_ by itself is a common form of address in the sense “my dear”, I think the suffix _-mukha_ has its intensive sense here, “dearest”, rather than “dear face”.

mn41:0.2	The People of Sālā	NA
mn41:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn41:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Sālā.	This village is possibly connected to the Śālagrāma famed in later years as the origin of the ammonite stones found on the Gaṇḍakī river and worshiped as aniconic forms of Vishnu. Against this theory is that Śālagrāma is too far to the north-east, although in truth we do not know the exact extent of Kosala. The feminine ending of the Pali form suggests that the name means “hall”, but Sanskrit sources trace Śālagrāma to the sal trees that grow abundantly in the Himalayan foothills. | The same framing narrative recurs at [mn60](), where the topic of rebirth is also discussed.
mn41:2.1	The brahmins and householders of Sālā heard,	NA
mn41:2.2	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—while wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Sālā, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	NA
mn41:2.3	He has this good reputation:	NA
mn41:2.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
mn41:2.5	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	NA
mn41:2.6	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased.	NA
mn41:2.7	He reveals an entirely full and pure spiritual life.	NA
mn41:2.8	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	NA
mn41:3.1	Then the brahmins and householders of Sālā went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Seated to one side they said to the Buddha:	NA
mn41:4.1	“What is the cause, worthy Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell?	Multiple theories of rebirth are found in Brahmanical texts. For example, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.5 says that rebirth depends on good or bad deeds, but notes the differing opinion that desire is all that matters. Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.10.1–5 describes two paths: forest ascetics go the Brahmā realm, while ritualists go to the moon, from whence those who did good deeds are reborn as human in a good caste, but those who did bad deeds are reborn as outcastes, pigs, or dogs. Those who follow neither path are reborn as small animals or insects.
mn41:4.2	And what is the cause, worthy Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?”	NA
mn41:5.1	“Unprincipled and immoral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	NA
mn41:5.2	Principled and moral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”	NA
mn41:6.1	“We don’t understand the detailed meaning of the worthy Gotama’s brief statement.	NA
mn41:6.2	Worthy Gotama, please teach us this matter in detail so we can understand the meaning.”	NA
mn41:6.3	“Well then, householders, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn41:6.4	“Yes, worthy sir,” they replied.	NA
mn41:6.5	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn41:7.1	“Householders, unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of mind.	This analysis, found frequently in the suttas, became known as the “ten pathways of skilful deeds” (_dasakusalakammapatha_). It was adopted in the treatment of _karma_ in Manusmṛti 12, where we find a very similar division of “ten characteristics” (_daśalakṣaṇa_).
mn41:8.1	And how is unprincipled and immoral conduct threefold by way of body?	NA
mn41:8.2	It’s when a certain person kills living creatures. They’re violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.	The same description is applied to the notorious serial killer Aṅgulimāla ([mn86:2.1]()). These definitions dramatically present clear cases of violation and are not intended to be complete or to cover all grey areas. The Vinaya rules analyze these transgressions in detail as they apply to monastic conduct.
mn41:8.3	They steal. With the intention to commit theft, they take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.	NA
mn41:8.4	They commit sexual misconduct. They have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal.	This definition covers a number of sexual transgressions from a male hetero-normative perspective that, with due allowance for social change, would also be considered inappropriate today: when a woman is married or engaged, or illegal sex, or if she is under guardianship, such as for a child or teen. Elsewhere, the texts identify a number of other illicit sexual acts, such as rape ([an8.84:1.3]()), underage ([snp1.6:21.2]()), incest ([an5.55]()), bestiality ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.30]()), necrophilia ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.13.1]()), and womanizing or promiscuity in general ([an8.54:6.2]()). Notably absent is any criticism of homosexuality, sex outside of marriage, relations with more than two partners, sex work, masturbation, or specific sexual acts.
mn41:8.5	This is how unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of body.	NA
mn41:9.1	And how is unprincipled and immoral conduct fourfold by way of speech?	NA
mn41:9.2	It’s when a certain person lies. They’re summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, worthy man, say what you know.’ Not knowing, they say ‘I know.’ Knowing, they say ‘I don’t know.’ Not seeing, they say ‘I see.’ And seeing, they say ‘I don’t see.’ So they deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason.	Again this is a severe example of lying, essentially perjury.
mn41:9.3	They speak divisively. They repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. And so they divide those who are harmonious, supporting division, delighting in division, loving division, speaking words that promote division.	NA
mn41:9.4	They speak harshly. They use the kinds of words that are cruel, nasty, hurtful, offensive, bordering on anger, not leading to immersion.	NA
mn41:9.5	They talk nonsense. Their speech is untimely, and is neither factual nor beneficial. It has nothing to do with the teaching or the training. Their words have no value, and are untimely, unreasonable, rambling, and pointless.	NA
mn41:9.6	This is how unprincipled and immoral conduct is fourfold by way of speech.	NA
mn41:10.1	And how is unprincipled and immoral conduct threefold by way of mind?	These three correspond with the respective defilements greed, hate, and delusion.
mn41:10.2	It’s when a certain person is covetous. They covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‘Oh, if only their belongings were mine!’	NA
mn41:10.3	They have ill will and malicious intentions: ‘May these sentient beings be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!’	NA
mn41:10.4	They have wrong view. Their perspective is distorted:	NA
mn41:10.5	‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’	This includes the wrong view that there is no afterlife, but goes beyond that to assert moral nihilism.
mn41:10.6	This is how unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of mind.	NA
mn41:10.7	That’s how unprincipled and immoral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	NA

mn41:12.1	And how is principled and moral conduct threefold by way of body?	NA
mn41:12.2	It’s when a certain person gives up killing living creatures. They renounce the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings.	NA
mn41:12.3	They give up stealing. They don’t, with the intention to commit theft, take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.	NA
mn41:12.4	They give up sexual misconduct. They don’t have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian.

NA
mn41:13.3	They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.	NA
mn41:13.4	They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable, and agreeable to the people.	NA

mn41:14.4	They have right view, an undistorted perspective:	NA
mn41:14.5	‘There is meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There are such things as mother and father, and beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’	NA

mn41:14.7	This is how principled and moral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	NA
mn41:15.1	A person of principled and moral conduct might wish:	NA
mn41:15.2	‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of well-to-do aristocrats!’	The Buddha is, of course, not recommending this, merely accommodating it. At this point, the ten ways of skillful deeds are both necessary and sufficient for the desired outcome. This changes with the higher realms, where absorption is also required, and the realization of arahantship, which requires the whole noble eightfold path. See note at [mn120:12.12]().
mn41:15.3	It’s possible that this might happen.	NA

mn43:0.2	The Great Elaboration	NA
mn43:1.1	So I have heard.	This sutta and the next are named for the class of scripture called _vedalla_, being the only suttas explicitly labelled as such. The root sense is to “split open” (_vi_-√_dal_) like a blossoming flower. These texts go beyond simple analysis or classification to “elaborate” the basic teachings (cf. the Sanskrit, which here has _vaipulya_, “expansion”). They share a similar method, where a series of questions and answers are carefully laid out, without revealing their purpose, but relentlessly driving towards the unraveling of the deepest meditation states emerging in Nibbana. While the Chinese parallels are broadly similar, there are many differences in detail, so they should be carefully studied before drawing any conclusions based on such “elaborations”.
mn43:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn43:1.3	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita came out of retreat, went to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn43:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Sāriputta:	NA
mn43:2.1	“Reverend, they speak of ‘a witless person’.	NA
mn43:2.2	How is a witless person defined?”	NA
mn43:2.3	“Reverend, they’re called witless because they don’t understand.	NA
mn43:2.4	And what don’t they understand?	NA
mn43:2.5	They don’t understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’	NA
mn43:2.6	They’re called witless because they don’t understand.”	NA
mn43:2.7	Saying “Good, reverend,” Mahākoṭṭhita approved and agreed with what Sāriputta said. Then he asked another question:	NA
mn43:3.1	“They speak of ‘a wise person’.	NA
mn43:3.2	How is a wise person defined?”	NA
mn43:3.3	“They’re called wise because they understand.	NA
mn43:3.4	And what do they understand?	NA
mn43:3.5	They understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’	NA
mn43:3.6	They’re called wise because they understand.”	NA
mn43:4.1	“They speak of ‘consciousness’.	NA
mn43:4.2	How is consciousness defined?”	NA
mn43:4.3	“It’s called consciousness because it cognizes.	In defining a noun by its verb, Sāriputta clarifies that consciousness is not an entity but a function. Consciousness is simply the act of being conscious. Similar definitions are proposed for other fundamental Dhamma terms such as “feeling” and “perception”.
mn43:4.4	And what does it cognize?	NA
mn43:4.5	It cognizes ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ and ‘neutral’.	This definition is subtly different from that of “feeling” below ([mn43:7.5]()). The addition of the quotative particle _-ti_ distances the verb for cognizing from the noun that is cognized. The Chinese and Tibetan parallels to this passage define consciousness here in the standard way as awareness of sense phenomena (MA 211 at T i 790c7, D 4094 *mngon pa, nyu* 81a7), which is more straightforward, but could be a result of normalization.
mn43:4.6	It’s called consciousness because it cognizes.”	NA
mn43:5.1	“Wisdom and consciousness—	NA
mn43:5.2	are these things mixed or separate?	NA
mn43:5.3	And can we completely disentangle them so as to describe the difference between them?”	_Vinibbhujati_ (“disentangle”) is used for the dissection of a corpse ([thig16.1:24.1]()) or the unravelling of coiled banana sheaths ([mn35:22.3]()).
mn43:5.4	“Wisdom and consciousness—	“Wisdom” (_paññā_)  and “consciousness” (_viññāṇa_) are two of the very many terms derived from the root _ñā_, “to know”. The prefixes act as intensifiers, but do not decisively distinguish the meaning, so while they are used consistently in doctrinal contexts, more loosely they can be interchangeable.
mn43:5.5	these things are mixed, not separate.	NA
mn43:5.6	And you can never completely disentangle them so as to describe the difference between them.	NA
mn43:5.7	For you understand what you cognize, and you cognize what you understand.	NA
mn43:5.8	That’s why these things are mixed, not separate.	NA
mn43:5.9	And you can never completely disentangle them so as to describe the difference between them.”	This dialogue cautions against pushing analysis too far.
mn43:6.1	“Wisdom and consciousness—	NA
mn43:6.2	what is the difference between these things that are mixed, not separate?”	NA
mn43:6.3	NA	NA
mn43:6.4	“The difference between these things is that wisdom should be developed, while consciousness should be completely understood.”	This refers to the fundamental distinction made in the first discourse ([sn56.11]()): that which is to be developed (“wisdom”) pertains to the fourth noble truth, while that which is to be completely understood (“consciousness”) pertains to the first noble truth. Again, the distinction between them is functional rather than ontological.
mn43:6.5	NA	NA
mn43:7.1	“They speak of this thing called ‘feeling’.	NA
mn43:7.2	How is feeling defined?”	NA
mn43:7.3	“It’s called feeling because it feels.	NA
mn43:7.4	And what does it feel?	NA
mn43:7.5	It feels pleasure, pain, and neutral.	This definition is similar to that for consciousness, except without the distancing _-ti_. The feeling is the experience, whereas consciousnesses is that which is aware of the feeling. | The progress of the text is more subtle than it appears, as the question on feeling and consciousness starts to lay the groundwork for understanding the deep states of meditation that are discussed later.
mn43:7.6	It’s called feeling because it feels.”	NA
mn43:8.1	“They speak of this thing called ‘perception’.	NA
mn43:8.2	How is perception defined?”	NA
mn43:8.3	“It’s called perception because it perceives.	NA
mn43:8.4	And what does it perceive?	NA
mn43:8.5	It perceives blue, yellow, red, and white.	“Color” is a more sophisticated and less universal aspect of awareness than “feeling”, reflecting the fact that “perception” relates to higher-order functions like recognition and interpretation, which are involved in concept formation. The “perception” of lights and colors is often connected with the development of the four “form” _jhānas_ (eg. [mn77:23.14]()), so we are paving the way for the apparently abrupt transition to the formless dimensions at [mn43:10.2]() below.
mn43:8.6	It’s called perception because it perceives.”	NA
mn43:9.1	“Feeling, perception, and consciousness—	NA
mn43:9.2	are these things mixed or separate?	NA
mn43:9.3	And can we completely disentangle them so as to describe the difference between them?”	NA
mn43:9.4	“Feeling, perception, and consciousness—	NA
mn43:9.5	these things are mixed, not separate.	NA
mn43:9.6	And you can never completely disentangle them so as to describe the difference between them.	NA
mn43:9.7	For you perceive what you feel, and you cognize what you perceive.	NA
mn43:9.8	That’s why these things are mixed, not separate.	NA
mn43:9.9	And you can never completely disentangle them so as to describe the difference between them.”	NA
mn43:10.1	“What can be known by purified mind consciousness released from the five senses?”	The key term “purified” (_parisuddha_) indicates the fourth absorption.
mn43:10.2	“Aware that ‘space is infinite’ it can know the dimension of infinite space. Aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’ it can know the dimension of infinite consciousness. Aware that ‘there is nothing at all’ it can know the dimension of nothingness.”	NA
mn43:11.1	“How do you understand something that can be known?”	NA
mn43:11.2	“You understand something that can be known with the eye of wisdom.”	In other words, through personal experience rather than scripture, tradition, etc.
mn43:12.1	“What is the purpose of wisdom?”	NA
mn43:12.2	“The purpose of wisdom is direct knowledge, complete understanding, and giving up.”	Wisdom is explained in functional terms through the effect that it produces.
mn43:13.1	“How many conditions are there for the arising of right view?”	That is, for stream-entry.
mn43:13.2	“There are two conditions for the arising of right view:	NA
mn43:13.3	the voice of another and rational application of mind.	The “voice of another” is the teachings of the Dhamma, but these have to be actually investigated and applied internally.
mn43:13.4	These are the two conditions for the arising of right view.”	NA
mn43:14.1	“When right view is supported by how many factors does it have freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom as its fruit and benefit?”	That is, how does a stream-enterer practice further for arahantship?
mn43:14.2	“When right view is supported by five factors it has freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom as its fruit and benefit.	NA
mn43:14.3	It’s when right view is supported by ethics, learning, discussion, serenity, and discernment.	NA
mn43:14.4	When right view is supported by these five factors it has freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom as its fruit and benefit.”	NA
mn43:15.1	“How many states of existence are there?”	NA
mn43:15.2	“Reverend, there are these three states of existence.	These three questions summarize dependent origination.
mn43:15.3	Existence in the sensual realm, the realm of luminous form, and the formless realm.”	NA
mn43:16.1	“But how is there rebirth into a new state of existence in the future?”	NA
mn43:16.2	“It’s because of sentient beings—shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving—taking pleasure wherever they land.	The term “shrouded by ignorance” (_avijjānīvaraṇa_) draws on the connection between _nīvaraṇa_, normally translated “hindrance”, and the cosmic serpent Vṛtra, the “constrictor” who wraps the world in darkness.
mn43:16.3	That’s how there is rebirth into a new state of existence in the future.”	NA
mn43:17.1	“But how is there no rebirth into a new state of existence in the future?”	NA
mn43:17.2	“It’s when ignorance fades away, knowledge arises, and craving ceases.	NA
mn43:17.3	That’s how there is no rebirth into a new state of existence in the future.”	NA
mn43:18.1	“But what, reverend, is the first absorption?”	NA
mn43:18.2	“Reverend, it’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn43:18.3	This is called the first absorption.”	NA
mn43:19.1	“But how many factors does the first absorption have?”	NA
mn43:19.2	“The first absorption has five factors.	NA
mn43:19.3	When a mendicant has entered the first absorption, placing the mind, keeping it connected, rapture, bliss, and unification of mind are present.	These five absorption factors are found in the suttas here and, with other factors appended, at [mn111:4.1](). The list summarizes the normal depiction of the first absorption, as the first four factors are all part of the standard first absorption formula, and all absorption or _samādhi_ is characterized by unification of mind (eg. [mn20:3.3]()). They became a standard analysis of the first absorption in late canonical texts (eg. [ps1.5:10.2](), [ds2.1.1:3.1](), [vb12:99.1](), [pe6:66.2]()).
mn43:19.4	That’s how the first absorption has five factors.”	NA
mn43:20.1	“But how many factors has the first absorption given up and how many does it possess?”	NA
mn43:20.2	“The first absorption has given up five factors and possesses five factors.	NA
mn43:20.3	When a mendicant has entered the first absorption, sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt are given up.	NA
mn43:20.4	Placing the mind, keeping it connected, rapture, bliss, and unification of mind are present.	All of these, except unification, are present to some degree before absorption, but now they manifest fully.
mn43:20.5	That’s how the first absorption has given up five factors and possesses five factors.”	NA
mn43:21.1	“Reverend, these five faculties have different domains and different ranges, and don’t experience each others’ domain and range. That is,	Again, apparently general questions are in fact laying the groundwork for a discussion on subtle sates of meditation.
mn43:21.2	the faculties of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body.	NA
mn43:21.3	What do these five faculties, with their different domains and ranges, have recourse to? What experiences their domains and ranges?”	NA
mn43:21.4	NA	NA
mn43:21.5	NA	NA
mn43:21.6	“These five faculties, with their different domains and ranges, have recourse to the mind. And the mind experiences their domains and ranges.”	Each kind of sense experience is quite separate and distinct. The mind brings them all together and creates a sensible world in which a “self” can operate.

mn43:22.9	“But what does warmth depend on to continue?”	NA
mn43:22.10	“Warmth depends on vitality to continue.”	NA
mn43:22.11	“Just now I understood you to say:	NA

mn43:22.13	But I also understood you to say:	NA
mn43:22.14	‘Warmth depends on vitality to continue.’	NA
mn43:22.15	How then should we see the meaning of this statement?”	NA
mn43:22.16	“Well then, reverend, I shall give you a simile.	NA
mn43:22.17	For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.	NA
mn43:22.18	Suppose there was an oil lamp burning. The light appears dependent on the flame, and the flame appears dependent on the light.	NA
mn43:22.19	In the same way, vitality depends on warmth to continue, and warmth depends on vitality to continue.”	NA
mn43:23.1	“Are the vital forces the same things as the phenomena that are felt? Or are they different things?”	“Vital force” is _āyusaṅkhāra_. The suttas also use _bhavasaṅkhāra_ ([dn16:3.10.5]()) and _jīvitasaṅkhāra_ ([dn16:2.23.5]()) synonymously.
mn43:23.2	“The vital forces are not the same things as the phenomena that are felt.	NA
mn43:23.3	For if the vital forces and the phenomena that are felt were the same things, a mendicant who had attained the cessation of perception and feeling would not emerge from it.	This introduces the most subtle of all meditation states, accessible only to non-returners and arahants who are fully accomplished in all the absorptions.
mn43:23.4	But because the vital forces and the phenomena that are felt are different things, a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling can emerge from it.”	NA
mn43:24.1	“How many things must this body lose before it lies abandoned, tossed aside like an insentient log?”	NA
mn43:24.2	“This body must lose three things before it lies abandoned, tossed aside like an insentient log: vitality, warmth, and consciousness.”	This passage assumes the existence of a distinct vital force that is one of three factors required for life, which is why I have translated _āyu_ here as “vitality” rather than “life”.
mn43:25.1	“What’s the difference between someone who has passed away and a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling?”	This distinction is critical, as it sometimes happens that a person in deep meditation seems as if dead. Indeed, this confused even Ānanda at the Buddha’s deathbed ([dn16:6.8.1]()).
mn43:25.2	“When someone dies, their physical, verbal, and mental processes have ceased and stilled; their vitality is spent; their warmth is dissipated; and their faculties have disintegrated.	These processes are defined in the next sutta ([mn44:14.1]()).
mn43:25.3	When a mendicant has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, their physical, verbal, and mental processes have ceased and stilled. But their vitality is not spent; their warmth is not dissipated; and their faculties are very clear.	NA
mn43:25.4	That’s the difference between someone who has passed away and a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling.”	NA
mn43:26.1	“How many conditions are necessary to attain the neutral release of the heart?”	NA
mn43:26.2	“Four conditions are necessary to attain the neutral release of the heart.	NA
mn43:26.3	Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
mn43:26.4	These four conditions are necessary to attain the neutral release of the heart.”	NA
mn43:27.1	“How many conditions are necessary to attain the signless release of the heart?”	NA
mn43:27.2	“Two conditions are necessary to attain the signless release of the heart:	NA
mn43:27.3	not focusing on any signs, and focusing on the signless.	NA

mn43:28.1	“Three conditions are necessary to remain in the signless release of the heart:	NA
mn43:28.2	not focusing on any signs, focusing on the signless, and a previous determination.	Before entering the meditation, one makes an inner resolve to remain there for a certain period of time.
mn43:28.3	These three conditions are necessary to remain in the signless release of the heart.”	NA

mn43:29.5	“The limitless release of the heart, and the release of the heart through nothingness, and the release of the heart through emptiness, and the signless release of the heart: do these things differ in both meaning and phrasing? Or do they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing?”	NA
mn43:30.1	“There is a way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing.	NA
mn43:30.2	But there’s also a way in which they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing.	These terms can be used for distinct states of meditation as described below, but they can all be used of arahantship as well.
mn43:31.1	And what’s the way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing?	NA
mn43:31.2	Firstly, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	NA

mn43:31.6	This is called the limitless release of the heart.	NA
mn43:32.1	And what is the release of the heart through nothingness?	NA
mn43:32.2	It’s when a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.	NA
mn43:32.3	This is called the heart’s release through nothingness.	NA
mn43:33.1	And what is the release of the heart through emptiness?	NA
mn43:33.2	It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this:	NA
mn43:33.3	‘This is empty of a self or what belongs to a self.’	NA
mn43:33.4	This is called the release of the heart through emptiness.	NA

mn44:0.2	The Shorter Elaboration	NA
mn44:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn44:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
mn44:1.3	Then the layman Visākha went to see the nun Dhammadinnā, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to her:	These two are little-known, in contrast with the previous _vedalla_ featuring a dialogue between two mendicants renowned for their wisdom. | Dhammadinnā was recognized as the foremost bhikkhunī in teaching ([an1.239:1.1]()), presumably on the basis of this sutta, and has a single verse to her name ([thig1.12]()). | Visākha is otherwise unmentioned in the canon. The commentary says this is not the same person as the mendicant known as Visākha, Pañcāli’s son ([thag2.45](), [an4.48](), [sn21.7]()).
mn44:2.1	“Ma’am, they speak of this thing called ‘substantial reality’.	The normal form of address for nuns is _ayyā_ (“ma’am”), from the root _ariya_ (“noble”); the masculine form _ayya_ is occasionally used for monks as well. | “Substantial reality” is _sakkāya_, from _sat_ (“real”) and _kāya_ (“substance”). The Jain form is _astikāya_, which refers to the five fundamental substances (or ontological categories) comprised of the medium of motion, the medium of rest, space, soul, and matter (Bhagavatīsūtra 1.10). Note that the suttas use _kāya_, in the sense of “substance” or “mass”, as a key doctrinal term for ascetic movements associated with Jainism (eg. [dn2:23.3](), [dn2:26.2]()), whereas _kāya_ appears to have had no philosophical importance in pre-Buddhist Vedic texts. The commentaries define _sakkāya_ as “the three planes of cyclic existence”, i.e. all that exists. Thus _sakkāya_ is the “substantial reality” that is mistakenly assumed to be a “self”.
mn44:2.2	What is this substantial reality that the Buddha spoke of?”	NA
mn44:2.3	“Visākha, the Buddha said that these five grasping aggregates are substantial reality.	Sāriputta also quotes the Buddha as saying this at [sn38.15:1.3](), both sources apparently drawing from [sn22.105:1.5]() and [sn22.103:1.6]().
mn44:2.4	That is, the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.	NA
mn44:2.5	The Buddha said that these five grasping aggregates are substantial reality.”	NA
mn44:2.6	Saying “Good, ma’am,” Visākha approved and agreed with what Dhammadinnā said. Then he asked another question:	NA

mn44:4.2	What is the cessation of substantial reality that the Buddha spoke of?”	NA

mn44:6.3	The desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates is the grasping there.”	In the suttas, the five aggregates are not presented as a catch-all category that encompasses all of reality, but rather five types of phenomena that provoke attachment, forming the basis of what we take to be “self”. Desire is what drives the formation of attachment, but it requires all the aggregates to function. Thus the “grasping” aggregates are numbered “five” after the model of the hand that grasps.
mn44:7.1	“But ma’am, how does substantialist view come about?”	NA
mn44:7.2	“It’s when an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.	NA
mn44:7.3	They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.	These are the twenty kinds of substantialist view.
mn44:7.4	They regard feeling …	NA
mn44:7.5	perception …	NA
mn44:7.6	choices …	NA
mn44:7.7	consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.	NA

mn44:8.8	That’s how substantialist view does not come about.”	NA
mn44:9.1	“But ma’am, what is the noble eightfold path?”	NA
mn44:9.2	“It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:	NA
mn44:9.3	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.”	NA
mn44:10.1	“But ma’am, is the noble eightfold path conditioned or unconditioned?”	NA
mn44:10.2	“The noble eightfold path is conditioned.”	NA
mn44:11.1	“Are the three spectrums of practice included in the noble eightfold path? Or is the noble eightfold path included in the three practice categories?”	This refers to the “three spectrums” of ethics, immersion, and wisdom (eg. [an3.143:2.3]()). The shorthand reference to them as a group of three is characteristic of later strata of Pali, but it is also found at [dn10:1.6.1](), and with the addition of _vimutti_ at [dn33:1.11.145](). | “Spectrum” here is _khandha_ (elsewhere “aggregate”), which again has the same basic sense of “mass”, “category” as does _kāya_ in _sakkāya_.
mn44:11.2	“The three spectrums of practice are not included in the noble eightfold path. Rather, the noble eightfold path is included in the three practice categories.	The two teachings cover the same ground, but the more specific factors of the eightfold path are included in the more general categories of the three spectra.
mn44:11.3	Right speech, right action, and right livelihood: these things are included in the spectrum of ethics.	NA
mn44:11.4	Right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion: these things are included in the spectrum of immersion.	NA
mn44:11.5	Right view and right thought: these things are included in the spectrum of wisdom.”	NA
mn44:12.1	“But ma’am, what is immersion? What things are the bases of immersion? What things are the prerequisites for immersion? What is the development of immersion?”	NA
mn44:12.2	“Unification of the mind is immersion.	“Unification” (_ekaggatā_), “immersion” (_samādhi_), and “absorption” (_jhāna_) are synonyms, although they may have specialized nuances. This understanding was common to Indic traditions, possibly under Buddhist influence. As just a few examples, Patañjali’s Yogasūtra 3.11 defines _samādhi_ as unification, as does Śaṅkāra on Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.3 (_aikāgryarūpeṇa samāhito_), and the commentary to Bhagavad Gīta 2.42–44 (_samādhiś cittaikāgryam_) and 17.11 (_samādhāyaikāgraṁ_). The Jain Tattvārthasūtra 9.27 similarly defines _dhyāna_, as does the commentary to Bhagavad Gīta 4.27 (_dhyānaikāgryam_) and 13.24 (_ekāgratayā yac cintanaṁ tad dhyānam_).
mn44:12.3	The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the bases for immersion.	The “foundations of immersion” (_samādhinimittā_) are the practices that lead to _jhāna_. Here _nimitta_ means “cause” (Commentary: _paccaya_).
mn44:12.4	The four right efforts are the prerequisites for immersion.	Success in mindfulness meditation is the immediate cause of immersion, but to achieve both mindfulness and immersion it is a prerequisite (_parikkhāra_) to make an effort.
mn44:12.5	The cultivation, development, and making much of these very same things is the development of immersion.”	“Development” (_bhāvanā_) means “growing”, “amplifying”.
mn44:13.1	“How many processes are there?”	NA
mn44:13.2	“There are these three processes.	NA
mn44:13.3	Physical, verbal, and mental processes.”	These “processes” (_saṅkhārā_) apply, as we shall see, in the development of meditation ([sn41.6:1.5](), [dn18:24.1]()). They must be distinguished from the similarly named three kinds of “choices” (_saṅkhārā_) that define volitional activity determining rebirth (i.e. karma, [mn57:8.2]()). In the three “processes”, the final item is always _cittasaṅkhāra_ (“mental process”), whereas in the three “choices” the final item is usually _manosaṅkhāra_. While _mano_ and _citta_ both mean “mind”, _mano_ leans to the sense of “volition”, while _citta_ leans to the sense of “awareness”. It is a quirk of the Pali texts that they usually have _cittasaṅkhāra_ in the context of dependent origination (but see [sn12.25:13.1]()), where the Sanskrit has the expected  _manaḥsaṁskāraḥ_ (SF 165 Ādisūtra, Arv 5.2 Arthaviniścayasūtra, SF 238 Pratītyasamutpādādivibhaṅganirdeśa).
mn44:14.1	“But ma’am, what is the physical process? What’s the verbal process? What’s the mental process?”	NA
mn44:14.2	“Breathing is a physical process. Placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes. Perception and feeling are mental processes.”	NA
mn44:15.1	“But ma’am, why is breathing a physical process? Why are placing the mind and keeping it connected verbal processes? Why are perception and feeling mental processes?”	NA
mn44:15.2	“Breathing is physical. It’s tied up with the body, that’s why breathing is a physical process.	Breathing is referred to as a “physical process” in the context of breath meditation to emphasize the natural stilling that occurs as the meditation settles. | As in [mn43](), the questions are laying the groundwork for a discussion of deep meditation. Hence in these definitions what is being discussed is not “processes” in general, but the very last residue of activity or disturbance whose cessation marks the transition to a deeper level of consciousness.
mn44:15.3	First you place the mind and keep it connected, then you break into speech. That’s why placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes.	_Vitakka_ and _vicāra_ have a more basic sense in ordinary states of mind (“thought” and “exploring”) and a more refined sense in the elevated consciousness of _jhāna_ (“placing the mind” and “keeping it connected”). They act as a condition for breaking into speech, so any hint of such movement, no matter how subtle, must be abandoned.
mn44:15.4	Perception and feeling are mental. They’re tied up with the mind, that’s why perception and feeling are mental processes.”	NA
mn44:16.1	“But ma’am, how does someone attain the cessation of perception and feeling?”	NA
mn44:16.2	“A mendicant who is entering such an attainment does not think:	NA
mn44:16.3	‘I will enter the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I am entering the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I have entered the cessation of perception and feeling.’	NA
mn44:16.4	Rather, their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state.”	Compare [mn43:28.2]().
mn44:17.1	“But ma’am, which process ceases first for a mendicant who is entering the cessation of perception and feeling: physical, verbal, or mental?”	NA
mn44:17.2	“The verbal process ceases first, then physical, then mental.”	The verbal process ceases in the first absorption, the breath in the fourth absorption ([sn36.11:2.19]()), and feeling and perception in the attainment of cessation.
mn44:18.1	“But ma’am, how does someone emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling?”	NA
mn44:18.2	“A mendicant who is emerging from such an attainment does not think:	NA
mn44:18.3	‘I will emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I am emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I have emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling.’	NA
mn44:18.4	Rather, their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state.”	NA
mn44:19.1	“But ma’am, which process arises first for a mendicant who is emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling: physical, verbal, or mental?”	NA
mn44:19.2	“The mental process arises first, then physical, then verbal.”	NA
mn44:20.1	“But ma’am, when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, how many kinds of contact do they experience?”	NA
mn44:20.2	“They experience three kinds of contact: emptiness, signless, and undirected contacts.”	See the discussion on various “releases of the heart” at [mn43:26.1]() ff. Here, when emerging from cessation, the higher form of release is meant, as the meditator’s mind naturally inclines towards liberating insight.
mn44:21.1	“But ma’am, when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, what does their mind slant, slope, and incline to?”	NA
mn44:21.2	“Their mind slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion.”	Again, here the higher sense of “seclusion” is meant, namely Nibbana.
mn44:22.1	“But ma’am, how many feelings are there?”	NA
mn44:22.2	“There are three feelings:	NA
mn44:22.3	pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling.”	NA
mn44:23.1	“What are these three feelings?”	NA
mn44:23.2	“Anything felt physically or mentally as pleasant or enjoyable.	NA
mn44:23.3	This is pleasant feeling.	NA
mn44:23.4	Anything felt physically or mentally as painful or unpleasant.	NA
mn44:23.5	This is painful feeling.	NA
mn44:23.6	Anything felt physically or mentally as neither pleasurable nor painful.	NA
mn44:23.7	This is neutral feeling.”	NA
mn44:24.1	“What is pleasant and what is painful regarding each of the three feelings?”	NA
mn44:24.2	“Pleasant feeling is pleasant when it remains and painful when it perishes.	NA
mn44:24.3	Painful feeling is painful when it remains and pleasant when it perishes.	NA
mn44:24.4	Neutral feeling is pleasant in the presence of knowledge, and painful in the presence of ignorance.”	Knowledge is what distinguishes equanimity from indifference.
mn44:25.1	“What underlying tendencies underlie each of the three feelings?”	NA
mn44:25.2	“The underlying tendency for greed underlies pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency for repulsion underlies painful feeling. The underlying tendency for ignorance underlies neutral feeling.”	NA
mn44:26.1	“Do these underlying tendencies always underlie these feelings?”	NA
mn44:26.2	“No, they do not.”	The arahant still experiences feelings, but without any underlying tendencies.
mn44:27.1	“What should be given up in regard to each of these three feelings?”	NA
mn44:27.2	“The underlying tendency to greed should be given up when it comes to pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency to repulsion should be given up when it comes to painful feeling. The underlying tendency to ignorance should be given up when it comes to neutral feeling.”	NA
mn44:28.1	“Should these underlying tendencies be given up regarding all instances of these feelings?”	NA
mn44:28.2	“No, not in all instances.	NA
mn44:28.3	Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn44:28.4	With this they give up greed, and the underlying tendency to greed does not lie within that.	The pleasure of _jhāna_ arises from letting go and is not itself a source of attachment.
mn44:28.5	And take a mendicant who reflects:	NA
mn44:28.6	‘Oh, when will I enter and remain in the same dimension that the noble ones enter and remain in today?’	Also at [mn137:13.3](). That “dimension” (_āyatana_) is Nibbana ([ud8.1:3.1](), [sn35.117:8.2]()).
mn44:28.7	Nursing such a longing for the supreme liberations gives rise to sadness due to longing.	This is a kind of “suffering not of the flesh” ([mn10:32.8]()).
mn44:28.8	With this they give up repulsion, and the underlying tendency to repulsion does not lie within that.	NA
mn44:28.9	Take a mendicant who, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
mn44:28.10	With this they give up ignorance, and the underlying tendency to ignorance does not lie within that.”	NA
mn44:29.1	“But ma’am, what is the counterpart of pleasant feeling?”	NA
mn44:29.2	“Painful feeling.”	NA
mn44:29.3	“What is the counterpart of painful feeling?”	NA
mn44:29.4	“Pleasant feeling.”	NA

mn44:29.14	“Your question goes too far, Visākha. You couldn’t figure out the limit of questions.	NA
mn44:29.15	For extinguishment is the culmination, destination, and end of the spiritual life.	NA
mn44:29.16	If you wish, go to the Buddha and ask him this question. You should remember it in line with his answer.”	NA
mn44:30.1	And then the layman Visākha approved and agreed with what the nun Dhammadinnā said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled her, keeping her on his right. Then he went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,	NA
mn44:30.2	and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed.	NA
mn44:30.3	When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,	NA
mn44:30.4	“The nun Dhammadinnā is astute, Visākha, she has great wisdom.	NA
mn44:30.5	If you came to me and asked this question, I would answer it in exactly the same way as the nun Dhammadinnā.	NA
mn44:30.6	That is what it means, and that’s how you should remember it.”	NA

mn44:30.8	Satisfied, the layman Visākha approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn45:0.1	Middle Discourses 45	NA
mn45:0.2	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices	NA
mn45:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn45:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn45:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn45:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn45:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn45:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn45:2.1	“Mendicants, there are these four ways of taking up practices.	NA
mn45:2.2	What four?	NA
mn45:2.3	There is a way of taking up practices that is pleasant now but results in future pain.	NA
mn45:2.4	There is a way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain.	NA
mn45:2.5	There is a way of taking up practices that is painful now but results in future pleasure.	NA
mn45:2.6	There is a way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure.	NA
mn45:3.1	And what is the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now but results in future pain?	NA
mn45:3.2	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	NA
mn45:3.3	‘There’s nothing wrong with sensual pleasures.’	This view is said to be a cause for lower rebirth at [an3.113:1.5](), an addiction at [an3.156:1.6](), and an extreme at [ud6.8:5.4]().
mn45:3.4	They throw themselves into sensual pleasures,	NA
mn45:3.5	cavorting with female wanderers with jeweled bands in their hair.	_Moḷibaddha_ (“head-band”) appears as a bejeweled decoration for lay folk at [mil6.1.3:1.3]() and [mil6.4.2:4.2](), and with a list of garbs for ascetics at [mil5.1.6:12.5](). The Sanskrit _maulibandha_ appears in a few later texts in the same sense. None of these sources clarify who these fancy wanderer ladies might be. The Chinese parallel at MA 174, however, does not say they are wanderers. It does seem odd to find such a decorative detail being worn by wanderers, so perhaps the Pali text is confused, and the idea of wanderers wearing headbands was later adopted by the Milinda. On the other hand, later texts such as the comedy Mattavilāsaprahasana show that dissolute “renunciates” were not unknown.
mn45:3.6	They say,	NA
mn45:3.7	‘What future danger do those ascetics and brahmins see in sensual pleasures that they speak of giving up sensual pleasures, and advocate the complete understanding of sensual pleasures?	NA
mn45:3.8	Pleasant is the touch of this female wanderer’s arm, tender, soft, and downy!’ And they throw themselves into sensual pleasures.	NA
mn45:3.9	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	NA
mn45:3.10	And there they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings.	NA
mn45:3.11	They say,	NA
mn45:3.12	‘This is that future danger that those ascetics and brahmins saw. For it is because of sensual pleasures that I’m feeling painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings.’	NA
mn45:4.1	Suppose that in the last month of summer a camel’s foot creeper pod were to burst open	The “camel’s foot creeper” (_māluvā_) features in a similar simile in the Jain Sūyagaḍa 1.3.2.10.
mn45:4.2	and a seed were to fall at the root of a sal tree.	NA
mn45:4.3	Then the deity haunting that sal tree would become apprehensive and nervous.	NA
mn45:4.4	But their friends and colleagues, relatives and kin—deities of the parks, forests, trees, and those who haunt the herbs, grass, and big trees—would come together to reassure them,	NA
mn45:4.5	‘Do not fear, sir, do not fear!	NA
mn45:4.6	Hopefully that seed will be swallowed by a peacock, or eaten by a deer, or burnt by a forest fire, or picked up by a lumberjack, or eaten by termites, or it may not even be fertile.’	On “eaten by termites”, Bhikkhu Ñāṇatusita, whose expertise in Pali is rivaled only by his knowledge of botany, says in his notes to Bhikkhu Bodhi’s translation, “Perhaps even the whole seed was eaten since the Maloo Creeper, a member of the legume family, has a hard woody seed. It is eaten by forest people in India, supposedly after removing the skin. Termites do not carry away seeds like ants would do, they eat things at the spot. Besides this, the seed is quite large. Thus _udrabheyyuṁ_ is probably the right reading. It is supported by the commentary, which glosses it as _khādeyyuṁ_.”
mn45:4.7	But none of these things happened. And the seed was fertile, so that when the monsoon clouds soaked it with rain, it sprouted.	NA
mn45:4.8	And the creeper wound its tender, soft, and downy tendrils around that sal tree.	NA
mn45:4.9	Then the deity thought,	NA
mn45:4.10	‘What future danger did my friends see when they said:	NA
mn45:4.11	“Do not fear, sir, do not fear!	NA
mn45:4.12	Hopefully that seed will be swallowed by a peacock, or eaten by a deer, or burnt by a forest fire, or picked up by a lumberjack, or eaten by termites, or it may not even be fertile.”	NA
mn45:4.13	Pleasant is the touch of this creeper’s tender, soft, and downy tendrils.’	NA
mn45:4.14	Then the creeper enfolded the sal tree,	NA
mn45:4.15	made a canopy over it,	NA
mn45:4.16	draped a curtain around it,	NA

mn46:17.14	These are the four ways of taking up practices.	NA
mn46:18.1	Suppose there was some bitter gourd mixed with poison.	NA
mn46:18.2	Then a man would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain.	NA
mn46:18.3	They’d say to him:	NA
mn46:18.4	‘Here, worthy man, this is bitter gourd mixed with poison.	NA
mn46:18.5	Drink it if you like.	NA
mn46:18.6	If you drink it, the color, aroma, and flavor will be unappetizing, and it will result in death or deadly pain.’	NA
mn46:18.7	He wouldn’t reject it. Without reflection, he’d drink it.	NA
mn46:18.8	The color, aroma, and flavor would be unappetizing, and it would result in death or deadly pain.	NA
mn46:18.9	This is comparable to the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain, I say.	NA
mn46:19.1	Suppose there was a bronze goblet of beverage that had a nice color, aroma, and flavor.	NA
mn46:19.2	But it was mixed with poison.	NA
mn46:19.3	Then a man would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain.	NA

mn46:19.10	The color, aroma, and flavor would be appetizing, but it would result in death or deadly pain.	NA
mn46:19.11	This is comparable to the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pain, I say.	NA
mn46:20.1	Suppose there was some rancid urine mixed with different medicines.	Rancid urine was the worst of medicines, used when nothing better was available. Specifically, the Vinaya allows it as a purgative in the case of snakebite ([pli-tv-kd6:14.6.4]()), and gives chebulic myrobalan soaked in cattle urine as a remedy for jaundice ([pli-tv-kd6:14.7.9]()). Modern research has shown that urine, far from being a sterile cure-all, contains [dangerous](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3032614/) levels of [bacterial pathogens](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3957746/), and has [no  medicinal value](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2023/03/29/fact-check-drinking-urine-carries-health-risks-no-sight-benefits/11561019002/).
mn46:20.2	Then a man with jaundice would come along.	NA
mn46:20.3	They’d say to him:	NA
mn46:20.4	‘Here, worthy man, this is rancid urine mixed with different medicines. Drink it if you like.	NA
mn46:20.5	If you drink it, the color, aroma, and flavor will be unappetizing, but after drinking it you will be happy.’	NA
mn46:20.6	He wouldn’t reject it. After appraisal, he’d drink it.	NA
mn46:20.7	The color, aroma, and flavor would be unappetizing, but after drinking it he would be happy.	NA
mn46:20.8	This is comparable to the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pleasure, I say.	NA
mn46:21.1	Suppose there was some curds, honey, ghee, and molasses all mixed together.	NA
mn46:21.2	Then a man with bloody dysentery would come along.	NA
mn46:21.3	They’d say to him:	NA
mn46:21.4	‘Here, worthy man, this is curds, honey, ghee, and molasses all mixed together. Drink it if you like.	NA
mn46:21.5	If you drink it, the color, aroma, and flavor will be appetizing, and after drinking it you will be happy.’	NA
mn46:21.6	He wouldn’t reject it. After appraisal, he’d drink it.	NA
mn46:21.7	The color, aroma, and flavor would be appetizing, and after drinking it he would be happy.	NA
mn46:21.8	This is comparable to the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure, I say.	NA
mn46:22.1	It’s like the last month of the rainy season, in autumn,  when the heavens are clear and cloudless. And as the sun is rising to the firmament, having dispelled all the darkness of space, it shines and glows and radiates.	NA
mn46:22.2	In the same way, this way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure dispels the doctrines of the various other ascetics and brahmins as it shines and glows and radiates.”	This text as well as [mn45:7.9]() answer the question of what practice results in future happiness, and so do not consider awakening. It is surprising to see such bold praise for such a modest teaching. The Chinese parallels to these suttas have the inverse situation, as they describe a practice leading to non-return (MA 174 at T i 712b27) or Nibbana (MA 175 at T i 712c25, T 83 at T i 902c10), yet do not have this passage of praise.
mn46:22.3	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn46:22.4	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn47:0.1	Middle Discourses 47	NA
mn47:0.2	The Inquirer	NA
mn47:1.1	So I have heard.	In this sutta, the Buddha shows his commitment to radical accountability and integrity. He does not merely pay lip service to the notion of open inquiry, but lays out a detailed and exacting procedure by which his students should test him. By extension, this approach may be applied to any spiritual teacher.
mn47:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn47:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn47:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn47:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn47:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn47:2.1	“Mendicants, a mendicant who is an inquirer, unable to comprehend another’s mind, should scrutinize the Realized One to understand whether he is a fully awakened Buddha or not.”	The ability to comprehend the mind of another was considered an advanced meditative skill, not accessible even to all arahants. It allowed one to read the mind of another to the extent of one’s own realization.
mn47:3.1	“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	NA
mn47:3.2	“Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn47:3.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
mn47:3.4	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn47:4.1	“Mendicants, a mendicant who is an inquirer, unable to comprehend another’s mind, should scrutinize the Realized One for two things—things that can be seen and heard:	NA
mn47:4.2	‘Can anything corrupt be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’	This refers to bodily behavior that might be seen or speech that might be heard.
mn47:4.3	Scrutinizing him they find that	NA
mn47:4.4	nothing corrupt can be seen or heard in the Realized One.	NA
mn47:5.1	NA	NA
mn47:5.2	They scrutinize further:	NA
mn47:5.3	‘Can anything mixed be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’	NA
mn47:5.4	Scrutinizing him they find that	NA
mn47:5.5	nothing mixed can be seen or heard in the Realized One.	NA
mn47:6.1	NA	NA
mn47:6.2	They scrutinize further:	NA
mn47:6.3	‘Can anything clean be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’	NA
mn47:6.4	Scrutinizing him they find that	NA
mn47:6.5	clean things can be seen and heard in the Realized One.	NA
mn47:7.1	NA	NA
mn47:7.2	They scrutinize further:	NA
mn47:7.3	‘Did the venerable attain this skillful state a long time ago, or just recently?’	It is easy to maintain a front for while, but defilements tend to reveal themselves over time.
mn47:7.4	Scrutinizing him they find that	NA
mn47:7.5	the venerable attained this skillful state a long time ago, not just recently.	NA
mn47:8.1	NA	NA
mn47:8.2	They scrutinize further:	NA
mn47:8.3	‘Are certain dangers found in that venerable mendicant who has achieved fame and renown?’	NA
mn47:8.4	For, mendicants, so long as a mendicant has not achieved fame and renown, certain dangers are not found in them.	NA
mn47:8.5	But when they achieve fame and renown, those dangers appear.	NA
mn47:8.6	Scrutinizing him they find that	NA
mn47:8.7	those dangers are not found in that venerable mendicant who has achieved fame and renown.	NA
mn47:9.1	NA	NA
mn47:9.2	They scrutinize further:	NA
mn47:9.3	‘Is this venerable securely stilled or insecurely stilled?	Here _uparata_ means “stilled, ceased” rather than “restrained”. The commentary explains that one has become stilled (_uparata_) due to the absence of perils (_abhaya_). The test aims to distinguish the arahant from those for whom the perils of defilements and rebirth, though possibly suppressed for a time through the power of _jhāna_, are still present.
mn47:9.4	Is the reason they don’t indulge in sensual pleasures that they’re free of greed because greed has ended?’	NA
mn47:9.5	Scrutinizing him they find that	NA
mn47:9.6	that venerable is securely stilled, not insecurely stilled.	NA
mn47:9.7	The reason they don’t indulge in sensual pleasures is that they’re free of greed because greed has ended.	NA
mn47:10.1	If others should ask that mendicant,	NA
mn47:10.2	‘But what reason and evidence does the venerable have for saying this?’	NA
mn47:10.3	NA	NA
mn47:10.4	NA	NA
mn47:10.5	Answering rightly, the mendicant should say,	NA
mn47:10.6	‘Because, whether that venerable is staying in a community or alone, some people there are in a good state or a sorry state, some instruct a group, and some are seen among pleasures of the flesh while others remain unsullied. Yet that venerable doesn’t look down on them for that.	The commentary explains _sugata_ and _duggata_ here as “well practiced” and “poorly practiced”. But the normal sense is one who is in a “good state” or a “sorry state”, typically associated with rebirth, but also with, for example, the “sorry state” of poverty or reduced circumstances ([pli-tv-kd10:2.4.4](), [pli-tv-kd6:15.5.10]()). Notice that there are people nearby even when he is living alone, so this must include lay folk as well as monastics. The point is that the Buddha does not despise the poor or show favors to the rich.
mn47:10.7	Also, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:	NA
mn47:10.8	“I am securely stilled, not insecurely stilled. The reason I don’t indulge in sensual pleasures is that I’m free of greed because greed has ended.”’	These exact words are not spoken by the Buddha in suttas. However the early Abhidhamma text Puggalapaññatti explains that “insecurely stilled” includes the seven trainees and ethical ordinary people, while the arahant is “securely stilled” ([pp2.1:11.1]()). Since the Puggalapaññatti consists mainly of lightly adapted quotes from the suttas, it is possible that this passage has been lost from the suttas as they stand. This would explain why these terms are invoked here as if they were known.
mn47:11.1	Next, they should ask the Realized One himself about this,	NA
mn47:11.2	‘Can anything corrupt be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’	NA
mn47:11.3	The Realized One would answer,	NA
mn47:11.4	‘Nothing corrupt can be seen or heard in the Realized One.’	NA
mn47:12.1	‘Can anything mixed be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’	NA
mn47:12.2	The Realized One would answer,	NA
mn47:12.3	‘Nothing mixed can be seen or heard in the Realized One.’	NA
mn47:13.1	‘Can anything clean be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’	NA
mn47:13.2	The Realized One would answer,	NA
mn47:13.3	‘Clean things can be seen and heard in the Realized One.	NA
mn47:13.4	I am the scope and the range of that, but I am not determined by that.’	_Etaṁ_ is the accusative of relation, familiar from such phrases as _taṁ gotamaṁ evaṁ kalyāṇo kittisaddo abbhuggato_ (“a good word *of that* Gotama has spread”). | _Ahamasmi_ (“I am”) asserts identity (not possession per the commentary). It is an Upaniṣadic turn of phrase. | _Tammaya_ (“determined by that”, literally “made with that”) is found occasionally in the suttas (also [mn137:20.3](), [mn113:21.7](), [an3.40:7.4](), [an6.104](), [snp4.9:12.2]()). The Buddha’s usage echoes Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.5, which begins, “This self is indeed divinity, made with consciousness …” (_sa vā ayamātmā brahma vijñānamayo_). It goes on to list many other items of which the self is comprised (_idaṁmayo_), the point being that the self is ultimately created by its actions (_yathākārī yathācārī tathā bhavati_), a detail that emphasizes the causal sense of _-maya_. Thus the term does not simply point to that which is the self, but rather that by which the self is shaped or determined. Yajñavalkya also uses _etanmaya_ in the same sense in such passages as Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 10.4.2.30: “that (self) is made with hymns, sacrifices, breaths, and divinities” (_candomaya stomamayaḥ prāṇamayo devatāmayaḥ sa etanmaya_) and Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.5.3: “that self is made with this: speech, mind, and breath” (_etanmayo vā ayam ātmā: vāṅmayo manomayaḥ prāṇamayaḥ_). Thus the term emphasizes the Buddha’s freedom from conditions. He exemplifies good qualities but is not “determined” by their kammic force.
mn47:14.1	A disciple ought to approach a teacher who has such a doctrine in order to listen to the teaching.	NA
mn47:14.2	The teacher explains Dhamma with its higher and higher stages, with its better and better stages, with its dark and bright sides.	Cp. [an5.180]().
mn47:14.3	When they directly know a certain principle of those teachings, in accordance with how they were taught, the mendicant comes to a conclusion about the teachings. They have confidence in the teacher:	NA

mn47:16.1	When someone’s faith is settled, rooted, and planted in the Realized One in this manner, with these words and phrases, it’s said to be grounded faith that’s based on evidence.	In this sentence the word _ākāra_ is used in two distinct senses. In the stock phrase “in this manner, with these words and phrases” (_imehi ākārehi imehi padehi imehi byañjanehi_) it means “manner” of exposition ([mn18:20.17](), [sn35.116:10.14](), [an10.115:21.2]()). In the phrase “grounded faith” (_ākāravatī saddhā_) it means a “ground” or “reason” on which faith is based.
mn47:16.2	It is strong, and cannot be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world.	Various editions (MS, PTS, BJT) followed by translators (Bodhi, Horner) connect _daḷhā_ with the foregoing _dassanamūlikā_. But that foregoing text is missing in the parallels for this passage ([dn27:9.3](), [sn48.42:6.4](), [iti83:10.1]()). _Daḷhā_ is connected rather with _asaṁhāriyā_, which is in any case semantically closer than _dassanamūlikā_.

mn48:0.2	The Mendicants of Kosambī	NA
mn48:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn48:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery.	NA
mn48:2.1	Now at that time the mendicants of Kosambī were arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words.	This is in reference to the notorious quarrel at Kosambī, also referred to at [mn128:2.1](). The events are detailed in the Vinaya at [pli-tv-kd10]().
mn48:2.2	They couldn’t persuade each other or be persuaded, nor could they convince each other or be convinced.	NA
mn48:3.1	Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was happening.	NA
mn48:3.2	NA	NA
mn48:4.1	So the Buddha addressed one of the monks,	NA
mn48:4.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell those mendicants that	NA
mn48:4.3	the teacher summons them.”	NA
mn48:4.4	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to those monks and said,	NA
mn48:4.5	“Venerables, the teacher summons you.”	NA
mn48:4.6	“Yes, reverend,” those monks replied. They went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them,	NA
mn48:4.7	“Is it really true, mendicants, that you have been arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words?	NA
mn48:4.8	And that you can’t persuade each other or be persuaded, nor can you convince each other or be convinced?”	NA
mn48:4.9	“Yes, sir,” they said.	NA
mn48:5.1	“What do you think, mendicants?	NA
mn48:5.2	When you’re arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words, are you treating your spiritual companions with kindness by way of body, speech, and mind, both in public and in private?”	NA
mn48:5.3	“No, sir.”	NA
mn48:5.4	“So it seems that when you’re arguing you are not treating each other with kindness.	NA
mn48:5.5	So what exactly do you know and see, you futile men, that you behave in such a way?	NA
mn48:5.6	This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.”	NA
mn48:6.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:	NA
mn48:6.2	“Mendicants, these six warm-hearted qualities make for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.	Also taught at [mn104:21.1](), [an6.11:1.1](), and [an6.12:1.1](), and collected at [dn33:2.2.37]() and [dn34:1.7.3]().

mn48:6.16	These six warm-hearted qualities make for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.	NA
mn48:7.1	Of these six warm-hearted qualities, the chief is the view that is noble and emancipating, and delivers one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering. It holds and binds everything together.	NA
mn48:7.2	It’s like a bungalow. The roof-peak is the chief point, which holds and binds everything together.	NA
mn48:7.3	In the same way, of these six warm-hearted qualities, the chief is the view that is noble and emancipating, and delivers one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering. It holds and binds everything together.	NA
mn48:8.1	And how does the view that is noble and emancipating lead one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering?	NA
mn48:8.2	It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this,	NA
mn48:8.3	‘Is there anything that I’m overcome with internally and haven’t given up, because of which I might not accurately know and see?’	NA

mn48:8.14	My mind is properly disposed for awakening to the truths.’	NA
mn48:8.15	This is the first knowledge they have achieved that is noble and transcendent, and is distinct from that of ordinary people.	NA

mn48:11.5	Though they may fall into a kind of offense for which resolution is possible, they quickly disclose, clarify, and reveal it to the Teacher or a sensible spiritual companion.	Vinaya offences fall into a number of classes, all of which must be confessed by a guilty monastic to their fellow monastics. Some are resolved upon confession, others by undergoing a procedure of relinquishment or temporary suspension. However, the most serious offences—sexual intercourse, murder, stealing, and lying about spiritual attainments—entail immediate and permanent expulsion. Offences are further distinguished by intention, as some offences may be transgressed without ill intent or even unknowingly (for example, eating at the wrong time). A stream-enterer cannot commit an expulsion offence, but they may commit one of the other offences without ill intent.
mn48:11.6	And having revealed it they restrain themselves in the future.	NA
mn48:11.7	Suppose there was a little baby boy. If he puts his hand or foot on a burning coal, he quickly pulls it back.	NA
mn48:11.8	In the same way, this is the nature of a person accomplished in view.	NA

mn48:12.4	This is the nature of a person accomplished in view.	NA
mn48:12.5	Though they might manage a diverse spectrum of duties for their spiritual companions, they still feel a keen regard for the training in higher ethics, higher mind, and higher wisdom.	NA
mn48:12.6	Suppose there was a cow with a baby calf. She watches her calf devotedly as she grazes.	The verb _apacinati_ is an irregular form of _apacāyati_, to “watch” but also to “revere”.
mn48:12.7	In the same way, this is the nature of a person accomplished in view.	NA
mn48:12.8	Though they might manage a diverse spectrum of duties for their spiritual companions, they still feel a keen regard for the training in higher ethics, higher mind, and higher wisdom.	NA
mn48:12.9	They understand,	NA

mn48:13.3	And what, mendicants, is the strength of a person accomplished in view?	NA
mn48:13.4	The strength of a person accomplished in view is that, when the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One are being taught, they pay attention, apply the mind, concentrate wholeheartedly, and actively listen to the teaching.	NA

mn48:14.3	And what, mendicants, is the strength of a person accomplished in view?	NA
mn48:14.4	The strength of a person accomplished in view is that, when the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One are being taught, they find inspiration in the meaning and the teaching, and find joy connected with the teaching.	NA
mn48:14.5	They understand,	NA
mn48:14.6	‘I have the same strength as a person accomplished in view.’	NA
mn48:14.7	This is the seventh knowledge they have achieved that is noble and transcendent, and is distinct from that of ordinary people.	NA
mn48:15.1	When a noble disciple has these seven factors, they have properly investigated their nature through the realization of the fruit of stream-entry.	Normally _sotāpattiphalasacchikiriyāya_ is dative, “*for* the realization of the fruit of stream-entry”, but that cannot be the case here as they are already a stream-enterer. The commentary reads it as instrumental.
mn48:15.2	A noble disciple with these seven factors has the fruit of stream-entry.”	NA
mn48:15.3	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn48:15.4	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn49:0.1	Middle Discourses 49	NA
mn49:0.2	On the Invitation of Divinity	NA
mn49:1.1	So I have heard.	This sutta is a unique fusion of high philosophy and cosmic drama, positing an unthinkable alliance between what in Christian terms would be called God and the Devil. Nonetheless, due to a plethora of textual difficulties and uncertain readings, caution in interpretation would be wise.
mn49:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn49:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn49:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn49:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn49:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn49:2.1	“This one time, mendicants, I was staying near Ukkaṭṭhā, in the Subhaga Forest at the root of a magnificent sal tree.	[sn6.4](), which otherwise opens with the same events, is simply set in Sāvatthī with no mention of Ukkaṭṭhā, which is the same setting as [mn1](), with which this sutta shares some themes. Both critique the sophisticated philosophy of the Kosalan brahmins, and hence are set in the town of their leader Pokkharasāti ([dn3:1.2.1]()).
mn49:2.2	Now at that time Baka the Divinity had the following harmful misconception:	Baka maintains the same wrong view at [sn6.4](), where his past lives are revealed. The word _baka_ means “stork” or “crane”. To search for a high divinity of this name in Brahmanism is to be disappointed, for instead we find a man-eating demon (_rakṣasa_) in bird form whose fate is to be slain by the hero Bhīma (or Kṛṣṇa). Pali stories tell of how the stork dozes peacefully as if meditating by the water, while in reality he is trying to fool fish into approaching so he can snatch them up ([ja38](), [ja236]()). A cunning, large, white, high-flying, predatory bird who fakes meditation is a fitting image for the antagonist of these suttas.
mn49:2.3	‘This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is whole, this is not liable to pass away. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.’	The use of the impersonal pronoun (_idaṁ_) to refer to the self as divinity is a characteristic Upaniṣadic idiom: “you are that” (_tat tvam asi_, Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.8.7); “that self is divinity” (_ayam ātmā brahma_, Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 1.2); “I am that” (_so’ham asmi_, Īśa Upaniṣad 16); “this is that self hidden in all” (_eṣa ta ātmā sarvāntaraḥ_, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.4.1, etc.); “this, verily, is that” (_etad vai tat_, Kaṭha Upaniṣad 2.1.5). | For _idaṁ niccaṁ_ see _eṣa nityo_ (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.23); for _idaṁ dhuvaṁ_ see _etad apramayaṁ dhruvam_ (4.4.20).
mn49:3.1	Then I knew what Baka the Divinity was thinking.	NA
mn49:3.2	As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, I vanished from the Subhaga Forest and reappeared in that realm of divinity.	NA
mn49:3.3	Baka saw me coming off in the distance	NA
mn49:3.4	and said,	NA
mn49:3.5	‘Come, good fellow! Welcome, good fellow!	“Good fellow” (_mārisa_; Sanskrit _mārṣa_, _māriṣa_) is a special term of address used by deities and sometimes by kings. The term harks back to Sanskrit _mādṛśa_, “one like me”, in the sense of having a comparable status.
mn49:3.6	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.	NA
mn49:3.7	For this is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is complete, this is not liable to pass away. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.’	NA
mn49:4.1	When he had spoken, I said to him,	NA
mn49:4.2	‘Oh lord, Baka the Divinity is lost in ignorance! Oh lord, Baka the Divinity is lost in ignorance!	NA
mn49:4.3	Because what is actually impermanent, not lasting, transient, incomplete, and liable to pass away, he says is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and not liable to pass away.	NA
mn49:4.4	And where there is being born, growing old, dying, passing away, and being reborn, he says that	NA
mn49:4.5	there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.	NA
mn49:4.6	And although there is another escape beyond this, he says that there’s no other escape beyond this.’	NA
mn49:5.1	Then Māra the Wicked took possession of a member of the retinue of Divinity and said this to me,	From this point the text diverges from [sn6.4:4.1]().
mn49:5.2	‘Mendicant, mendicant! Don’t attack this one! Don’t attack this one! For this is the Divinity, the Great Divinity, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born.	Māra adopts the boast of Brahmā ([dn1:2.5.2]()). | It is rare for the Buddha to be addressed as “mendicant” (_bhikkhu_) and it is probably meant in a slighting sense.
mn49:5.3	There have been ascetics and brahmins before you, mendicant, who criticized and loathed earth, water, fire, air, creatures, gods, the Progenitor, and the Divinity.	This is a summary of the items in [mn1](). | The “ascetics and brahmins” referred to here would include the ancient practitioners of movements such as Jainism, whose rejection of Vedism predates the Buddha.
mn49:5.4	When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a lower realm.	“With breath cut off” (_pāṇupacchedā_) is a unique idiom for death in Pali, but compare Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.5.14: _prāṇaṁ na vicchindyāt_; Atharvaveda 19.58.1c: _prāṇo’chinno_.
mn49:5.5	There have been ascetics and brahmins before you, mendicant, who praised and approved earth, water, fire, air, creatures, gods, the Progenitor, and the Divinity.	This would be the ancient sages revered in the Vedic tradition.
mn49:5.6	When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a higher realm.	NA
mn49:5.7	So, mendicant, I tell you this:	NA
mn49:5.8	please, good fellow, do exactly what the Divinity says. Don’t go beyond the word of the Divinity.	NA
mn49:5.9	If you do, then you’ll end up like a person who, when approached by Lady Luck, would ward her off with a staff; or who, as they are falling over a cliff, would lose grip of the ground with their hands and feet.	“Lady Luck” is Siri, later famed as goddess of fortune and prosperity. The same idiom recurs at [thag8.3:2.1](). As to why someone would ward her off, Siri (Sanskrit _śrī_) is identified with Lakṣmī “the undeparting” (Śrī Sūkta 2, _lakṣmīmanapagāminīm_). Atharva Veda 7.115 opens with, “Fly away wicked Lakṣmī, vanish, fly hence”. Apparently 101 Lakṣmīs attach to a man when born, and the spell chases away the wicked (_pāpi_) while keeping the good (_puṇya_). In this case the Pali text does not draw directly from the Veda, as there is no close verbal parallel, and the Pali presents as irrational an action that makes good sense in the context of the Vedic passage. Rather, it would seem, the Pali draws from a more general cultural awareness. | For “falling over a cliff” see [dn12:78.2]().
mn49:5.10	Please, good fellow, do exactly what the Divinity says. Don’t go beyond the word of the Divinity.	NA
mn49:5.11	Do you not see the assembly of the Divinity gathered here?’	NA
mn49:5.12	And so Māra the Wicked presented the assembly of the Divinity to me.	NA
mn49:6.1	When he had spoken, I said to Māra,	NA
mn49:6.2	‘I know you, Wicked One. Do not think,	NA
mn49:6.3	“He does not know me.”	NA
mn49:6.4	You are Māra the Wicked.	NA
mn49:6.5	And the Divinity, the Divinity’s assembly, and the retinue of Divinity have all fallen into your hands; they’re under your sway.	Normally Māra is believed to hold sway over all the sensual realms, while the _jhānas_ (and their corresponding planes of rebirth) are beyond him ([mn25:12.1]()). Here his reach goes even further, as even the Brahmā realms, while freed from sensuality, are not freed from the attachment to continued existence.
mn49:6.6	And you think,	NA
mn49:6.7	“Maybe this one, too, has fallen into my hands; maybe he’s under my sway!”	NA
mn49:6.8	But I haven’t fallen into your hands; I’m not under your sway.’	NA
mn49:7.1	When I had spoken, Baka the Divinity said to me,	NA
mn49:7.2	‘But, good fellow, what I say is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and not liable to pass away is in fact permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and not liable to pass away. And where I say there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn there is in fact	One of Māra’s talents is making people believe that his malign ideas are in fact their own.
mn49:7.3	no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.	NA
mn49:7.4	And when I say there’s no other escape beyond this there is in fact no other escape beyond this.	NA
mn49:7.5	There have been ascetics and brahmins in the world before you, mendicant, whose deeds of fervent mortification lasted as long as your entire life.	Note the use of _kasiṇa_ in the sense “entire”.
mn49:7.6	When there was another escape beyond this they knew it, and when there was no other escape beyond this, they knew it.	NA
mn49:7.7	So, mendicant, I tell you this:	NA
mn49:7.8	you will never find another escape beyond this, and you will eventually get weary and frustrated.	NA
mn49:7.9	If you attach to earth, you will lie close to me, in my domain, subject to my will, and expendable.	NA
mn49:7.10	If you attach to water …	NA
mn49:7.11	fire …	NA
mn49:7.12	air …	NA
mn49:7.13	creatures …	NA
mn49:7.14	gods …	NA
mn49:7.15	the Progenitor …	NA
mn49:7.16	the Divinity, you will lie close to me, in my domain, subject to my will, and expendable.’	NA
mn49:8.1	‘Divinity, I too know that	NA
mn49:8.2	if I attach to earth, I will lie close to you, in your domain, subject to your will, and expendable.	NA
mn49:8.3	If I attach to water …	NA
mn49:8.4	fire …	NA
mn49:8.5	air …	NA
mn49:8.6	creatures …	NA
mn49:8.7	gods …	NA
mn49:8.8	the Progenitor …	NA
mn49:8.9	the Divinity, I will lie close to you, in your domain, subject to your will, and expendable. And in addition, Divinity, I understand your range and your light:	The measuring of a Brahmā by their “light” (_juti_) shows the close connection between divinity and the stars.
mn49:8.10	“That’s how powerful is Baka the Divinity, how illustrious and mighty.”’	NA
mn49:8.11	‘But in what way do you understand my range and my light?’	NA
mn49:9.1	‘A galaxy extends a thousand times as far	NA
mn49:9.2	as the moon and sun revolve	NA
mn49:9.3	and the shining ones light up the quarters.	NA
mn49:9.4	And there you wield your power.	NA
mn49:9.5	You know the high and low,	NA
mn49:9.6	the passionate and dispassionate,	NA
mn49:9.7	and the coming and going of sentient beings	NA
mn49:9.8	from this realm to another.	NA
mn49:9.9	That’s how I understand your range and your light.	NA
mn49:10.1	But there are three other realms that you don’t know or see,	MS reads _añño kāyo_ (“another realm”), but the PTS and BJT reading _aññe tayo kāyā_ is supported by the Chinese parallel (MA 78 at T i 548a28). Possibly this change was necessitated by the addition of a fourth realm below.
mn49:10.2	but which I know and see.	PTS and BJT have _tyāhaṁ_ (= _te ahaṁ_), consistent with their plural reading, as opposed to MS’s singular _tamahaṁ_. This shows that this variation, which is not decided by the commentary, was a deliberate editorial choice.
mn49:10.3	There is the realm named after the gods of streaming radiance. You passed away from there and were reborn here.	Here _ābhassarā_ is masculine plural, hence not an adjective of _kāyo_ but a reference to the “gods” of that realm. MS is inconsistent in this point, for below we find _subhakiṇho_ and_vehapphalo_ as singular adjectives, where PTS and BJT consistently use the plural form.
mn49:10.4	You’ve dwelt here so long that you’ve forgotten about that, so you don’t know it or see it.	Brahmā also forgets his origins at [dn1:2.2.1]().
mn49:10.5	But I know it and see it.	NA
mn49:10.6	So Divinity, I am not your equal in knowledge, let alone your inferior.	NA
mn49:10.7	Rather, I know more than you.	NA
mn49:10.8	There is the realm named after the gods of universal beauty … There is the realm named after the gods of abundant fruit, which you don’t know or see.	MS adds a fourth class here, _abhibhū_ (“the Vanquisher”), which is not supported by PTS or BJT, or the Chinese parallel.
mn49:10.9	But I know it and see it.	NA
mn49:10.10	So Divinity, I am not your equal in knowledge, let alone your inferior.	NA
mn49:10.11	Rather, I know more than you.	NA
mn49:11.1	Since directly knowing earth as earth, and since directly knowing that which does not fall within the scope of experience characterized by earth, I have not become earth, I have not become in earth, I have not become as earth, I have not become one who thinks ‘earth is mine’, I have not affirmed earth.	This difficult passage directly echoes [mn1:3.3](). | _Anubhūta_ has its normal sense of “experiences”, “undergoes” ([thig10.1:8.2](), more commonly _paccanubhūta_, eg. [mn79:8.1](), [sn15.1:1.14]()). Commentary has _appattaṁ_, “not attained” (i.e. not within the scope of absorption). | That which “falls within the scope of experience characterized by earth” (_yāvatā pathaviyā pathavattena ananubhūtaṁ_) is sense experience and the four absorptions; that which does not fall in such a scope are the formless attainments and especially Nibbana. | For _nāhosiṁ_ (prefer over MS _nāpahosiṁ_) the commentary glosses “grasps”. The sense is that he does not identify. | For _abhivadati_, compare Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.14, which says that so long as there is the appearance of duality, one sees, hears, smells, “speaks about” (_abhivadati_), “conceives” (_manute_), and “cognizes” (_vijānāti_) particulars. Notice that this employs _abhivadati_ alongside _manute_, just as _abhivadati_ in the Pali appears alongside where _maññati_ appears in [mn1:3.3]().

mn49:23.1	Since directly knowing all as all, and since directly knowing that which does not fall within the scope of experience characterized by all, I have not become all, I have not become in all, I have not become as all, I have not become one who thinks ‘all is mine’, I have not affirmed all.	This whole passage seems designed to culminate with “experience characterized by all” (_sabbassa sabbattena ananubhūtaṁ_) in answer to Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.5.19, which says that “this self that experiences all is divinity” (_ayam ātmā brahma sarvānubhūḥ_). In surpassing even the “experience of all” the Buddha unequivocally asserts his superiority to the Upaniṣadic teaching.
mn49:23.2	So Divinity, I am not your equal in knowledge, let alone your inferior.	NA
mn49:23.3	Rather, I know more than you.’	NA
mn49:24.1	‘Well, good fellow, if you have directly known that which does not fall within the scope of experience characterized by all, may that not be vacuous and hollow for you!	The close _-ti_ in MS edition indicates the end of Baka’s speech, but this is not found in PTS or BJT editions. If the close _-ti_ is accepted here, then the next paragraph is spoken by the Buddha and it should also end with close _-ti_, but no edition has this. We would also expect the Buddha to use a vocative, but there is none. The only reading that is both coherent and attested is that Baka’s speech begins here and ends when he says he will vanish. This is supported by the Chinese parallel, which while lacking an exact equivalent, attributes a similar claim to Brahmā (MA 78 at T i 548b11).
mn49:25.1	Consciousness where no form appears,	These two lines, which appear to be an independent, free-floating expression of the Upaniṣadic view, are quoted at [dn11:85.18](). Baka is asserting that what the Buddha has described is none other than the domain of “infinite consciousness”, which is one of the highest attainments attributed to Brahmanical sages. | “Where no form appears” (_anidassanaṁ_) here is a synonym for “formless” (see eg. [mn21:14.8](), “space is formless and invisible”, _ākāso arūpī anidassano_). Normally the colors and images seen in the “form” absorptions are described as “visible” (eg. [dn16:3.29.1]()), so this indicates the formless attainments.
mn49:25.2	infinite, luminous all-round.	NA
mn49:25.3	That is what does not fall within the scope of experience characterized by earth, water, fire, air, creatures, gods, the Progenitor, the Divinity, the gods of streaming radiance, the gods of universal beauty, the gods of abundant fruit, the Vanquisher, and the all.	NA
mn49:26.1	Well look now, good fellow, I will vanish from you!’	NA
mn49:26.2	‘All right, then, Divinity, vanish from me—if you can.’	NA
mn49:26.3	Then Baka the Divinity said,	NA
mn49:26.4	‘I will vanish from the ascetic Gotama! I will vanish from the ascetic Gotama!’ But he was unable to vanish from me.	Since he believes the dimension of infinite consciousness is that which the Buddha speaks of, he mistakenly assumes he has the power.
mn49:26.5	So I said to him,	NA
mn49:26.6	‘Well now, Divinity, I will vanish from you!’	NA
mn49:26.7	‘All right, then, good fellow, vanish from me—if you can.’	NA
mn49:26.8	Then I used my psychic power to will that	NA
mn49:26.9	my voice would extend so that Divinity, his assembly, and his retinue would hear me, but they would not see me.	This is a dramatic expression of the philosophical gulf between the Buddha and Baka. Baka’s power manifests as “light”, whereas the Buddha demonstrates invisibility.
mn49:26.10	And while vanished I recited this verse:	NA
mn49:27.1	‘Seeing the danger in continued existence—	The Buddha shifts the focus from the attainment of a state of exalted consciousness to the cessation of existence.
mn49:27.2	that life in any existence will cease to be—	Following Bodhi and Critical Pali Dictionary in reading _vibhavesi_. | The _ca_ here answers to the last line of the verse.
mn49:27.3	I didn’t affirm any kind of existence,	NA
mn49:27.4	and didn’t grasp at relishing.’	NA
mn49:28.1	Then the Divinity, his assembly, and his retinue, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought,	NA
mn49:28.2	‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!	NA
mn49:28.3	The ascetic Gotama has such psychic power and might! We’ve never before seen or heard of any other ascetic or brahmin with psychic power and might like the ascetic Gotama, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan.	NA
mn49:28.4	Though people enjoy continued existence, loving it so much, he has extracted it, root and all.’	NA
mn49:29.1	Then Māra the Wicked took possession of a member of the retinue of Divinity and said this to me,	NA
mn49:29.2	‘If such is your understanding, good fellow, do not present it to your disciples or those gone forth!	The verb _upanesi_ here is used above at [mn49:5.12]() in the opposite case, where Māra “presents” Brahmā’s assembly to the Buddha.
mn49:29.3	Do not teach this Dhamma to your disciples or those gone forth!	NA
mn49:29.4	Do not wish this for your disciples or those gone forth!	NA
mn49:29.5	There have been ascetics and brahmins before you, mendicant, who claimed to be perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.	NA
mn49:29.6	They presented, taught, and wished this for their disciples and those gone forth.	NA
mn49:29.7	When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a lower realm.	NA
mn49:29.8	But there have also been other ascetics and brahmins before you, mendicant, who claimed to be perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.	NA
mn49:29.9	They did not present, teach, or wish this for their disciples and those gone forth.	NA
mn49:29.10	When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a higher realm.	NA
mn49:29.11	So, mendicant, I tell you this:	NA
mn49:29.12	please, good fellow, remain passive, dwelling in blissful meditation in this life, for this is better left unsaid. Good fellow, do not instruct others.’	NA
mn49:30.1	When he had spoken, I said to Māra,	NA
mn49:30.2	‘I know you, Wicked One. Do not think,	NA
mn49:30.3	“He doesn’t know me.”	NA
mn49:30.4	You are Māra the Wicked.	NA
mn49:30.5	You don’t speak to me like this out of sympathy,	NA
mn49:30.6	but with no sympathy.	NA
mn49:30.7	For you think,	NA
mn49:30.8	“Those who the ascetic Gotama teaches will go beyond my reach.”	NA
mn49:30.9	Those who formerly claimed to be fully awakened Buddhas were not in fact fully awakened Buddhas.	NA
mn49:30.10	But I am.	NA
mn49:30.11	The Realized One remains as such whether or not he teaches disciples.	NA
mn49:30.12	The Realized One remains as such whether or not he presents the teaching to disciples.	NA
mn49:30.13	Why is that?	NA
mn49:30.14	Because the Realized One has given up the defilements that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.	NA
mn49:30.15	He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future.	NA
mn49:30.16	Just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth,	NA
mn49:30.17	the Realized One has given up the defilements that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.	NA
mn49:30.18	He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future.’”	NA
mn49:31.1	And so, because of the silencing of Māra, and because of the invitation of the Divinity, the name of this discussion is “On the Invitation of Divinity”.	There is no record of Baka’s conversion.
mn50:0.1	Middle Discourses 50	NA
mn50:0.2	The Condemnation of Māra	NA
mn50:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn50:1.2	At one time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.	This sutta serves as a showcase for Moggallāna, who is able to swiftly best Māra and recount a detailed story of past lives.
mn50:2.1	At that time Moggallāna was walking mindfully in the open air.	NA
mn50:2.2	Now at that time Māra the Wicked had got inside Moggallāna’s belly.	Māra is sometimes called Namuci, and in fact seems to descend from the Vedic adversary of that name. Vedic Namuci “the wicked” (_pāpmā vai namuciḥ_, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 12.7.3, Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 4.4.4) was a wily trickster (_māyin_, Rig Veda 1.53.7c) who was nonetheless outsmarted by Indra (Rig Veda 5.30.6c), and possessed ineffectual armies reliant on women (Rig Veda 5.30.9a). Buddhist Māra “the wicked” (_māro pāpimā_) was a wily trickster (*passim*) who was nonetheless outsmarted by the Buddha and his followers (*passim*); he possessed ineffectual armies ([dn20:21.3](), [an4.13:2.3](), [snp3.2]()), and sent his daughters to do his dirty work ([sn4.25]()). The decapitated head of Namuci introduced death (_mṛtyu_) in the form of blood to the deathless (_amṛta_) soma (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 12.7.3.4, Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 4.4.4), establishing his Pali names Maccurāja, “King of Death” and Māra, “Murderer”. He appears in a similar guise in Jainism too (Ācaraṅga 1.3.1.3).
mn50:2.3	Moggallāna thought,	NA
mn50:2.4	“Why now is my belly so very heavy,	NA
mn50:2.5	like I’ve just eaten a load of beans?”	T 66 has <span lang='lzh'>猶若食豆</span>, MA 131 <span lang='lzh'>猶如食豆</span>, both of which confirm the sense “full of beans”. T 67 on the other hand has <span lang='lzh'>飢人而負重擔</span>, “like a hungry man bearing a heavy load.”
mn50:2.6	Then he stepped down from the walking path, entered his dwelling, sat down on the seat spread out,	NA
mn50:3.1	and investigated inside himself.	NA
mn50:3.2	He saw that Māra the Wicked had got inside his belly.	NA
mn50:3.3	So he said to Māra,	NA
mn50:3.4	“Come out, Wicked One,	NA
mn50:3.5	come out!	NA
mn50:3.6	Do not harass the Realized One or his disciple.	NA
mn50:3.7	Don’t create lasting harm and suffering for yourself!”	NA
mn50:4.1	Then Māra thought,	NA
mn50:4.2	“This ascetic doesn’t really know me or see me when he tells me to come out.	NA
mn50:4.3	NA	NA
mn50:4.4	NA	NA
mn50:4.5	NA	NA
mn50:4.6	NA	NA
mn50:4.7	Not even the Teacher could recognize me so quickly, so how could a disciple?”	NA
mn50:5.1	Then Moggallāna said to Māra,	NA
mn50:5.2	“I know you even when you’re like this, Wicked One. Do not think,	NA
mn50:5.3	‘He doesn’t know me.’	NA
mn50:5.4	You are Māra the Wicked.	NA
mn50:5.5	And you think,	NA
mn50:5.6	‘This ascetic doesn’t really know me or see me when he tells me to come out.	NA
mn50:5.7	NA	NA
mn50:5.8	NA	NA
mn50:5.9	NA	NA
mn50:5.10	NA	NA
mn50:5.11	Not even the Teacher could recognize me so quickly, so how could a disciple?’”	NA
mn50:6.1	Then Māra thought,	NA
mn50:6.2	“This ascetic really does know me and see me when he tells me to come out.”	NA
mn50:6.3	NA	NA
mn50:6.4	NA	NA
mn50:6.5	NA	NA
mn50:6.6	NA	NA
mn50:6.7	Then Māra came up out of Moggallāna’s mouth and stood against the door.	NA
mn50:7.1	Moggallāna saw him there	NA
mn50:7.2	and said,	NA
mn50:7.3	“I see you even there, Wicked One. Do not think,	NA
mn50:7.4	‘He doesn’t see me.’	NA
mn50:7.5	That’s you, Wicked One, standing against the door.	NA
mn50:8.1	Once upon a time, Wicked One, I was a Māra named Dūsī, and I had a sister named Kāḷī.	Dūsī the “corrupter” and Kāḷī the “dark lady”, an early mention of a goddess of that name. | This story is also told at [thag20.1:48.1]().
mn50:8.2	You were her son,	NA
mn50:8.3	which made you my nephew.	NA
mn50:9.1	At that time Kakusandha, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world.	Kakusandha is mentioned also at [sn12.7:1.1](), [sn15.20:2.8](), [dn14:1.4.4](), [dn32:3.8](), and [thag7.5:4.4]().
mn50:9.2	Kakusandha had a fine pair of chief disciples named Vidhura and Sañjīva.	NA
mn50:9.3	Of all the disciples of the Buddha Kakusandha,	NA
mn50:9.4	none were the equal of Venerable Vidhura in teaching Dhamma.	NA
mn50:9.5	And that’s how he came to be known as Vidhura.	At [an3.20:2.1](), _vidhura_ is the cleverness of a shopkeeper in trade, illustrating the “indefatigable” mendicant in striving.
mn50:10.1	But when Venerable Sañjīva had gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, he easily attained the cessation of perception and feeling.	NA
mn50:10.2	Once upon a time, Sañjīva was sitting at the root of a certain tree having attained the cessation of perception and feeling.	NA
mn50:10.3	Some cowherds, shepherds, farmers, and passers-by saw him sitting there	NA
mn50:10.4	and said,	NA
mn50:10.5	‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!	NA
mn50:10.6	This ascetic passed away while seated.	NA
mn50:10.7	We should cremate him.’	NA
mn50:10.8	They collected grass, wood, and cow-dung, heaped it all on Sañjīva’s body, set it on fire, and left.	NA
mn50:11.1	Then, when the night had passed, Sañjīva emerged from that attainment, shook out his robes, and, since it was morning, he robed up and entered the village for alms.	NA
mn50:11.2	Those cowherds, shepherds, farmers, and passers-by saw him wandering for alms	NA
mn50:11.3	and said,	NA
mn50:11.4	‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!	NA
mn50:11.5	This ascetic passed away while seated, and now he has come back to life!’	NA
mn50:11.6	And that’s how he came to be known as Sañjīva.	_Sañjīva_ means “survivor”.
mn50:12.1	Then it occurred to Māra Dūsī,	NA
mn50:12.2	‘I don’t know the course of rebirth of these ethical mendicants of good character.	The idiom _āgatiṁ vā gatiṁ vā_, literally “comings and goings”, refers to the “course of rebirth”.
mn50:12.3	Why don’t I take possession of these brahmins and householders and say,	NA
mn50:12.4	“Come, all of you, abuse, attack, harass, and trouble the ethical mendicants of good character.	Māra urges and encourages, but does not control their behavior, so they are still responsible for their deeds.
mn50:12.5	Hopefully by doing this we can upset their minds so that Māra Dūsī can find a vulnerability.”’	NA
mn50:12.6	And that’s exactly what he did.	NA
mn50:12.7	NA	NA
mn50:12.8	NA	NA
mn50:13.1	Then those brahmins and householders abused, attacked, harassed, and troubled the ethical mendicants of good character:	NA
mn50:13.2	‘These shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman, say, “We practice absorption meditation! We practice absorption meditation!” Shoulders drooping, downcast, and dopey, they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate.	The phrase “meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate” (_jhāyanti pajjhāyanti nijjhāyanti apajjhāyanti_) uses a series of verbs from the same root as _jhāna_ with different prefixes to satirical effect. See also [an6.46:2.2](), [an11.9:2.10](), and [mn108:26.4]().
mn50:13.3	They’re just like an owl on a branch, which meditates and concentrates and contemplates and ruminates as it hunts a mouse.	NA
mn50:13.4	NA	NA

mn50:13.9	They’re just like an unladen donkey by an alley or a drain or a dustbin, which meditates and concentrates and contemplates and ruminates.	NA

mn50:13.11	Most of the people who died at that time—when their body broke up, after death—were reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	NA
mn50:14.1	Then Kakusandha the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, addressed the mendicants:	NA
mn50:14.2	‘Mendicants, the brahmins and householders have been possessed by Māra Dūsī.	NA
mn50:14.3	He told them to abuse you in the hope of upsetting your minds so that he can find a vulnerability.	NA
mn50:14.4	Come, all of you mendicants, meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	These meditations counteract the tendency to anger.
mn50:14.5	Meditate spreading a heart full of compassion …	NA
mn50:14.6	Meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing …	NA

mn50:15.1	When those mendicants were instructed and advised by the Buddha Kakusandha in this way, they went to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, where they meditated spreading a heart full of love …	NA
mn50:15.2	compassion …	NA
mn50:15.3	rejoicing …	NA

mn50:16.3	“Come, all of you, honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the ethical mendicants of good character.	NA
mn50:16.4	Hopefully by doing this we can upset their minds so that Māra Dūsī can find a vulnerability.”’	Māra did not want to genuinely respect the mendicants, but to corrupt them with adulation.
mn50:17.1	And that’s exactly what he did.	NA
mn50:17.2	NA	NA
mn50:17.3	NA	NA
mn50:17.4	Then those brahmins and householders honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated the ethical mendicants of good character.	NA
mn50:17.5	Most of the people who died at that time—when their body broke up, after death—were reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	NA
mn50:18.1	Then Kakusandha the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, addressed the mendicants:	NA
mn50:18.2	‘Mendicants, the brahmins and householders have been possessed by Māra Dūsī.	NA
mn50:18.3	He told them to venerate you	NA
mn50:18.4	in the hope of upsetting your minds so that he can find a vulnerability.	NA
mn50:18.5	Come, all you mendicants, meditate observing the ugliness of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness of food, perceiving dissatisfaction with the whole world, and observing the impermanence of all conditions.’	These meditations counteract attachment.
mn50:19.1	When those mendicants were instructed and advised by the Buddha Kakusandha in this way, they went to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, where they meditated observing the ugliness of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness of food, perceiving dissatisfaction with the whole world, and observing the impermanence of all conditions.	NA
mn50:20.1	Then the Buddha Kakusandha robed up in the morning and, taking this bowl and robe, entered the village for alms with Venerable Vidhura as his second monk.	NA
mn50:21.1	Then Māra Dūsī took possession of a certain boy, picked up a rock, and hit Vidhura on the head, cracking it open.	NA
mn50:21.2	Then Vidhura, with blood pouring from his cracked skull, still followed behind the Buddha Kakusandha.	_Yeva_ (“still”) has an adversative sense here (see [an3.82:1.4]()).
mn50:21.3	Then the Buddha Kakusandha turned to gaze back, the way that elephants do, saying,	_Nāgāpalokitaṁ_, the “elephant look”, was famously employed by the Buddha as he made his final departure from Vesālī ([dn16:4.1.2]()). There is a similar Sanskrit term _siṁhāvalokana_, the “lion look”, said to be the slow glance back that a lion makes as he leaves his kill.
mn50:21.4	‘This Māra Dūsī knows no bounds.’	NA
mn50:21.5	And as he was gazing, Māra Dūsī fell from that place and was reborn in the Great Hell.	The Pali _sahāpalokanāya_ makes it clear that Māra fell to hell while the Buddha was looking, not because he looked. | More details on hell are provided in [mn129]() and [mn130]().
mn50:22.1	Now that Great Hell is known by three names:	NA
mn50:22.2	‘Related to the Six Fields of Contact’ and also ‘The Impaling With Spikes’ and also ‘Individually Painful’.	The sense of _paccattavedaniya_ (“Individually Painful”) is clarified in the verses ([mn50:24.6]()).
mn50:22.3	Then the wardens of hell came to me and said,	NA
mn50:22.4	‘When spike meets spike in your heart,	NA
mn50:22.5	you will know that	NA
mn50:22.6	you’ve been roasting in hell for a thousand years.’	NA
mn50:23.1	I roasted for many years, many centuries, many millennia in that Great Hell.	NA
mn50:23.2	For ten thousand years I roasted in the annex of that Great Hell, experiencing the pain called ‘this is emergence’.	I think _vuṭṭhānimaṁ_ (“this is emergence”) simply means the feeling that is experienced on “emergence” from the Great Hell to the annex. The commentary, however, says it means the “feeling that emerges as a result of kamma”.

mn51:0.2	With Kandaraka	NA
mn51:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn51:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	Campā is modern Champapur near Bhagalpur in Bihar state, not far from West Bengal. It is near the eastern-most reach of the Buddha’s journeys. Campā was the capital of Aṅga, one of the sixteen “great nations” (_mahājanapadā_). It was a flourishing trade center, and became a sacred city for the Jains. | _Gaggarā_, an onomatopoeic reduplication (“gargle”), is the name of a number of rivers and whirlpools in Sanskrit (cp. the modern Ghaggar River in north-west India).
mn51:1.3	Then Pessa the elephant driver’s son and Kandaraka the wanderer went to see the Buddha. When they had approached, Pessa bowed and sat down to one side.	Neither of these appear elsewhere.
mn51:1.4	But the wanderer Kandaraka exchanged greetings with the Buddha and stood to one side.	NA
mn51:1.5	He looked around the mendicant Saṅgha, who were so very silent, and said to the Buddha:	NA
mn51:2.1	“It’s incredible, worthy Gotama, it’s amazing!	NA
mn51:2.2	How the mendicant Saṅgha has been led to practice properly by the worthy Gotama!	NA
mn51:2.3	All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas in the past or the future who lead the mendicant Saṅgha to practice properly will at best do so	NA
mn51:2.4	like the worthy Gotama does in the present.”	Kandaraka’s status as a (non-Buddhist) wanderer does not preclude his faith in the Buddha.
mn51:2.5	NA	NA
mn51:2.6	NA	NA
mn51:3.1	“That’s so true, Kandaraka! That’s so true!	We do not hear anything about Kandaraka after this exchange.
mn51:3.2	All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas in the past or the future who lead the mendicant Saṅgha to practice properly will at best do so	NA
mn51:3.3	like I do in the present.	NA
mn51:3.4	NA	NA
mn51:3.5	NA	NA
mn51:3.6	For in this mendicant Saṅgha there are perfected mendicants, who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and are rightly freed through enlightenment.	NA
mn51:3.7	And in this mendicant Saṅgha there are trainee mendicants who are consistently ethical, living consistently, alert, living alertly.	NA
mn51:3.8	They meditate with their minds firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.	NA
mn51:3.9	What four?	NA
mn51:3.10	It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
mn51:3.11	They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
mn51:3.12	They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
mn51:3.13	They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.”	NA
mn51:4.1	When he had spoken, Pessa said to the Buddha:	NA
mn51:4.2	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	NA
mn51:4.3	How well described by the Buddha are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation! They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment.	_Yāva supaññatta_ is also at [dn18:22.3](); it is a variation of the standard _yāva subhāsita_.
mn51:4.4	For we white-clothed laypeople also from time to time meditate with our minds well established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.	The Buddha sometimes taught devotional meditations such as the six recollections for lay people, but passages such as this show there was no fundamental difference between lay and monastic meditations.
mn51:4.5	We meditate observing an aspect of the body …	NA
mn51:4.6	feelings …	NA
mn51:4.7	mind …	NA
mn51:4.8	principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
mn51:4.9	It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	NA
mn51:4.10	How the Buddha knows what’s best for sentient beings, even though humans continue to be so shady, rotten, and tricky.	NA
mn51:4.11	For human beings are shady, sir,	NA
mn51:4.12	while beasts are obvious.	NA
mn51:4.13	For I can drive an elephant in training,	NA
mn51:4.14	and while going back and forth in Campā it’ll try all the tricks, bluffs, ruses, and feints that it can.	NA
mn51:4.15	But my bondservants, servants, and workers behave one way by body, another by speech, and their minds another.	NA
mn51:4.16	It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	NA
mn51:4.17	How the Buddha knows what’s best for sentient beings, even though humans continue to be so shady, rotten, and tricky.	NA
mn51:4.18	For human beings are shady, sir,	NA
mn51:4.19	while beasts are obvious.”	NA
mn51:5.1	“That’s so true, Pessa! That’s so true!	NA
mn51:5.2	For human beings are shady,	NA
mn51:5.3	while beasts are obvious.	NA
mn51:5.4	Pessa, these four people are found in the world.	NA
mn51:5.5	What four?	NA
mn51:5.6	One person mortifies themselves, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves.	“Mortifies themselves” is _attantapo_.
mn51:5.7	One person mortifies others, committed to the practice of mortifying others.	NA
mn51:5.8	One person mortifies themselves and others, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others.	NA
mn51:5.9	One person doesn’t mortify either themselves or others, committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or others.	NA
mn51:5.10	They live without wishes in this very life, quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine.	“With self become divine” (_brahmabhūtena attanā_) deliberately echoes Upaniṣadic language. Pali is sometimes said to lack reference to the cosmic Brahman (in neuter), having only the personal Brahmā (in masculine). The grammatical case of _brahma-_ in the compound here is undetermined, yet no scholar of Sanskrit would hesitate to interpret the common phrase _brahmabhūtātmā_ in the sense “self become one with the cosmic divinity Brahman”. Surely the Pali draws from the same sense, using it to describe Nibbāna.
mn51:5.11	Which one of these four people do you like the sound of?”	NA
mn51:5.12	“Sir, I don’t like the sound of the first three people.	NA
mn51:5.13	NA	NA
mn51:5.14	NA	NA
mn51:5.15	NA	NA
mn51:5.16	I only like the sound of the last person, who doesn’t mortify either themselves or others.”	NA
mn51:6.1	“But why don’t you like the sound of those three people?”	NA
mn51:6.2	“Sir, the person who mortifies themselves does so even though they want to be happy and recoil from pain.	NA
mn51:6.3	That’s why I don’t like the sound of that person.	NA
mn51:6.4	The person who mortifies others does so even though others want to be happy and recoil from pain.	NA
mn51:6.5	That’s why I don’t like the sound of that person.	NA
mn51:6.6	The person who mortifies themselves and others does so even though both themselves and others want to be happy and recoil from pain.	NA
mn51:6.7	That’s why I don’t like the sound of that person.	NA
mn51:6.8	The person who doesn’t mortify either themselves or others—living without wishes, quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine—does not torment themselves or others, both of whom want to be happy and recoil from pain.	NA
mn51:6.9	NA	NA
mn51:6.10	That’s why I like the sound of that person.	NA
mn51:6.11	Well, now, sir, I must go.	NA
mn51:6.12	I have many duties, and much to do.”	NA
mn51:6.13	“Please, Pessa, go at your convenience.”	NA
mn51:6.14	And then Pessa the elephant driver’s son approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	Presumably Kandaraka left too. This sutta has an odd structure, as the bulk of the teaching occurs after the protagonists leave. This has the ring of a genuinely random encounter.
mn51:7.1	Then, not long after he had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:	NA
mn51:7.2	“Mendicants, Pessa the elephant driver’s son is astute.	NA
mn51:7.3	He has great wisdom.	NA
mn51:7.4	If he had sat here an hour so that I could have analyzed these four people in detail, he would have greatly benefited.	NA
mn51:7.5	Still, even with this much he has already greatly benefited.”	NA
mn51:7.6	“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!	NA
mn51:7.7	May the Buddha analyze these four people in detail. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	NA
mn51:7.8	“Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn51:7.9	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
mn51:7.10	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn51:8.1	“And what person mortifies themselves, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves? It’s when a person goes naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared for them, or an invitation for a meal.	For these practices, which were pursued by the Buddha before his awakening, see notes at [mn12:45.1]().
mn51:8.2	They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who lives with a man; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or beer or wine, and drink no fermented gruel.	NA
mn51:8.3	They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls.	NA
mn51:8.4	They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day.	NA
mn51:8.5	They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals.	NA
mn51:8.6	They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.	NA
mn51:8.7	They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings.	NA
mn51:8.8	They tear out their hair and beard, committed to this practice.	NA
mn51:8.9	They constantly stand, refusing seats.	NA
mn51:8.10	They squat, committed to the endeavor of squatting.	NA
mn51:8.11	They lie on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns their bed.	NA
mn51:8.12	They’re devoted to ritual bathing three times a day, including the evening.	NA
mn51:8.13	And so they live committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body.	NA
mn51:8.14	This is called a person who mortifies themselves, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves.	NA
mn51:9.1	And what person mortifies others, committed to the practice of mortifying others?	NA
mn51:9.2	It’s when a person is a slaughterer of sheep, pigs, or poultry, a hunter or trapper, a fisher, a bandit, an executioner, a butcher, a jailer, or someone with some other kind of cruel livelihood.	NA
mn51:9.3	This is called a person who mortifies others, being committed to the practice of mortifying others.	NA
mn51:10.1	And what person mortifies themselves and others, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others?	NA
mn51:10.2	It’s when a person is an anointed aristocratic king or a well-to-do brahmin.	The same vivid description of ritual is found at [mn94:12.2]() and [an4.198:6.2](). | The passage features many details close to the sacrifice as described in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, especially chapter 3, to which I refer below. Of course the attitude is the exact opposite.
mn51:10.3	He has a new ceremonial hall built to the east of the citadel. He shaves off his hair and beard, dresses in a rough antelope hide, and smears his body with ghee and oil. Scratching his back with antlers, he enters the hall with his chief queen and the brahmin high priest.	_Santhāgāra_ is normally a hall to gather for business, a “town hall”. Here, however, the term draws on the idiom _yajñasya saṁsthā_, (“completion/establishment of the sacrifice”), which is so common the term “sacrifice” may be left out as implied (eg. 13.2.4.2). Thus it is “a building for completing the sacrifice” (commentary: _yaññasāla_). | The hall for sacrifice, referred to simply as _śālā_ (3.1.1), is oriented to the east, for “the east is the quarter of the gods” (3.1.1.6). | Shaving hair and beard before the sacrifice is described in detail (3.1.2). | The anointing is with _navanīta_ (“fresh butter”, 3.1.3.7 ff.). | The sacrificer wears clean linen (3.1.2.13), but sits on antelope hide (3.2.1.1), scratching himself with the horn (3.2.1.31). | The wife’s fertility cleanses and heals (3.5.3.13, 3.8.2).
mn51:10.4	There he lies on the bare ground strewn with grass.	He lies down to sleep in the evening (3.2.2.22). | The spreading of grass is a regular feature of Vedic ritual (eg. 3.6.3.14).
mn51:10.5	The king feeds on the milk from one teat of a cow that has a calf of the same color. The chief queen feeds on the milk from the second teat. The brahmin high priest feeds on the milk from the third teat. The milk from the fourth teat is served to the sacred flame. The calf feeds on the remainder.	After shaving, the sacrificer consumes milk only (3.1.2.1), breaking his fast with milk cooked with rice or barley (3.2.2.10, 14). | Milk is drawn from specific teats (3.4.4.26, 9.5.1; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.8.1). | Milk is cooked from a white cow with white calf (5.3.2.1), or in another rite from a black cow with white calf (9.2.3.30).
mn51:10.6	He says:	NA
mn51:10.7	‘Slaughter this many bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, rams, and horses for the sacrifice! Fell this many trees and reap this much grass for the sacrificial equipment!’	The slaughter of animal victims is described in detail (3.7.3). | The sacrificer ought not use the worldly term “slaughter” (Pali _haññantu_ = Sanskrit _jahi_), rather “make them agree”, “persuade” (_saṁjñapaya_, 3.8.1.15) so they look forward to being sacrificed (3.7.3.4). | Trees are felled to make the stake (_yūpa_) to which the animals are tied, while grass (_darbha_) is strewn on the altar (3.6.4).
mn51:10.8	His bondservants, servants, and workers do their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping with tearful faces.	NA
mn51:10.9	This is called a person who mortifies themselves and others, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others.	NA
mn51:11.1	And what person doesn’t mortify either themselves or others, but lives without wishes, quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine?	NA
mn51:12.1	It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.	NA
mn51:12.2	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	NA
mn51:12.3	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
mn51:13.1	A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in a good family.	NA
mn51:13.2	They gain faith in the Realized One	NA
mn51:13.3	and reflect:	NA
mn51:13.4	‘Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide open.	NA
mn51:13.5	It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	NA
mn51:13.6	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	NA
mn51:13.7	After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn51:14.1	Once they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings.	NA
mn51:14.2	They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving.	NA
mn51:14.3	They give up unchastity. They are chaste, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex.	NA
mn51:14.4	They give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and dependable, and don’t trick the world with their words.	NA
mn51:14.5	They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.	NA
mn51:14.6	They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people.	NA
mn51:14.7	They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.	NA

mn51:15.1	They’re content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.	NA
mn51:15.2	They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden.	NA
mn51:15.3	In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.	NA
mn51:15.4	When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves.	NA
mn51:16.1	When they see a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.	NA
mn51:16.2	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.	NA

mn51:18.1	When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, this noble contentment, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness,	NA

mn51:20.1	They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.	NA
mn51:20.2	Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA

mn51:24.2	They recollect many kinds of past lives, that is, one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food.

They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind.

mn52:0.1	Middle Discourses 52	NA
mn52:0.2	The Wealthy Citizen	NA
mn52:1.1	So I have heard.	This discourse is repeated at [an11.16]().
mn52:1.2	At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva.	The Buddha spent his last rains retreat here ([sn47.9:1.5](), [dn16:2.22.3]()). The fact that the Buddha is not mentioned and the setting at Pāṭaliputta suggest that he had already passed away.
mn52:1.3	Now at that time the householder Dasama, a wealthy citizen, had arrived at Pāṭaliputta on some business.	_Dasama_ means “tenth”, explained by the commentary as meaning he was tenth in line in his family. | _Aṭṭhakanāgara_ is usually taken to be the name of a city, but neither the city nor the possessive form _nāgara_ appear elsewhere. Since all we know of him is that he was very rich; since the Pali is in the habit of naming people after their prominent quality; and since we find elsewhere a man named after his wealth (Dhaniya at [snp1.2]()), perhaps we should take _aṭṭhaka_ from _artha_ in the sense of “wealthy”, which agrees with the later Sanskrit sense of _nāgara_ as “prominent citizen”.
mn52:2.1	He went to the Chicken Monastery, approached a certain mendicant, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	With the rise of Pāṭaliputta, this became an important monastery after the Buddha’s passing. Malalasekera (*Dictionary of Pali Proper Names*) suggests it was the same monastery later renowned as Aśokārāma. Ānanda stayed there often ([sn45.18]()–20, [sn47.21]()–3), which explains why Dasama expected to find him there.
mn52:2.2	“Sir, where is Venerable Ānanda now staying?	NA
mn52:2.3	For I want to see him.”	NA
mn52:2.4	“Householder, Venerable Ānanda is staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva.”	NA
mn52:3.1	Then the householder Dasama, having concluded his business there, went to the little village of Beluva in Vesālī to see Ānanda. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to Ānanda:	Beluva was immediately north of Vesālī, so about a day’s walk from Pāṭaliputta. But Dasama could doubtless afford a carriage.
mn52:3.2	“Honorable Ānanda, is there one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary from the yoke?”	A number of “one things” are taught throughout the suttas. It seems Dasama wanted a simple summary, but Ānanda wished to challenge him.
mn52:3.3	“There is, householder.”	NA
mn52:3.4	“And what is that one thing?”	NA
mn52:4.1	“Householder, it’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn52:4.2	Then they reflect:	NA
mn52:4.3	‘Even this first absorption is produced by choices and intentions.’	This illustrates the development of insight based on absorption. After emerging from the attainment, the meditator reflects on the nature of that experience, realizing that even the most blissful and peaceful of states is still “chosen and intended” (_abhisaṅkhataṁ abhisañcetayitaṁ_), i.e. constructed by volition.
mn52:4.4	They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’	NA
mn52:4.5	Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.	Insight must persist to bear fruit.
mn52:4.6	If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.	“Passion and love for that meditation” (_teneva dhammarāgena tāya dhammanandiyā_); here _dhamma_ means the state of meditation, i.e. the jhāna. This is the “higher fetter” of _rūparāga_, the desire for birth in the Brahmā realms of luminous form.
mn52:4.7	This is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.	NA

mn52:14.7	This too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.”	Ānanda omits the final formless attainment, neither perception nor non-perception, which is not regarded as a basis for insight due to its extreme subtlety. See too [mn64:15.5]().
mn52:15.1	When he said this, the householder Dasama said to Venerable Ānanda,	NA
mn52:15.2	“Honorable Ānanda, suppose a person was looking for an entrance to a hidden treasure. And all at once they’d come across eleven entrances!	NA
mn52:15.3	In the same way, I was searching for the door to freedom from death. And all at once I found eleven doors to freedom from death for cultivation.	“For cultivation”: variants include _bhāvanāya_, _savanāya_, and _sevanāya_. The center point of these is _sevanāya_, which is a synonym of _bhāvanāya_ and near-homonym of _savanāya_. Also, the sense of _savanāya_ should be “for hearing”, but he has already heard them, so they are now “for cultivation”.
mn52:15.4	Suppose a person had a house with eleven doors. If the house caught fire they’d be able to flee to safety through any one of those doors.	NA
mn52:15.5	In the same way, I’m able to flee to safety through any one of these eleven doors to freedom from death.	Kaṭha Upaniṣad 2.2.1 speaks of “a city with eleven doors of the unborn”. Śaṅkara identifies these as the apertures of the body: eyes, ears, nostrils, mouth, navel, genitals, anus, and the spiritual opening at the crown of the head.
mn52:15.6	Sir, those of other religions seek a fee for the tutor. Why shouldn’t I make an offering to Venerable Ānanda?”	“Fee for the teacher”: _ācariyadhana_. | “Other religions” is in reference to the Brahmanical _dakṣiṇā_.
mn52:16.1	Then the householder Dasama, having assembled the Saṅgha from Vesālī and Pāṭaliputta, served and satisfied them with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	NA
mn52:16.2	He clothed each and every mendicant in a pair of garments, with a set of three robes for Ānanda. And he had a dwelling worth five hundred built for Ānanda.	This lavish demonstration of Dasama’s wealth is an early indication of the largess enjoyed by the Sangha in Pāṭaliputta. Over a century later, under Ashoka, so many corrupt individuals entered the Sangha seeking profits that a Council had to be held to expel them.

mn53:0.2	A Trainee	NA
mn53:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn53:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.	NA
mn53:2.1	Now at that time a new town hall had recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all.	The completion of a town hall was celebrated by a talk for the Sakyans at [sn35.243:1.2]() and the Mallas at [dn33:1.2.1](). Such halls were community meeting places that played a central role in civic society and communal decision-making in democratic republics such as the Mallas and the Sakyans. The Buddha’s participation is a sign of his support for their civic and democratic process.
mn53:2.2	Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	NA
mn53:2.3	“Sir, a new town hall has recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all.	NA
mn53:2.4	May the Buddha be the first to use it, and only then will the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu use it.	NA
mn53:2.5	That would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu.”	NA
mn53:3.1	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
mn53:3.2	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, the Sakyans got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the new town hall, where they spread carpets all over, prepared seats, set up a water jar, and placed an oil lamp. Then they went back to the Buddha,	NA
mn53:3.3	bowed, stood to one side,	NA
mn53:3.4	and told him of their preparations, saying,	NA
mn53:3.5	NA	NA
mn53:3.6	“Please, sir, come at your convenience.”	NA
mn53:4.1	Then the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Having washed his feet he entered the town hall and sat against the central column facing east.	NA
mn53:4.2	The Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them.	NA
mn53:4.3	The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Buddha right in front of them.	NA
mn53:5.1	The Buddha spent much of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the Sakyans with a Dhamma talk. Then he addressed Venerable Ānanda,	NA
mn53:5.2	“Ānanda, speak about the practicing trainee to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu as you feel inspired.	NA
mn53:5.3	My back is sore,	NA
mn53:5.4	I’ll stretch it.”	NA
mn53:5.5	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
mn53:5.6	And then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.	NA
mn53:6.1	Then Ānanda addressed Mahānāma the Sakyan:	By convention, speech is addressed to the most senior member of the group.
mn53:6.2	“Mahānāma, a noble disciple is accomplished in ethics, guards the sense doors, eats in moderation, and is dedicated to wakefulness. They have seven good qualities, and they get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in this life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.	This is a version of the Gradual Training. It is generally oriented towards monastics, as the Gradual Training usually is, but the inclusion of the “seven good qualities” appears to be a nod towards adapting it for a lay audience.
mn53:7.1	And how is a noble disciple accomplished in ethics?	NA
mn53:7.2	It’s when a noble disciple is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.	NA
mn53:7.3	That’s how a noble disciple is ethical.	NA
mn53:8.1	And how does a noble disciple guard the sense doors?	NA
mn53:8.2	When a noble disciple sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.	NA
mn53:8.3	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.	NA

mn53:8.9	If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint.	NA
mn53:8.10	That’s how a noble disciple guards the sense doors.	NA
mn53:9.1	And how does a noble disciple eat in moderation?	NA
mn53:9.2	It’s when a noble disciple reflects rationally on the food that they eat:	NA
mn53:9.3	‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will have the means to keep going, blamelessness, and a comfortable abiding.’	NA
mn53:9.4	That’s how a noble disciple eats in moderation.	NA
mn53:10.1	And how is a noble disciple dedicated to wakefulness?	NA
mn53:10.2	It’s when a noble disciple practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind from obstacles.	NA
mn53:10.3	In the first watch of the night, they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation.	NA
mn53:10.4	In the middle watch, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.	NA
mn53:10.5	In the last watch, they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying their mind from obstacles.	NA
mn53:10.6	That’s how a noble disciple is dedicated to wakefulness.	NA
mn53:11.1	And how does a noble disciple have seven good qualities?	These are illustrated with a simile of a citadel at [an7.67](). They partly overlap with other factors of the Gradual Training; but then, these things are not meant to be exclusive.
mn53:11.2	It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:	NA
mn53:11.3	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
mn53:12.1	They have a conscience. They’re conscientious about bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and conscientious about having any bad, unskillful qualities.	NA
mn53:13.1	They exercise prudence. They’re prudent when it comes to bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and prudent when it comes to acquiring any bad, unskillful qualities.	NA
mn53:14.1	They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, rehearsing them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.	NA
mn53:15.1	They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.	NA
mn53:16.1	They’re mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago.	The pre-Buddhist sense of _sati_ is “memory”, while “mindfulness” evolved from the practice of “remembering” scripture, creating an uninterrupted flow state in the present. In this sense, mindfulness can be understood as the element of continuity that knits consciousness together in a coherent stream. Thus when practicing “mindfulness of breathing” one pays continuous attention to the breaths, not “forgetting” what one is doing.
mn53:17.1	They’re wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.	NA
mn53:17.2	That’s how a noble disciple has seven good qualities.	NA

mn53:23.3	moderation in eating,	NA
mn53:23.4	being dedicated to wakefulness,	NA
mn53:23.5	having seven good qualities,	NA
mn53:23.6	and getting the four absorptions when they want, without trouble or difficulty.	NA
mn53:24.1	A noble disciple’s knowledge includes the following: recollecting their past lives,	NA
mn53:24.2	clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman,	NA
mn53:24.3	and realizing the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life due to the ending of defilements.	NA
mn53:25.1	This noble disciple is said to be ‘accomplished in knowledge’, and also ‘accomplished in conduct’, and also ‘accomplished in knowledge and conduct’.	NA
mn53:25.2	And the divinity Sanaṅkumāra also spoke this verse:	Sanaṅkumāra (“Everyoung”) became a Hindu deity closely associated with the worship of Krishna. He first appears in the seventh chapter of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. The occasion he spoke this verse is recorded at [sn6.11](), and it is repeated several times in the suttas, for example at [dn3:1.28.2](), where it has a better contextual justification.
mn53:25.3	‘The aristocrat is best among people	NA
mn53:25.4	who take clan as the standard.	NA
mn53:25.5	But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct	NA
mn53:25.6	is best among gods and humans.’	NA
mn53:25.7	And that verse was well sung by the Divinity Sanaṅkumāra, not poorly sung; well spoken, not poorly spoken, beneficial, not harmful, and it was approved by the Buddha.”	NA
mn53:26.1	Then the Buddha got up and said to Venerable Ānanda,	NA
mn53:26.2	“Good, good, Ānanda!	NA
mn53:26.3	It’s good that you spoke to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu about the practicing trainee.”	NA
mn53:26.4	This is what Venerable Ānanda said,	NA

mn53:26.6	Satisfied, the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu approved what Venerable Ānanda said.	NA
mn54:0.1	Middle Discourses 54	NA
mn54:0.2	With Potaliya the Householder	NA
mn54:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn54:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅguttarāpans, near the town of theirs named Āpaṇa.	Aṅga was the country to that controlled the Ganges to the east of both Magadha and Vesālī. The region of Aṅga north of both the Ganges and the Mahī was known as Aṅguttarāpa, “Aṅga North of the Water”. The market town of Āpaṇa was evidently the chief settlement of the region.
mn54:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Āpaṇa for alms.	NA
mn54:2.2	He wandered for alms in Āpaṇa. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to a certain forest grove for the day’s meditation.	NA
mn54:2.3	Having plunged deep into it, he sat at the root of a certain tree to meditate.	NA
mn54:3.1	Potaliya the householder also approached that forest grove while going for a walk. He was well dressed in sarong and cloak, with parasol and sandals. Having plunged deep into it, he went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	A wanderer called Potaliya appears at [an4.100](). | “Sarong” (_nivāsana_) is lay attire at [an3.39:1.4]() and monastic at [pli-tv-kd1:25.9.1](), while “cloak” (_pāvuraṇa_) is lay attire at [sn7.14:1.2]() and monastic at [pli-tv-bi-vb-np11]() and [pli-tv-bi-vb-np12](). These are evidently similar to the monastic _antaravāsaka_ and _saṅghāṭi_. | Parasols and sandals were considered inappropriate luxuries for monastics ([pli-tv-bi-vb-pc84](), [pli-tv-kd15:23.2.19](), [pli-tv-kd5:12.1.5]()), and it was considered disrespectful to teach someone thus attired ([pli-tv-bu-vb-sk57](), [pli-tv-bu-vb-sk62]()). There was, however, an exemption in all cases for health reasons, and monastics were allowed sandals outside of a village.
mn54:3.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side, and the Buddha said to him,	NA
mn54:3.3	“There are seats, householder. Please sit if you wish.”	NA
mn54:3.4	When he said this, Potaliya was angry and upset. Thinking, “The ascetic Gotama addresses me as ‘householder’!” he stayed silent.	NA
mn54:3.5	For a second time …	NA
mn54:3.6	and a third time the Buddha said to him,	NA
mn54:3.7	“There are seats, householder. Please sit if you wish.”	NA
mn54:3.8	When he said this, Potaliya was angry and upset. Thinking, “The ascetic Gotama addresses me as ‘householder’!” he said to the Buddha,	NA
mn54:3.9	“Worthy Gotama, it is neither proper nor appropriate for you to address me as ‘householder’.”	NA
mn54:3.10	“Well, householder, you have the features, attributes, and signs of a householder.”	Monastics were criticized as being “just like householders” for wearing sandals ([pli-tv-kd5:12.1.3]()) and sunshades ([pli-tv-kd15:23.2.8](), [pli-tv-bi-vb-pc8]()).
mn54:3.11	“Worthy Gotama, it’s because I have refused all work and cut off all business.”	NA
mn54:3.12	“Householder, in what way have you refused all work and cut off all business?”	NA
mn54:3.13	“Worthy Gotama, all the money, grain, gold, and silver I used to have has been handed over to my children as their inheritance. And in this matter I do not advise or reprimand them, but live with nothing more than food and clothes.	This explains the cutting off of “business” (_vohāra_) as not getting involved in the family money. | The word “reprimand” (_anupavādī_) is adapted from its worldly sense here to an ethical one below ([mn54:6.4]()).
mn54:3.14	That’s how I have refused all work and cut off all business.”	NA
mn54:3.15	“The cutting off of business as you describe it is one thing, householder, but the cutting off of business in the noble one’s training is quite different.”	NA
mn54:3.16	“But what, sir, is cutting off of business in the noble one’s training?	NA
mn54:3.17	Sir, please teach me this.”	NA
mn54:3.18	“Well then, householder, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	The Buddha appears to be breaking his own rule against teaching someone with sandals and parasol. The Chinese parallel avoids this awkward situation by saying that Potaliya had set aside his parasol and sandals (MA 203 at T i 773a29).
mn54:3.19	“Yes, sir,” said Potaliya.	NA
mn54:4.1	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn54:4.2	“Householder, these eight things lead to the cutting off of business in the noble one’s training.	While all these items are standard, this list of eight does not appear elsewhere. It must have been a personal teaching for Potaliya.
mn54:4.3	What eight?	NA
mn54:4.4	Killing living creatures should be given up, relying on not killing living creatures.	NA
mn54:4.5	Stealing should be given up, relying on not stealing.	NA

mn54:4.12	These are the eight things—stated in brief without being analyzed in detail—that lead to the cutting off of business in the noble one’s training.”	NA
mn54:5.1	“Sir, please teach me these eight things in detail out of sympathy.”	NA

mn54:6.3	‘I am practicing to give up and cut off the fetters that might cause me to kill living creatures.	NA

mn54:15.0	1. The Dangers of Sensual Pleasures	NA
mn54:15.1	“Householder, suppose a dog weak with hunger was hanging around a butcher’s shop.	This list of similes is also found at [mn22:3.8](), [an5.76:11.2](), and [thig16.1:41.1](), as well as in various parallels to these texts. There, the list is expanded from seven to ten (with minor variations in parallels), and it is quoted as a familiar teaching without any need for explanation. Several of the similes require explanation to make sense; for example “fruit on a tree”, by itself, hardly evokes suffering. Note too that the explanation below at [mn54:20.2]() mentions the town of Āpaṇa where the discourse is set. These considerations suggest that the list of similes, together with their explanations, first appeared here.
mn54:15.2	A deft butcher or their apprentice would toss them a skeleton scraped clean of flesh and smeared in blood.	NA

mn54:15.9	“In the same way, a noble disciple reflects:	NA

In similar passages ([sn19.1:3.2](), [sn55.21:2.4](), [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.3.2]()) we find “crow” (_kāka_) rather than text’s “heron” (_kaṅka_). The Chinese parallel at MA 203 does indeed have <span lang='lzh'>烏</span> (“crow”). Given the behavior described here, I think it’s likely the original was, in fact, crow.
mn54:16.2	Other vultures, crows, and hawks would keep chasing it, pecking and clawing.	The verbs here are uncertain and readings vary considerably. Compare Rig Veda 6.46.14 where horse-racers compete “like birds over raw flesh”.

mn55:0.1	Middle Discourses 55	NA
mn55:0.2	With Jīvaka	NA
mn55:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn55:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Mango Grove of Jīvaka Komārabhacca.	Jīvaka was the Buddha’s doctor. His story is told in [pli-tv-kd8](), where we learn that he was abandoned on a trash heap by his mother Sālavatī, only to be discovered and raised by Prince Abhaya of Magadha, a Jain [mn58](). He was called “Survivior” (_jīvaka_) and “Raised by a Prince” (_komārabhacca_). In later Ayurveda, _kaumārabhṛtya_ means “paediatrics”, and a lost treatise on that subject is attributed to Jīvaka (Jīvakatantra).
mn55:2.1	Then Jīvaka went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:	NA
mn55:3.1	“Sir, I have heard this:	NA
mn55:3.2	‘They slaughter living creatures specially for the ascetic Gotama. The ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared on his behalf: this is a deed he caused.’	This was an accusation made against the Buddha by Jains ([an8.12:31.2](), [pli-tv-kd6:31.13.1]()). They objected only to eating meat “killed on purpose for him”, and so by implication not all eating of meat. This is consistent with several Jain scriptural passages indicating that ascetics may, under certain strictures, eat meat (Ācaraṅgasūtra 2.1.10.5–6, Bhagavatīsūtra 557 (p. 1261a), Kalpasūtra (Sāmācārī 17), Dasaveyāliyasutta 5–1.73).
mn55:3.3	I trust that those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and do not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?”	NA
mn55:4.1	“Jīvaka, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false and untrue.	NA
mn55:5.1	In three cases I say that meat may not be eaten:	NA
mn55:5.2	it’s seen, heard, or suspected.	The relevant Vinaya rule makes the meaning clear: “When you know it was killed on purpose for you” ([pli-tv-kd6:31.14.4]()). To allay suspicion of improper meat, mendicants are also required to check the provenance of meat before eating ([pli-tv-kd6:23.9.9]()).
mn55:5.3	These are three cases in which meat may not be eaten.	NA
mn55:5.4	In three cases I say that meat may be eaten:	NA

The point of the passage is that he has merely *heard* that Brahmā abides in love, but he *witnesses* that the Buddha does so.

mn55:13.5	Excellent, sir! Excellent! …	NA
mn55:13.6	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	This sutta marks the occasion of Jīvaka’s conversion. It would seem that he had previously harbored doubts due to his Jain upbringing. Elsewhere he appears as a devotee of the Buddha. [an1.256:1.1]() records that he was the foremost disciple with “confidence in a person”, establishing that he was a stream-enterer. The occasion of his stream-entry, however, is not recorded in Pali.
mn56:0.1	Middle Discourses 56	NA
mn56:0.2	With Upāli	NA
mn56:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn56:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Nāḷandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove.	Pāvārika means “blanket-weaver”. Places were often named for their primary economic activity. Probably there was a community of blanket weavers and the park was owned by their leading merchant.
mn56:2.1	At that time the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan was residing at Nāḷandā together with a large assembly of Jain ascetics.	Jain tradition holds that Mahāvīra passed at a Pāvā near Nāḷandā. Buddhist texts know only the Pāvā of the Mallians to the north. Evidently there has been some confusion, and perhaps “Pāvārika’s mango grove”, the site of discussions with Jains here and at [sn42.8](), is the Pāvā known to the Jains. Note, however, that the earliest Jain source for Mahāvīra’s passing, the Kalpasutra, does not say where Pāvā is. But it does say the events were commemorated by the rulers of Kāsī and Kosala, and the Mallians and the Licchavīs. The absence of Magadha and the presence of Malla sit better with the location of Pāvā in Malla rather than Magadha.
mn56:2.2	Then the Jain ascetic Dīgha Tapassī wandered for alms in Nāḷandā. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to Pāvārika’s mango grove. There he approached the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	In Sanskrit, Dīrghatapasvin was a common name, or rather epithet, for ascetics, meaning “long fervor” in honor of lengthy dedication to practices such as starvation. It is presumably the Dīgha Tapassī of this sutta who is inscribed in a Buddhist stupa at Bharhut teaching a group of students. At least one of his students appears to be holding a small stick, which may be a pictorial representation of the subject of this discourse.
mn56:2.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side. The Buddha said to him,	NA
mn56:2.4	“There are seats, Tapassī. Please sit if you wish.”	NA
mn56:3.1	When he said this, Dīgha Tapassī took a low seat and sat to one side.	NA
mn56:3.2	The Buddha said to him,	NA
mn56:3.3	“Tapassī, how many kinds of deed does the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan describe for performing bad deeds?”	NA
mn56:3.4	“Reverend Gotama, the Jain Ñātika doesn’t usually speak in terms of ‘deeds’.	NA
mn56:3.5	He usually speaks in terms of ‘rods’.”	The term “rod” implies violence and punishment unlike the more neutral “deed”. This usage is found in such Jain texts as Uttarādhyayanasūtra 8.10. It was evidently common enough that it could be referred to obliquely as the “three rods” (20.60; see too Isibhāsiyāiṁ 25.2, 35.0.6). It is also found in Mahābhārata 12.228.034c.
mn56:3.6	“Then how many kinds of rod does the Jain Ñātika describe for performing bad deeds?”	NA
mn56:3.7	“The Jain Ñātika describes three kinds of rod for performing bad deeds:	NA
mn56:3.8	the physical rod, the verbal rod, and the mental rod.”	NA
mn56:3.9	“But are these kinds of rod all distinct from each other?”	NA
mn56:3.10	“Yes, each is quite distinct.”	NA
mn56:3.11	“Of the three rods thus analyzed and differentiated, which rod does the Jain Ñātika describe as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds: the physical rod, the verbal rod, or the mental rod?”	NA
mn56:3.12	“The Jain Ñātika describes the physical rod as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod.”	In Jainism, all three “rods” create _karma_, which in Jainism is a kind of subtle matter (_pudgala_) that adheres to and obscures the soul ( Tattvārthasūtra 6.1–2). Thus all _karma_ is material. Nonetheless, according to Dr. Hiralal Jain, *Jainism in Buddhist Literature*, the Jain position is not that physical actions are more important, since all three kinds of action must be intentional. Rather, it is that intentional actions performed through the body have a greater weight than those performed by speech or by thought alone. _Karma_ in the Jain system is the result of such intentional action, which clings to the soul as a form of matter.
mn56:3.13	“Do you say the physical rod, Tapassī?”	NA
mn56:3.14	“I say the physical rod, Reverend Gotama.”	NA
mn56:3.15	“Do you say the physical rod, Tapassī?”	NA
mn56:3.16	“I say the physical rod, Reverend Gotama.”	NA
mn56:3.17	“Do you say the physical rod, Tapassī?”	NA
mn56:3.18	“I say the physical rod, Reverend Gotama.”	NA
mn56:3.19	Thus the Buddha made Dīgha Tapassī stand by this point up to the third time.	NA
mn56:4.1	When this was said, Dīgha Tapassī said to the Buddha,	NA
mn56:4.2	“But Reverend Gotama, how many kinds of rod do you describe for performing bad deeds?”	NA
mn56:4.3	“Tapassī, the Realized One doesn’t usually speak in terms of ‘rods’.	NA
mn56:4.4	He usually speaks in terms of ‘deeds’.”	The terms _daṇḍa_ (“rod” or “punishment”) and _kamma_ (“deed”) are synonymous in Jainism. The three _daṇḍas_ of body, speech, and mind are also found in Manusmṛti 12.8.
mn56:4.5	“Then how many kinds of deed do you describe for performing bad deeds?”	NA
mn56:4.6	“I describe three kinds of deed for performing bad deeds:	NA
mn56:4.7	physical deeds, verbal deeds, and mental deeds.”	NA
mn56:4.8	“But are these kinds of deed all distinct from each other?”	NA
mn56:4.9	“Yes, each is quite distinct.”	NA
mn56:4.10	“Of the three deeds thus analyzed and differentiated, which deed do you describe as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds: physical deeds, verbal deeds, or mental deeds?”	NA
mn56:4.11	“I describe mental deeds as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much physical deeds or verbal deeds.”	NA
mn56:4.12	“Do you say mental deeds, Reverend Gotama?”	NA
mn56:4.13	“I say mental deeds, Tapassī.”	NA
mn56:4.14	“Do you say mental deeds, Reverend Gotama?”	NA
mn56:4.15	“I say mental deeds, Tapassī.”	NA
mn56:4.16	“Do you say mental deeds, Reverend Gotama?”	NA
mn56:4.17	“I say mental deeds, Tapassī.”	NA
mn56:4.18	Thus the Jain ascetic Dīgha Tapassī made the Buddha stand by this point up to the third time, after which he got up from his seat and went to see the Jain Ñātika.	NA
mn56:5.1	Now at that time the Jain Ñātika was sitting together with a large assembly of Bālaki laypeople headed by Upāli.	Bālaki is obscure. The commentary says it could mean either “foolish” (which seems harsh) or “from the village of the child salt miners” (which is obscure and distant, [mn128:7.1]()). A Dṛpta Bālāki of the Gārgya clan features in Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.1.1, so perhaps it was a proper name (from _balāka_, “crane”).
mn56:5.2	The Jain Ñātika saw Dīgha Tapassī coming off in the distance	NA
mn56:5.3	and said to him,	NA
mn56:5.4	“So, Tapassī, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”	NA
mn56:5.5	“Just now, sir, I’ve come from the presence of the ascetic Gotama.”	NA
mn56:5.6	“But did you have some discussion with him?”	NA
mn56:5.7	“I did.”	NA
mn56:5.8	“And what kind of discussion did you have with him?”	NA
mn56:5.9	Then Dīgha Tapassī informed the Jain Ñātika of all they had discussed.	NA
mn56:6.1	When he had spoken, the Jain Ñātika said to him,	NA
mn56:6.2	“Good, good, Tapassī!	NA
mn56:6.3	Dīgha Tapassī has answered the ascetic Gotama like a learned disciple who rightly understands their teacher’s instructions.	NA
mn56:6.4	For how impressive is the measly mental rod when compared with the solid physical rod?	NA
mn56:6.5	Rather, the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod.”	NA
mn56:7.1	When he said this, the householder Upāli said to him,	NA
mn56:7.2	“Good, sir! Well done, Dīgha Tapassī!	NA
mn56:7.3	The Honorable Tapassī has answered the ascetic Gotama like a learned disciple who rightly understands their teacher’s instructions.	NA
mn56:7.4	For how impressive is the measly mental rod when compared with the solid physical rod?	NA
mn56:7.5	Rather, the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod.	NA
mn56:7.6	I’d better go and refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine regarding this point.	NA
mn56:7.7	If he stands by the position that he stated to Dīgha Tapassī, I’ll take him on in debate and drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong man would grab a fleecy sheep and drag it to and fro and round about!	NA
mn56:7.8	Taking him on in debate, I’ll drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong brewer’s worker would toss a large brewer’s sieve into a deep lake, grab it by the corners, and drag it to and fro and round about!	NA
mn56:7.9	Taking him on in debate, I’ll shake him down and about and give him a beating, like a strong brewer’s mixer would grab a strainer by the corners and shake it down and about, and give it a beating!	NA
mn56:7.10	I’ll play a game of hemp-washing with the ascetic Gotama, like a sixty-year-old elephant would plunge into a deep lotus pond and play a game of hemp-washing!	NA
mn56:7.11	Sir, I’d better go and refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine on this point.”	NA
mn56:7.12	“Go, householder, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine on this point.	NA
mn56:7.13	For either I should do so, or Dīgha Tapassī, or you.”	It is rather a shame that neither in Buddhist nor Jain tradition is there a record of the two actually meeting.
mn56:8.1	When he said this, Dīgha Tapassī said to the Jain Ñātika,	NA
mn56:8.2	“Sir, I don’t believe it’s a good idea for the householder Upāli to rebut the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.	NA
mn56:8.3	For the ascetic Gotama is a magician. He knows a conversion magic, and uses it to convert the disciples of other religions.”	NA
mn56:8.4	“It is impossible, Tapassī, it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotama’s disciple.	This is a setup intended to satirize Mahāvīra’s claims to omniscience.
mn56:8.5	But it is possible that Gotama could become Upāli’s disciple.	NA
mn56:8.6	Go, householder, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine on this point.	NA
mn56:8.7	For either I should do so, or Dīgha Tapassī, or you.”	NA
mn56:9.1	For a second time …	NA
mn56:9.2	and a third time, Dīgha Tapassī said to the Jain Ñātika,	NA
mn56:9.3	“Sir, I don’t believe it’s a good idea for the householder Upāli to rebut the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.	NA
mn56:9.4	For the ascetic Gotama is a magician. He knows a conversion magic, and uses it to convert the disciples of other religions.”	NA
mn56:9.5	“It is impossible, Tapassī, it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotama’s disciple.	NA
mn56:9.6	But it is possible that Gotama could become Upāli’s disciple.	NA
mn56:9.7	Go, householder, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine on this point.	NA
mn56:9.8	For either I should do so, or Dīgha Tapassī, or you.”	NA
mn56:9.9	“Yes, sir,” replied the householder Upāli to the Jain Ñātika. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled him, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
mn56:9.10	“Sir, did the Jain ascetic Dīgha Tapassī come here?”	NA
mn56:9.11	“He did, householder.”	NA
mn56:9.12	“But did you have some discussion with him?”	NA
mn56:9.13	“I did.”	NA
mn56:9.14	“And what kind of discussion did you have with him?”	Upāli makes sure to hear the Buddha’s side before proceeding.
mn56:9.15	Then the Buddha informed Upāli of all they had discussed.	NA
mn56:10.1	When he said this, the householder Upāli said to him,	NA
mn56:10.2	“Good, sir, well done by Tapassī!	NA
mn56:10.3	The Jain ascetic Tapassī has answered the ascetic Gotama like a learned disciple who rightly understands their teacher’s instructions.	NA
mn56:10.4	For how impressive is the measly mental rod when compared with the solid physical rod?	NA
mn56:10.5	Rather, the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod.”	NA
mn56:10.6	“Householder, so long as you debate on the basis of truth, we can have some discussion about this.”	NA
mn56:10.7	“I will debate on the basis of truth, sir.	NA
mn56:10.8	Let us have some discussion about this.”	NA
mn56:11.1	“What do you think, householder?	NA
mn56:11.2	Take a Jain ascetic who is sick, suffering, gravely ill. They reject cold water and use only hot water.	Jain ascetics could not use cold water on account of the living creatures therein. Ācāraṅgasūtra 2.2.1.8 says a _nigaṇṭha_ must not stay at a lay person’s house because they may fall ill and be treated with, among other things, cold water (see also 2.6.2.2 and 2.1.7.7).  Uttarādhyayanasūtra 1.1.3.7 dismisses the Buddhist claim that mere filtering is sufficient to render water allowable (see also 2.4).
mn56:11.3	Not getting cold water, they might die.	NA
mn56:11.4	Now, where does the Jain Ñātika say they would be reborn?”	NA
mn56:11.5	“Sir, there are gods called ‘mind-bound’. They would be reborn there.	NA
mn56:11.6	Why is that?	NA
mn56:11.7	Because they died with mental attachment.”	It is not clear from the text why they must have attachment.
mn56:11.8	“Think about it, householder! You should think before answering.	NA
mn56:11.9	What you said before and what you said after don’t match up.	NA
mn56:11.10	But you said that you would debate on the basis of truth.”	NA
mn56:11.11	NA	NA
mn56:11.12	NA	NA
mn56:11.13	“Even though the Buddha says this, still the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod.”	NA
mn56:12.1	“What do you think, householder?	NA
mn56:12.2	Take a Jain ascetic who is restrained in all that is to be restrained, is bridled in all that is to be restrained, has shaken off evil in all that is to be restrained, and is curbed in all that is to be restrained.	MS has _nigaṇṭho nāṭaputto_, but I follow PTS _nigaṇṭho_, in line with the pattern in this sutta and with the parallel at [dn2:29.4](). | At Isibhāsiyāiṁ 29.19, Vardhamāna ( Mahāvīra) teaches that a sage is _savva-vārīhiṁ vārie_, “restrained in all restraints”, which clearly parallels our current passage. In that passage, “restraint” refers to stopping the influx of defilements through the five senses, neither delighting in the pleasant nor loathing the unpleasant. | Read _vāri_ as future passive participle (cf. Sanskrit _vārya_). | _Dhuta_ in the sense “shaken off (evil by means of ascetic practices)” is a characteristic Jain term. | For _sabbavāriphuṭo_ compare _ophuṭo_ at [mn99:15.5](). In both cases _phuṭ_ appears in a string of terms from the root _var_, and is possibly a corrupted form, or at least has the same meaning.
mn56:12.3	When going out and coming back they accidentally injure many little creatures.	Jain ascetics use a soft broom to sweep the path before them to avoid this.
mn56:12.4	Now, what result does the Jain Ñātika say they would incur?”	NA
mn56:12.5	“Sir, the Jain Ñātika says that unintentional acts are not very blameworthy.”	NA
mn56:12.6	“But if they are intentional?”	NA
mn56:12.7	“Then they are very blameworthy.”	NA
mn56:12.8	“But where does the Jain Ñātika say that intention is classified?”	NA
mn56:12.9	“In the mental rod, sir.”	NA
mn56:12.10	“Think about it, householder! You should think before answering.	NA

Vettam Mani’s *Puranic Encyclopedia* informs us that Daṇḍa was a son of Ikṣvāku, founder of the solar dynasty, who gave Daṇḍa the country between the mountains Himālaya and Vindhya. But Daṇḍa raped Arā, the daughter of the hermit Śukra. Śukra destroyed the country of Daṇḍa in a rain of fire. See too Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa 3.5. Buddhist accounts may be found in the Sarabhaṅga Jātaka at [ja522]() and Mahāvastu 99. This sage is possibly noted by name at [mn116:6.13](). | Kaliṅga was a coastal realm in modern Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. Its downfall is related in [ja522](), although that was a kammic result of vile sin against ascetics rather than by psychic power. | Mejjha’s destruction is told in [ja497](). There, Mātaṅga features as a wise sage, and it is not clear to me how this relates to the wilderness of that name. In the suttas, the person Mātaṅga was regarded as an enlightened sage of the past ([mn116:6.17](), [snp1.7:26.1]()).

mn56:14.1	“What have you heard?”	NA
mn56:14.2	“I heard that it was because of a malevolent act of will by seers that the wildernesses of Daṇḍaka, Kaliṅga, Mejjha, and Mātaṅga came to be that way.”	NA
mn56:14.3	“Think about it, householder! You should think before answering.	NA
mn56:14.4	What you said before and what you said after don’t match up.	NA

mn56:15.2	Nevertheless, I wanted to hear the Buddha’s various solutions to the problem, so I thought I’d oppose you in this way.	NA
mn56:15.3	Excellent, sir! Excellent!	NA
mn56:15.4	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
mn56:15.5	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
mn56:15.6	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	NA
mn56:16.1	“Householder, you should act after careful consideration. It’s good for well-known people such as yourself to act after careful consideration.”	As at [an8.12:26.1]().
mn56:16.2	“Now I’m even more delighted and satisfied with the Buddha, since he tells me to act after careful consideration.	NA
mn56:16.3	For if the followers of other religions were to gain me as a disciple, they’d carry a banner all over Nāḷandā, saying:	NA
mn56:16.4	‘The householder Upāli has become our disciple!’	NA
mn56:16.5	And yet the Buddha says:	NA
mn56:16.6	‘Householder, you should act after careful consideration. It’s good for well-known people such as yourself to act after careful consideration.’	NA
mn56:16.7	For a second time, I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
mn56:16.8	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	NA
mn56:17.1	“For a long time now, householder, your family has been a well-spring of support for the Jain ascetics. You should consider giving to them when they come.”	NA
mn56:17.2	“Now I’m even more delighted and satisfied with the Buddha, since he tells me to consider giving to the Jain ascetics when they come.	NA
mn56:17.3	I have heard, sir, that the ascetic Gotama says this:	NA
mn56:17.4	‘Gifts should only be given to me, not to others.	The same calumny is reported at [an8.12:27.6]() and [an3.57:1.4]().
mn56:17.5	Gifts should only be given to my disciples, not to the disciples of others.	NA
mn56:17.6	Only what is given to me is very fruitful, not what is given to others.	NA
mn56:17.7	Only what is given to my disciples is very fruitful, not what is given to the disciples of others.’	NA
mn56:17.8	Yet the Buddha encourages me to give to the Jain ascetics.	NA
mn56:17.9	Well, sir, we’ll know the proper time for that.	NA
mn56:17.10	For a third time, I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
mn56:17.11	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	NA
mn56:18.1	Then the Buddha taught the householder Upāli step by step, with	NA
mn56:18.2	a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation.	NA
mn56:18.3	And when he knew that Upāli’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas:	NA
mn56:18.4	suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.	NA
mn56:18.5	Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye,	NA
mn56:18.6	in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in Upāli:	NA
mn56:18.7	“Everything that has a beginning has an end.”	NA
mn56:18.8	Then Upāli saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions.	NA
mn56:18.9	He said to the Buddha, “Well, now, sir, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.”	NA
mn56:18.10	“Please, householder, go at your convenience.”	NA
mn56:19.1	And then the householder Upāli approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went back to his own home, where he addressed the gatekeeper,	NA
mn56:19.2	“My good gatekeeper, from this day forth close the gate to Jain monks and nuns, and open it for the Buddha’s monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.	NA
mn56:19.3	If any Jain ascetics come, say this to them:	NA
mn56:19.4	‘Wait, sir, do not enter.	This is even harsher than it appears, for one of the Jains’ rules is not to wait when invited for food (_natiṭṭhabhaddantiko_, eg. [mn12:45.1]()).
mn56:19.5	From now on the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama.	NA
mn56:19.6	His gate is closed to Jain monks and nuns, and opened for the Buddha’s monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.	NA
mn56:19.7	If you require almsfood, wait here, they will bring it to you.’”	NA
mn56:19.8	“Yes, sir,” replied the gatekeeper.	NA
mn56:20.1	Dīgha Tapassī heard that	NA
mn56:20.2	Upāli had become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama.	NA
mn56:20.3	He went to the Jain Ñātika and said to him,	NA
mn56:20.4	“Sir, they say that the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama.”	NA
mn56:20.5	“It is impossible, Tapassī, it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotama’s disciple.	NA
mn56:20.6	But it is possible that Gotama could become Upāli’s disciple.”	NA
mn56:20.7	For a second time …	NA
mn56:20.8	and a third time, Dīgha Tapassī said to the Jain Ñātika,	NA
mn56:20.9	“Sir, they say that the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama.”	NA
mn56:20.10	“It is impossible, Tapassī, it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotama’s disciple.	NA
mn56:20.11	But it is possible that Gotama could become Upāli’s disciple.”	NA
mn56:20.12	“Well, sir, I’d better go and find out whether or not Upāli has become Gotama’s disciple.”	NA
mn56:20.13	“Go, Tapassī, and find out whether or not Upāli has become Gotama’s disciple.”	NA
mn56:21.1	Then Dīgha Tapassī went to Upāli’s home.	NA
mn56:21.2	The gatekeeper saw him coming off in the distance	NA
mn56:21.3	and said to him,	NA
mn56:21.4	“Wait, sir, do not enter.	NA
mn56:21.5	From now on the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama.	NA
mn56:21.6	His gate is closed to Jain monks and nuns, and opened for the Buddha’s monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.	NA
mn56:21.7	If you require almsfood, wait here, they will bring it to you.”	NA
mn56:21.8	Saying, “No, worthy man, I do not require almsfood,” he turned back and went to the Jain Ñātika and said to him,	NA
mn56:21.9	“Sir, it’s really true that Upāli has become Gotama’s disciple.	NA
mn56:21.10	Sir, I couldn’t get you to accept that it wasn’t a good idea for the householder Upāli to rebut the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.	NA
mn56:21.11	For the ascetic Gotama is a magician. He knows a conversion magic, and uses it to convert the disciples of other religions.	NA
mn56:21.12	The householder Upāli has been converted by the ascetic Gotama’s conversion magic!”	NA
mn56:21.13	“It is impossible, Tapassī, it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotama’s disciple.	NA
mn56:21.14	But it is possible that Gotama could become Upāli’s disciple.”	NA
mn56:21.15	For a second time …	NA
mn56:21.16	NA	NA
mn56:21.17	NA	NA
mn56:21.18	and a third time, Dīgha Tapassī told the Jain Ñātika	NA
mn56:21.19	that it was really true.	NA
mn56:21.20	“It is impossible …	NA
mn56:21.21	NA	NA
mn56:21.22	Well, Tapassī, I’d better go and find out for myself whether or not Upāli has become Gotama’s disciple.”	NA
mn56:22.1	Then the Jain Ñātika went to Upāli’s home together with a large following of Jain ascetics.	NA
mn56:22.2	The gatekeeper saw him coming off in the distance	NA
mn56:22.3	and said to him:	NA
mn56:22.4	“Wait, sir, do not enter.	NA
mn56:22.5	From now on the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama.	NA

mn56:22.8	“Well then, my good gatekeeper, go to Upāli and say:	NA
mn56:22.9	‘Sir, the Jain Ñātika is waiting outside the gates together with a large following of Jain ascetics.	NA
mn56:22.10	He wishes to see you.’”	NA
mn56:22.11	“Yes, sir,” replied the gatekeeper. He went to Upāli and relayed what was said.	NA
mn56:22.12	NA	NA
mn56:22.13	NA	NA
mn56:22.14	Upāli said to him, “Well, then, my good gatekeeper, prepare seats in the hall of the middle gate.”	NA
mn56:22.15	“Yes, sir,” replied the gatekeeper. He did as he was asked, then returned to Upāli and said,	NA
mn56:22.16	“Sir, seats have been prepared in the hall of the middle gate.	NA
mn56:22.17	Please go at your convenience.”	NA
mn56:23.1	Then Upāli went to the hall of the middle gate, where he sat on the highest and finest seat. He addressed the gatekeeper,	NA
mn56:23.2	“Well then, my good gatekeeper, go to the Jain Ñātika and say to him:	NA
mn56:23.3	‘Sir, Upāli says	NA
mn56:23.4	you may enter if you wish.’”	NA
mn56:23.5	“Yes, sir,” replied the gatekeeper. He went to the Jain Ñātika and relayed what was said.	NA
mn56:23.6	NA	NA
mn56:23.7	NA	NA
mn56:23.8	Then the Jain Ñātika went to the hall of the middle gate together with a large following of Jain ascetics.	NA
mn56:24.1	NA	NA
mn56:24.2	Previously, when Upāli saw the Jain Ñātika coming, he would go out to greet him and, having wiped off the highest and finest seat with his upper robe, he would embrace him and sit him down.	_Pariggahetvā_ (“embrace”) is used in only one other passage, where it refers to a nurse cradling a baby’s head ([an5.7:1.9](), [mn58:7.6]()).
mn56:24.3	But today, having seated himself on the highest and finest seat, he said to the Jain Ñātika,	NA
mn56:24.4	“There are seats, sir.	NA
mn56:24.5	Please sit if you wish.”	NA
mn56:25.1	When he said this, the Jain Ñātika said to him:	NA
mn56:25.2	“You’re mad, householder! You’re a moron!	NA
mn56:25.3	You said: ‘I’ll go and refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.’ But you come back caught in the vast net of his doctrine.	NA
mn56:25.4	Suppose a man went to deliver a pair of testicles, but came back castrated. Or they went to deliver eyes, but came back blinded.	NA
mn56:25.5	In the same way, you said: ‘I’ll go and refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.’ But you come back caught in the vast net of his doctrine.	NA
mn56:25.6	You’ve been converted by the ascetic Gotama’s conversion magic!”	NA
mn56:26.1	“Sir, this conversion magic is excellent.	NA
mn56:26.2	This conversion magic is lovely!	NA
mn56:26.3	If my loved ones—relatives and kin—were to be converted by this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.	NA
mn56:26.4	If all the aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials were to be converted by this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.	NA
mn56:26.5	If the whole world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—were to be converted by this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.	NA
mn56:26.6	Well then, sir, I shall give you a simile.	NA
mn56:26.7	For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.	NA
mn56:27.1	Once upon a time there was an old brahmin, elderly and senior. His wife was a young brahmin lady who was pregnant and about to give birth.	The age at which girls were considered ready for marriage was sixteen.
mn56:27.2	Then she said to the brahmin,	NA
mn56:27.3	‘Go, brahmin, buy a baby monkey from the market and bring it back so it can be a playmate for my child.’	Though the word is not used, this is the _dohaḷa_, the desire of a (usually pregnant) woman that is as unstoppable as it is irrational. In numerous Jātaka stories as well as across Indian storytelling generally, it serves to send a hero on his journey. For a developed _dohaḷa_ story in the canon, see the legend of Dīghāvu ([pli-tv-kd10:2.3.1]()).
mn56:27.4	When she said this, the brahmin said to her,	NA
mn56:27.5	‘Wait, my dear, until you give birth.	NA
mn56:27.6	If your child is a boy, I’ll buy you a male monkey,	NA
mn56:27.7	but if it’s a girl, I’ll buy a female monkey.’	NA
mn56:27.8	For a second time,	NA
mn56:27.9	and a third time she said to the brahmin,	NA
mn56:27.10	‘Go, brahmin, buy a baby monkey from the market and bring it back so it can be a playmate for my child.’	NA
mn56:27.11	Then that brahmin, because of his love for the brahmin lady, bought a male baby monkey at the market, brought it to her, and said,	NA
mn56:27.12	‘I’ve bought this male baby monkey for you so it can be a playmate for your child.’	NA
mn56:27.13	When he said this, she said to him,	NA
mn56:27.14	‘Go, brahmin, take this monkey to Rattapāṇi the dyer and say,	NA
mn56:27.15	“Worthy Rattapāṇi, I wish to have this monkey dyed the color of yellow greasepaint, pounded and re-pounded, and pressed on both sides.”’	NA
mn56:27.16	Then that brahmin, because of his love for the brahmin lady, took the monkey to Rattapāṇi the dyer and said,	NA
mn56:27.17	‘Worthy Rattapāṇi, I wish to have this monkey dyed the color of yellow greasepaint, pounded and re-pounded, and pressed on both sides.’	NA
mn56:27.18	When he said this, Rattapāṇi said to him,	NA
mn56:27.19	‘Sir, this monkey can withstand a dying, but not a pounding or a pressing.’	NA
mn56:27.20	In the same way, the doctrine of the foolish Jains looks fine initially—for fools, not for the astute—but can’t withstand being scrutinized or pressed.	NA
mn56:27.21	Then some time later that brahmin took a new pair of garments to Rattapāṇi the dyer and said,	NA
mn56:27.22	‘Worthy Rattapāṇi, I wish to have this new pair of garments dyed the color of yellow greasepaint, pounded and re-pounded, and pressed on both sides.’	NA
mn56:27.23	When he said this, Rattapāṇi said to him,	NA
mn56:27.24	‘Sir, this pair of garments can withstand a dying, a pounding, and a pressing.’	NA
mn56:27.25	In the same way, the doctrine of the Buddha looks fine initially—for the astute, not for fools—and it can withstand being scrutinized and pressed.”	NA
mn56:28.1	“Householder, the king and his retinue know you as	NA
mn56:28.2	a disciple of the Jain Ñātika.	NA
mn56:28.3	Whose disciple should we remember you as?”	NA
mn56:29.1	When he had spoken, the householder Upāli got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms in the direction of the Buddha, and said to the Jain Ñātika,	NA
mn56:29.2	“Well then, sir, hear whose disciple I am:	NA
mn56:29.3	The attentive one, free of delusion,	NA
mn56:29.4	with hard-heartedness dissolved, victor in battle;	Read _khīla_ as _khila_, a reference to the five kinds of hard-heartedness. For similar idioms see [snp4.16:19.2]() and [sn8.8:8.2]() = [thag21.1:34.2]().

mn56:29.7	immaculate in the midst of it all:	“In the midst of it all” is _vessantara_, as in the famous Jātaka of that name (Ja 547). MA 133 here has <span lang='lzh'>安隱</spa>, where <span lang='lzh'>隱</span> represents _antara_, and <span lang='lzh'>安</span> may be _sama_. _Vessa_ in the sense of “all” is rare in Pali.
mn56:29.8	he is the Buddha, and I am his disciple.	NA

mn56:29.19	he has cut off conceit, he’s a hero:	NA
mn56:29.20	he is the Buddha, and I am his disciple.	NA

mn56:29.32	he is the Buddha, and I am his disciple.	NA
mn56:29.33	He is the seventh sage, free of deceit,	The idea of the seven sages, long proverbial in Vedic culture, was adapted for Gotama in [dn14](), where he is the seventh recorded Buddha. Readings of this phrase in various texts and commentaries also allow the sense, “best of seers”.
mn56:29.34	with three knowledges, he has attained to divinity,	NA
mn56:29.35	he has bathed, he knows philology,	The terms here are all Brahmanical, so we should take _padaka_ in the usual sense of “philology” as in eg. [mn91:2.1]().
mn56:29.36	he’s tranquil, he understands what is known;	NA
mn56:29.37	he is Sakka the Able, Purindada the Firstgiver:	_Sakka_ (_śakra_) was originally an epithet of Indra, the “able one”. | _Purandara_ (“Fortbreaker”) is another epithet (eg. Rig Veda 1.102.7). The Buddha reforms it to _Purindada_ (“Firstgiver”) at [sn11.12:2.1](). But Indra’s generosity is long renowned, eg. Rig Veda 1.10.6c: “He is the able one, and he will be able for us—Indra who distributes the goods” (_sa śakra uta naḥ śakad indro vasu dayamānaḥ_).

mn56:29.44	he is the Buddha, and I am his disciple.	NA
mn56:29.45	Transcendent, he practices absorption,	At [thig14.1:14.1]() _samuggata_ refers to a lily rising above the waters; at [sn10.7:10.2]() to rising above suffering.

mn56:29.57	He has cut off craving and is awakened,	NA
mn56:29.58	free of fuming, unsullied;	NA
mn56:29.59	a mighty spirit worthy of offerings,	The Chinese here evidently reads _akkha_ (“eye”), but in the context of offerings I think _yakkha_ (“spirit”) fits better. Conversion legends of _yakkhas_ tell how the cruel offerings of sacrifice are replaced with the harmless offerings to the Buddha. Perhaps it was later adjusted to _akkha_ as the _yakkha_ developed a poor reputation in later Buddhism.
mn56:29.60	best of men, inestimable,	NA

mn56:30.2	“Sir, suppose there was a large heap of many different flowers. A deft garland-maker or their apprentice could tie them into a colorful garland.	NA
mn56:30.3	In the same way, the Buddha has many beautiful qualities to praise, many hundreds of such qualities.	Upāli is playing on the dual senses of _vaṇṇa_ as both “praise” and “beauty”. In doing so, he implicitly answers Mahāvīra’s question: he is adept at poetic improvisation (_paṭibhāna_).
mn56:30.4	Who, sir, would not praise the praiseworthy?”	NA
mn56:31.1	Unable to bear this honor paid to the Buddha, the Jain Ñātika spewed hot blood from his mouth there and then.	The Pali commentary says this was the cause of his death in Pāvā soon after, which supports the contention that Pāvā is Pāvārika. The Jain Kalpasūtra, however, tells a very different story, of a triumphant leader who, having lived a long and exemplary life, mindfully departed this world in honor and dignity, to the consternation of the gods.
mn57:0.1	Middle Discourses 57	NA
mn57:0.2	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog	NA
mn57:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn57:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where they have a town named Haliddavasana.	The Koliyans were south-eastern neighbors of the Sakyans, with whom they had close ties in marriage and customs. | Haliddavasana (“yellow-clothes”) is also the scene of [sn46.54](), which discusses similarities and differences between Buddhism and wanderers when it comes to meditation.
mn57:2.1	Then Puṇṇa the Koliyan, a cow votary, and the naked ascetic Seniya, a dog votary, went to see the Buddha. Puṇṇa bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side, while Seniya exchanged greetings and polite conversation with him before sitting down to one side curled up like a dog.	The cow votary (_govatika_) is attested in Sanskrit (eg. Mahābhārata 5.97.13). Elsewhere, non-Buddhist texts mention cat votaries (Manu 4.30), snake votaries, fish votaries, those who live like beasts (_mṛgacaryā_), and others, but not, so far as I am aware, dog votaries. The cow and dog observances are found in later Buddhist texts (Yogacārabhūmi 157.10, Mahākarmavibhaṅga 44.19, Śikṣāsamuccaya 332.3, etc.) evidently drawing from this sutta. Thus, while no parallel of this sutta has survived, it was known in northern Buddhist traditions and must have been lost due to a failure of transmission.
mn57:2.2	Puṇṇa said to the Buddha,	NA
mn57:2.3	“Sir, this naked ascetic Seniya the dog votary does a hard thing: he eats food placed on the ground.	NA
mn57:2.4	For a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a dog.	NA
mn57:2.5	Where will he be reborn in his next life?”	NA
mn57:2.6	“Enough, Puṇṇa, let it be. Don’t ask me that.”	Also at [sn42.2]() and [sn42.3]().
mn57:2.7	For a second time …	NA
mn57:2.8	and a third time, Puṇṇa said to the Buddha,	NA
mn57:2.9	“Sir, this naked ascetic Seniya does a hard thing: he eats food placed on the ground.	NA
mn57:2.10	For a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a dog.	NA
mn57:2.11	Where will he be reborn in his next life?”	NA
mn57:2.12	“Clearly, Puṇṇa, I’m not getting through to you when I say:	NA
mn57:2.13	‘Enough, Puṇṇa, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’	NA
mn57:2.14	Nevertheless, I will answer you.	NA
mn57:3.1	Take someone who develops the dog observance fully and uninterruptedly. They develop a dog’s ethics, a dog’s mentality, and a dog’s behavior fully and uninterruptedly.	NA
mn57:3.2	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of dogs.	NA
mn57:3.3	But if they have such a view: ‘By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or spiritual life, may I become one of the gods!’ This is their wrong view.	NA
mn57:3.4	An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: hell or the animal realm.	NA
mn57:3.5	So if the dog observance succeeds it leads to rebirth in the company of dogs, but if it fails it leads to hell.”	NA
mn57:4.1	When he said this, Seniya cried and burst out in tears.	NA
mn57:4.2	The Buddha said to Puṇṇa,	NA
mn57:4.3	“This is what I didn’t get through to you when I said:	NA
mn57:4.4	‘Enough, Puṇṇa, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’”	NA
mn57:4.5	Seniya said, “Sir, I’m not crying because of what the Buddha said.	NA
mn57:4.6	But, sir, for a long time I have undertaken this observance to behave like a dog.	NA
mn57:4.7	Sir, this Puṇṇa is a cow votary.	NA
mn57:4.8	For a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a cow.	From a text of a later date, the cow observance is described thus: “One should bathe in the urine of a cow, maintain himself with milk, and move with the cows, eating after they had eaten. It is known as _govrata_. One would become free from the sins in a month. He would attain the world of cows and reach heaven” (Agni Purāna 292:12–13a, Gangadharan’s translation). This is not a penance for burning off sin, but rather a way of elevating oneself through the sacred nature of the cow. It is not clear, however, if this is the same as the observance in the Buddha’s day.
mn57:4.9	Where will he be reborn in his next life?”	NA
mn57:4.10	“Enough, Seniya, let it be. Don’t ask me that.”	NA
mn57:4.11	For a second time …	NA
mn57:4.12	and a third time Seniya said to the Buddha,	NA
mn57:4.13	“Sir, this Puṇṇa is a cow votary.	NA
mn57:4.14	For a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a cow.	NA
mn57:4.15	Where will he be reborn in his next life?”	NA
mn57:4.16	“Clearly, Seniya, I’m not getting through to you when I say:	NA
mn57:4.17	‘Enough, Seniya, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’	NA
mn57:4.18	Nevertheless, I will answer you.	NA
mn57:5.1	Take someone who develops the cow observance fully and uninterruptedly. They develop a cow’s ethics, a cow’s mentality, and a cow’s behavior fully and uninterruptedly.	NA
mn57:5.2	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of cows.	This means to be reborn as a cow, rather than in the _goloka_, which in Hinduism is a heaven for cows.
mn57:5.3	But if they have such a view: ‘By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or spiritual life, may I become one of the gods!’ This is their wrong view.	NA
mn57:5.4	An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: hell or the animal realm.	NA
mn57:5.5	So if the cow observance succeeds it leads to rebirth in the company of cows, but if it fails it leads to hell.”	NA
mn57:6.1	When he said this, Puṇṇa cried and burst out in tears.	NA
mn57:6.2	The Buddha said to Seniya,	NA
mn57:6.3	“This is what I didn’t get through to you when I said:	NA
mn57:6.4	‘Enough, Seniya, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’”	NA
mn57:6.5	Puṇṇa said, “Sir, I’m not crying because of what the Buddha said.	NA
mn57:6.6	But, sir, for a long time I have undertaken this observance to behave like a cow.	NA
mn57:6.7	I am quite confident that the Buddha	NA
mn57:6.8	is capable of teaching me so that I can give up this cow observance, and the naked ascetic Seniya can give up that dog observance.”	NA
mn57:6.9	“Well then, Puṇṇa, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn57:6.10	“Yes, sir,” he replied.	NA
mn57:6.11	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn57:7.1	“Puṇṇa, I declare these four kinds of deeds, having realized them with my own insight.	See [an4.233]() ff.
mn57:7.2	What four?	NA
mn57:7.3	There are dark deeds with dark results;	NA
mn57:7.4	bright deeds with bright results;	NA
mn57:7.5	dark and bright deeds with dark and bright results; and	By treating ethical decisions via a tetralemma, the Buddha rejects the “law of the excluded middle” and the consequent belief that acts must be either right or wrong.
mn57:7.6	neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results, which lead to the ending of deeds.	These are the intentions associated with the noble eightfold path.
mn57:8.1	And what are dark deeds with dark results?	NA
mn57:8.2	It’s when someone makes hurtful choices by way of body, speech, and mind.	NA
mn57:8.3	Having made these choices, they’re reborn in a hurtful world,	NA
mn57:8.4	where hurtful contacts strike them.	NA
mn57:8.5	Touched by hurtful contacts, they experience hurtful feelings that are exclusively painful—like the beings in hell.	NA
mn57:8.6	This is how a being is born from a being.	NA
mn57:8.7	For your deeds determine your rebirth,	NA
mn57:8.8	and when you’re reborn contacts strike you.	NA
mn57:8.9	This is why I say that sentient beings are heirs to their deeds.	NA
mn57:8.10	These are called dark deeds with dark results.	NA
mn57:9.1	And what are bright deeds with bright results?	NA
mn57:9.2	It’s when someone makes pleasing choices by way of body, speech, and mind.	NA
mn57:9.3	Having made these choices, they are reborn in a pleasing world,	NA
mn57:9.4	where pleasing contacts strike them.	NA
mn57:9.5	Touched by pleasing contacts, they experience pleasing feelings of perfect happiness—like the gods of universal beauty.	NA
mn57:9.6	This is how a being is born from a being.	NA
mn57:9.7	For your deeds determine your rebirth,	NA
mn57:9.8	and when you’re reborn contacts strike you.	NA
mn57:9.9	This is why I say that sentient beings are heirs to their deeds.	NA
mn57:9.10	These are called bright deeds with bright results.	NA
mn57:10.1	And what are dark and bright deeds with dark and bright results?	NA
mn57:10.2	It’s when someone makes both hurtful and pleasing choices by way of body, speech, and mind.	NA
mn57:10.3	Having made these choices, they are reborn in a world that is both hurtful and pleasing,	NA
mn57:10.4	where hurtful and pleasing contacts strike them.	NA
mn57:10.5	Touched by both hurtful and pleasing contacts, they experience both hurtful and pleasing feelings that are a mixture of pleasure and pain—like humans, some gods, and some beings in the underworld.	NA
mn57:10.6	This is how a being is born from a being.	NA
mn57:10.7	For what you do brings about your rebirth,	NA
mn57:10.8	and when you’re reborn contacts strike you.	NA
mn57:10.9	This is why I say that sentient beings are heirs to their deeds.	NA
mn57:10.10	These are called dark and bright deeds with dark and bright results.	NA
mn57:11.1	And what are neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results, which lead to the ending of deeds?	NA
mn57:11.2	It’s the intention to give up dark deeds with dark results, bright deeds with bright results, and both dark and bright deeds with both dark and bright results.	NA
mn57:11.3	These are called neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results, which lead to the ending of deeds.	NA
mn57:11.4	These are the four kinds of deeds that I declare, having realized them with my own insight.”	NA
mn57:12.1	When he had spoken, Puṇṇa the Koliyan said to the Buddha,	NA
mn57:12.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent! …	NA
mn57:12.3	NA	NA
mn57:12.4	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	NA
mn57:13.1	And Seniya the naked ascetic said to the Buddha,	NA
mn57:13.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent! …	NA
mn57:13.3	NA	NA
mn57:13.4	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
mn57:13.5	Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”	Puṇṇa the layman goes for refuge, while Seniya the ascetic goes forth.
mn57:14.1	“Seniya, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.	This probation is laid down in the Vinaya at [pli-tv-kd1:38.1.5](). The candidate shaves, dons the robes, takes refuge, and asks for probation. They must show good conduct and restraint, diligence in duties, and enthusiasm for the Buddha’s teachings and practice.
mn57:14.2	However, I have recognized individual differences in this matter.”	In addition to individual exceptions, there are general exceptions for dreadlocked ascetics, since they believe in kamma, and for the Buddha’s relatives.
mn57:14.3	“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.”	NA
mn57:15.1	And the naked ascetic Seniya received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	NA
mn57:15.2	Not long after his ordination, Venerable Seniya, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn57:15.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	NA
mn57:15.4	And Venerable Seniya became one of the perfected.	NA
mn58:0.1	Middle Discourses 58	NA
mn58:0.2	With Prince Abhaya	NA
mn58:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn58:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	This sutta is framed as a response to a challenge by Mahāvīra, the Jain leader. It shows the Buddha’s characteristic dry humor to undermine religious pretensions (see eg. [mn76:21.4](), [dn11:82.7]()). The dialogue slyly shows the Buddha defeating Mahāvīra by using one of Mahāvīra’s key methods against him.
mn58:2.1	Then Prince Abhaya went up to the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Jain Ñātika said to him,	Prince Abhaya (“fearless”) raised Jīvaka after discovering him abandoned [pli-tv-kd8:1.4.5](). In this sutta he appears as an acolyte of Mahāvīra, while in [sn46.56]() he asks the Buddha about Pūraṇa Kassapa. Apart from these details he is unknown in the early texts. Commentaries say he was the son of King Bimbisāra by one of his queens, Padumavatī of Ujjenī, making him half-brother to Ajātasattu. They also say that following Bimbisāra’s death, Abhaya went forth and spoke the verse at [thag1.26](). | Not to be confused with Abhaya the Licchavī of [an3.74]() and [an4.196](); nor with the author of [thag1.98](); nor is [thig2.8]() addressed to his mother, but that of the nun Abhayā ([thig2.9]()).
mn58:3.1	“Come, prince, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.	NA
mn58:3.2	Then you will get a good reputation:	NA
mn58:3.3	‘Prince Abhaya refuted the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama, so mighty and powerful!’”	NA
mn58:3.4	“But sir, how am I to do this?”	NA
mn58:3.5	“Here, prince, go to the ascetic Gotama and say to him:	NA
mn58:3.6	‘Sir, may the Realized One utter speech that is disliked by others?’	The Jain doctrine _anekantavāda_ (“doctrine of many-sidedness”, “non-categorical doctrine”) posits that in metaphysical propositions, one must conditionally affirm multiple possibilities so as to illuminate the complex, multifacted nature of reality. An aspect of _anekantavāda_ is the _syadvada_, which frames all statements with _syā_, “it may be”. This uses the optative tense to conditionally affirm or deny without making absolute statements. The same tense is employed here by Mahāvīra in order to trap the Buddha on the horns of a dilemma (_ubhatokoṭika_). Needless to say, this is not how he is presented in Jain texts.
mn58:3.7	When he’s asked this, if he answers:	NA
mn58:3.8	‘He may, prince,’ say this to him,	NA
mn58:3.9	‘Then, sir, what exactly is the difference between you and an ordinary person?	When springing the trap, the voice shifts from the respectful third person to the familiar second person.
mn58:3.10	For even an ordinary person may utter speech that is disliked by others.’	NA
mn58:3.11	But if he answers,	NA
mn58:3.12	‘He may not, prince,’ say this to him:	NA
mn58:3.13	‘Then, sir, why exactly did you declare of Devadatta:	NA
mn58:3.14	“Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable”?	Mahāvīra is quoting from the Buddha at [an8.7:1.7]() = [pli-tv-kd17:4.7.1](). This dates this sutta to the last years of the Buddha’s life, after the rebellion of Devadatta and the ascension of Ajātasattu, and shortly before Mahāvīra’s passing.
mn58:3.15	Devadatta was angry and upset with what you said.’	NA
mn58:3.16	When you put this dilemma to him, the Buddha won’t be able to either spit it out or swallow it down.	NA
mn58:3.17	He’ll be like a man with an iron cross stuck in his throat, unable to either spit it out or swallow it down.”	NA
mn58:3.18	NA	NA
mn58:4.1	“Yes, sir,” replied Abhaya. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Jain Ñātika, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.	NA
mn58:4.2	Then he looked up at the sun and thought,	NA
mn58:4.3	“It’s too late to refute the Buddha’s doctrine today.	NA
mn58:4.4	I shall refute his doctrine in my own home tomorrow.” He said to the Buddha,	NA
mn58:4.5	“Sir, may the Buddha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me, together with three other monks.”	NA
mn58:4.6	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
mn58:5.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Abhaya got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	NA
mn58:5.2	Then when the night had passed, the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Abhaya’s home, and sat down on the seat spread out.	NA
mn58:5.3	Then Abhaya served and satisfied the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	NA
mn58:5.4	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Abhaya took a low seat, sat to one side,	NA
mn58:6.1	and said to him,	NA
mn58:6.2	“Sir, may the Realized One utter speech that is disliked by others?”	NA
mn58:6.3	“This matter is not categorical, prince.”	The Buddha solves the dilemma by avoiding a categorical statement, thus beating the Jains at their own game. Unlike the Jains, the Buddha did not advocate giving non-categorical answers as a general principle; different questions require different approaches when answering ([an3.67](), [mn136:5.3]()). Cf. [an3.78]() and [an3.21:9.1]().
mn58:6.4	“Then the Jains have lost in this, sir.”	NA
mn58:6.5	“But prince, why do you say that	NA
mn58:6.6	the Jains have lost in this?”	NA
mn58:6.7	Then Abhaya told the Buddha all that had happened.	NA
mn58:6.8	NA	NA
mn58:6.9	NA	NA
mn58:6.10	NA	NA
mn58:6.11	NA	NA
mn58:6.12	NA	NA
mn58:6.13	NA	NA
mn58:6.14	NA	NA
mn58:6.15	NA	NA
mn58:6.16	NA	NA
mn58:6.17	NA	NA
mn58:6.18	NA	NA
mn58:6.19	NA	NA
mn58:6.20	NA	NA
mn58:6.21	NA	NA
mn58:6.22	NA	NA
mn58:6.23	NA	NA
mn58:6.24	NA	NA
mn58:6.25	NA	NA
mn58:6.26	NA	NA
mn58:7.1	Now at that time a little baby boy was sitting in Prince Abhaya’s lap.	NA
mn58:7.2	Then the Buddha said to Abhaya,	NA
mn58:7.3	“What do you think, prince?	NA
mn58:7.4	If—because of your negligence or his nursemaid’s negligence—your boy were to put a stick or stone in his mouth, what would you do to him?”	NA
mn58:7.5	“I’d try to take it out, sir.	NA
mn58:7.6	If that didn’t work, I’d cradle his head with my left hand and take it out using a hooked finger of my right hand, even if it drew blood.	NA
mn58:7.7	Why is that?	NA
mn58:7.8	Because I have sympathy for the boy, sir.”	NA
mn58:8.1	“In the same way, prince, the Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be untrue, false, and pointless, and which is disliked by others.	NA
mn58:8.2	The Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be true and correct, but which is harmful and disliked by others.	NA
mn58:8.3	The Realized One knows the right time to speak so as to explain what he knows to be true, correct, and beneficial, but which is disliked by others.	For the phrase “speak so as to explain” (_vācāya veyyākaraṇāya_) I follow the commentary.
mn58:8.4	The Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be untrue, false, and pointless, but which is liked by others.	NA
mn58:8.5	The Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be true and correct, but which is harmful, even if it is liked by others.	NA
mn58:8.6	The Realized One knows the right time to speak so as to explain what he knows to be true, correct, and beneficial, and which is liked by others.	NA
mn58:8.7	Why is that?	NA
mn58:8.8	Because the Realized One has sympathy for sentient beings.”	Here the optatives are gone and the Buddha states his views directly, showing that just because a question is not “categorical” does not mean that it cannot be given a definitive answer. However, it cannot be answered all-at-once or “categorically”, but must be broken into parts by “analysis” before answering.
mn58:9.1	“Sir, there are clever aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics who come to see you with a question already planned.	NA
mn58:9.2	Do you think beforehand that if they ask you like this, you’ll answer like that, or does the answer just strike you on the spot?”	NA
mn58:10.1	“Well then, prince, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.	NA
mn58:10.2	What do you think, prince?	NA
mn58:10.3	Are you skilled in the various parts of a chariot?”	NA
mn58:10.4	“I am, sir.”	NA
mn58:10.5	“What do you think, prince?	NA
mn58:10.6	When they come to you and ask:	NA
mn58:10.7	‘What’s the name of this chariot part?’	NA
mn58:10.8	Do you think beforehand that if they ask you like this, you’ll answer like that, or does the answer appear to you on the spot?”	NA
mn58:10.9	“Sir, I’m well-known as a charioteer skilled in a chariot’s parts.	NA
mn58:10.10	All the major and minor parts are well-known to me.	NA
mn58:10.11	The answer just appears to me on the spot.”	NA
mn58:11.1	“In the same way, when clever aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics come to see me with a question already planned, the answer just strikes me on the spot.	NA
mn58:11.2	Why is that?	NA
mn58:11.3	Because the Realized One has clearly comprehended the principle of the teachings, so that the answer just strikes him on the spot.”	NA
mn58:12.1	When he had spoken, Prince Abhaya said to the Buddha,	NA
mn58:12.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent! …	NA
mn58:12.3	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	NA
mn59:0.1	Middle Discourses 59	NA
mn59:0.2	The Many Kinds of Feeling	NA
mn59:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn59:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn59:1.3	Then the chamberlain Pañcakaṅga went up to Venerable Udāyī, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	Pañcakaṅga features as a prominent devotee of the Buddha in [mn78](), [mn127](), and in a parallel to the current sutta at [sn36.19](). As _thapati_ (“chamberlain”) he was the ranking official under Pasenadi. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.4.4.17–18 tells us that royal authority goes from the king, to the king’s brother, to the _thapati_, to the village head. Similarly, Atharva Veda 2.32.4a and 5.23.11a mention the _thapati_ directly after the king. [sn55.6:15.1]() shows the _thapati_ was trusted with the most intimate and sensitive duties of the court. Elsewhere we learn that they shared the meal and carriage with the king, accompanying him on military campaigns ([mn89:18.1]()), while [sn55.6:1.4]() shows them engaged in governing the provinces. Thus the _thapati_ was the highest non-royal official in the court, entrusted with governing, advising, and security of the household. | There are several individuals called Udāyī, and it is not possible to distinguish them all.
mn59:1.4	“Sir, how many feelings has the Buddha spoken of?”	NA
mn59:1.5	“Chamberlain, the Buddha has spoken of three feelings:	NA
mn59:1.6	pleasant, painful, and neutral.	NA
mn59:1.7	The Buddha has spoken of these three feelings.”	NA
mn59:1.8	When he said this, Pañcakaṅga said to Udāyī,	NA
mn59:1.9	“Sir, Udāyī, the Buddha hasn’t spoken of three feelings.	NA
mn59:1.10	He’s spoken of two feelings:	NA
mn59:1.11	pleasant and painful.	NA
mn59:1.12	The Buddha said that neutral feeling is included as a peaceful and subtle kind of pleasure.”	NA
mn59:2.1	For a second time, Udāyī said to Pañcakaṅga,	NA
mn59:2.2	“The Buddha hasn’t spoken of two feelings,	NA
mn59:2.3	he’s spoken of three.”	NA
mn59:2.4	NA	NA
mn59:2.5	NA	NA
mn59:2.6	For a second time, Pañcakaṅga said to Udāyī,	NA
mn59:2.7	“The Buddha hasn’t spoken of three feelings,	NA
mn59:2.8	he’s spoken of two.”	NA
mn59:2.9	NA	NA
mn59:2.10	NA	NA
mn59:3.1	And for a third time, Udāyī said to Pañcakaṅga,	NA
mn59:3.2	“The Buddha hasn’t spoken of two feelings,	NA
mn59:3.3	he’s spoken of three.”	NA
mn59:3.4	NA	NA
mn59:3.5	NA	NA
mn59:3.6	And for a third time, Pañcakaṅga said to Udāyī,	NA
mn59:3.7	“The Buddha hasn’t spoken of three feelings,	NA
mn59:3.8	he’s spoken of two.”	NA
mn59:3.9	NA	NA
mn59:3.10	NA	NA
mn59:3.11	But neither was able to persuade the other.	NA
mn59:4.1	Venerable Ānanda heard this discussion between Udāyī and Pañcakaṅga.	NA
mn59:4.2	Then he went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,	NA
mn59:4.3	and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed.	NA
mn59:4.4	When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,	NA

mn60:1.1	So I have heard.	This sutta subverts the imagery of gambling by reasoning towards logical certitude in a world of apparently random chances. Gambling was a major feature of Vedic culture, with the moving confession of Rig Veda 10.34 recounting the thrill and loss of the game. The gods were invoked to ensure success (Atharvaveda 7.109). Even kings bowed to the dice (Rig Veda 10.34.8), so that the Rājasūya consecration ceremony is secured with a (loaded) game of dice (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.4.4.6, 23). Numerous tales of kings losing their realms at dice, most notably Yudhiṣṭhira in the Mahābhārata, show that the power and danger of gambling was not merely symbolic.
mn60:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Sālā.	The same framing narrative recurs at [mn41](), where the topic of rebirth is also at stake.
mn60:2.1	The brahmins and householders of Sālā heard:	NA
mn60:2.2	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Sālā, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	NA
mn60:2.3	He has this good reputation:	NA
mn60:2.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
mn60:2.5	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	NA
mn60:2.6	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
mn60:2.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	NA
mn60:3.1	Then the brahmins and householders of Sālā went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. The Buddha said to them:	NA
mn60:4.1	“So, householders, is there any teacher you’re happy with, in whom you have acquired grounded faith?”	The Brahmanical community was in a period of questioning and transition, with multiple different perspectives offered by both Brahmins and ascetics.
mn60:4.2	“No, sir.”	NA
mn60:4.3	“Since you haven’t found a teacher you’re happy with, you should undertake and implement this unfailing teaching.	While the contextual sense of the key term _apaṇṇaka_ (“unfailing”) is clear, the etymology has proven a puzzle. I propose that it is a gambling term, and _paṇṇa_ appears as a form of the number five. While a set of four dice was “perfect”, the fifth “losing” (_kali_) die was all-powerful, since just one extra die meant you lose everything (Rig Veda 10.34.2, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.4.4.6). _Apaṇṇaka_ is therefore literally a “set without a fifth” and metaphorically “without fail”.
mn60:4.4	For when the unfailing teaching is undertaken, it will be for your lasting welfare and happiness.	NA
mn60:4.5	And what is the unfailing teaching?	NA
mn60:5.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	NA
mn60:5.2	‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’	At [dn2:23.2]() this is presented as the moral view of Ajita of the Hair Blanket, who justifies it with a materialist theory.
mn60:6.1	And there are some ascetics and brahmins whose doctrine directly contradicts this.	NA
mn60:6.2	They say:	NA
mn60:6.3	‘There is meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There are such things as mother and father, and beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’	The positive side is of course the Buddha’s view.
mn60:6.4	What do you think, householders?	NA
mn60:6.5	Don’t these doctrines directly contradict each other?”	NA
mn60:6.6	“Yes, sir.”	NA
mn60:7.1	“Since this is so, consider those ascetics and brahmins whose view is that	NA
mn60:7.2	there’s no meaning in giving, etc.	NA
mn60:7.3	You can expect that they will reject good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and undertake and implement bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind.	NA
mn60:7.4	Why is that?	NA
mn60:7.5	Because those ascetics and brahmins don’t see that unskillful qualities are full of drawbacks, sordidness, and corruption, or that skillful qualities have the benefit and cleansing power of renunciation.	NA
mn60:8.1	Moreover, since there actually is another world, their view that there is no other world is wrong view.	NA
mn60:8.2	Since there actually is another world, their thought that there is no other world is wrong thought.	NA
mn60:8.3	Since there actually is another world, their speech that there is no other world is wrong speech.	NA
mn60:8.4	Since there actually is another world, in saying that there is no other world they contradict those perfected ones who know the other world.	NA
mn60:8.5	Since there actually is another world, in convincing another that there is no other world they are convincing them to accept an untrue teaching.	NA
mn60:8.6	And on account of that they glorify themselves and put others down.	NA
mn60:8.7	So they give up their former ethical conduct and are established in unethical conduct.	NA
mn60:8.8	And that is how these many bad, unskillful qualities come to be with wrong view as condition—wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, contradicting the noble ones, convincing others to accept untrue teachings, and glorifying oneself and putting others down.	NA
mn60:9.1	A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:	NA
mn60:9.2	‘If there is no other world, when this individual’s body breaks up they will keep themselves safe.	Given that they no longer exist, how are they safe? Bodhi’s “will have made himself safe” is unlikely, as it is future perfect, a rare sense that requires the past participle. Anyway he hasn’t “made himself” anything, he just happen to live in a world without moral consequences. Horner notes the problem without offering a solution, there are no parallels, and commentaries are silent. I think the text is corrupt.
mn60:9.3	And if there is another world, when their body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	NA
mn60:9.4	But let us grant that those who say that there is no other world are correct.	The syntax of this sentence is tricky. _Kāmaṁ_ is “willingly”, which together with _hotu_ conveys the sense “let us grant …”. _Māhu_ resolves to _mā ahu_, a simple negation rather than a prohibition. For _kāmaṁ_ with _mā_ and imperative, compare [sn11.4:7.1]().
mn60:9.5	Regardless, that individual is still criticized by sensible people in this very life as being an immoral individual of wrong view, a nihilist.’	“Nihilist” is _natthikavāda_, “one whose doctrine is that there is nothing”. While this view is discussed many times in the suttas, the word _natthikavāda_ is elsewhere only applied to a specific pair of persons, Vassa and Bhañña of Ukkalā ([mn117:38.1](), [sn22.62:13.2](), [an4.30:8.2]()).
mn60:9.6	But if there really is another world, they hold a losing hand on both counts.	“Losing hand” is _kaliggāha_.
mn60:9.7	For they are criticized by sensible people in this very life, and when their body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	NA
mn60:9.8	They have wrongly undertaken this unfailing teaching in such a way that it encompasses the positive outcomes of one side only, leaving out the skillful premise.	It is difficult to choose between “skillful” and “wholesome” as renderings for _kusala_. “Skillful” sticks closer to the root sense, while “wholesome” is more idiomatic. But the context here well illustrates that the root sense is still alive in the language, as the “skillful” option is that which wisely aligns cause and effect with one’s own well-being.
mn60:10.1	Since this is so, consider those ascetics and brahmins whose view is that	NA
mn60:10.2	there is meaning in giving, etc.	NA
mn60:10.3	You can expect that they will reject bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and undertake and implement good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind.	NA

mn60:12.1	A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:	NA

mn60:12.3	But let us grant that those who say that there is no other world are correct.	NA
mn60:12.4	Regardless, that individual is still praised by sensible people in this very life as being a moral individual of right view, who affirms a positive teaching.’	NA
mn60:12.5	So if there really is another world, they hold a perfect hand on both counts.	“Perfect hand” (_kaṭaggaha_) is an expression from the classical Vedic game of chance. The details are obscure and would have changed over time, but it seems that a large quantity of _vibhītaka_ (“bedda”) nuts were cast in a hollow, from which players took a handful. If the number of nuts was divisible by four, it was said to be a “perfect” (_kaṭa_; see Rig Veda 1.132.1, etc.) “hand” (_gāha_). | _Apaṇṇaka_ and _kaṭaggāha_ are also connected at [sn42.13:23.5](); compare the “gem” thrown like a loaded die at [an3.118:4.6]() and [an10.217:17.1](). Good rebirth is further compared to a “perfect hand” at [mn129:49.1](). And at [ja1:2.4](), a wise person would “take up” (_gaṇhe_) what is unfailing, namely a winning hand.
mn60:12.6	For they are praised by sensible people in this very life, and when their body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	NA
mn60:12.7	They have rightly undertaken this unfailing teaching in such a way that it encompasses the positive outcomes of both sides, leaving out the unskillful premise.	NA
mn60:13.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	NA
mn60:13.2	‘The one who acts does nothing wrong when they punish, mutilate, torture, aggrieve, oppress, intimidate, or when they encourage others to do the same. They do nothing wrong when they kill, steal, break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, commit adultery, and lie.	At [dn2:17.2](), this denial of the doctrine of kamma is attributed to Pūraṇa Kassapa. He may have subscribed to hard determinism, so that we have no choice in what we do. He may also have believed that we should keep moral rules as a social contract, but that this had no effect on the afterlife. | In such contexts, _kar-_ means “punish, inflict” ([mn129:29.2]()).

mn60:29.2	‘There are no totally formless states of meditation.’	The four “formless states” (_āruppā_) are attained with the “total” (_sabbaso_) surmounting of form. While the previous views characterize prominent ascetic movements, the final view relates to the formless meditations, the cardinal teaching of the contemplative movement of the Kosalan brahmins, represented by such figures as Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta ([mn36:14.9]()) or the sixteen brahmins of the Pārāyanavagga ([snp5.1]() ff.). The Buddha elevates his teaching by directly addressing the highest and best of contemporary Brahmanical practices.

It can be broader than that, however, as with the Upaniṣadic doctrine of eternal unity of the contingent personal self with the absolute universal divinity.

mn61:0.2	Advice to Rāhula at Ambalaṭṭhika	NA
mn61:1.1	So I have heard.	The Buddha teaches his son Rāhula the dangers of lying, using gestures to illustrate his point. The simple subject matter and child-friendly methods support the commentary’s claim that this was when Rāhula was still a boy, soon after he ordained ([pli-tv-kd1:54.1.1]()). | This sutta is among those recommended for study by the Saṅgha by King Ashoka in Minor Rock Edict No. 3, the Calcutta-Bairāṭ rock inscription from Viratnagar in Rajasthan. There it is described as “the exhortation to Rāhula spoken by the Lord Buddha concerning falsehood” (_laghulo-vāde musā-vādaṁ adhigicya bhagavatā budhena bhāsite_).
mn61:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
mn61:2.1	Now at that time Venerable Rāhula was staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā.	The commentary says this is a building next to the Bamboo Grove rather than the site of the royal rest-house mentioned at [dn1:1.2.1]().
mn61:2.2	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to Ambalaṭṭhika to see Venerable Rāhula.	NA
mn61:2.3	Rāhula saw the Buddha coming off in the distance.	NA
mn61:2.4	He spread out a seat and placed water for washing the feet.	NA
mn61:2.5	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,	NA
mn61:2.6	and washed his feet.	NA
mn61:2.7	Rāhula bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.	NA
mn61:3.1	Then the Buddha, leaving a little water in the pot, addressed Rāhula,	NA
mn61:3.2	“Rāhula, do you see this little bit of water left in the pot?”	NA
mn61:3.3	“Yes, sir.”	NA
mn61:3.4	“That’s how little of the ascetic’s nature is left in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.”	NA
mn61:4.1	Then the Buddha, tossing away what little water was left in the pot, said to Rāhula,	NA
mn61:4.2	“Do you see this little bit of water that was tossed away?”	NA
mn61:4.3	“Yes, sir.”	NA
mn61:4.4	“That’s how the ascetic’s nature is tossed away in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.”	NA
mn61:5.1	Then the Buddha, turning the pot upside down, said to Rāhula,	NA
mn61:5.2	“Do you see how this pot is turned upside down?”	NA
mn61:5.3	“Yes, sir.”	NA
mn61:5.4	“That’s how the ascetic’s nature is turned upside down in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.”	NA
mn61:6.1	Then the Buddha, turning the pot right side up, said to Rāhula,	NA
mn61:6.2	“Do you see how this pot is vacant and hollow?”	NA
mn61:6.3	“Yes, sir.”	NA
mn61:6.4	“That’s how vacant and hollow the ascetic’s nature is in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.	NA
mn61:7.1	Suppose there was a royal bull elephant with tusks like chariot-poles, able to draw a heavy load, pedigree and battle-hardened. In battle it uses its fore-feet and hind-feet, its fore-quarters and hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, and tail, but it still protects its trunk.	The Buddha shows his mastery of pedagogy. He begins with movement and gestures to illustrate what for a boy could easily have been a dull and abstract teaching. Then he continues to engage the boy’s interest by comparing the mendicant life to war-elephants.
mn61:7.2	So its rider thinks:	NA
mn61:7.3	‘This royal bull elephant still protects its trunk.	NA
mn61:7.4	It has not yet given its life.’	NA
mn61:7.5	But when that royal bull elephant … in battle uses its fore-feet and hind-feet, its fore-quarters and hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, and tail, and its trunk, its rider thinks:	NA
mn61:7.6	‘This royal bull elephant … in battle uses its fore-feet and hind-feet, its fore-quarters and hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, and tail, and its trunk.	NA
mn61:7.7	It has given its life.	NA
mn61:7.8	Now there is nothing that royal bull elephant would not do.’	NA
mn61:7.9	In the same way, when someone is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie, there is no bad deed they would not do, I say.	NA
mn61:7.10	So you should train like this: ‘I will not tell a lie, even for a joke.’	This does not mean that one cannot tell jokes, or even that the jokes cannot speak of things that are not true. To be guilty of lying, one must try to deliberately create a false belief in the other person. If I say, “A monk, a priest, and a rabbi brought a donkey into a bar”, it is obviously not something I expect people to believe. This point is illustrated in the background story for this sutta in the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinayavibhaṅga and Mahāprajñāpāramitopadeśaśāstra, which say that Rāhula had been mischievously telling visitors the Buddha was at the Vulture’s Peak when in reality he was in the Bamboo Grove. In this case, he deliberately created a false belief in order to send people in the wrong direction.
mn61:7.11	NA	NA
mn61:8.1	What do you think, Rāhula?	NA
mn61:8.2	What is the purpose of a mirror?”	Mirrors of polished bronze were the selfies of the day, a vanity of youth ([mn77:33.18]()). They were forbidden for monastics except when ill ([pli-tv-kd15:2.4.1]()).
mn61:8.3	“It’s for checking your reflection, sir.”	NA
mn61:8.4	“In the same way, deeds of body, speech, and mind should be done only after repeated checking.	The Buddha illustrates the abstract concept of introspection with what is perhaps the most fundamental metaphor: the sight of one’s own face. See also Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.7.4 and Kaṭha Upaniṣad 2.3.5.
mn61:9.1	When you want to act with the body, you should check on that same deed:	NA

mn61:9.6	It’s unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result.’ To the best of your ability, Rāhula, you should not do such a deed.	_Sasakkaṁ_ is from _sa_ (“own”) + _sakka_ (“ability”).
mn61:9.7	But if, while checking in this way, you know:	NA
mn61:9.8	‘This act with the body that I want to do doesn’t lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both.	NA

mn61:10.8	‘This act with the body that I am doing doesn’t lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both.	NA
mn61:10.9	It’s skillful, with happiness as its outcome and result.’ Then, Rāhula, you should continue doing such a deed.	NA

mn61:12.1	When you want to act with speech, you should check on that same deed:	The threefold awareness of actions before, during, and after is emphasized in the Vinaya analysis of the rule against deliberate lying ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc1:2.2.2]()).

mn62:0.1	Middle Discourses 62	NA
mn62:0.2	The Longer Advice to Rāhula	NA
mn62:1.1	So I have heard.	Compared to [mn61](), now the Buddha is assigning advanced practices to Rāhula, recommending a diverse range of different meditations. | The unusual structure raises questions as to its historicity, which I will discuss in my final note, having noted relevant details along the way.
mn62:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn62:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	NA
mn62:2.2	And Venerable Rāhula also robed up and followed behind the Buddha.	According to the commentary, Rāhula was now eighteen years old, situating this sutta several years after [mn61]().
mn62:3.1	Then the Buddha looked back at Rāhula and said,	NA
mn62:3.2	“Rāhula, you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’”	NA
mn62:3.3	“Only form, Blessed One? Only form, Holy One?”	The commentary says that the Buddha admonished him because he was admiring his father’s beauty, thinking that he looked similar. See [mn61:8.2](), which similarly implies that vanity was a weakness of Rāhula.
mn62:3.4	“Form, Rāhula, as well as feeling and perception and choices and consciousness.”	NA
mn62:4.1	Then Rāhula thought, “Who would go to the village for alms today after being advised directly by the Buddha?” Turning back, he sat down cross-legged at the root of a certain tree, setting his body straight, and establishing mindfulness in his presence.	He decides to meditate rather than eat for that day.
mn62:5.1	Venerable Sāriputta saw him sitting there,	Rāhula would have still been a novice (_sāmaṇera_) as he was not yet twenty. It was Sāriputta who ordained him ([pli-tv-kd1:54.2.7]()).
mn62:5.2	and addressed him,	NA
mn62:5.3	“Rāhula, develop mindfulness of breathing.	NA
mn62:5.4	When mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial.”	NA
mn62:6.1	Then in the late afternoon, Rāhula came out of retreat, went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	NA
mn62:7.1	“Sir, how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial?”	The Pali text has a striking narrative form. The Buddha encourages Rāhula to contemplate form; then Sāriputta urges him in breath meditation; but when Rāhula asks the Buddha about that, the Buddha ignores him (until much later in the sutta) and instead expands on his instructions on form. The Chinese parallel (EA 17.1 at T ii 581c–582c) paints quite a different picture. Sāriputta does not appear at all, and it is the Buddha who instructs Rāhula when he is meditating, teaching him not just mindfulness of breathing but also the meditations on the ugliness of the body and the divine abidings. Then, when Rāhula approaches him later to ask further about mindfulness of breathing, the Buddha teaches him this right away, omitting entirely the long section on the elements. Both suttas agree on teaching Rāhula a range of meditations, but the Pali implies that he needed to mature his mind with a range of other meditations before attempting mindfulness of breathing, a situation of which Sāriputta was not aware.
mn62:8.1	“Rāhula, the interior earth element is anything internal, pertaining to an individual, that’s hard, solid, and appropriated. This includes:	This largely follows [mn140:14.4]() and [mn28:4.1](), the latter of which was taught by Sāriputta.

mn62:30.3	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn62:30.4	Satisfied, Venerable Rāhula approved what the Buddha said.	The Chinese parallel presents a fuller picture of Rāhula’s progress at this point, saying he went away, developed _jhānas_, and became an arahant, before returning to announce this to the Buddha, who praised him as the foremost of those desiring training. In the Pali, Rāhula’s awakening occurs differently in [mn147](), while he is praised for desiring training at [an1.209:1.1](). | It is not easy to assess the historical authenticity of this sutta. The Chinese version presents a more coherent narrative that may indicate less corruption. Yet it expands the ending, making the sutta a comprehensive account of Rāhula’s progress. The collection from which it stems, the Ekottarikāgama, is the latest and least orthodox of extant Āgama collections, and it could be that it has streamlined a knotty narrative. The Pali, with its abrupt narrative transition and its implication that Sāriputta got his meditation instructions wrong, has more of the randomness of natural dialogue. Yet the fact that the portions extra to the Chinese include not only the person of Sāriputta, but also teachings associated with Sāriputta, is hard to explain as a loss of text. Perhaps both texts have been expanded from a simpler original where the Buddha teaches meditation to his son.
mn63:0.1	Middle Discourses 63	NA
mn63:0.2	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta	NA
mn63:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn63:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn63:2.1	Then as Venerable Māluṅkyaputta was in private retreat this thought came to his mind:	Māluṅkyaputta was, according to Pali commentaries, the son of the lady Māluṅkyā of Kosala. Alternatively, Sanskrit dictionaries give _māluka_ as the name of a people or a mixed caste, although I have not been able to trace any further details. His conversion is not recorded as he appears always as a monk in Pali. This discourse and [mn64]() present him as somewhat of a fool, but it seems that he persisted, and late in life sought teachings in meditation and ultimately realized arahantship, of which we have two different accounts ([an4.257](), [sn35.95]()). The latter contains an extensive set of verses attributed to him, which are repeated at [thag16.5](). A second set of his verses are at [thag6.5]().
mn63:2.2	“There are several convictions that the Buddha has left undeclared; he has set them aside and refused to comment on them.	NA
mn63:2.3	For example: the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a realized one still exists, or no longer exists, or both still exists and no longer exists, or neither still exists nor no longer exists.	NA
mn63:2.4	The Buddha does not explain these points to me.	NA
mn63:2.5	I don’t endorse that, and do not accept it.	NA
mn63:2.6	I’ll go to him and ask him about this.	NA

mn63:5.8	But the man would say:	NA
mn63:5.9	‘I won’t extract this arrow as long as I don’t know whether the man who wounded me was an aristocrat, a brahmin, a peasant, or a menial.’	“Extract this arrow”(_imaṁ sallaṁ āharissāmi_): in his Ayurvedic text Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṁhitā, Vāgbhaṭa devotes the entirety of chapter 1.28 to this procedure (_śalyāharaṇavidhi_).
mn63:5.10	He’d say:	NA

mn63:5.19	I won’t extract this arrow as long as I don’t know whether the bow that wounded me was straight or recurved;	It would appear that _dhanu_ is the general word for “bow”, of which _cāpa_ and _kodaṇḍa_ are specialized varieties. These bows appear with others in a list of weapons at Arthaśāstra 2.18.8. While it is not clear what these were exactly, _kodaṇḍa_ is sometimes used for “eyebrows”, suggesting that the bow of that name was of the recurve type favored by horsemen, and the _cāpa_ by contrast may have been straight.

mn63:6.1	It’s not true that if there were the view ‘the cosmos is eternal’ there would be the living of the spiritual life.	This is a double conditional, the sense being that if the pre-condition is met (locative absolute), the subsequent act would follow (conditional). The form echoes Māluṅkyaputta’s conditions, which is why the syntax here is more convoluted than in similar cases elsewhere.
mn63:6.2	It’s not true that if there were the view ‘the cosmos is not eternal’ there would be the living of the spiritual life.	NA
mn63:6.3	When there is the view that the cosmos is eternal or that the cosmos is not eternal, there is rebirth, there is old age, there is death, and there is sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.	NA

mn63:8.2	Because they aren’t beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.	NA
mn63:8.3	That’s why I haven’t declared them.	NA

mn64:0.2	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya	NA
mn64:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn64:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn64:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn64:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA

mn64:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn64:2.1	“Mendicants, do you remember the five lower fetters taught by me?”	NA

mn64:2.3	“Sir, I remember them.”	NA
mn64:2.4	“But how do you remember them?”	NA
mn64:2.5	“I remember the lower fetters taught by the Buddha as follows: substantialist view,	As at [sn45.179](), [an10.13](), etc. They are “lower fetters” because they bind sentient beings to rebirth in lower planes.

mn64:2.10	That’s how I remember the five lower fetters taught by the Buddha.”	NA
mn64:3.1	“Who on earth do you remember being taught the five lower fetters in that way?	Given that Māluṅkyaputta got the answer right, it is not clear why the Buddha adopted the reproving tone that he would normally use in response to a dangerously mistaken view ([mn22:6.1]()). The commentary explains that he had the view that fetters were only present when active, hence the Buddha’s simile to follow. Regardless, as compared to [mn63](), Māluṅkyaputta is making progress, as he gives a serious answer to an important question and appears to no longer be on the verge of disrobing.
mn64:3.2	Wouldn’t the wanderers of other religions fault you using the simile of the infant?	NA
mn64:3.3	For a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘substantial reality’, so how could substantialist view possibly arise in them?	NA

mn64:4.1	When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,	NA
mn64:4.2	“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!	NA
mn64:4.3	May the Buddha teach the five lower fetters. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	NA
mn64:4.4	“Well then, Ānanda, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn64:4.5	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA

mn64:8.14	should be regarded as being like that strong person.	NA
mn64:9.1	And what, Ānanda, is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters?	NA
mn64:9.2	It’s when a mendicant—due to the seclusion from attachments, the giving up of unskillful qualities, and the complete settling of physical discomforts—quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	The opening clause is a unique addition to the standard _jhāna_ formula. | In later texts, “seclusion from attachments” (_upadhiviveka_) signified arahantship ([mnd14:10.1]()), but here it must have a less exalted sense. Perhaps it refers to leaving behind the material things to which one is attached ([sn1.2]()). | For “bodily discomfort”, see [mn127:16.7]().
mn64:9.3	They contemplate the phenomena there—included in form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness—as impermanent, as suffering, as diseased, as a boil, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as falling apart, as empty, as not-self.	This shows the development of insight based directly on the absorption.
mn64:9.4	They turn their mind away from those things,	NA
mn64:9.5	and apply it to the element free of death:	NA
mn64:9.6	‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.’	NA
mn64:9.7	Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.	NA
mn64:9.8	If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.	NA
mn64:9.9	This is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.	NA
mn64:10-12.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption …	NA
mn64:10-12.2	third absorption …	NA
mn64:10-12.3	fourth absorption.	NA
mn64:10-12.4	They contemplate the phenomena there—included in form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness—as impermanent …	NA
mn64:10-12.5	They turn their mind away from those things …	NA
mn64:10-12.6	If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, they’re reborn spontaneously … and are not liable to return from that world.	NA
mn64:10-12.7	This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.	NA
mn64:13.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.	NA
mn64:13.2	They contemplate the phenomena there—included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness—as impermanent …	NA
mn64:13.3	They turn their mind away from those things …	NA
mn64:13.4	If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, they’re reborn spontaneously … and are not liable to return from that world.	NA
mn64:13.5	This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.	NA
mn64:14.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness.	NA
mn64:14.2	They contemplate the phenomena there—included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness—as impermanent …	NA
mn64:14.3	They turn their mind away from those things …	NA
mn64:14.4	If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, they’re reborn spontaneously … and are not liable to return from that world.	NA
mn64:14.5	This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.	NA
mn64:15.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.	NA
mn64:15.2	They contemplate the phenomena there—included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness—as impermanent …	NA
mn64:15.3	They turn their mind away from those things …	NA
mn64:15.4	If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, they’re reborn spontaneously … and are not liable to return from that world.	NA
mn64:15.5	This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.”	The final formless attainment is omitted as at [mn52:14.7]().
mn64:16.1	“Sir, if this is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters, how come some mendicants here are released in heart while others are released by wisdom?”	“Released in heart“ and “released by wisdom” indicate an emphasis on either immersion or wisdom respectively.
mn64:16.2	“In that case, I say it is the diversity of their faculties.”	The Buddha makes the same point at [sn48.13]() and [sn48:16](). For more on the “diversity of faculties”, see [mn66:14.6]().
mn64:16.3	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn64:16.4	Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn65:0.1	Middle Discourses 65	NA
mn65:0.2	With Bhaddāli	NA
mn65:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn65:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn65:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn65:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn65:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn65:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn65:2.1	“Mendicants, I eat my food in one sitting per day.	The practice of eating one meal a day is encouraged but not required by Vinaya. At [mn21:7.4]() the Buddha reminisced about the days when he merely needed to mention it and monks would follow suit. | In the related story at [mn70:1.3](), the Buddha encouraged not eating at night, to which monks also objected, occasioning the laying down of a Vinaya rule ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc37]()), although at least some of the monks later came to regret their objections, recognizing that the Buddha had acted for their welfare ([mn66:6.4]()).
mn65:2.2	Doing so, I find that I’m healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	NA
mn65:2.3	You too should eat your food in one sitting per day.	NA
mn65:2.4	Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”	NA
mn65:3.1	When he said this, Venerable Bhaddāli said to the Buddha,	Bhaddāli does not appear elsewhere in early texts.
mn65:3.2	“Sir, I’m not going to try to eat my food in one sitting per day.	NA
mn65:3.3	For when eating once a day I might feel remorse and regret.”	The commentary says that he feared he would not be able to sustain his monkhood. Chinese parallels at this point indicate that he feared discomfort (EA 49.7 at T ii 800b29, T 1425 at T xxii 359b14).
mn65:4.1	“Well then, Bhaddāli, eat one part of the meal in the place where you’re invited, and bring the rest back to eat.	NA
mn65:4.2	Eating this way, too, you will sustain yourself.”	_Ekāsano_ here in Mahāsaṅgīti edition appears superfluous, as it is missing in most editions.
mn65:4.3	“Sir, I’m not going to try to eat that way, either.	NA
mn65:4.4	For when eating that way I might also feel remorse and regret.”	NA
mn65:4.5	Then, as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it, Bhaddāli announced he would not try to keep it.	NA
mn65:4.6	Then for the whole of that three months Bhaddāli would not see the Buddha face to face, as happens when someone doesn’t fulfill the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.	“Would not see the Buddha face to face” is a loose rendering of _na bhagavato sammukhībhāvaṁ adāsi_. The idiom can be captured more literally at [dn3:2.6.2](); when King Pasenadi meets Pokkharasāti, he does not “grant him an audience face to face” (_tassa … sammukhībhāvampi na dadāti_) but only behind a curtain.
mn65:5.1	At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that	NA
mn65:5.2	when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering.	NA
mn65:6.1	Then Bhaddāli went up to those mendicants, and exchanged greetings with them.	NA
mn65:6.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The mendicants said to Bhaddāli,	NA
mn65:6.3	“Reverend Bhaddāli, this robe is being made for the Buddha.	NA
mn65:6.4	When it’s finished and the three months of the rains residence have passed the Buddha will set out wandering.	NA
mn65:6.5	Come on, Bhaddāli, learn your lesson. Don’t make it hard for yourself later on.”	NA
mn65:7.1	“Yes, reverends,” Bhaddāli replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
mn65:7.2	“I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me that, as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it, I announced I would not try to keep it.	NA

mn65:32.12	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn65:33.1	“Suppose a deft horse trainer were to obtain a fine thoroughbred. First of all he’d make it get used to wearing the bit.	NA
mn65:33.2	Because it has not done this before, it still resorts to some twists, ducks, and dodges.	NA
mn65:33.3	But with regular and gradual practice its bad behavior is extinguished.	For the phrase _tasmiṁ ṭhāne parinibbāyati_ (“its bad behavior is extinguished”, literally “it is extinguished regarding that state”) I follow the commentary, which specifies that _tasmiṁ ṭhāne_ refers to the twists and dodges that cease rather than the good habits that are developed.
mn65:33.4	When it has done this, the horse trainer next makes it get used to wearing the harness.	NA
mn65:33.5	Because it has not done this before, it still resorts to some twists, ducks, and dodges.	NA
mn65:33.6	But with regular and gradual practice its bad behavior is extinguished.	NA
mn65:33.7	When it has done this, the horse trainer next makes it get used to walking in procession, circling, prancing, galloping, charging, the protocols and traditions of court, and in the very best speed, fleetness, and camaraderie.	_Rājaguṇe_ occurs in [mil5.1.4](), where it distinguishes royal officials from ordinary ones. I take it and _rājavaṁse_ to refer to “the protocols and traditions of court” rather than “kingly qualities”.
mn65:33.8	Because it has not done this before, it still resorts to some twists, ducks, and dodges.	NA
mn65:33.9	But with regular and gradual practice its bad behavior is extinguished.	NA
mn65:33.10	When it has done this, the horse trainer next rewards it with a grooming and a rub down.	NA
mn65:33.11	A fine royal thoroughbred with these ten factors is worthy of a king, fit to serve a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship.	NA
mn65:34.1	In the same way, a mendicant with ten qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.	NA
mn65:34.2	What ten?	NA
mn65:34.3	It’s when a mendicant has an adept’s right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right immersion, right knowledge, and right freedom.	NA
mn65:34.4	A mendicant with these ten qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”	NA
mn65:34.5	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn65:34.6	Satisfied, Venerable Bhaddāli approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn66:0.1	Middle Discourses 66	NA
mn66:0.2	The Simile of the Quail	NA
mn66:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn66:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅguttarāpans, near the town of theirs named Āpaṇa.	NA
mn66:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Āpaṇa for alms.	NA
mn66:2.2	He wandered for alms in Āpaṇa. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to a certain forest grove for the day’s meditation.	NA
mn66:2.3	Having plunged deep into it, he sat at the root of a certain tree to meditate.	NA
mn66:3.1	Venerable Udāyī also robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Āpaṇa for alms.	NA
mn66:3.2	He wandered for alms in Āpaṇa. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to that forest grove for the day’s meditation.	NA
mn66:3.3	Having plunged deep into it, he sat at the root of a certain tree to meditate.	NA
mn66:3.4	Then as Venerable Udāyī was in private retreat this thought came to his mind:	NA
mn66:4.1	“The Buddha has rid us of so many things that bring suffering and gifted us so many things that bring happiness!	NA
mn66:4.2	He has rid us of so many unskillful things and gifted us so many skillful things!”	NA
mn66:5.1	Then in the late afternoon, Udāyī came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	NA
mn66:6.1	“Just now, sir, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind:	NA
mn66:6.2	‘The Buddha has rid us of so many things that bring suffering and gifted us so many things that bring happiness!	NA
mn66:6.3	He has rid us of so many unskillful things and gifted us so many skillful things!’	NA
mn66:6.4	For we used to eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day.	This sutta distinguishes the “wrong time of day”, i.e. the afternoon, and the “wrong time of night”, i.e. any time when it is dark. The common expression “eating at night and at the wrong time” ([mn27:13.9]()) thus refers to both these periods. The Vinaya rule defines _vikāla_ for the purpose of this rule to include both afternoon and nighttime ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc37:2.1.5]()), and it is this understanding that prevails in the tradition.
mn66:6.5	But then there came a time when the Buddha addressed the mendicants, saying,	NA
mn66:6.6	‘Please, mendicants, give up that meal at the wrong time of day.’	NA
mn66:6.7	At that, sir, we became sad and upset,	NA
mn66:6.8	‘But these faithful householders give us delicious fresh and cooked foods at the wrong time of day. And the Blessed One tells us to give it up! The Holy One tells us to let it go!’	NA
mn66:6.9	But when we considered our love and respect for the Buddha, and our sense of conscience and prudence, we gave up that meal at the wrong time of day.	NA
mn66:6.10	Then we ate in the evening and the morning.	NA
mn66:6.11	But then there came a time when the Buddha addressed the mendicants, saying,	NA
mn66:6.12	‘Please, mendicants, give up that meal at the wrong time of night.’	Recorded at [mn70:1.3]().
mn66:6.13	At that, sir, we became sad and upset,	NA
mn66:6.14	‘But that’s considered the more delicious of the two meals. And the Blessed One tells us to give it up! The Holy One tells us to let it go!’	NA
mn66:6.15	Once it so happened that a certain person got some soup during the day. He said,	NA
mn66:6.16	‘Come, let’s set this aside; we’ll enjoy it together this evening.’	NA
mn66:6.17	Nearly all meals are prepared at night, only a few in the day.	NA
mn66:6.18	But when we considered our love and respect for the Buddha, and our sense of conscience and prudence, we gave up that meal at the wrong time of night.	NA
mn66:6.19	In the past, mendicants went wandering for alms in the dark of the night. They walked into a swamp, or fell into a sewer, or collided with a thorn bush, or collided with a sleeping cow, or encountered youths escaping a crime or on their way to commit one, or were invited by a female to commit a lewd act.	“Youths escaping a crime or on their way to commit one” (_katakammehipi akatakammehipi_) follows the commentary. See also [an5.77:5.3]().
mn66:6.20	Once it so happened that I was wandering for alms in the dark of the night.	NA
mn66:6.21	A woman washing a pot saw me by a flash of lightning.	NA
mn66:6.22	Startled, she cried out,	NA
mn66:6.23	‘Woe is me! It’s a damn goblin!’	Goblins (_pisāca_) and other fiends roamed freely at night, kept at bay only by means of potent spells (eg. Rig Veda 1.133.5a, Atharva Veda 1.16, 5.29, 6.32, 8.6). | This interjection is found at [ja525:2.1](), [ja547:62.3](), and [pli-tv-kd15:10.2.4](). In all cases read _abhuṁ me_; also accept the Vinaya reading _pisāco vatāyan_. Rig Vedic _abhva_ means “formless, void”, while in Atharva Veda 4.17.5 and 7.23.1 it describes a fiend who is to be banished.
mn66:6.24	When she said this, I said to her,	NA
mn66:6.25	‘Sister, I am no goblin.	NA
mn66:6.26	I’m a mendicant waiting for alms.’	NA
mn66:6.27	‘Die, mendicant’s father! Die, mendicant’s mother!	_Mārī_ is obscure, but the Chinese parallel is  framed as a curse, which makes sense for the Pali too (MA 192 at T i 741b9). Agni Purāna 137 provides a _mahāmārī_ spell for bringing death. | _Ātu_ is explained in the commentary as “father”. The Chinese parallel agrees that both parents are meant. | For the uttering of a curse upon the relatives of the cursed, see Atharva Veda 2.32.4 (_hatamātā_), 5.29.6.

mn66:14.3	They tolerate them and don’t give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them.	NA
mn66:14.4	I call this person ‘fettered’, not ‘detached’.	NA
mn66:14.5	Why is that?	NA
mn66:14.6	Because I understand the diversity of faculties as it applies to this person.	“Diversity of faculties” refers to the differing capabilities of individuals, so _imasmiṁ puggale_ must be locative of reference.
mn66:15.1	Take another person practicing to give up and let go of attachments.	NA

mn66:16.1	Take another person practicing to give up and let go of attachments.	NA
mn66:16.2	As they do so, memories and thoughts connected with attachments beset them every so often, due to the loss of mindfulness.	NA
mn66:16.3	Slowly mindfulness arises,	NA

mn66:18.1	Udāyī, these are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	NA
mn66:18.2	What five?	NA
mn66:18.3	Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	NA

mn66:18.8	These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	NA
mn66:19.1	The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasure—a filthy, ordinary, ignoble pleasure. Such pleasure should not be cultivated or developed, but should be feared, I say.	NA

mn66:20.2	second absorption …	NA

mn66:21.1	This is called the pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening. Such pleasure should be cultivated and developed, and should not be feared, I say.	NA
mn66:22.1	Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption.	NA
mn66:22.2	This belongs to the perturbable, I say.	NA

mn66:23.2	This belongs to the perturbable, I say.	NA
mn66:23.3	And what there belongs to the perturbable?	NA
mn66:23.4	Whatever rapture and bliss has not ceased there is what belongs to the perturbable.	NA
mn66:24.1	Take a mendicant who, with the fading away of rapture, enters and remains in the third absorption.	NA
mn66:24.2	This belongs to the perturbable.	NA

mn66:26.1	Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption.	NA
mn66:26.2	But this is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.	NA
mn66:26.3	And what goes beyond it?	NA

mn66:29.1	Take a mendicant who, giving up pleasure and pain, enters and remains in the fourth absorption. That goes beyond it.	NA
mn66:29.2	But this too is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.	NA
mn66:29.3	And what goes beyond it?	NA
mn66:30.1	Take a mendicant who, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. That goes beyond it.	NA
mn66:30.2	But this too is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.	NA
mn66:30.3	And what goes beyond it?	NA
mn66:31.1	Take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. That goes beyond it.	NA
mn66:31.2	But this too is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.	NA
mn66:31.3	And what goes beyond it?	NA
mn66:32.1	Take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness. That goes beyond it.	NA
mn66:32.2	But this too is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.	NA
mn66:32.3	And what goes beyond it?	NA
mn66:33.1	Take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. That goes beyond it.	NA
mn66:33.2	But this too is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.	NA
mn66:33.3	And what goes beyond it?	NA
mn66:34.1	Take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. That goes beyond it.	NA
mn66:34.2	So, Udāyī, I even recommend giving up the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	NA
mn66:34.3	Do you see any fetter, large or small, that I don’t recommend giving up?”	NA
mn66:34.4	“No, sir.”	NA
mn66:34.5	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn66:34.6	Satisfied, Venerable Udāyī approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn67:0.1	Middle Discourses 67	NA
mn67:0.2	At Cātumā	NA
mn67:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn67:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Cātumā in a myrobalan grove.	Cātumā is a Sakyan town mentioned only here. | The introduction is similar to [ud3.3]().
mn67:2.1	Now at that time five hundred mendicants headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna arrived at Cātumā to see the Buddha.	NA
mn67:2.2	And the visiting mendicants, while exchanging pleasantries with the resident mendicants, preparing their lodgings, and putting away their bowls and robes, made a dreadful racket.	NA
mn67:3.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	NA
mn67:3.2	“Ānanda, who’s making that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”	NA
mn67:3.3	And Ānanda told him what had happened.	NA
mn67:3.4	NA	NA
mn67:4.1	“Well then, Ānanda, in my name tell those mendicants that	NA
mn67:4.2	the teacher summons them.”	NA
mn67:4.3	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. He went to those mendicants and said,	NA
mn67:4.4	“Venerables, the teacher summons you.”	NA
mn67:4.5	“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants. Then they rose from their seats and went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them:	NA
mn67:4.6	“Mendicants, what’s with that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”	NA
mn67:4.7	And they told him what had happened.	NA
mn67:4.8	NA	NA
mn67:5.1	“Go away, mendicants, I dismiss you. You are not to stay in my presence.”	NA
mn67:5.2	“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. They got up from their seats, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. They set their lodgings in order and left, taking their bowls and robes.	NA
mn67:6.1	Now at that time the Sakyans of Cātumā were sitting together at the town hall on some business.	NA
mn67:6.2	Seeing those mendicants coming off in the distance,	NA
mn67:6.3	they went up to them and said,	NA
mn67:6.4	“Hello venerables, where are you going?”	NA
mn67:6.5	“Good sirs, the mendicant Saṅgha has been dismissed by the Buddha.”	NA
mn67:6.6	“Well then, venerables, sit here for an hour. Hopefully we’ll be able to restore the Buddha’s confidence.”	NA
mn67:6.7	“Yes, good sirs,” replied the mendicants.	NA
mn67:7.1	Then the Sakyans of Cātumā went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	NA
mn67:7.2	“May the Buddha be happy with the mendicant Saṅgha!	NA
mn67:7.3	May the Buddha welcome the mendicant Saṅgha!	NA
mn67:7.4	May the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past!	NA
mn67:7.5	There are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training.	NA
mn67:7.6	If they don’t get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apart.	NA
mn67:7.7	If young seedlings don’t get water they may change and fall apart.	NA
mn67:7.8	In the same way, there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. If they don’t get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apart.	NA

mn67:7.13	May the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past!”	NA
mn67:8.1	Then the divinity Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared in front of the Buddha.	NA
mn67:8.2	He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:	NA
mn67:9.1	“May the Buddha be happy with the mendicant Saṅgha!	NA

mn67:10.1	The Sakyans of Cātumā and the divinity Sahampati were able to restore the Buddha’s confidence with the similes of the seedlings and the calf.	NA
mn67:11.1	Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn67:11.2	“Get up, reverends, and pick up your bowls and robes.	NA
mn67:11.3	The Buddha’s confidence has been restored by the Sakyans of Cātumā and the divinity Sahampati with the similes of the seedlings and the calf.”	NA
mn67:12.1	“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants. Then they rose from their seats and, taking their bowls and robes, went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta,	NA
mn67:12.2	“Sāriputta, what did you think when the mendicant Saṅgha was dismissed by me?”	NA
mn67:12.3	“Sir, I thought this:	NA
mn67:12.4	‘The Buddha has dismissed the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
mn67:12.5	Now he will remain passive, dwelling in blissful meditation in this life, and so will we.’”	NA
mn67:12.6	“Hold on, Sāriputta, hold on! Don’t you ever think such a thing again!”	The PTS reading is preferable: _na kho te Sāriputta puna pi evarūpaṁ cittaṁ uppādetabbanti_.
mn67:13.1	Then the Buddha addressed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna,	NA
mn67:13.2	“Moggallāna, what did you think when the mendicant Saṅgha was dismissed by me?”	NA
mn67:13.3	“Sir, I thought this:	NA
mn67:13.4	‘The Buddha has dismissed the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
mn67:13.5	Now he will remain passive, dwelling in blissful meditation in this life. Meanwhile, Venerable Sāriputta and I shall lead the mendicant Saṅgha.’”	NA
mn67:13.6	“Good, good, Moggallāna!	NA
mn67:13.7	For either I should lead the mendicant Saṅgha, or else Sāriputta and Moggallāna.”	NA
mn67:14.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:	NA
mn67:14.2	“Mendicants, when you go into the water you should anticipate four dangers.	Also at [an4.122]().
mn67:14.3	What four?	NA
mn67:14.4	The dangers of waves, gharials, whirlpools, and sharks.	NA
mn67:14.5	These are the four dangers that you should anticipate when you go into the water.	NA
mn67:15.1	In the same way, a person gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in this teaching and training should anticipate four dangers.	NA
mn67:15.2	What four?	NA
mn67:15.3	The dangers of waves, gharials, whirlpools, and sharks.	NA
mn67:16.1	And what, mendicants, is the danger of waves?	Indian literature uses the wave as metaphor for a “surge” of disturbing emotion.
mn67:16.2	It’s when a gentleman has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, thinking:	NA
mn67:16.3	‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.	NA
mn67:16.4	Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’	NA
mn67:16.5	When they’ve gone forth, their spiritual companions advise and instruct them:	NA
mn67:16.6	‘You should go out like this, and come back like that. You should look to the front like this, and to the side like that. You should contract your limbs like this, and extend them like that. This is how you should bear your outer robe, bowl, and robes.’	These activities are elsewhere framed as the practice of “situational awareness” ([mn10:8.1]()).
mn67:16.7	They think:	NA
mn67:16.8	‘Formerly, as laypeople, we advised and instructed others.	When challenged, he uses the plural as a defense mechanism, disguising his personal reaction as an undefined “us”, implicating the Saṅgha as a whole.
mn67:16.9	And now these mendicants—who you’d think were our children or grandchildren—imagine they can advise and instruct us!’	NA

mn67:16.11	This is called a mendicant who resigns the training and returns to a lesser life for fear of the danger of waves.	NA
mn67:16.12	‘Danger of waves’ is a term for anger and distress.	NA
mn67:17.1	And what, mendicants, is the danger of gharials?	The gharial is a large crocodilian of the Ganges. The adult male has a distinctive “pot” (_ghara_) at the tip of its snout, from which it takes its name. The Pali _kumbhīla_ (Sanskrit _kumbhīra_) similarly stems from _kumbha_, “pot”. Gharials can be seen breaking water to swallow fish, their long toothy snouts making them an apt symbol for gluttony. | Referenced by the nun Sumedhā in her verses at [thig16.1:55.3]().
mn67:17.2	It’s when a gentleman has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, thinking:	NA
mn67:17.3	‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.	NA
mn67:17.4	Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’	NA
mn67:17.5	When they’ve gone forth, their spiritual companions advise and instruct them:	NA

mn67:17.7	They think: ‘Formerly, as laypeople, we used to eat, consume, taste, and drink what we wanted, not what we didn’t want.	NA
mn67:17.8	We ate and drank both allowable and unallowable things, at the right time and the wrong time.	NA
mn67:17.9	And these faithful householders give us delicious fresh and cooked foods at the wrong time of day. But these guys imagine they can gag our mouths!’	NA

mn67:18.1	And what, mendicants, is the danger of whirlpools?	_Āvaṭṭa_ means a “whirlpool”, but also to “revert”. Cf. the “return to a lesser life” (_hīnāyāvattati_).
mn67:18.2	It’s when a gentleman has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, thinking:	NA

mn67:19.1	And what, mendicants, is the danger of sharks?	The _susukā_ is said to be a carnivorous fish (_caṇḍamaccha_). The Sanskrit form _śuṣkala_ is said to mean both a species of fish and also “flesh”. The pun appears to be between _susukā_ and _susukāḷakesā_, a stock description of attractive young people with “pristine black hair”.

mn67:20.1	These are the four dangers that a person who gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in this teaching and training should anticipate.”	NA
mn67:20.2	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn67:20.3	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn68:0.1	Middle Discourses 68	NA
mn68:0.2	At Naḷakapāna	NA
mn68:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn68:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans near Naḷakapāna in the grove of flame-of-the-forest trees.	The Buddha is recorded as visiting this grove in two other discourses, which share a common narrative; both deal with the growth of spiritual qualities ([an10.67](), [an10.68]()).
mn68:2.1	Now at that time several very well-known gentlemen had gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness in the Buddha’s name—	This makes it sound like they had gone forth recently, which would date this discourse to the early years of the dispensation.
mn68:2.2	The venerables Anuruddha, Bhaddiya, Kimbila, Bhagu, Koṇḍañña, Revata, Ānanda, and other very well-known gentlemen.	Pali editions vary a little in the exact monks mentioned.
mn68:3.1	Now at that time the Buddha was sitting in the open, surrounded by the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
mn68:3.2	Then the Buddha spoke to the mendicants about those gentlemen:	NA
mn68:3.3	“Mendicants, those gentlemen who have gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness in my name—I trust they’re satisfied with the spiritual life?”	NA
mn68:3.4	When this was said, the mendicants kept silent.	NA
mn68:3.5	For a second and a third time the Buddha asked the same question.	NA
mn68:3.6	NA	NA
mn68:3.7	NA	NA
mn68:3.8	NA	NA
mn68:3.9	NA	NA
mn68:3.10	For a third time, the mendicants kept silent.	NA
mn68:4.1	Then it occurred to the Buddha,	NA
mn68:4.2	“Why don’t I question just those gentlemen?”	Reading _te va_ as in PTS. Here the Buddha switches from addressing the monks as a whole to addressing just Anuruddha and his friends.
mn68:4.3	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Anuruddha,	NA
mn68:4.4	“Anuruddha and friends, I hope you’re satisfied with the spiritual life?”	NA
mn68:4.5	“Indeed, sir, we are satisfied with the spiritual life.”	NA
mn68:5.1	“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!	NA
mn68:5.2	It’s appropriate for gentlemen like yourselves, who have gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, to be satisfied with the spiritual life.	NA
mn68:5.3	Since you’re blessed with youth, in the prime of life, with pristine black hair, you could have enjoyed sensual pleasures; yet you have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn68:5.4	But you didn’t go forth to escape a summons by a king or a summons for a bandit, or because you were in debt or in fear, or in order to make a living.	Also at [sn22.80:6.4]() and [iti91:2.4](). The terms here follow the same sequence as in the Vinaya account of ordination. Generally, ordination should not be given in such cases, but if it is given, those performing it incur an offense of wrong-doing. | Soldiers joined the Sangha to escape military service, so the Buddha said one should not ordain those in service to a king ([pli-tv-kd1:40.1.1]()). | Several rules regarding ordination of criminals were passed, the thrust of which is that wanted outlaws should not be ordained ([pli-tv-kd1:41.1.1]()). | Another man ordained to escape debt ([pli-tv-kd1:46.1.1]()). | “In fear” (_bhayaṭṭa_) is the only item that does not straightforwardly correspond to the Vinaya sequence, where instead the ordination of slaves appears at this point ([pli-tv-kd1:47.1.1]()). But a connection is suggested by the verses of the water-carrier Puṇṇikā, who speaks of living “in fear” of her masters’ abuse and beatings. | Seventeen boys ordained as novices to get a nice livelihood ([pli-tv-kd1:49.1.1]()).
mn68:5.5	Rather, didn’t you go forth thinking: ‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.	NA
mn68:5.6	Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering’?”	NA
mn68:5.7	NA	NA
mn68:5.8	“Yes, sir.”	NA
mn68:6.1	“But, Anuruddha and friends, when a gentleman has gone forth like this, what should he do?	NA
mn68:6.2	Take someone who doesn’t achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that. Their mind is still occupied by desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, doubt, discontent, and sloth.	This is the first absorption, lacking which the mind is full of hindrances. It appears that here the Buddha is explaining the benefits of absorption to Anuruddha, making this the first of several suttas concerned with Anuruddha’s meditative progress ([mn128](), [an3.130 ](), [mn31]()).
mn68:6.3	That’s someone who doesn’t achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that.	NA
mn68:6.4	Take someone who does achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that. Their mind is not occupied by desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, doubt, discontent, and sloth.	NA
mn68:6.5	That’s someone who does achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that.	NA
mn68:7.1	Is this what you think of me?	NA
mn68:7.2	‘The Realized One has not given up the defilements that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.	NA
mn68:7.3	That’s why, after appraisal, he uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and dispels some things.’”	Of the seven methods given at [mn2:4.1](), this omits “seeing”, “restraint”, and “developing”. The Buddha is asking whether his use of the four remaining methods gives the impression he is secretly acting from defilements. It seems to me that this question is speaking to a common tendency among young, idealistic practitioners to expect the teacher to completely transcend worldly activities. But then they see the teacher eating food (like someone desiring taste) or avoiding dangerous situations (like someone worried about their body). When they do such things, it comes from a place of attachment, so it is only natural to wonder if the same applies to the teacher as well. Someone who has experienced, at minimum, the first absorption has known what it is like for the mind to be temporarily free of such attachments, hence would not have such thoughts.
mn68:7.4	“No sir, we don’t think of you that way.	NA
mn68:7.5	NA	NA
mn68:7.6	NA	NA
mn68:7.7	We think of you this way:	NA

mn68:7.9	That’s why, after appraisal, he uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and dispels some things.’”	NA
mn68:7.10	“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!	NA
mn68:7.11	The Realized One has given up the defilements that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death. He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future.	NA
mn68:7.12	Just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth,	NA
mn68:7.13	in the same way, the Realized One has given up the defilements so they are unable to arise in the future.	NA
mn68:7.14	That’s why, after appraisal, he uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and dispels some things.	NA
mn68:8.1	What do you think, Anuruddha and friends?	NA
mn68:8.2	What advantage does the Realized One see in declaring the rebirth of his disciples who have passed away:	NA
mn68:8.3	‘This one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there’?”	At [sn44.9]() the six ascetic teachers are each said to do this, and the Buddha does it at [dn16:2.5.1]() = [dn18:1.4](). | This can be seen as a preemptive teaching to Anuruddha, who was to master the clairvoyance that makes such insights possible. The Buddha wants him to know that such abilities should only be used for pure reasons.
mn68:8.4	“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	NA
mn68:9.1	“The Realized One does not declare such things for the sake of deceiving people or flattering them, nor for the benefit of possessions, honor, or popularity, nor thinking, ‘So let people know about me!’	NA

mn69:0.1	Middle Discourses 69	NA
mn69:0.2	With Gulissāni	NA
mn69:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn69:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
mn69:2.1	Now at that time a wilderness mendicant of boorish behavior named Gulissāni had come down to the midst of the Saṅgha on some business.	Gulissāni (variant Goliyāni) is only known here. | The term _padasamācaro_ (Mahāsaṅgīti editions) or _padarasamācāro_ (Buddha Jayanthi, PTS, and Thai editions) is unique and uncertain. The commentary does not gloss it linguistically, but explains, “of weak conduct, of coarse conduct”. The reading _padara_ is preferred in Cone’s *Dictionary of Pali* in the sense “cleft”. But I propose we read with Sanskrit _padra_, “village”. This explains the confusion in Pali readings, as the Sanskrit is midway between _pada_ and _padara_. The point is that he was supposed to be a forest monk, yet he behaved “boorishly” as if he were from the village.
mn69:2.2	There Venerable Sāriputta spoke to the mendicants about Gulissāni:	NA

mn70:0.1	Middle Discourses 70	NA
mn70:0.2	At Kīṭāgiri	NA
mn70:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn70:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kāsis together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	NA
mn70:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:	NA
mn70:2.1	“Mendicants, I abstain from eating at night.	While I have not been able to trace a Jain rule regarding eating in the afternoon, not eating at night (_rattibhojanā_) was a standard practice of Jain ascetics (Uttarādhyayana 19.30, 13.2;  Dasaveyāliya 4.6, 6.26; Sūyagaḍa 1.2.3.3). It was adopted early into the Gradual Training ([mn27:13.9]()). The failure of mendicants to comply led to the laying down of a formal Vinaya rule ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc37]()). But some came to regret their objections, recognizing that the Buddha had acted for their welfare ([mn66:6.4]()). | The related practice of eating in one sitting is, by contrast, not required in the Vinaya, but was encouraged ([mn21:7.4](), [mn65:2.1]()).
mn70:2.2	Doing so, I find that I’m healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	NA
mn70:2.3	You too should abstain from eating at night.	NA
mn70:2.4	Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”	NA
mn70:2.5	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
mn70:3.1	Then the Buddha, traveling stage by stage in the land of the Kāsis, arrived at a town of the Kāsis named Kīṭāgiri,	NA
mn70:3.2	and stayed there.	NA
mn70:4.1	Now at that time the mendicants who followed Assaji and Punabbasuka were residing at Kīṭāgiri.	Assaji and Punabbasuka were a pair of shameless monks known for corrupting lay folk with their superficial charm ([pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.1.2](), [pli-tv-kd11:13.1.1]()) and for misdirecting Sangha lodgings ([pli-tv-kd16:16.1.1]()), while leading others down the same path. | Assaji is not to be confused with the good monk who was one of the first five mendicants ([mn35:3.1]()).
mn70:4.2	Then several mendicants went up to them and said,	NA
mn70:4.3	“Reverends, the Buddha abstains from eating at night, and so does the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
mn70:4.4	Doing so, they find that they’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	NA
mn70:4.5	You too should abstain from eating at night.	NA
mn70:4.6	Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”	NA
mn70:4.7	When they said this, the mendicants who followed Assaji and Punabbasuka said to them,	NA
mn70:4.8	“Reverends, we eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day.	NA
mn70:4.9	Doing so, we find that we’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	NA
mn70:4.10	Why should we give up what is apparent in the present to chase after what takes effect over time?	They are twisting the meaning of well-known properties of the Dhamma, which is “apparent in the present” and “immediately effective” (_sandiṭṭhiko akāliko_, [mn7:6.2]()). In this they are following the example of Māra, who makes the exact same argument ([sn1.20:4.4](), [sn4.21:1.7]()). The fallacy is that it is sensual pleasures that take time—for they bind you to rebirth—whereas the Dhamma may be realized in this life.
mn70:4.11	We shall eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day.”	NA
mn70:5.1	Since those mendicants were unable to persuade the mendicants who were followers of Assaji and Punabbasuka, they approached the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	NA

mn70:6.3	the teacher summons them.”	NA
mn70:6.4	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to those mendicants and said,	NA
mn70:6.5	“Venerables, the teacher summons you.”	NA
mn70:6.6	“Yes, reverend,” those mendicants replied. They went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.	NA
mn70:6.7	The Buddha said to them, “Is it really true, mendicants, that several mendicants went to you and said:	NA
mn70:6.8	‘Reverends, the Buddha abstains from eating at night, and so does the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
mn70:6.9	Doing so, they find that they’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	NA
mn70:6.10	You too should abstain from eating at night.	NA
mn70:6.11	Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.’	NA
mn70:6.12	When they said this, did you really say to them:	NA
mn70:6.13	‘Reverends, we eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day.	NA
mn70:6.14	Doing so, we find that we’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	NA

mn70:6.16	We shall eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day.’”	NA
mn70:6.17	“Yes, sir.”	NA
mn70:6.18	“Mendicants, have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma like this: no matter what this individual experiences—pleasurable, painful, or neutral—their unskillful qualities decline and their skillful qualities grow?”	The Buddha, even in the face of such intransigence, begins by establishing common ground and giving encouragement.
mn70:6.19	“No, sir.”	NA
mn70:7.1	“Haven’t you known me to teach the Dhamma like this: ‘When someone feels this kind of pleasant feeling, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline. But when someone feels that kind of pleasant feeling, unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow. When someone feels this kind of painful feeling, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline.

mn70:12.3	I say that mendicants don’t have work to do with diligence if they are perfected, with defilements ended, having completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and become rightly freed through enlightenment.

mn70:15.1	And what person is freed both ways?	NA
mn70:15.2	It’s a person who has direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless, transcending form. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements have come to an end.	The first two of the seven are both fully perfected arahants. The arahant “freed both ways” is defined by their mastery of formless meditations, which they understand with wisdom ([dn15:36.3](), [an9.45]()). | “Direct meditative experience” is an oblique rendering of _kāyena phusitvā_, since in the “formless” meditations, _kāya_ cannot mean “body”. Like other meditative terms, the sense of the word gradually grows more subtle as meditation deepens. In preliminary passages it simply means “the body” as contemplated in meditation. As meditation deepens it takes more of a sense of experience as it happens in the body. Finally, as physical perception fades, _kāya_ loses any sense of materiality and simply means direct personal experience of meditative states or even of Nibbana.
mn70:15.3	This person is called freed both ways.	NA

But because of their strong insight, they have not needed to further develop the ultimate refinement of the formless attainments.
mn70:16.3	This person is called freed by wisdom.	NA
mn70:16.4	I say that this mendicant has no work to do with diligence.	NA

mn71:0.2	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges	NA
mn71:1.1	So I have heard.	This begins the “Vacchagotta trilogy”, a series of three suttas tracing Vacchagotta’s spiritual development. In this sutta he shows an attitude of curiosity and respect, and gains a degree of faith in the Buddha. | This is not the same person as the lay brahmin Vacchagotta of Venāgapura  at [an3.63:2.1]().
mn71:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	NA
mn71:2.1	Now at that time the wanderer Vacchagotta was residing in the Single Lotus Monastery of the wanderers.	Vacchagotta is a clan name; his personal name is not recorded. The Vaccha clan stems from the Vedic seer Vatsa, author of Rig Veda 8.6–11. Several notable figures of this clan are known, including a lineage master in Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.5.3, but there is nothing to identify them with the Vacchagotta of the suttas. Given Vacchagotta’s evident interest in the ascetic traditions, it is noteworthy that a certain Śayyambha Vatsagotra, father of Manaka, was said to be a direct disciple of Mahāvīra (Kalpasūtra 10.3).
mn71:3.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.	NA
mn71:3.2	Then it occurred to him,	NA
mn71:3.3	“It’s too early to wander for alms in Vesālī.	NA
mn71:3.4	Why don’t I visit the wanderer Vacchagotta at the Single Lotus Monastery?”	NA
mn71:3.5	So that’s what he did.	NA
mn71:4.1	Vacchagotta saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,	NA
mn71:4.2	and said to him,	NA
mn71:4.3	“Let the Blessed One come, sir!	NA
mn71:4.4	Welcome to the Blessed One, sir!	NA
mn71:4.5	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.	NA
mn71:4.6	Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”	NA
mn71:4.7	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,	NA
mn71:4.8	while Vacchagotta took a low seat and sat to one side.	NA
mn71:4.9	Then Vacchagotta said to the Buddha:	NA
mn71:5.1	“Sir, I have heard this:	At [an3.57]() he similarly asks the Buddha to confirm his teachings on generosity. At [sn44.9](), meanwhile, he asks a somewhat related question about the six ascetic teachers and their divining of afterlife destinies.
mn71:5.2	‘The ascetic Gotama claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus:	Such extraordinary claims were not unprecedented, as both the Jain leader Mahāvīra ([mn14:17.2](), [mn79:6.7]()) and Pūraṇa Kassapa ([an9.38:2.1]()) are said to claim omniscience in the Pali canon. Extant Jain texts have no shortage of such claims (eg. Sūyagaḍa1.6, Kalpasūtra 1, Bhagavatisūtra 4.10, etc.), and it seems likely that this was part of Mahāvīra’s teachings. Sources for Pūraṇa Kassapa are slim, but he was regarded as a great teacher of the Ājīvakas, whose founder the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla was said to be omniscient (Basham, *History and Doctrines of the Ājīvikas*, 275–6).
mn71:5.3	“Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.”’	NA
mn71:5.4	I trust that those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and do not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?”	NA
mn71:5.5	“Vaccha, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false and untrue.”	At [an4.24:2.1]() the Buddha claims to know whatever is “seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, and explored by the mind”, which is a complete knowledge of subjective experience. In the curious dialogue at [mn90:8.5]() the Buddha denies that anyone “will know” all things simultaneously. The Milindapañha reversed this to the positive statement that the Buddha could know all things, just not simultaneously ([mil5.1.2:1.2]()). The Buddha’s omniscience became the standard view of the later books of the Pali canon ([cnd10:5.2](), [bv2:55.3](), [pp1.6:2.1](), [kv3.1:5.3](), etc.).
mn71:6.1	“So how should we answer so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should we explain in line with his teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?”	NA
mn71:6.2	“‘The ascetic Gotama has the three knowledges.’ Answering like this you would repeat what I have said, and not misrepresent me with an untruth. You would explain in line with my teaching, and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism.	The Buddha’s knowledge is specific and functional: it serves the purpose of liberation.
mn71:7.1	For, Vaccha, whenever I want, I recollect my many kinds of past lives.	NA
mn71:7.2	That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. I remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so I recollect my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	NA
mn71:8.1	And whenever I want, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	NA
mn71:9.1	And I have realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. I live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.	NA
mn71:10.1	‘The ascetic Gotama has the three knowledges.’ Answering like this you would repeat what I have said, and not misrepresent me with an untruth. You would explain in line with my teaching, and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism.”	NA
mn71:11.1	When he said this, the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the Buddha,	NA
mn71:11.2	“Worthy Gotama, are there any laypeople who, without giving up the fetter of lay life, make an end of suffering when the body breaks up?”	Vacchagotta uses the phrase _gihisaṁyojana_ (“fetter of lay life”) for the inner attachment to lay life, which is not overcome by the mere act of joining a religious order. Compare the Buddha’s term _gehasita_, the thoughts and memories “of the lay life” ([mn21:6.2](), [mn119:4.7](), [mn125:23.5](), [mn137:9.3]()). See also [mn54](), where the external “signs” of a householder are connected with the fetters.
mn71:11.3	“No, Vaccha.”	NA
mn71:12.1	“But are there any laypeople who, without giving up the fetter of lay life, go to heaven when the body breaks up?”	NA
mn71:12.2	“There’s not just one hundred laypeople, Vaccha, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that who, without giving up the fetter of lay life, go to heaven when the body breaks up.”	NA
mn71:13.1	“Worthy Gotama, are there any Ājīvaka ascetics who make an end of suffering when the body breaks up?”	NA
mn71:13.2	“No, Vaccha.”	NA
mn71:14.1	“But are there any Ājīvaka ascetics who go to heaven when the body breaks up?”	NA
mn71:14.2	“Vaccha, when I recollect the past ninety-one eons, I can’t find any Ājīvaka ascetics who have gone to heaven, except one;	This goes back to the time of the Buddha Vipassī ([dn14:1.4.1]()).
mn71:14.3	and he taught the efficacy of deeds and action.”	Thus denying the basic doctrines of both Gosāla ([dn2:20.2]()) and Pūraṇa Kassapa ([dn2:17.2]()).
mn71:15.1	“In that case, worthy Gotama, that sectarian fold is empty even of the chance to go to heaven.”	The Buddha is speaking of the Ājīvakas, who denied moral causality, not of non-Buddhist paths generally.
mn71:15.2	“Yes, Vaccha, that sectarian fold is empty even of the chance to go to heaven.”	NA
mn71:15.3	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn71:15.4	Satisfied, the wanderer Vacchagotta approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn72:0.1	Middle Discourses 72	NA
mn72:0.2	With Vacchagotta on Fire	NA
mn72:1.1	So I have heard.	This sutta depicts Vacchagotta, having gained a degree of faith as depicted in [mn71](), question the Buddha regarding the undeclared points. This is just a taste of Vacchagotta’s curiosity, as the 55 suttas of SN 33 all deal with the same topic, as do [sn44.7](), [sn44.8](), and [sn44.11](). Underlying all these questions is the assumption of a self, which Vacchagotta asks directly about at [sn44.10]().
mn72:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn72:2.1	Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn72:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:	NA

At [dhp349](), however, the root sense of “churn” fits the context of “thoughts”, while at [mn90:12.14]() it refers to starting a fire by “churning” with a fire-drill, a common Vedic usage (Rig Veda 3.23.1a, 3.29.12a, 8.48.6a; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.1.4.8, 3.7.3.3, etc.).

mn72:18.3	It’s hard for you to understand, since you have a different view, creed, and belief, unless you dedicate yourself to practice with the guidance of tradition.	NA
mn72:18.4	Well then, Vaccha, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.	When Vacchagotta is out of his depth, the Buddha helps him by coming back to a simple, grounded metaphor.
mn72:19.1	What do you think, Vaccha?	NA
mn72:19.2	Suppose a fire was burning in front of you. Would you know:	NA
mn72:19.3	‘This fire is burning in front of me’?”	NA
mn72:19.4	“Yes, I would, worthy Gotama.”	NA
mn72:19.5	NA	NA
mn72:19.6	“But Vaccha, suppose they were to ask you:	NA
mn72:19.7	‘This fire burning in front of you: what does it depend on to burn?’ How would you answer?”	The language in this passage echoes key Buddhist doctrinal terms. Here, “depend” is _paṭicca_.
mn72:19.8	NA	NA
mn72:19.9	“I would answer like this:	NA
mn72:19.10	‘This fire burning in front of me burns in dependence on grass and logs as fuel.’”	“Fuel” is _upādāna_, normally translated as “grasping”.
mn72:19.11	“Suppose that fire burning in front of you was extinguished. Would you know:	“Extinguished” is _nibbāyeyya_, a verbal form of Nibbāna.
mn72:19.12	‘This fire in front of me is quenched’?”	NA
mn72:19.13	“Yes, I would, worthy Gotama.”	NA
mn72:19.14	NA	NA
mn72:19.15	“But Vaccha, suppose they were to ask you:	NA
mn72:19.16	‘This fire in front of you that is quenched: in what direction did it go—	NA
mn72:19.17	east, south, west, or north?’ How would you answer?”	NA
mn72:19.18	“It doesn’t apply, worthy Gotama. The fire depended on grass and logs as fuel. When that runs out, and no more fuel is added, the fire is reckoned to have become quenched due to lack of fuel.”	NA
mn72:20.1	“In the same way, Vaccha, any form by which a realized one might be described has been given up, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.	Here “realized one” (_tathāgata_) pertains to any arahant, as at [sn54.12](). The Pali commentary and one of the Chinese parallels here (SA2 196 at T ii 445a18) agree in saying that a “living being” (_satta_) is meant. However, _tathāgata_ and _satta_ are exact verbal parallels: _tathā_ (“real”) + _gata_ (“come to the state of”) and _sa_ (“real”) + _tta_ (“state of”). Thus it seems likely that this was originally intended as a mere verbal gloss to resolve the compound.
mn72:20.2	A realized one is freed from reckoning in terms of form. They’re deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom,	NA
mn72:20.3	like the ocean.	NA
mn72:20.4	‘They’re reborn’, ‘they’re not reborn’, ‘they’re both reborn and not reborn’, ‘they’re neither reborn nor not reborn’—none of these apply.	NA

mn72:20.20	‘They’re reborn’, ‘they’re not reborn’, ‘they’re both reborn and not reborn’, ‘they’re neither reborn nor not reborn’—none of these apply.”	NA
mn72:21.1	When he said this, the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the Buddha:	NA
mn72:21.2	“Worthy Gotama, suppose there was a large sal tree not far from a town or village.	NA
mn72:21.3	And because it’s impermanent, its branches and foliage, bark and shoots, and softwood would fall off.	NA
mn72:21.4	After some time it would be rid of branches and foliage, bark and shoots, and softwood, pure, and consolidated in the core.	NA
mn72:21.5	In the same way, worthy Gotama’s dispensation is rid of branches and foliage, bark and shoots, and softwood, pure, and consolidated in the core.	NA
mn72:22.1	Excellent, worthy Gotama! …	NA
mn72:22.2	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	Vacchagotta had already gone forth as a wanderer, so it is surprising that he calls himself a “lay follower” (_upāsaka_). The Chinese parallels simply say that he left without taking refuge (SA 962 at T ii 246a17 and SA2 196 at T ii 445c8). Given that the Pali tradition repeats him going for refuge in the next sutta ([mn73:15.2]()), it seems likely that this detail was added by mistake here.
mn73:0.1	Middle Discourses 73	NA
mn73:0.2	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta	NA
mn73:1.1	So I have heard.	The final episode in the Vacchagotta trilogy sees our hero rise above his useless metaphysical quandaries and seek a better way to live. The Buddha’s patience is rewarded as Vacchagotta finally achieves his goal.
mn73:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
mn73:2.1	Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn73:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,	NA
mn73:3.1	“For a long time I have had discussions with the worthy Gotama.	NA
mn73:3.2	Please teach me in brief what is skillful and what is unskillful.”	NA
mn73:3.3	“Vaccha, I can teach you what is skillful and what is unskillful in brief or in detail.	NA
mn73:3.4	Still, let me do so in brief.	NA
mn73:3.5	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn73:3.6	“Yes, worthy sir,” Vaccha replied.	NA
mn73:3.7	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn73:4.1	“Greed is unskillful, contentment is skillful.	Elsewhere (eg. [mn9:4.1]()) a distinction is drawn between greed, hate, and delusion as the *root* of the unskillful, while the ten kinds of action are the unskillful (and the same applies to the skillful).
mn73:4.2	Hate is unskillful, love is skillful.	NA
mn73:4.3	Delusion is unskillful, understanding is skillful.	NA
mn73:4.4	So there are these three unskillful things and three that are skillful.	NA
mn73:5.1	Killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; covetousness, ill will, and wrong view: these things are unskillful.	NA
mn73:5.2	Refraining from killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; refraining from speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; contentment, kind-heartedness, and right view: these things are skillful.	NA

mn73:6.1	When a mendicant has given up craving so it is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future, that mendicant is perfected. They’ve ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and are rightly freed through enlightenment.”	NA
mn73:7.1	“Leaving aside the worthy Gotama,	NA
mn73:7.2	is there even a single monk disciple of the worthy Gotama who has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements?”	Two devas mentally ask Mahāvīra a similar question at Bhagavatisūtra 4.5.59; the answer was seven hundred.
mn73:7.3	“There are not just one hundred such monks who are my disciples, Vaccha, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that.”	NA
mn73:8.1	“Leaving aside the worthy Gotama and the monks,	NA
mn73:8.2	is there even a single nun disciple of the worthy Gotama who has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements?”	NA
mn73:8.3	“There are not just one hundred such nuns who are my disciples, Vaccha, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that.”	NA
mn73:9.1	“Leaving aside the worthy Gotama, the monks, and the nuns,	NA
mn73:9.2	is there even a single layman disciple of Mister Gotama—white-clothed and chaste—who, with the ending of the five lower fetters, is reborn spontaneously, to be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world?”	Devoted layfolk would regularly keep the five precepts, which forbid sexual misconduct, and undertake the eight precepts, including celibacy, on the sabbath. However it seems that then, as today, there is a less formalized class of layfolk who would undertake the eight precepts continuously. White-robed, celibate layfolk are mentioned in [dn29:12.11](), where they are a property of a fully-developed and prosperous religion. Celibate laypeople are also referred to at [an5.180]() and [an10.75:2.2](). Such layfolk have the potential to realize non-return, since that requires the complete letting go of all forms of desire.

mn73:10.1	“Leaving aside Mister Gotama, the monks, the nuns, and the chaste laymen,	NA
mn73:10.2	is there even a single layman disciple of the worthy Gotama—white-clothed, enjoying sensual pleasures, following instructions, and responding to advice—who has gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and lives self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instruction?”	That is, they are stream-enterers.

mn73:15.1	Excellent, worthy Gotama! …	NA
mn73:15.2	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
mn73:15.3	May I receive the going forth, the ordination in the worthy Gotama’s presence?”	NA
mn73:16.1	“Vaccha, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.	NA
mn73:16.2	However, I have recognized individual differences in this matter.”	NA
mn73:16.3	“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.”	NA
mn73:16.4	And the wanderer Vaccha received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	NA
mn73:17.1	Not long after his ordination, a fortnight later, Venerable Vacchagotta went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA

mn73:17.3	Please teach me further.”	NA
mn73:18.1	“Well then, Vaccha, further develop two things: serenity and discernment.	NA

mn73:24.3	NA	NA
mn73:25.1	And then Venerable Vacchagotta approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	NA
mn73:26.1	Then Vacchagotta, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn73:26.2	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	NA
mn73:26.3	And Venerable Vacchagotta became one of the perfected.	NA

mn73:28.8	NA	NA
mn73:28.9	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn73:28.10	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn74:0.1	Middle Discourses 74	NA
mn74:0.2	With Dīghanakha	NA
mn74:1.1	So I have heard.	This sutta records the occasion of the full enlightenment of the Buddha’s greatest disciple, Sāriputta, as well as the conversion of Dīghanakha. The commentary says this became the occasion for a unique four-factored gathering: it is the full moon in the month of Māgha; 1,250 mendicants spontaneously assemble; all were arahants with the six high knowledges; all were ordained by the “come, mendicant” formula. Today this is celebrated in the Makha Puja festival in Thailand.
mn74:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain in the Boar’s Cave.	NA
mn74:2.1	Then the wanderer Dīghanakha went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	Dīghanakha means “Long-nails”; it must have been a nickname. Long nails are forbidden in the Vinaya ([pli-tv-kd15:27.1.21]()) and also to the one performing a Brahmanical consecration (_dīkṣā_, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3.1.2). Further, EA 34.4 says that long nails (<span lang='lzh'>爪長</span>), uncut hair, and unwashed robes were disgraceful characteristics of ascetics. Ācārāṅgasūtra 2.8.5 speaks of the ascetic practice of abandoning the care of the hair of the head, beard, and nails. | Dīghanakha was Sāriputta’s nephew according to the Pali commentaries (not here, but in [mn111](), [sn11.2](), etc.) and northern texts such as Mahāprajñāpāramitā-upadeśa-śāstra, Mahāvibhāṣā, and Avadānaśataka.
mn74:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side and said to the Buddha,	NA
mn74:2.3	“Worthy Gotama, this is my doctrine and view:	NA
mn74:2.4	‘Nothing is acceptable to me.’”	Dīghanakha’s view “nothing is acceptable to me” (_sabbaṁ me nakkhamati_) is obscure, which seems to be the point. Sanskrit and Tibetan parallels to this passage are identical to the Pali, so when some Chinese translations say “no view” or “no teaching” is acceptable, this is probably because the translators felt the need to clarify, echoing the common expression, “the acceptance of a view after consideration” (_diṭṭhinijjhānakkhanti_). This reading fits the text, but the sense may be broader than that. The closest phrasing in Pali is at [dn25:10.11](), where “this is not acceptable to me” (_idaṁ me nakkhamati_) refers to food that a picky monk rejects. Views about acceptable food are recorded in detail in Jain texts, and we may presume that other orders had similar systems. Strictness in such matters is seen as a sign of virtue, escalating ultimately to the refusal of all food.
mn74:2.5	“This view of yours, Aggivessana—	Aggivessana is his Brahmanical clan name.
mn74:2.6	is that acceptable to you?”	While this displays the Buddha’s ready wit, like much good humor it plays on a deeper anxiety. For it is easy to say that one believes in nothing, but the state of unknowing is psychologically unstable, as minds seek answers. When someone claims to hold no views, their skepticism is how they hide their views from themselves.
mn74:2.7	“If I were to accept this view, worthy Gotama, it would make no difference, it would make no difference!”	NA
mn74:3.1	“Well, Aggivessana, there are many more in the world who say,	NA
mn74:3.2	‘It would make no difference! It would make no difference!’	NA
mn74:3.3	But they don’t give up that view, and they grasp another view.	NA
mn74:3.4	And there are a scant few in the world who say,	NA
mn74:3.5	‘It would make no difference! It would make no difference!’	NA
mn74:3.6	And they give up that view by not grasping another view.	NA
mn74:4.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	NA
mn74:4.2	‘Everything is acceptable to me.’	NA
mn74:4.3	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	NA
mn74:4.4	‘Nothing is acceptable to me.’	NA
mn74:4.5	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	NA
mn74:4.6	‘Some things are acceptable to me and some things are not.’	NA
mn74:4.7	Regarding this, the view of the ascetics and brahmins to whom everything is acceptable	NA
mn74:4.8	is close to greed, bondage, approving, attachment, and grasping.	NA
mn74:4.9	The view of the ascetics and brahmins to whom nothing is acceptable	NA
mn74:4.10	is far from greed, bondage, approving, attachment, and grasping.”	NA
mn74:5.1	When he said this, the wanderer Dīghanakha said to the Buddha,	NA
mn74:5.2	“Worthy Gotama commends my conviction! He recommends my conviction!”	NA

mn74:9.1	Aggivessana, this body is formed. It’s made up of the four principal states, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction.

mn74:9.2	Doing so, you’ll give up desire, affection, and subservience to the body.	For _kāyanvayatā_ (“subservience to the body”) see [mn36:4.4](). The inclusion of this rare phrase here suggests that Jain-like practices such as starvation may be indicated.

mn74:13.1	A mendicant whose mind is freed like this doesn’t side with anyone or dispute with anyone. They use the language of the world to communicate without getting stuck on it.”	See [dn9:53.5]().
mn74:14.1	Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was standing behind the Buddha fanning him.	NA
mn74:14.2	Then he thought,	NA
mn74:14.3	“It seems the Buddha speaks of giving up and letting go all these things through direct knowledge.”	NA
mn74:14.4	Reflecting like this, Venerable Sāriputta’s mind was freed from the defilements by not grasping.	Sāriputta became a stream-enterer on hearing a short teaching from the monk Assaji ([pli-tv-kd1:23.5.6]()), whereupon he told his friend Moggallāna. They both promptly left their former teacher Sañjaya, a traumatic loss to Sañjaya and his community. [an4.172:2.1]() says that Sāriputta became enlightened a fortnight after he ordained, a detail confirmed in multiple parallels to this passage; [mn111:2.8]() details the practice he undertook in that fortnight. This means that the current discussion must have taken place only a fortnight after leaving Sañjaya. Now, Sañjaya’s philosophy was to systematically avoid taking any position ([dn2:32.2]()), which is similar to Dīghanakha’s doctrine. It seems likely, then, that Dīghanakha was a disciple of Sañjaya. This supposition finds support in several parallels, which say Dīghanakha was annoyed to learn that Sāriputta had rejected other teachers and gone over to the Buddha (eg. Avadānaśataka, Vaidya 1958a 256: _sarve tīrthakarā nigṛhītāḥ_; also in Mahāprajñāpāramitā-upadeśa-śāstra and Mahāvibhāṣā). These sources do not specify Sañjaya, but who else could it be?
mn74:15.1	And the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the wanderer Dīghanakha:	NA
mn74:15.2	“Everything that has a beginning has an end.”	NA
mn74:15.3	Then Dīghanakha saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha:	NA
mn74:16.1	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	NA
mn74:16.2	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
mn74:16.3	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
mn74:16.4	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	The Pali is alone in saying Dīghanakha became a lay follower, as all parallels report that he ordained and became an arahant. As with Vacchagotta at [mn72:22.2](), it is unlikely that a wanderer would become a lay follower and the Pali is probably in error. | The Mahāprajñāpāramitā-upadeśa-śāstra, Tibetan Mūla-Sarvāstivāda-Vinaya, and Avadānaśataka say that, having cut his long nails before ordination, he was known by his actual name, Koṣṭhila, that is, the monk known in Pali as Mahākoṭṭhita. This contradicts the Pali tradition, but as Anālayo shows, there are several inconsistencies in the Pali accounts, so the northern tradition is credible (*Comparative Study*, vol. 1, p. 406, note 88).
mn75:0.1	Middle Discourses 75	NA
mn75:0.2	With Māgaṇḍiya	NA
mn75:1.1	So I have heard.	The wanderer Māgaṇḍiya appears outraged at the presence of the Buddha, who he thinks stands in opposition to life itself since he opposes sensual enjoyment. It soon turns out that he misunderstands the Buddha’s teachings on sensuality, as the Buddha’s aim is not to prevent people from experiencing pleasure but to elevate them so they can enjoy a higher form of pleasure.
mn75:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma, on a grass mat in the fire chamber of a brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan.	NA
mn75:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kammāsadamma for alms.	NA
mn75:2.2	He wandered for alms in Kammāsadamma. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to a certain forest grove for the day’s meditation.	NA
mn75:2.3	Having plunged deep into it, he sat at the root of a certain tree to meditate.	NA
mn75:3.1	Then as the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya was going for a walk he approached that fire chamber.	A Māgaṇḍiya appears here and in [snp4.9](), where he uses his beautiful daughter to tempt the Buddha (cited and discussed at [sn22.3]()). As to the protagonist of [snp4.9](), the Pali commentary, Divyāvadāna 36—which calls him Mākandika—and the Chinese parallel in the Arthapada (T iv 180) say he too was from the Kuru country. Now, the Mahābhārata and other Sanskrit sources name Mākandī as a city or province on the banks of the Ganges, in the Pañcāla kingdom south of Hastināpura. This more-or-less agrees with Māgaṇḍiya’s home in the Kuru country, and suggests his name means “the man from Mākandī”. Divyāvadāna 36 and Sanskrit fragment say the Mākandika of [snp4.9]() was also a wanderer, which does not contradict the position of the Pali commentaries and the Arthapada that he was a brahmin. At [an5.294-302:1.1](), _māgaṇḍika_ is listed as a type of ascetic; these could well be students of Māgaṇḍiya. Kathāsaritsāgara 15 tells the comic farce of an ascetic from Mākandikā on the banks of the Ganges, who fell in love with the daughter of a merchant and went to ridiculous lengths to obtain her, only to end up a laughing-stock. This story could well have begun life as a comic inversion of [snp4.9](). Reading all these sources together, we can posit that there was a brahmin wanderer from Mākandī on the Ganges in Kuru-Pañcāla, who gained a certain fame and following as a teacher, but whose hedonism was his downfall. The Pali commentaries further specify that the Māgaṇḍiya of the current sutta is the nephew of the one at [snp4.9]().
mn75:3.2	He saw the grass mat spread out there	NA
mn75:3.3	and asked the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan,	NA
mn75:3.4	“Worthy Bhāradvāja, who has this grass mat been spread out for? It looks like an ascetic’s bed.”	NA
mn75:4.1	“There is the ascetic Gotama, a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family.	NA
mn75:4.2	He has this good reputation:	NA
mn75:4.3	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
mn75:4.4	This bed has been spread for that worthy Gotama.”	NA
mn75:5.1	“Well, it’s a sad sight, worthy Bhāradvāja,	NA
mn75:5.2	a very sad sight indeed,	NA
mn75:5.3	to see a bed for the worthy Gotama, that baby-killer!”	_Bhūnahan_ is Sanskrit _bhrūṇahan_. The earliest sense is “fetus-killer”, found in Rig Veda 10.155.2a where a grotesque demoness is cursed as one who “slays all fetuses” (_sarvā bhrūṇāny āruṣī_), and also at Atharvaveda 6.1112.3c (_bhrūṇaghni_). Later it took on the sense “murderer of a brahmin”. It is used in Pali for a depraved person, especially one who destroys the life of a developed fetus or child (see [an7.64:22.1](), [ja358:1.1](), [ja544:105.2]()). | The brahmin of Verañja calls the Buddha a variety of names at [an8.11]().
mn75:5.4	“Be careful what you say, Māgaṇḍiya,	NA
mn75:5.5	be careful what you say.	NA
mn75:5.6	Many astute aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics are devoted to the worthy Gotama. They’ve been guided by him in the noble system, the skillful teaching.”	NA
mn75:5.7	“Even if I was to see the worthy Gotama face to face, worthy Bhāradvāja, I would say to his face:	NA
mn75:5.8	‘The ascetic Gotama is a baby-killer.’	NA
mn75:5.9	Why is that?	NA
mn75:5.10	For so it came to me while sleeping.”	_Sutta_ can mean “discourse” or “sleeping”. I do not know anywhere else in the Pali where non-Buddhist texts are referred to as _sutta_. Further, it would seem unlikely that they had such a prophecy of the Buddha, and no early Brahmanical texts have anything like this. On the other hand, the Upaniṣads feature many passages on sleep and dream, and the importance of the visions therein (eg. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.1.18). Also, _avacarati_ is not, so far as I know, used for the “transmission” of scripture, but it is used for the “descent” from heaven (Rig Veda 10.59.9a), a usage fitting well the appearance of a vision in a dream. | The plural _no_ (“our”) here is not significant, as Māgaṇḍiya refers to himself with the royal “we”.
mn75:5.11	“If you don’t mind, I’ll tell the ascetic Gotama about this.”	NA
mn75:5.12	“Don’t worry, worthy Bhāradvāja. You may tell him exactly what I’ve said.”	NA
mn75:6.1	With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard this discussion between the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan and the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya.	NA
mn75:6.2	Coming out of retreat, he went to the brahmin’s fire chamber and sat on the grass mat.	NA
mn75:6.3	Then the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn75:6.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	NA
mn75:6.5	“Bhāradvāja, did you have a discussion with the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya about this grass mat?”	NA
mn75:6.6	When he said this, the brahmin, shocked and awestruck, said to the Buddha,	NA
mn75:6.7	“I wanted to mention this very thing to the worthy Gotama,	NA
mn75:6.8	but you brought it up before I had a chance.”	NA
mn75:7.1	But this conversation between the Buddha and the brahmin was left unfinished.	NA

mn75:7.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and the Buddha said to him:	NA

So even though the fire was actually painful to touch, they had a distorted perception that it was pleasant.”	NA
mn75:16.1	“In the same way, sensual pleasures of the past, future, and present are painful to touch, fiercely burning and scorching.	NA
mn75:16.2	These sentient beings who are not free from sensual pleasures—being consumed by craving for sensual pleasures, burning with passion for sensual pleasures—have impaired sense faculties. So even though sensual pleasures are actually painful to touch, they have a distorted perception that they are pleasant.	NA
mn75:17.1	Suppose there was a person affected by leprosy, with sores and blisters on their limbs. Being devoured by worms, scratching with their nails at the opening of their wounds, they’re cauterizing their body over a pit of glowing coals.	NA
mn75:17.2	The more they scratch their wounds and cauterize their body, the more their wounds become foul, stinking, and infected. But still, they derive a degree of pleasure and gratification from the itchiness of their wounds.	NA
mn75:17.3	In the same way, I see other sentient beings who are not free from sensual pleasures being consumed by craving for sensual pleasures, burning with passion for sensual pleasures, indulging in sensual pleasures.	NA
mn75:17.4	The more they indulge in sensual pleasures, the more their craving for sensual pleasures grows, and the more they burn with passion for sensual pleasures. But still, they derive a degree of pleasure and gratification from the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	NA
mn75:18.1	What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya?	NA
mn75:18.2	Have you seen or heard of a king or a royal minister of the past, future, or present, amusing themselves supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, who—without giving up craving for sensual pleasures and dispelling passion for sensual pleasures—lives rid of thirst, their mind peaceful inside?”	NA
mn75:18.3	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
mn75:18.4	“Good, Māgaṇḍiya.	NA
mn75:18.5	Neither have I.	NA
mn75:18.6	On the contrary, all the ascetics or brahmins of the past, future, or present who live rid of thirst, their minds peaceful inside, do so after truly understanding the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of sensual pleasures, and after giving up craving and dispelling passion for sensual pleasures.”	NA
mn75:19.1	Then on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
mn75:19.2	“Health is the ultimate blessing;	The first two lines appear also as the first and last lines of [dhp204](), as well as in many parallels for that verse.
mn75:19.3	extinguishment, the ultimate happiness.	NA
mn75:19.4	Of paths, the ultimate is eightfold—	NA
mn75:19.5	it’s safe, and leads to freedom from death.”	NA
mn75:19.6	When he said this, Māgaṇḍiya said to him,	NA
mn75:19.7	“It’s incredible, worthy Gotama, it’s amazing!	NA
mn75:19.8	How well said this was by the worthy Gotama!	NA
mn75:19.9	‘Health is the ultimate blessing; extinguishment, the ultimate happiness.’	NA
mn75:19.10	I’ve also heard that wanderers of the past, the tutors of tutors, said:	NA
mn75:19.11	‘Health is the ultimate blessing; extinguishment, the ultimate happiness.’	I have not been able to trace such a saying. Kaṭha Upaniṣad 2.4.2 identifies the supreme divinity as “ultimate happiness”.
mn75:19.12	And it agrees, worthy Gotama.”	NA
mn75:19.13	“But Māgaṇḍiya, when you heard that wanderers of the past said this,	NA
mn75:19.14	what is that health? And what is that extinguishment?”	NA
mn75:19.15	When he said this, Māgaṇḍiya stroked his own limbs with his hands, saying:	NA
mn75:19.16	“This is that health, worthy Gotama, this is that extinguishment!	NA
mn75:19.17	For I am now healthy and happy, and have no afflictions.”	Compare [dn1:3.20.2]().

mn75:21.8	These days it has gradually become a verse used by ordinary people.	NA
mn75:21.9	But Māgaṇḍiya, this body is a disease, a boil, a dart, a misery, an affliction. Yet you say of this body:	NA

mn75:25.9	When my grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease.	NA
mn75:25.10	That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.”	NA
mn75:26.1	When he said this, Māgaṇḍiya said to him,	NA
mn75:26.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	NA
mn75:26.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
mn75:26.4	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
mn75:26.5	May I receive the going forth, the ordination in the worthy Gotama’s presence?”	NA
mn75:27.1	“Māgaṇḍiya, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.	NA
mn75:27.2	However, I have recognized individual differences in this matter.”	NA
mn75:27.3	“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.”	NA
mn75:28.1	And the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	NA
mn75:28.2	Not long after his ordination, Venerable Māgaṇḍiya, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn75:28.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	NA

mn76:0.1	Middle Discourses 76	NA
mn76:0.2	With Sandaka	NA
mn76:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn76:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery.	NA
mn76:2.1	Now at that time the wanderer Sandaka was residing at the cave of the wavy leaf fig tree together with a large assembly of around five hundred wanderers.	Neither Sandaka nor this location appear to be known elsewhere.
mn76:3.1	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Ānanda came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants:	NA
mn76:3.2	“Come, reverends, let’s go to the Devakata Pool to see the cave.”	Evidently an excursion for sightseeing was popular. As well as simply enjoying nature, such trips give the mendicants a chance to check out possible places to stay for meditation.
mn76:3.3	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.	NA
mn76:3.4	Then Ānanda together with several mendicants went to the Devakata Pool.	NA
mn76:4.1	Now at that time, Sandaka and the large assembly of wanderers were sitting together making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as	NA
mn76:4.2	talk about kings, bandits, and chief ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence.	NA
mn76:4.3	Sandaka saw Ānanda coming off in the distance,	NA
mn76:4.4	and hushed his own assembly,	NA
mn76:4.5	“Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound.	NA
mn76:4.6	The ascetic Ānanda, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is coming.	NA
mn76:4.7	He is included among the disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing near Kosambī.	This sentence is redundant as it stands. But wherever this idiom occurs elsewhere, it specifies that the person is a lay disciple ([dn25:3.5](), [mn78:3.7](), [an10.93:2.7](), [an10.94:3.4]()). Perhaps the text here has been corrupted and originally specified that Ānanda was a *monastic* disciple.
mn76:4.8	Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet.	NA
mn76:4.9	Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”	NA
mn76:4.10	Then those wanderers fell silent.	NA
mn76:5.1	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the wanderer Sandaka,	NA
mn76:5.2	who said to him,	NA
mn76:5.3	“Come, worthy Ānanda! Welcome, worthy Ānanda!	NA
mn76:5.4	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.	NA
mn76:5.5	Please sit down, this seat is ready.”	NA
mn76:5.6	Ānanda sat down on the seat spread out,	NA
mn76:5.7	while Sandaka took a low seat and sat to one side.	NA
mn76:5.8	Ānanda said to Sandaka,	NA
mn76:5.9	“Sandaka, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	NA
mn76:5.10	“Worthy Ānanda, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now.	NA
mn76:5.11	It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later.	NA
mn76:5.12	It’d be great if the worthy Ānanda himself would give a Dhamma talk explaining his own tradition.”	NA
mn76:5.13	“Well then, Sandaka, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn76:5.14	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Sandaka.	NA
mn76:5.15	Venerable Ānanda said this:	NA
mn76:6.1	“Sandaka, these things have been explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha: four ways that negate the spiritual life, and four kinds of unreliable spiritual life. A sensible person would, to the best of their ability, not practice such spiritual paths, and if they did practice them, they wouldn’t succeed in the system of the skillful teaching.”	NA
mn76:6.2	“But worthy Ānanda, what are the four ways that negate the spiritual life, and the four kinds of unreliable spiritual life?”	NA
mn76:7.1	“Sandaka, take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and view:	NA
mn76:7.2	‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.	Attributed to Ajita of the hair blanket at [dn2:23.2](). | The denial of “mother and father” is usually interpreted as the denial of moral duty towards one’s parents. However, I think it is a doctrine of conception which denies that a child is created by the mother and father. Rather, the child is produced by the four elements, with parents as mere instigators and incubators.
mn76:7.3	This person is made up of the four principal states. When they die, the earth in their body merges and coalesces with the substance of earth. The water in their body merges and coalesces with the substance of water. The fire in their body merges and coalesces with the substance of fire. The air in their body merges and coalesces with the substance of air. The faculties are transferred to space.	This is a materialist analysis of the person. | The word _kāya_ (“substance”) is central to Jainism. Ācārāṅgasūtra 8.1.11 speaks of the “substances” of earth, water, fire, and air as being imbued with life so one should avoid damaging them.

mn76:10.2	‘The one who acts does nothing wrong when they punish, mutilate, torture, aggrieve, oppress, intimidate, or when they encourage others to do the same.

Attributed to Pūraṇa Kassapa  at [dn2:17.2](). | This is a denial of the doctrine of kamma. While his doctrine appears to be morally nihilistic, it seems unlikely this was Pūraṇa Kassapa’s full teaching. He may have subscribed to hard determinism, so that we have no choice in what we do.

This combines the view attributed to Pakudha Kaccāyana ([dn2:26.2]()) with the second part of Gosāla’s view ([dn2:20.7]()). There are several inconsistencies in the presentation of these views in Pali, and still more when parallels are considered.

mn76:20.3	But worthy Ānanda, what are the four kinds of unreliable spiritual life?”	This section deals with religious claims to truth, which sound confident but turn out to be unreliable. _Anassāsika_ (“unreliable”) normally describes “conditions”, where it is a synonym of _anicca_ and _adhuva_ ([an7.66:2.3](), [dn17:2.16.4](), [sn15.20:2.12](), [sn22.96:4.14]()).

mn76:21.1	“Sandaka, take a certain teacher who claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus:	NA
mn76:21.2	‘Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.’	NA
mn76:21.3	They enter an empty house; they get no almsfood; a dog bites them; they encounter a wild elephant, a wild horse, and a wild cow; they ask the name and clan of a woman or man; they ask the name and path to a village or town.	NA
mn76:21.4	When asked, ‘Why is this?’ they answer: ‘I had to enter an empty house, that’s why I entered it. I had to get no almsfood, that’s why I got none. I had to get bitten by a dog, that’s why I was bitten. I had to encounter a wild elephant, a wild horse, and a wild cow, that’s why I encountered them. I had to ask the name and clan of a woman or man, that’s why I asked. I had to ask the name and path to a village or town, that’s why I asked.’	Not only did the Buddha deny this kind of strong omniscience, he took pains to point out its absurdity.

found only in the commentary to this term so is probably spurious.

mn76:53.1	“But Reverend Ānanda, in this teaching and training, how many are emancipated?”	“(Those who are) emancipated” is _niyyātāro_, a unique occurrence of an agent noun from _niyyāti_, “to go out”. This was probably a technical term in Sandaka’s system.
mn76:53.2	“There are not just one hundred who are emancipated, Sandaka, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that in this teaching and training.”	NA
mn76:53.3	“It’s incredible, worthy Ānanda, it’s amazing!	NA
mn76:53.4	Namely, that there’s no glorifying one’s own teaching and putting down the teaching of others. The Dhamma is taught in its own field, and so many emancipated are recognized.	NA
mn76:53.5	But these Ājīvakas, sons of she whose sons are dead, glorify themselves and put others down. And they only recognize three who have been emancipated:	The commentary takes _mata_ as “dead” and the compound _puttamatāya_ as genitive feminine, yielding the sense, “she whose sons are dead”, explaining that Sandaka thought, “Those Ājīvakas are surely dead; their mother is she whose sons are dead”. Perhaps, however, “she whose sons are dead” is an allusion to a child-killing _yakkhinī_ such as Hārītī of Madhurā or Kālī in the commentary to [dhp5](), thus having the force, “sons of a she-devil”. Either way this is a curse or slur intruding into a passage whose intent is to highlight the Buddha’s fair-minded treatment of others. A near-identical phrase is used of brutal bandits  at [ja79:1.3](). The compound is inverted at [sn5.3:2.1](), but seems to have the same meaning.
mn76:53.6	Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saṅkicca, and the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla.”	NA
mn76:54.1	Then the wanderer Sandaka addressed his own assembly,	NA
mn76:54.2	“Go, good fellows. The spiritual life is lived under the ascetic Gotama.	NA
mn76:54.3	It’s not easy for me to forsake possessions, honor, or popularity now.”	NA
mn76:54.4	And that’s how the wanderer Sandaka sent his own assembly to lead the spiritual life under the Buddha.	NA
mn77:0.1	Middle Discourses 77	NA
mn77:0.2	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī	NA
mn77:1.1	So I have heard.	Beginning as a discussion on why certain teachers are given due respect, the Buddha creates one of the most comprehensive accounts of his system of meditation, drawing in almost all the different perspectives and approaches to _samādhi_.
mn77:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
mn77:2.1	Now at that time several very well-known wanderers were residing in the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground.	NA
mn77:2.2	They included Annabhāra, Varadhara, Sakuludāyī, and other very well-known wanderers.	The Buddha addresses these wanderers at [an4.30](), where he teaches four fundamental principles of any holy life, and at [an4.185](), where he teaches four “truths of the brahmins”. These are all respectful engagements that highlight common ground. | Annabhāra means “food-carrier” and indicates a humble origin ([thag16.9:19.1]()). | Varadhara means “bearer of good fortune”; it is probably a name for the earth. | Sakuludāyī also appears in [mn79](). His name (“one who rises up with his own family”) is ironic, given that his attempt to go forth is frustrated by his followers at [mn79:46.2]().
mn77:3.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.	NA
mn77:3.2	Then it occurred to him,	NA
mn77:3.3	“It’s too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha.	NA
mn77:3.4	Why don’t I visit the wanderer Sakuludāyī at the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground?”	NA
mn77:4.1	So the Buddha went to the monastery of the wanderers.	NA
mn77:4.2	Now at that time, Sakuludāyī was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as	NA
mn77:4.3	talk about kings, bandits, and chief ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence.	NA
mn77:4.4	Sakuludāyī saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,	NA
mn77:4.5	and hushed his own assembly,	NA
mn77:4.6	“Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound.	NA
mn77:4.7	NA	NA
mn77:4.8	Here comes the ascetic Gotama.	NA
mn77:4.9	The venerable likes quiet and praises quiet.	NA
mn77:4.10	Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”	NA
mn77:4.11	Then those wanderers fell silent.	NA
mn77:5.1	Then the Buddha approached Sakuludāyī,	NA
mn77:5.2	who said to him,	NA
mn77:5.3	“Let the Blessed One come, sir!	NA
mn77:5.4	Welcome to the Blessed One, sir!	NA
mn77:5.5	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.	NA
mn77:5.6	Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”	NA
mn77:5.7	NA	NA
mn77:5.8	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,	NA
mn77:5.9	while Sakuludāyī took a low seat and sat to one side.	NA
mn77:5.10	The Buddha said to him,	NA
mn77:5.11	“Udāyī, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	NA
mn77:6.1	“Sir, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now.	NA
mn77:6.2	It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later.	NA
mn77:6.3	Sir, a few days ago several ascetics and brahmins who follow various other religions were sitting together at the debating hall, and this discussion came up among them:	NA
mn77:6.4	‘The people of Aṅga and Magadha are so fortunate, so very fortunate!	NA
mn77:6.5	For there are these ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community, and tutor a community. They’re well-known and famous religious founders, deemed holy by many people. And they have come down for the rainy season residence at Rājagaha.	NA

mn77:6.15	And he too has come down for the rains residence at Rājagaha.	NA
mn77:6.16	Which of these ascetics and brahmins is honored, respected, revered, and venerated by their disciples? And how do their disciples, honoring and respecting them, remain loyal?’	NA
mn77:6.17	Some of them said:	NA
mn77:6.18	‘This Pūraṇa Kassapa leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people.	NA
mn77:6.19	But he’s not honored, respected, revered, and venerated by his disciples. And his disciples, not honoring and respecting him, don’t remain loyal to him.	NA
mn77:6.20	Once it so happened that he was teaching an assembly of many hundreds.	NA
mn77:6.21	Then one of his disciples made a noise,	NA
mn77:6.22	“My good fellows, don’t ask Pūraṇa Kassapa about that.	NA
mn77:6.23	He doesn’t know that.	NA
mn77:6.24	I know it. Ask me about it,	NA
mn77:6.25	and I’ll answer you.”	NA

mn77:6.27	“Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound.	NA
mn77:6.28	They’re not asking you, they’re asking me!	NA
mn77:6.29	I’ll answer you!”	NA
mn77:6.30	Indeed, many of his disciples have left him after refuting his doctrine:	NA
mn77:6.31	“You don’t understand this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training? You’re practicing wrong. I’m practicing right. I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!”	NA
mn77:6.32	That’s how Pūraṇa Kassapa is not honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by his disciples. On the contrary, his disciples, not honoring and respecting him, don’t remain loyal to him.	NA
mn77:6.33	Rather, he’s reviled, and rightly so.’	Taking _dhamma_ here in the sense of “right, legitimate”, rather than “teaching”, as the example criticizes him not his teaching.

I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!”	NA
mn77:6.53	That’s how the Jain Ñātika is not honored, respected, revered, and venerated by his disciples. On the contrary, his disciples, not honoring and respecting him, don’t remain loyal to him.	NA
mn77:6.54	Rather, he’s reviled, and rightly so.’	NA

mn77:6.57	He’s honored, respected, revered, and venerated by his disciples. And his disciples, honoring and respecting him, remain loyal to him.	NA
mn77:6.58	Once it so happened that he was teaching an assembly of many hundreds.	NA
mn77:6.59	Then one of his disciples cleared their throat.	NA

mn77:6.61	“Hush, venerable, don’t make sound! Our teacher, the Blessed One, is teaching!”	NA
mn77:6.62	While the ascetic Gotama is teaching an assembly of many hundreds, there is no sound of his disciples coughing or clearing their throats.	NA

mn77:6.65	It’s like when there’s a person at the crossroads pressing out pure dwarf-bee honey,	_Khuddā_ (literally “small one”) is said to be a species of small bee, also known in Sanskrit as _kṣudrā_. The “dwarf bee” (_apis florea_) fits the bill, as it is a small wild honeybee found in India.

mn77:6.69	“Whatever the Buddha teaches, we shall listen to it.”	NA
mn77:6.70	Even when disciples of the ascetic Gotama, having clashed with their spiritual companions, reject the training and return to a lesser life, they speak only praise of the teacher, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. They blame only themselves, not others: “We were unlucky, we had little merit. For even after going forth in such a well explained teaching and training we weren’t able to practice for life the perfectly full and pure spiritual life.”	For “having clashed” (_sampayojetvā_), see [sn11.24:1.2]().
mn77:6.71	They become monastery workers or lay followers, and they proceed having undertaken the five precepts.	NA

mn77:8.1	“Sir, I see five such qualities in the Buddha.	This is an example of what the Buddha says in [dn1:1.7.1](), “When an ordinary person speaks praise of the Realized One, they speak only of trivial, insignificant details of mere ethics.”
mn77:8.2	What five?	NA
mn77:8.3	The Buddha eats little and praises eating little.	NA
mn77:8.4	This is the first such quality I see in the Buddha.	NA
mn77:8.5	Furthermore, the Buddha is content with any kind of robe, and praises such contentment.	NA
mn77:8.6	This is the second such quality I see in the Buddha.	NA
mn77:8.7	Furthermore, the Buddha is content with any kind of almsfood, and praises such contentment.	NA
mn77:8.8	This is the third such quality I see in the Buddha.	NA
mn77:8.9	Furthermore, the Buddha is content with any kind of lodging, and praises such contentment.	NA
mn77:8.10	This is the fourth such quality I see in the Buddha.	NA
mn77:8.11	Furthermore, the Buddha is secluded, and praises seclusion.	NA
mn77:8.12	This is the fifth such quality I see in the Buddha.	NA
mn77:8.13	These are the five qualities I see in the Buddha, because of which his disciples honor, respect, revere, and venerate him; and honoring and respecting him, they remain loyal to him.”	NA
mn77:9.1	“Suppose, Udāyī, my disciples were loyal to me because I eat little. Well, there are disciples of mine who eat a tumbler of food, or half a tumbler; they eat a wood-apple, or half a wood-apple.	NA
mn77:9.2	But sometimes I even eat this bowl full to the brim, or even more.	NA
mn77:9.3	So if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because I eat little, then those disciples who eat even less would not be loyal to me.	NA
mn77:9.4	Suppose my disciples were loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of robe. Well, there are disciples of mine who have rag robes, wearing shabby robes. They gather scraps from charnel grounds, rubbish dumps, and shops, make them into a patchwork robe and wear it.	NA
mn77:9.5	But sometimes I wear robes offered by householders that are strong, yet next to which bottle-gourd down is coarse.	For Mahāsaṅgīti _satthalūkhāni_ accept PTS and BJT reading _yattha lūkhāni_. | _Alābu_ is “bottle gourd”, which is covered in a fine down.

mn77:9.7	Suppose my disciples were loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of almsfood. Well, there are disciples of mine who eat only almsfood, wander indiscriminately for almsfood, happy to eat whatever they glean.

mn77:9.11	But sometimes I even stay in bungalows, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with doors fastened and windows shuttered.	NA
mn77:9.12	So if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of lodging, then those disciples who stay at the root of a tree would not be loyal to me.	NA
mn77:9.13	Suppose my disciples were loyal to me because I’m secluded and I praise seclusion. Well, there are disciples of mine who live in the wilderness, in remote lodgings. Having ventured deep into remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest, they live there, coming down to the midst of the Saṅgha each fortnight for the recitation of the monastic code.	NA
mn77:9.14	But sometimes I live crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their chief ministers, and monastics of other religions and their disciples.	NA
mn77:9.15	So if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because I’m secluded and praise seclusion, then those disciples who live in the wilderness would not be loyal to me.	NA
mn77:9.16	So, Udāyī, it’s not because of these five qualities that my disciples honor, respect, revere, and venerate me; and honoring and respecting me, they remain loyal to me.	NA
mn77:10.1	There are five other qualities because of which my disciples honor, respect, revere, and venerate me; and honoring and respecting me, they remain loyal to me.	NA
mn77:10.2	What five?	NA
mn77:10.3	Firstly, my disciples esteem me for the higher ethics:	NA
mn77:10.4	‘The ascetic Gotama is ethical. He possesses the entire spectrum of ethical conduct to the highest degree.’	NA
mn77:11.1	Since this is so,	NA
mn77:11.2	this is the first quality because of which my disciples are loyal to me.	NA
mn77:12.1	Furthermore, my disciples esteem me for my excellent knowledge and vision:	NA
mn77:12.2	‘The ascetic Gotama only claims to know when he does in fact know.	NA
mn77:12.3	He only claims to see when he really does see.	NA
mn77:12.4	He teaches based on direct knowledge, not without direct knowledge.	NA
mn77:12.5	He teaches based on reason, not without reason.	NA
mn77:12.6	He teaches with a demonstrable basis, not without it.’	This is a good example of why _sappāṭihāriya_ means “with demonstrable basis”, not “with miracles”.
mn77:12.7	Since this is so,	NA

mn77:13.2	‘The ascetic Gotama is wise. He possesses the entire spectrum of wisdom to the highest degree.	NA
mn77:13.3	It’s not possible that he would fail to foresee grounds for future criticism, or to legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up.’	_Vādapatha_ is found here and at [an4.8:5.1]() in the sense of “criticism”. Compare _vacanapatha_, which is always used in the sense of “harsh words”, “criticism” (eg. [an4.114:9.2]()). Compare English “give a talking to”, “have words with”. At [snp5.7:8.5](), however, _vādapatha_ is used in the sense “ways of speech”.
mn77:13.4	What do you think, Udāyī?	NA
mn77:13.5	Would my disciples, knowing and seeing this, break in and interrupt me?”	NA
mn77:13.6	“No, sir.”	NA
mn77:13.7	“That’s because I don’t expect to be instructed by my disciples.	NA

mn77:13.11	NA	NA
mn77:13.12	NA	NA
mn77:13.13	this is the third quality because of which my disciples are loyal to me.	NA
mn77:14.1	Furthermore, my disciples come to me and ask how the noble truth of suffering applies to the suffering in which they are swamped and mired. And I provide them with a satisfying answer to their question.	The Buddha does not merely teach a satisfying theory, he applies it to address the specific suffering with which individuals are afflicted (_yena dukkhena dukkhotiṇṇā_).
mn77:14.2	They ask how the noble truths of the origin of suffering,	NA
mn77:14.3	the cessation of suffering,	NA
mn77:14.4	and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering apply to the suffering  in which they are swamped and mired. And I provide them with satisfying answers to their questions.	NA

mn77:15.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.	The fifth quality as presented here constitutes one of the most comprehensive presentations of meditation in any early Buddhist text. The Chinese parallel (MA 207 at T i 783b16) simply says that the Buddha taught disciples to transcend doubt and reach the far shore, which makes the same point far more economically. It seems likely that the Pali text has been expanded. | From here through to [mn77:21.3]() the Buddha presents the seven sets of practices later renowned as the 37 “qualities that lead to awakening” (_bodhipakkhiyadhammā_).
mn77:15.2	It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
mn77:15.3	They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …	NA
mn77:15.4	mind …	NA
mn77:15.5	principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
mn77:15.6	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	“Perfection” is _pāramī_, here a term for arahantship. The concept of “perfections” as a set of qualities developed by a Bodhisattva over many lifetimes is not found in any early text. It was introduced several centuries after the Buddha in the Cariyāpiṭaka ([cp1]()) and throughout the latest texts of the Pali canon ([bv1:78.1](), [thi-ap28:64.2](), [kp8:15.2](), [pli-tv-pvr3:3.2](), [mil5.1.4:13.1]()). Similar conceptions were meanwhile developing in other schools, eventually becoming a key doctrine of Mahāyāna.
mn77:16.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the four right efforts.	NA
mn77:16.2	It’s when a mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise.	NA
mn77:16.3	They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up.	NA
mn77:16.4	They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities arise.	NA
mn77:16.5	They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are fulfilled by development.	NA
mn77:16.6	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	NA
mn77:17.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the four bases of psychic power.	NA
mn77:17.2	It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort.	NA
mn77:17.3	They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy, and active effort.	NA
mn77:17.4	They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to mental development, and active effort.	NA

mn77:18.3	energy,	NA
mn77:18.4	mindfulness,	NA

mn77:20.9	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	NA
mn77:21.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the noble eightfold path.	NA
mn77:21.2	It’s when a mendicant develops right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.	NA
mn77:21.3	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	NA
mn77:22.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the eight liberations.	The eight liberations (_vimokkhā_) are an alternative way of describing the meditative experiences of _jhāna_. Elsewhere they are listed at [dn15:35.1](), [dn16:3.33.1](), [dn33:3.1.168](), [dn34:2.1.191](), [an:8.66](), and referred to at [an4.189:1.8]() and [thag20.1:33.1](). At [an8.120]() and [mn137:27.1]() they are listed but not called the eight liberations.
mn77:22.2	Having physical form, they see forms.	Someone sees a meditative vision based on the perception of their own body, such as through mindfulness of breathing or one’s own body parts. Such “visions” or “forms” (_rūpā_) are the lights or other meditation phenomena that today are sometimes called _nimitta_. | The first three liberations all cover the four _jhānas_.
mn77:22.3	This is the first liberation.	NA
mn77:22.4	Not perceiving form internally, they see forms externally.	A meditator grounds their practice on some external focus, such as a light, the sight of a corpse, or an external element such as earth.
mn77:22.5	This is the second liberation.	NA
mn77:22.6	They’re focused only on beauty.	This is a practice based on wholly pure and exalted meditation, such as the meditation on love, or the sight of a pure brilliant color like the sky.
mn77:22.7	This is the third liberation.	NA
mn77:22.8	Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space.	NA
mn77:22.9	This is the fourth liberation.	NA
mn77:22.10	Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness.	NA
mn77:22.11	This is the fifth liberation.	NA
mn77:22.12	Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness.	NA
mn77:22.13	This is the sixth liberation.	NA
mn77:22.14	Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	NA
mn77:22.15	This is the seventh liberation.	NA
mn77:22.16	Going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling.	NA
mn77:22.17	This is the eighth liberation.	NA
mn77:22.18	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	NA
mn77:23.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the eight dimensions of mastery.	These are another way of describing the different experiences of _jhāna_. Also at [an8.65](), [an10.29:6.1](), [dn16:3.24.1](), [dn33:3.1.142](), and [dn34:2.1.160]().
mn77:23.2	Perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally, limited, both pretty and ugly.	An “ugly” form is the mental image that arises in such contemplations as the parts of the body. A “beautiful” image arises from practices such as mindfulness of breathing.
mn77:23.3	Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’	NA
mn77:23.4	This is the first dimension of mastery.	NA
mn77:23.5	Perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally, limitless, both pretty and ugly.	NA
mn77:23.6	Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’	NA
mn77:23.7	This is the second dimension of mastery.	NA
mn77:23.8	Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally, limited, both pretty and ugly.	NA
mn77:23.9	Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’	NA
mn77:23.10	This is the third dimension of mastery.	NA
mn77:23.11	Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally, limitless, both pretty and ugly.	NA
mn77:23.12	Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’	NA
mn77:23.13	This is the fourth dimension of mastery.	NA
mn77:23.14	Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally, blue, with blue color and blue appearance.	This is the meditation where one contemplates an external color, either a prepared disk or a natural phenomena such as the sky or a flower, which eventually gives rise to a “counterpart” image. Today such meditations are called _kasiṇa_ following the Visuddhimagga, but for the original sense of _kasiṇa_ see below ([mn77:24.1]()).
mn77:23.15	They’re like a flax flower that’s blue, with blue color and blue appearance. Or a cloth from Varanasi that’s smoothed on both sides, blue, with blue color and blue appearance.	NA
mn77:23.16	In the same way, not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally, blue, with blue color and blue appearance.	NA
mn77:23.17	Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’	NA
mn77:23.18	This is the fifth dimension of mastery.	NA
mn77:23.19	Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally that are yellow, with yellow color and yellow appearance.	NA
mn77:23.20	They’re like a champak flower that’s yellow, with yellow color and yellow appearance. Or a cloth from Varanasi that’s smoothed on both sides, yellow, with yellow color and yellow appearance.	NA
mn77:23.21	In the same way, not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally that are yellow, with yellow color and yellow appearance.	NA
mn77:23.22	Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’	NA
mn77:23.23	This is the sixth dimension of mastery.	NA
mn77:23.24	Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally that are red, with red color and red appearance.	NA
mn77:23.25	They’re like a scarlet mallow flower that’s red, with red color and red appearance. Or a cloth from Varanasi that’s smoothed on both sides, red, with red color and red appearance.	NA
mn77:23.26	In the same way, not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally that are red, with red color and red appearance.	NA
mn77:23.27	Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’	NA
mn77:23.28	This is the seventh dimension of mastery.	NA
mn77:23.29	Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally that are white, with white color and white appearance.	NA
mn77:23.30	They’re like the morning star that’s white, with white color and white appearance. Or a cloth from Varanasi that’s smoothed on both sides, white, with white color and white appearance.	NA
mn77:23.31	In the same way, not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally that are white, with white color and white appearance.	NA
mn77:23.32	Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’	NA
mn77:23.33	This is the eighth dimension of mastery.	NA
mn77:23.34	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	NA
mn77:24.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the ten universal dimensions of meditation.	NA
mn77:24.2	Someone perceives the meditation on universal earth above, below, across, undivided and limitless.	NA
mn77:24.3	They perceive the meditation on universal water …	NA
mn77:24.4	the meditation on universal fire …	NA
mn77:24.5	the meditation on universal air …	NA
mn77:24.6	the meditation on universal blue …	NA
mn77:24.7	the meditation on universal yellow …	NA
mn77:24.8	the meditation on universal red …	NA
mn77:24.9	the meditation on universal white …	NA
mn77:24.10	the meditation on universal space …	NA
mn77:24.11	the meditation on universal consciousness above, below, across, undivided and limitless.	That Pali _kasiṇa_ (Sanskrit _kṛtsna_) means “universal”, “totality” is shown by this passage where it is “undivided and limitless”. It is a name for the state of absorption, not for the meditation disk used in preliminary practice. Yājñavalkya says that, just as salt is “entirely” salty, the Self is an “entire mass of consciousness” (_kṛtsnaḥ prajñānaghana eva_, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.5.13).
mn77:24.12	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	NA
mn77:25.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the four absorptions.	From here, the text introduces the absorptions and higher knowledges, illustrated as in [dn2]() with a few differing similes. The absorptions and three higher knowledges also appear with similes at [mn39]().
mn77:25.2	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn77:25.3	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.	As a meditator proceeds, their subjective experience of the “body” evolves from tactile sense impressions (_phoṭṭhabba_), to the interior mental experience of bliss and light (_manomayakāya_), to the direct personal realization of highest truth ([mn70:23.2](): _kāyena ceva paramasaccaṁ sacchikaroti_).
mn77:25.4	It’s like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out.	The kneading is the “placing the mind and keeping it connected”, the water is bliss, while the lack of leaking speaks to the contained interiority of the experience.
mn77:25.5	In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.	NA
mn77:26.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption. It has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn77:26.2	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion.	NA
mn77:26.3	It’s like a deep lake fed by spring water. There’s no inlet to the east, west, north, or south, and the heavens would not properly bestow showers from time to time.	Again the simile emphasizes the water as bliss, while the lack of inflow expresses containment and unification.
mn77:26.4	But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads throughout the lake. There’s no part of the lake that’s not spread through with cool water.	The water welling up is the rapture, which is the uplifting emotional response to the experience of bliss.
mn77:26.5	In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion.	NA
mn77:27.1	Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption. They meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA
mn77:27.2	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture.	NA
mn77:27.3	It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. From the tip to the root they’re drenched, steeped, filled, and soaked with cool water. There’s no part of them that’s not soaked with cool water.	The meditator is utterly immersed in stillness and bliss.
mn77:27.4	In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture.	NA
mn77:28.1	Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption. It is without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
mn77:28.2	They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind.	The equanimity of the fourth _jhāna_ is not dullness and indifference, but a brilliant and radiant awareness.
mn77:28.3	It’s like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread over with white cloth.	The white cloth is the purity and brightness of equanimity. The commentary explains this as a person who has just got out of a bath and sits perfectly dry and content.
mn77:28.4	In the same way, they sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind.	NA
mn77:28.5	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	NA
mn77:29.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to understand this:	Here these practices are simply listed one after another, but normally the following knowledges are said to be made possible by the fourth absorption (eg. [dn2:83.1]()). | The first two knowledges—“knowledge and vision” of the mind attached to body, and the mind-made body—are found only here, [dn2:83.1](), and [dn10:2.21.3]().
mn77:29.2	‘This body of mine is formed. It’s made up of the four principal states, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction.	This is the “coarse” (_olārika_) body. The obvious impermanence of the body invites the tempting but fallacious notion that the mind or soul is permanent, which is dispelled by deeper insight.
mn77:29.3	And this consciousness of mine is attached to it, tied to it.’	This distinction should not be mistaken for mind-body dualism. These are not fundamental substances but experiences of a meditator.
mn77:29.4	Suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent and clear, endowed with all good qualities.	NA
mn77:29.5	And it was strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown.	NA
mn77:29.6	And someone with clear eyes were to take it in their hand and check it:	NA
mn77:29.7	‘This beryl gem is naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent and clear, endowed with all good qualities.	NA
mn77:29.8	And it’s strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown.’	Strung gems were loved in India from the time in the Harappan civilization, millennia before the Buddha.
mn77:29.9	In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to understand this:	NA
mn77:29.10	‘This body of mine is formed. It’s made up of the four principal states, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction.	NA
mn77:29.11	And this consciousness of mine is attached to it, tied to it.’	NA
mn77:29.12	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	NA
mn77:30.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to create from this body another body—formed, mind-made, whole in its major and minor limbs, not deficient in any faculty.	The “mind-made body” is the interior mental representation of the physical body. In ordinary consciousness it is proprioception, which here is enhanced by the power of meditation. The higher powers in Buddhism are regarded as extensions and evolutions of aspects of ordinary experience, not as metaphysical realities separate from the world of mundane experience. Note that it is still “physical” (_rūpī_) even though it is mind-made. This is the subtle (_sukhuma_) body, which is an energetic experience of physical properties by the mind. | _Sabbaṅga_ has the sense “whole and healthy of limb” (Rig Veda 10.161.5c, Atharva Veda 8.2.8c, 11.3.32 ff.). One is reborn with “whole body” (_sarvatanu_, Atharva Veda 5.6.11c, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.1.8.60, 12.8.3.31). | _Paccaṅga_ means “minor limb”, for example the fingers or internal organs.
mn77:30.2	Suppose a person was to draw a reed out from its sheath.	NA
mn77:30.3	They’d think:	NA
mn77:30.4	‘This is the reed, this is the sheath. The reed and the sheath are different things. The reed has been drawn out from the sheath.’	NA
mn77:30.5	Or suppose a person was to draw a sword out from its scabbard.	NA
mn77:30.6	They’d think:	NA
mn77:30.7	‘This is the sword, this is the scabbard. The sword and the scabbard are different things. The sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.’	NA
mn77:30.8	Or suppose a person was to draw a snake out from its slough.	NA
mn77:30.9	They’d think:	NA
mn77:30.10	‘This is the snake, this is the slough. The snake and the slough are different things. The snake has been drawn out from the slough.’	NA
mn77:30.11	In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to create from this body another body—formed, mind-made, whole in its major and minor limbs, not deficient in any faculty.	NA
mn77:30.12	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	NA
mn77:31.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. They control the body as far as the realm of divinity.	“Psychic powers” (_iddhi_) were much cultivated in the Buddha’s day, but the means to acquire them varied: devotion to a god, brutal penances, or magic rituals. The Buddha taught that the mind developed in _samādhi_ was capable of things that are normally incomprehensible. Only a few of these are attested as events in the early texts. The most common is the ability to disappear and reappear, exhibited by the Buddha ([an8.30:2.1]()), some disciples ([mn37:6.1]()), and deities ([mn67:8.1]()).
mn77:31.2	Suppose a deft potter or their apprentice had some well-prepared clay. They could produce any kind of pot that they like.	These similes hark back to the descriptions of the purified mind as pliable and workable.
mn77:31.3	Or suppose a deft ivory-carver or their apprentice had some well-prepared ivory. They could produce any kind of ivory item that they like.	NA
mn77:31.4	Or suppose a deft goldsmith or their apprentice had some well-prepared gold. They could produce any kind of gold item that they like.	This simile is extended in detail at [an3.101]().
mn77:31.5	In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to wield the many kinds of psychic power …	NA
mn77:31.6	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	NA
mn77:32.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use so that, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and heavenly, whether near or far.	“Clairaudience” is a literal rendition of _dibbasota_. The root sense of _dibba_ is to “shine” like the bright sky or a divine being. The senses of clarity and divinity are both present. The Buddha occasionally used this ability for teaching, as at [mn75:6.1]().
mn77:32.2	Suppose there was a powerful horn blower. They’d easily make themselves heard in the four quarters.	This simile appears misplaced (see eg. [mn99:24.4]()). At [dn2:90.1]() we find the simile of being able to clearly identify sounds along the road, which fits better.
mn77:32.3	In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use so that, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and heavenly, whether near or far.	NA
mn77:32.4	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	NA
mn77:33.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind.	Note that the Indic idiom is not the “reading” of minds, which suggests hearing the words spoken in inner dialogue. While this is exhibited by the Buddha (eg. [an8.30:2.1]()), the main emphasis is on the comprehension of the overall state of mind.
mn77:33.2	They understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’,	NA
mn77:33.3	and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’;	NA
mn77:33.4	mind with hate as ‘mind with hate’,	NA
mn77:33.5	and mind without hate as ‘mind without hate’;	NA
mn77:33.6	mind with delusion as ‘mind with delusion’,	NA
mn77:33.7	and mind without delusion as ‘mind without delusion’;	NA
mn77:33.8	constricted mind as ‘constricted mind’,	NA
mn77:33.9	and scattered mind as ‘scattered mind’;	NA
mn77:33.10	expansive mind as ‘expansive mind’,	NA
mn77:33.11	and unexpansive mind as ‘unexpansive mind’;	NA
mn77:33.12	mind that is not supreme as ‘mind that is not supreme’,	NA
mn77:33.13	and mind that is supreme as ‘mind that is supreme’;	NA
mn77:33.14	mind immersed in samādhi as ‘mind immersed in samādhi’,	NA
mn77:33.15	and mind not immersed in samādhi as ‘mind not immersed in samādhi’;	NA
mn77:33.16	freed mind as ‘freed mind’,	NA
mn77:33.17	and unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’.	NA
mn77:33.18	Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water. If they had a spot they’d know ‘I have a spot’, and if they had no spots they’d know ‘I have no spots’.	Again the simile emphasizes how clear and direct the experience is. Without deep meditation, we have some intuitive sense for the minds of others, but it is far from clear.
mn77:33.19	In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind …	NA
mn77:33.36	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	NA
mn77:34.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to recollect the many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	Here begins the “three knowledges” (_tevijjā_), a subset of the six direct knowledges. The first two of these play an important role in deepening understanding of the nature of suffering in _saṁsāra_. | Empowered by the fourth _jhāna_, memory breaks through the veil of birth and death, revealing the vast expanse of time and dispelling the illusion that there is any place of eternal rest or sanctuary in the cycle of transmigration. The knowledge of these events is not hazy or murky, but clear and precise, illuminated by the brilliance of purified consciousness.
mn77:34.2	Suppose a person was to leave their home village and go to another village. From that village they’d go to yet another village. And from that village they’d return to their home village. They’d think: ‘I went from my home village to another village. There I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. From that village I went to yet another village. There too I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. And from that village I returned to my home village.’	The word for “past life” is _pubbanivāsa_, literally “former home”, and the imagery of houses is found in the second of the three knowledges as well. Recollection of past lives is as fresh and clear as the memory of a recent journey.
mn77:34.3	In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to recollect the many kinds of past lives.	NA
mn77:34.4	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	NA
mn77:35.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use so that, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	Here knowledge extends to the rebirths of others as well as oneself. Even more significant, it brings in the understanding of cause and effect; *why* rebirth happens the way it does. Such knowledge, however, is not infallible, as the Buddha warns in [dn1:2.5.3]() and [mn136](). The experience is one thing; the inferences drawn from it are another. One should draw conclusions only tentatively, after long experience. | “Clairvoyance” renders _dibbacakkhu_ (“celestial eye”), for which see Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.12.5, “the mind is its [the self’s] celestial eye” (_mano’sya daivaṁ cakṣuḥ_).
mn77:35.2	Suppose there were two houses with doors. A person with clear eyes standing in between them would see humans entering and leaving a house and wandering to and fro.	This simile is found in Majjhima at [mn39:20.3]() and [mn130:2.1](). A slightly different simile is found in the Dīgha at [dn2:96.1]() and [dn10:2.33.1]().
mn77:35.3	In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use so that, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn …	NA
mn77:35.4	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	NA
mn77:36.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.	This is the experience of awakening that is the true goal of the Buddhist path. The defilements—properties of the mind that create suffering—have been curbed by the practice of ethics and suppressed by the power of _jhāna_. Here they are eliminated forever.
mn77:36.2	Suppose that in a mountain glen there was a lake that was transparent, clear, and unclouded. A person with clear eyes standing on the bank would see the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel, and schools of fish swimming about or staying still. They’d think: ‘This lake is transparent, clear, and unclouded. And here are the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel, and schools of fish swimming about or staying still.’	Once again the pool of water represents the mind, but now the meditator is not immersed in the experience, but looks back and reviews it objectively.
mn77:36.3	In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.	NA
mn77:36.4	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	NA
mn77:37.1	This is the fifth quality because of which my disciples are loyal to me.	NA
mn77:38.1	These are the five qualities because of which my disciples honor, respect, revere, and venerate me; and honoring and respecting me, they remain loyal to me.”	NA
mn77:38.2	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn77:38.3	Satisfied, the wanderer Sakuludāyī approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn78:0.1	Middle Discourses 78	NA
mn78:0.2	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta	NA
mn78:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn78:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn78:1.3	Now at that time the wanderer Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta was residing together with around five hundred wanderers in Mallikā’s single-halled monastery for philosophical debates, hedged by pale-moon ebony trees.	Uggāhamāna appears to have the sense “argumentative” found in the Sanskrit _udgrāha_ but not otherwise attested in Pali. Both sense and reading of Samaṇamaṇḍikā are unclear. He appears nowhere else. | Mallikā was the chief queen of Pasenadi, and her place is mentioned in a similar context at [dn9:1.3](). The commentary explains that the brahmins, Jains, and others would assemble there to “debate their beliefs” (_samayaṁ pavadanti_), a rare early usage of _samaya_ in this sense. | Read _ācīra_ in the sense of “boundary, hedge” (Commentary: _timbarūrukkhapantiyā parikkhittattā_; cf. Sanskrit _prācīra_, “enclosure, hedge, fence, wall”).
mn78:2.1	Then the chamberlain Pañcakaṅga left Sāvatthī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha.	Previously featuring in [mn59:1.3]().
mn78:2.2	It occurred to him,	NA
mn78:2.3	“It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha,	NA
mn78:2.4	as he’s in retreat.	NA
mn78:2.5	And it’s the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicants,	NA
mn78:2.6	as they’re in retreat.	NA
mn78:2.7	Why don’t I go to Mallikā’s monastery to visit the wanderer Uggāhamāna?”	NA
mn78:2.8	So that’s what he did.	NA
mn78:3.1	Now at that time, Uggāhamāna was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as	NA
mn78:3.2	talk about kings, bandits, and chief ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence.	NA
mn78:3.3	Uggāhamāna saw Pañcakaṅga coming off in the distance,	NA
mn78:3.4	and hushed his own assembly,	NA
mn78:3.5	“Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound.	NA
mn78:3.6	Here comes Pañcakaṅga, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama.	NA
mn78:3.7	He is included among the white-clothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing in Sāvatthī.	NA
mn78:3.8	Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet.	NA
mn78:3.9	Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”	NA
mn78:3.10	Then those wanderers fell silent.	NA
mn78:4.1	Then Pañcakaṅga approached Uggāhamāna, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn78:4.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Uggāhamāna said to him:	NA
mn78:5.1	“Householder, when an individual has four qualities I describe them as an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment.	The “invincible ascetic” (_samaṇaṁ ayojjhaṁ_) appears only here. The Sanskrit _ayodhya_ occurs in the Atharva Veda as an epithet of Indra (19.13.7) and of the gods’ “impregnable” fortress (10.2.31). It seems to be a special term for an enlightened being in Uggāhamāna’s system; compare Upaka’s “Infinite Victor” (_anantajina_) of [mn26:25.22]().
mn78:5.2	What four?	NA
mn78:5.3	It’s when they do no bad deeds with their body; speak no bad words; think no bad thoughts; and don’t earn a living by bad livelihood.	NA
mn78:5.4	When an individual has these four qualities I describe them as an invincible ascetic.”	NA
mn78:6.1	Then Pañcakaṅga neither approved nor dismissed the wanderer Uggāhamāna’s statement.	NA
mn78:6.2	He got up from his seat, thinking,	NA
mn78:6.3	“I will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.”	NA
mn78:7.1	Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,	NA
mn78:7.2	and informed the Buddha of all that had been discussed.	NA
mn78:8.1	When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,	NA
mn78:8.2	“Chamberlain, if what Uggāhamāna says is true, a little baby boy is an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment.	NA
mn78:8.3	For a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘a body’, so how could they possibly do a bad deed with their body, aside from just wriggling?	NA
mn78:8.4	And a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘speech’, so how could they possibly speak bad words, aside from just crying?	NA
mn78:8.5	And a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘thought’, so how could they possibly think bad thoughts, aside from just whimpering?	NA
mn78:8.6	And a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘livelihood’, so how could they possibly earn a living by bad livelihood, aside from their mother’s breast?	NA
mn78:8.7	If what Uggāhamāna says is true, a little baby boy is an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment.	NA
mn78:8.8	When an individual has four qualities I describe them, not as an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment—but as having achieved the same level as a little baby.	NA
mn78:8.9	What four?	NA
mn78:8.10	It’s when they do no bad deeds with their body; speak no bad words; think no bad thoughts; and don’t earn a living by bad livelihood.	NA
mn78:8.11	When an individual has these four qualities I describe them, not as an invincible ascetic, but as having achieved the same level as a little baby.	NA
mn78:9.1	When an individual has ten qualities, chamberlain, I describe them as an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment.	NA

mn79:0.1	Middle Discourses 79	NA
mn79:0.2	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī	NA
mn79:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn79:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
mn79:1.3	Now at that time the wanderer Sakuludāyī was residing together with a large assembly of wanderers in the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground.	NA
mn79:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.	NA
mn79:2.2	Then it occurred to him,	NA
mn79:2.3	“It’s too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha.	NA
mn79:2.4	Why don’t I visit the wanderer Sakuludāyī at the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground?”	NA
mn79:2.5	Then the Buddha went to the monastery of the wanderers.	NA
mn79:3.1	Now at that time, Sakuludāyī was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as	NA
mn79:3.2	talk about kings, bandits, and chief ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence.	NA
mn79:3.3	Sakuludāyī saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,	NA
mn79:3.4	and hushed his own assembly,	NA
mn79:3.5	“Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound.	NA
mn79:3.6	Here comes the ascetic Gotama.	NA
mn79:3.7	The venerable likes quiet and praises quiet.	NA
mn79:3.8	Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”	NA
mn79:3.9	Then those wanderers fell silent.	NA
mn79:4.1	Then the Buddha approached Sakuludāyī,	NA
mn79:4.2	who said to him,	NA
mn79:4.3	“Let the Blessed One come, sir!	NA
mn79:4.4	Welcome to the Blessed One, sir!	NA
mn79:4.5	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.	NA
mn79:4.6	Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”	NA
mn79:4.7	NA	NA
mn79:4.8	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,	NA
mn79:4.9	while Sakuludāyī took a low seat and sat to one side.	NA
mn79:4.10	The Buddha said to him,	NA
mn79:4.11	“Udāyī, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	NA
mn79:5.1	“Sir, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now.	NA
mn79:5.2	It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later.	NA
mn79:5.3	When I don’t come to the assembly, they sit and engage in all kinds of low talk.	NA
mn79:5.4	But when I have come to the assembly, they sit gazing up at my face alone, thinking,	Cp. [sn56.39:1.2](). At [dn2:35.2]() this is the attitude of a servant to the king.
mn79:5.5	‘Whatever the ascetic Udāyī teaches, we shall listen to it.’	The same phrase is used of the Buddha’s assembly at [mn77:6.64](), but with a different attitude: the Buddha’s assembly is poised expectantly, while Udāyī’s is gazing up at his face.
mn79:5.6	But when the Buddha has come to the assembly, both myself and the assembly sit gazing up at your face, thinking,	NA
mn79:5.7	‘Whatever the Buddha teaches, we shall listen to it.’”	NA
mn79:6.1	“Well then, Udāyī, suggest something for me to talk about.”	NA
mn79:6.2	“Sir, a few days ago someone was claiming to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus: ‘Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.’	NA
mn79:6.3	When I asked them a question about the past, they dodged the issue, distracted the discussion with irrelevant points, and displayed annoyance, hate, and bitterness.	NA
mn79:6.4	That reminded me of the Buddha:	For the Mahāsaṅgīti _sati_ (“reminded”), PTS reads _pīti_ here, but the phrase occurs at [mn89:4.2]() and [dn9:6.32](), both times with _sati_.
mn79:6.5	‘Surely it must be the Blessed One, the Holy One who is so skilled in such matters.’”	NA
mn79:6.6	“But Udāyī, who was it that made such a claim and behaved in such a way?”	NA
mn79:6.7	“It was the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan, sir.”	The same claim is recorded at [mn14:17.2]().
mn79:7.1	“Udāyī, someone who can recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details, might ask me a question about the past, or I might ask them a question about the past.	NA
mn79:7.2	And they might satisfy me with their answer, or I might satisfy them with my answer.	NA
mn79:7.3	Someone who, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds might ask me a question about the future, or I might ask them a question about the future.	NA
mn79:7.4	And they might satisfy me with their answer, or I might satisfy them with my answer.	NA
mn79:7.5	Nevertheless, Udāyī, leave aside the past and the future.	NA
mn79:7.6	I shall teach you the Dhamma:	NA
mn79:7.7	‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises.	The Buddha does not claim to see every fact and detail, but he comprehends the principle that underlies all suffering.
mn79:7.8	When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases.’”	NA
mn79:8.1	“Well sir, I can’t even recall with features and details what I’ve undergone in this incarnation.	_Attabhāva_ is literally “the state of the self”, and refers to the body in which consciousness has been incarnated. While _attā_ usually has a psychological or metaphysical sense, it sometimes means the “body”, a usage found also in the Sanskrit _ātman_ (eg. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.2.4).
mn79:8.2	How should I possibly recollect my many kinds of past lives with features and details, like the Buddha?	NA
mn79:8.3	For I can’t even see a mud-goblin right now.	The curious mud-goblin (_paṁsupisācaka_) is similarly mentioned at [ud4.4:7.3]().
mn79:8.4	How should I possibly, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, see sentient beings passing away and being reborn, like the Buddha?	NA
mn79:8.5	But then the Buddha told me,	NA
mn79:8.6	‘Nevertheless, Udāyī, leave aside the past and the future.	NA
mn79:8.7	I shall teach you the Dhamma:	NA
mn79:8.8	“When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises.	NA
mn79:8.9	When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases.”’ But that is even more unclear to me.	NA
mn79:8.10	Perhaps I might satisfy the Buddha by answering a question about my own tradition.”	NA
mn79:9.1	“But Udāyī, what is your own tradition?”	NA
mn79:9.2	“Sir, it’s this:	NA
mn79:9.3	‘This is the ultimate splendor, this is the ultimate splendor.’”	For more on this theory see note on [mn80:2.4]().
mn79:9.4	“But what is that ultimate splendor?”	NA
mn79:9.5	NA	NA
mn79:9.6	“Sir, the ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.”	NA
mn79:9.7	“But what is that ultimate splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer?”	NA
mn79:9.8	“Sir, the ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.”	NA
mn79:10.1	“Udāyī, you could draw this out for a long time.	NA
mn79:10.2	You say, ‘The ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.’ But you don’t describe that splendor.	NA
mn79:10.3	Suppose a man was to say,	NA
mn79:10.4	‘Whoever the finest lady in the land is, it is her that I want, her I desire!’	NA
mn79:10.5	They’d say to him,	NA
mn79:10.6	‘Worthy man, that finest lady in the land who you desire—do you know whether she’s an aristocrat, a brahmin, a peasant, or a menial?’	NA
mn79:10.7	Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’	NA
mn79:10.8	They’d say to him,	NA
mn79:10.9	‘Worthy man, that finest lady in the land who you desire—do you know her name or clan? Whether she’s tall or short or medium? Whether her skin is black, brown, or tawny? What village, town, or city she comes from?’	NA
mn79:10.10	Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’	NA
mn79:10.11	They’d say to him,	NA
mn79:10.12	‘Worthy man, do you desire someone who you’ve never even known or seen?’	NA
mn79:10.13	Asked this, he’d say, ‘Yes.’	NA
mn79:10.14	What do you think, Udāyī?	NA
mn79:10.15	This being so, doesn’t that man’s statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?”	NA
mn79:10.16	“Clearly that’s the case, sir.”	NA
mn79:10.17	“In the same way, you say, ‘The ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.’ But you don’t describe that splendor.”	NA
mn79:11.1	“Worthy sir, suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked. When placed on a cream rug it would shine and glow and radiate. Such is the splendor of the self that is free of disease after death.”	The statement on the “splendor of the self after death” is not found in the parallel at MA 208.
mn79:12.1	“What do you think, Udāyī?	NA
mn79:12.2	Which of these two has a finer splendor: such a beryl gem, or a firefly in the dark of night?”	NA
mn79:12.3	“A firefly in the dark of night, sir.”	NA
mn79:13.1	“What do you think, Udāyī?	NA
mn79:13.2	Which of these two has a finer splendor: a firefly in the dark of night, or an oil lamp in the dark of night?”	NA
mn79:13.3	“An oil lamp in the dark of night, sir.”	NA
mn79:14.1	“What do you think, Udāyī?	NA
mn79:14.2	Which of these two has a finer splendor: an oil lamp in the dark of night, or a great mass of fire in the dark of night?”	NA
mn79:14.3	“A great mass of fire in the dark of night, sir.”	NA
mn79:15.1	“What do you think, Udāyī?	NA
mn79:15.2	Which of these two has a finer splendor: a great mass of fire in the dark of night, or the Morning Star in the clear and cloudless heavens at the crack of dawn?”	NA
mn79:15.3	“The Morning Star in the clear and cloudless heavens at the crack of dawn, sir.”	NA
mn79:16.1	“What do you think, Udāyī?	NA
mn79:16.2	Which of these two has a finer splendor: the Morning Star in the clear and cloudless heavens at the crack of dawn, or the full moon at midnight in the clear and cloudless heavens on the fifteenth day sabbath?”	NA
mn79:16.3	“The full moon at midnight in the clear and cloudless heavens on the fifteenth day sabbath, sir.”	NA
mn79:17.1	“What do you think, Udāyī?	NA
mn79:17.2	Which of these two has a finer splendor: the full moon at midnight in the clear and cloudless heavens on the fifteenth day sabbath, or the sun at midday in the clear and cloudless heavens in the last month of the rainy season, in autumn?”	NA
mn79:17.3	“The sun at midday in the clear and cloudless heavens in the last month of the rainy season, in autumn, sir.”	NA
mn79:18.1	“Beyond this, Udāyī, I know very many gods on whom the light of the sun and moon makes no impression.	_Ābhā nanubhonti_ (“light makes no impression”) is glossed as _obhāsaṁ na vaḷañjanti_, “does not partake of the light”. At [an4.127:1.4]() the same phrase, in regard to the space where the light of the sun does not reach, is glossed _pabhā nappahonti_, i.e. “light is ineffective”. Compare _ananubhūtaṁ_ at [mn49:11.1]().
mn79:18.2	Nevertheless, I do not say:	NA
mn79:18.3	‘The splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.’	NA
mn79:18.4	But of the splendor inferior to a firefly you say, ‘This is the ultimate splendor.’ And you don’t describe that splendor.”	NA
mn79:19.1	“The Blessed One has cut short the discussion! The Holy One has cut short the discussion!”	NA
mn79:19.2	“But Udāyī, why do you say this?”	NA

mn79:19.4	“Sir, it says this in our own tradition:	NA
mn79:19.5	‘This is the ultimate splendor, this is the ultimate splendor.’	NA
mn79:19.6	But when pursued, pressed, and grilled on our own tradition, we turned out to be vacuous, hollow, and mistaken.”	NA
mn79:20.1	“But Udāyī, is there a world of perfect happiness? And is there a grounded practice for realizing a world of perfect happiness?”	NA
mn79:20.2	“Sir, it says this in our own tradition:	NA
mn79:20.3	‘There is a world of perfect happiness. And there is a grounded practice for realizing a world of perfect happiness.’”	NA
mn79:21.1	“Well, what is that grounded practice for realizing a world of perfect happiness?”	NA
mn79:21.2	“Sir, it’s when someone gives up killing living creatures, stealing, sexual misconduct, and lying. And they proceed having undertaken some kind of mortification.	_Vā_ here is conjunctive.
mn79:21.3	This is the grounded practice for realizing a world of perfect happiness.”	NA
mn79:22.1	“What do you think, Udāyī?	NA
mn79:22.2	On an occasion when someone refrains from killing living creatures, is their self perfectly happy at that time, or does it have both pleasure and pain?”	NA
mn79:22.3	“It has both pleasure and pain.”	NA

mn79:22.6	NA	NA

mn79:22.11	“What do you think, Udāyī?	NA
mn79:22.12	On an occasion when someone undertakes and follows some kind of mortification, is their self perfectly happy at that time, or does it have both pleasure and pain?”	NA
mn79:22.13	“It has both pleasure and pain.”	NA
mn79:22.14	“What do you think, Udāyī?	NA
mn79:22.15	Is a perfectly happy world realized by relying on a practice of mixed pleasure and pain?”	NA
mn79:23.1	“The Blessed One has cut short the discussion! The Holy One has cut short the discussion!”	NA
mn79:23.2	“But Udāyī, why do you say this?”	NA

mn79:23.4	“Sir, it says this in our own tradition:	NA
mn79:23.5	‘There is a world of perfect happiness. And there is a grounded practice for realizing a world of perfect happiness.’	“Grounded practice” is _ākāravatī paṭipadā_, for which compare the “grounded faith” (_ākāravatī saddhā_) of [mn47:16.1]() and [mn60:4.1]().
mn79:23.6	But when pursued, pressed, and grilled on our own tradition, we turned out to be vacuous, hollow, and mistaken.	NA
mn79:23.7	But sir, is there a world of perfect happiness? And is there a grounded practice for realizing a world of perfect happiness?”	NA
mn79:24.1	“There is a world of perfect happiness, Udāyī. And there is a grounded practice for realizing a world of perfect happiness.”	NA
mn79:24.2	“Well sir, what is that grounded practice for realizing a world of perfect happiness?”	NA
mn79:25.1	“It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption.	NA
mn79:25.2	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption.	NA
mn79:25.3	With the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption.	NA
mn79:25.4	This is the grounded practice for realizing a world of perfect happiness.”	NA
mn79:25.5	“Sir, that’s not the grounded practice for realizing a world of perfect happiness. At that point a perfectly happy world has already been realized.”	NA
mn79:25.6	“No, Udāyī, at that point a perfectly happy world has not been realized.	NA
mn79:25.7	This is the grounded practice for realizing a world of perfect happiness.”	NA
mn79:26.1	When he said this, Sakuludāyī’s assembly made an uproar, a dreadful racket,	NA
mn79:26.2	“In that case, we’re lost, and so are our traditional teachings! We’re lost, and so are our traditional teachings!	NA
mn79:26.3	We know nothing higher than this!”	NA
mn79:26.4	Then Sakuludāyī, having quieted those wanderers, said to the Buddha,	NA
mn79:27.1	“Well sir, at what point is a perfectly happy world realized?”	NA
mn79:27.2	“It’s when, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption.	NA
mn79:27.3	There are deities who have been reborn in a perfectly happy world. That mendicant associates with them, converses, and engages in discussion.	NA
mn79:27.4	It’s at this point that a perfectly happy world has been realized.”	NA
mn79:28.1	“Surely the mendicants must lead the spiritual life under the Buddha for the sake of realizing this perfectly happy world?”	NA
mn79:28.2	“No, Udāyī, the mendicants don’t lead the spiritual life under me for the sake of realizing this perfectly happy world.	NA
mn79:28.3	There are other things that are finer, for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me.”	NA
mn79:28.4	“But what are those finer things?”	NA
mn79:29-36.1	“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. …	NA
mn79:37.1	They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.	NA
mn79:37.2	Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption.	NA
mn79:37.3	This is one of the finer things for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me.	NA
mn79:38-40.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption …	NA

mn79:41.2	They recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	NA
mn79:41.3	This too is one of the finer things.	NA
mn79:42.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	NA
mn79:42.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	NA
mn79:42.3	This too is one of the finer things.	NA
mn79:43.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	NA

mn79:44.1	Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	NA
mn79:44.2	When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.	NA
mn79:44.3	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’	NA
mn79:44.4	This too is one of the finer things.	NA
mn79:44.5	These are the finer things for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me.”	NA
mn79:45.1	When he had spoken, Sakuludāyī said to the Buddha,	NA
mn79:45.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent!	NA
mn79:45.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
mn79:45.4	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
mn79:45.5	Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”	NA
mn79:46.1	When he said this, Sakuludāyī’s assembly said to him,	NA
mn79:46.2	“Worthy Udāyī, don’t lead the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama.	NA
mn79:46.3	You have been a tutor; don’t live as a pupil.	NA
mn79:46.4	You’ll end up like a water jar that turns into a water ladle.	“Water ladle” (_udañcanika_, variant _uddekanika_, commentary _udakavāraka_) is a unique term. Read _udañchanika_ in the sense “(ladle) for drawing water” (cp. Sanskrit _ākarṣa_ for Pali _añchana_). | The terms _udakamaṇika_ (“water jar”) and _udañchanika_ (“water ladle”) pun on Udāyī’s name.
mn79:46.5	Worthy Udāyī, don’t lead the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama.	NA
mn79:46.6	You have been a tutor; don’t live as a pupil.”	NA
mn79:46.7	And that’s how the wanderer Sakuludāyī’s own assembly prevented him from leading the spiritual life under the Buddha.	NA
mn80:0.1	Middle Discourses 80	NA
mn80:0.2	With Vekhanasa	NA
mn80:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn80:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn80:2.1	Then the wanderer Vekhanasa went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	Vekhanasa, the “descendant of Vikhānasa” was, according to the commentary, the teacher of Sakaludāyī and came to defend his teaching. The Vekhanasas were Vedic poets. They became known in later Sanskrit texts as an order of forest-dwelling ascetics, who evolved into the modern Vaikhānasa Vishnavite tradition. This sutta may be the earliest reference to a tradition of Vekhanasa ascetics, creating a link between the Vedic poets and the later tradition. The Buddha calls him by his personal or clan name Kaccāna.
mn80:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side,	NA
mn80:2.3	and expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
mn80:2.4	“This is the ultimate splendor, this is the ultimate splendor.”	The Rig Veda features two Vaikhānasa poems, one of which describes Soma as “most resplendent” (_śubhraśastamaḥ_, Rig Veda 9.66.26), a phrase notably parallel in meaning to the Pali “ultimate splendor” (_paramo vaṇṇo_). These verses are rich with similar imagery: Soma is a “gleaming light” (24) whose “glittering drops” “flash with radiance” (25), “pervading with rays” (27), a “heaven-bright milk” (30). This poem is ascribed to “a hundred Vaikhānasas”, suggesting that an order already existed at the time. Perhaps the Vekhanasa lineage developed their philosophy from these verses, which they had recited over so many centuries that the original referent, Soma, was forgotten.
mn80:2.5	“But Kaccāna, why do you say:	NA
mn80:2.6	‘This is the ultimate splendor, this is the ultimate splendor.’	NA
mn80:2.7	What is that ultimate splendor?”	NA
mn80:2.8	“Worthy Gotama, the ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.”	NA
mn80:2.9	“But what is that ultimate splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer?”	NA
mn80:2.10	“Worthy Gotama, the ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.”	NA
mn80:3.1	“Kaccāna, you could draw this out for a long time.	NA
mn80:3.2	You say, ‘The ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.’ But you don’t describe that splendor.	NA
mn80:3.3	Suppose a man was to say,	NA
mn80:3.4	‘Whoever the finest lady in the land is, it is her that I want, her I desire!’	NA
mn80:3.5	They’d say to him,	NA
mn80:3.6	‘Worthy man, that finest lady in the land who you desire—do you know whether she’s an aristocrat, a brahmin, a peasant, or a menial?’	NA
mn80:3.7	Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’	NA
mn80:3.8	They’d say to him,	NA
mn80:3.9	‘Worthy man, that finest lady in the land who you desire—do you know her name or clan? Whether she’s tall or short or medium? Whether her skin is black, brown, or tawny? What village, town, or city she comes from?’	NA
mn80:3.10	Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’	NA
mn80:3.11	They’d say to him,	NA
mn80:3.12	‘Worthy man, do you desire someone who you’ve never even known or seen?’	NA
mn80:3.13	Asked this, he’d say, ‘Yes.’	NA
mn80:3.14	What do you think, Kaccāna?	NA
mn80:3.15	This being so, doesn’t that man’s statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?”	NA
mn80:3.16	“Clearly that’s the case, worthy Gotama.”	NA
mn80:3.17	“In the same way, you say, ‘The ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.’ But you don’t describe that splendor.”	NA
mn80:4.1	“Worthy Gotama, suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked. When placed on a cream rug it would shine and glow and radiate. Such is the splendor of the self that is healthy after death.”	NA
mn80:5.1	“What do you think, Kaccāna?	NA
mn80:5.2	Which of these two has a finer splendor: such a beryl gem, or a firefly in the dark of night?”	NA
mn80:5.3	“A firefly in the dark of night.”	NA
mn80:6.1	“What do you think, Kaccāna?	NA
mn80:6.2	Which of these two has a finer splendor: a firefly in the dark of night, or an oil lamp in the dark of night?”	NA
mn80:6.3	“An oil lamp in the dark of night.”	NA
mn80:7.1	“What do you think, Kaccāna?	NA
mn80:7.2	Which of these two has a finer splendor: an oil lamp in the dark of night, or a great mass of fire in the dark of night?”	NA
mn80:7.3	“A great mass of fire in the dark of night.”	NA
mn80:8.1	“What do you think, Kaccāna?	NA
mn80:8.2	Which of these two has a finer splendor: a great mass of fire in the dark of night, or the Morning Star in the clear and cloudless heavens at the crack of dawn?”	NA
mn80:8.3	“The Morning Star in the clear and cloudless heavens at the crack of dawn.”	NA
mn80:9.1	“What do you think, Kaccāna?	NA
mn80:9.2	Which of these two has a finer splendor: the Morning Star in the clear and cloudless heavens at the crack of dawn, or the full moon at midnight in the clear and cloudless heavens on the fifteenth day sabbath?”	NA
mn80:9.3	“The full moon at midnight in the clear and cloudless heavens on the fifteenth day sabbath.”	NA
mn80:10.1	“What do you think, Kaccāna?	NA
mn80:10.2	Which of these two has a finer splendor: the full moon at midnight in the clear and cloudless heavens on the fifteenth day sabbath, or the sun at midday in the clear and cloudless heavens in the last month of the rainy season, in autumn?”	NA
mn80:10.3	“The sun at midday in the clear and cloudless heavens in the last month of the rainy season, in autumn.”	NA
mn80:11.1	“Beyond this, Kaccāna, I know very many gods on whom the light of the sun and moon makes no impression.	NA
mn80:11.2	Nevertheless, I do not say:	NA
mn80:11.3	‘The splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.’	NA
mn80:11.4	But of the splendor inferior to a firefly you say, ‘This is the ultimate splendor.’ And you don’t describe that splendor.	NA
mn80:12.1	Kaccāna, there are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.	NA
mn80:12.2	What five?	NA
mn80:12.3	Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	NA
mn80:12.4	Sounds known by the ear …	NA
mn80:12.5	Smells known by the nose …	NA
mn80:12.6	Tastes known by the tongue …	NA
mn80:12.7	Touches known by the body, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	NA
mn80:12.8	These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	NA
mn80:13.1	The pleasure and happiness that arises from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasure.	NA
mn80:13.2	‘From the senses comes sensual pleasure. Beyond sensual pleasure is the pleasure that surmounts the sensual, which is said to be the best of these.’”	The introductory _iti_ (“so they say”) indicates that the Buddha is quoting a saying, which may not have originated with him. | The “pleasure that surmounts the sensual” (_kāmaggasukha_) is defined by the commentary as Nibbāna, which explains why the Buddha says below that only arahants can truly understand this saying ([mn80:14.8]()). | Compare with the passage on extracting cream of ghee, which uses parallel syntax ([dn9:52.1](), [sn34.1:1.9](), [an4.95:4.1]()).
mn80:14.1	When he said this, Vekhanasa said to the Buddha,	NA
mn80:14.2	“It’s incredible, worthy Gotama, it’s amazing!	NA
mn80:14.3	How well said this was by the worthy Gotama!	NA
mn80:14.4	‘From the senses comes sensual pleasure. Beyond sensual pleasure is the pleasure that surmounts the sensual, which is said to be the best of these.’	NA
mn80:14.5	Worthy Gotama, from the senses comes sensual pleasure. Beyond sensual pleasure is the pleasure that surmounts the sensual, which is said to be the best of these.”	NA
mn80:14.6	“Kaccāna, since you have a different view, creed, and belief, then, unless you dedicate yourself to practice with the guidance of tradition, it’s hard for you to understand	NA
mn80:14.7	the senses, sensual pleasure, and the pleasure that surmounts the sensual.	NA
mn80:14.8	There are mendicants who are perfected, who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and are rightly freed through enlightenment. They can understand	NA
mn80:14.9	the senses, sensual pleasure, and the pleasure that surmounts the sensual.”	NA
mn80:15.1	When he said this, Vekhanasa became angry and upset. He even attacked and badmouthed the Buddha himself, saying,	NA
mn80:15.2	“The ascetic Gotama will be worsted!” He said to the Buddha,	NA
mn80:15.3	“This is exactly what happens with some ascetics and brahmins. Not knowing the past or seeing the future, they nevertheless claim:	NA
mn80:15.4	‘We understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.”’	NA
mn80:15.5	Their statement turns out to be a joke—mere words, vacuous and hollow.”	NA
mn80:16.1	“Kaccāna, there are some ascetics and brahmins who, not knowing the past or seeing the future, nevertheless claim:	NA
mn80:16.2	‘We understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.”’	NA
mn80:16.3	There is a legitimate refutation of them.	NA
mn80:16.4	Nevertheless, Kaccāna, leave aside the past and the future.	NA
mn80:16.5	Let a sensible person come—neither devious nor deceitful, a person of integrity. I teach and instruct them.	NA
mn80:16.6	Practicing as instructed they will soon know and see for themselves,	NA
mn80:16.7	‘So this is how to be rightly released from the bond, that is, the bond of ignorance.’	NA
mn80:16.8	Suppose there was a little baby bound with swaddling up to the neck.	NA
mn80:16.9	As they grow up and their senses mature, they’re accordingly released from those bonds.	NA
mn80:16.10	They’d know ‘I’m released,’ and there would be no more bonds.	NA
mn80:16.11	In the same way, let a sensible person come—neither devious nor deceitful, a person of integrity. I teach and instruct them.	NA
mn80:16.12	Practicing as instructed they will soon know and see for themselves,	NA
mn80:16.13	‘So this is how to be rightly released from the bond, that is, the bond of ignorance.’”	NA
mn80:17.1	When he said this, Vekhanasa said to the Buddha,	NA
mn80:17.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! …	NA
mn80:17.3	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	NA
mn80:17.4	NA	NA

mn81:0.1	Middle Discourses 81	NA
mn81:0.2	With Ghaṭīkāra	NA
mn81:1.1	So I have heard.	This lively story is one of the most developed of the early canonical Jātakas. The popularity of the story is attested by the many parallels, which include a retelling of the story by the deity who had been Ghaṭīkāra ([sn1.50]()). Ghaṭīkāra’s virtues as an ideal lay follower are extolled; his kindness, faith, and contentment, and especially his practice of economic harmlessness through rejection of the contractual market economy.
mn81:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	NA
mn81:2.1	Then the Buddha left the road, and at a certain spot he smiled.	NA
mn81:2.2	Then Venerable Ānanda thought,	NA
mn81:2.3	“What is the cause, what is the reason why the Buddha smiled?	NA
mn81:2.4	Realized Ones do not smile for no reason.”	NA
mn81:2.5	So Ānanda arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,	NA
mn81:2.6	“What is the cause, what is the reason why the Buddha smiled?	NA
mn81:2.7	Realized Ones do not smile for no reason.”	NA
mn81:3.1	“Once upon a time, Ānanda, there was a market town in this spot named Vebhaliṅga. It was successful and prosperous, populous, full of humans.	Each of the occasions when the Buddha smiled in this way served as an introduction to an uplifting story of the past. In [mn83](), the Buddha tells of the fabled king Maghadeva of Mithilā, who went forth and practice the divine meditations. [an5.180](), like the current sutta, tells the story of a virtuous layperson in the time of Kassapa Buddha. Both the Kassapa stories are set in Kosala. | Vebhaliṅga is known only from this context and there are many variant readings. | Here the compound _gāmanigama_, elsewhere “village or town” clearly means “market town”. The same idiom is found in Sanskrit versions of this text (_vaibhiḍiṅgī nāma grāmanigamo_, Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya 17.390).
mn81:3.2	And Kassapa, a blessed one, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, lived supported by Vebhaliṅga.	NA
mn81:3.3	It was here, in fact, that he had his monastery,	NA
mn81:3.4	where he advised the mendicant Saṅgha while seated.”	NA
mn81:4.1	Then Ānanda spread out his outer robe folded in four and said to the Buddha,	NA
mn81:4.2	“Well then, sir, may the Blessed One sit here!	NA
mn81:4.3	Then this piece of land will have been occupied by two perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.”	NA
mn81:4.4	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out.	NA
mn81:4.5	When he was seated he said to Venerable Ānanda:	NA
mn81:5.1	“Once upon a time, Ānanda, there was a market town in this spot named Vebhaliṅga. It was successful and prosperous, populous, full of humans.	NA
mn81:5.2	And Kassapa, a blessed one, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, lived supported by Vebhaliṅga.	NA
mn81:5.3	It was here, in fact, that he had his monastery,	NA
mn81:5.4	where he advised the mendicant Saṅgha while seated.	NA
mn81:6.1	The Buddha Kassapa had as chief supporter in Vebhaliṅga a potter named Ghaṭīkāra.	NA
mn81:6.2	Ghaṭīkāra had a dear friend named Jotipāla, a student.	Various texts of the northern Sarvāstivāda movement, including the Madhyama-āgama and the Saṅghabhedavastu, speak instead of the potter Nandīpāla and the Brahmin youth Uttara. | Ghaṭīkāra (“potter”) Nandīpāla is also referred to by his clan name Bhaggava. | Jotipāla means “guardian of the sacred flame”, i.e. someone who maintains the Vedic fire ritual, as attested by another Jotipāla of the past ([dn19:47.26]()). Yet another Jotipāla was a religious founder of the past ([an6.54:18.1](), [an7.73:2.5]()). The name seems to appear only in Buddhist sources. Given that it is always in legendary contexts, it is probably a vocational epithet like Ghaṭīkāra.
mn81:6.3	Then Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla,	NA
mn81:6.4	‘Come, dear Jotipāla, let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	Kassapa (Sanskrit Kaśyapa) means “tortoise”. It is a common Brahmanical clan name, stemming from an ancient figure reckoned as the eldest of the “seven sages”, to whom some Vedic verses are attributed. Further details of the Buddha Kassapa’s time are found at [dn14:1.4.6](), [sn15.20:4.1](), and [sn48.57:3.1]().
mn81:6.5	For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’	_Sādhusammata_ is normally an epithet of (real or supposed) saints. Here it is the “sight” (_dassana_) of the saint that is deemed holy. This is an early example of the belief known in Hinduism as _darshana_, that the sight of a holy person, place, or object was auspicious and conveyed blessings on the seer. This topic is also treated at [snp4.4]() and [an6.30]().
mn81:6.6	When he said this, Jotipāla said to him,	NA
mn81:6.7	‘Enough, dear Ghaṭīkāra.	NA
mn81:6.8	What’s the use of seeing that shaveling, that fake ascetic?’	NA
mn81:6.9	For a second time …	NA
mn81:6.10	and a third time, Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla,	NA
mn81:6.11	‘Come, dear Jotipāla, let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn81:6.12	For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’	NA
mn81:6.13	For a third time, Jotipāla said to him,	NA
mn81:6.14	‘Enough, dear Ghaṭīkāra.	NA
mn81:6.15	What’s the use of seeing that shaveling, that fake ascetic?’	NA
mn81:6.16	‘Well then, dear Jotipāla, let’s take some bathing cleanser and go to the river to bathe.’	_Sotti_ is uncertain. I take it as from the root _suc_ in the sense “cleanser”. However, it may be related to Sanskrit _śukti_ (from the same root), which is mentioned by Varāhamihira as an ingredient in perfumed bath powders fit for a king (Bṛhat Saṁhitā 77). There, it is probably either powdered or ashen oyster shell, which is included as an exfoliant in some modern soaps, or else perfume from a plant whose leaves or flowers resemble oysters. The commentary, identifying it with the _kuruvindakasutti_ that was banned for mendicants at [pli-tv-kd15:1.3.18](), evidently derives it from _sutta_ (“string”) and explains it as a string of resin-balls compounded with _kuruvindaka_ (itself uncertain, possibly a herb). However, these explanations all seem dubious, as Pali texts treat _sotti_ as a normal means of washing, and should not require specialized ingredients or methods ([an3.70:8.2](), [mn93:10.5]()).
mn81:6.17	‘Yes, dear,’ replied Jotipāla.	NA
mn81:6.18	So that’s what they did.	NA
mn81:7.1	Then Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla,	NA
mn81:7.2	‘Dear Jotipāla, the Buddha Kassapa’s monastery is not far away.	NA
mn81:7.3	Let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn81:7.4	For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’	NA
mn81:7.5	When he said this, Jotipāla said to him,	NA
mn81:7.6	‘Enough, dear Ghaṭīkāra.	NA
mn81:7.7	What’s the use of seeing that shaveling, that fake ascetic?’	NA
mn81:7.8	For a second time …	NA
mn81:7.9	and a third time, Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla,	NA
mn81:7.10	‘Dear Jotipāla, the Buddha Kassapa’s monastery is not far away.	NA
mn81:7.11	Let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn81:7.12	For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’	NA
mn81:7.13	For a third time, Jotipāla said to him,	NA
mn81:7.14	‘Enough, dear Ghaṭīkāra.	NA
mn81:7.15	What’s the use of seeing that shaveling, that fake ascetic?’	NA
mn81:8.1	Then Ghaṭīkāra grabbed Jotipāla by the skirt-hem and said,	The _ovaṭṭikā_ is the turned-over hem of a skirt or sarong that holds it up (see [pli-tv-bu-vb-np10:1.2.7]()).
mn81:8.2	‘Dear Jotipāla, the Buddha Kassapa’s monastery is not far away.	NA
mn81:8.3	Let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn81:8.4	For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’	NA
mn81:8.5	So Jotipāla undid his skirt-hem and said to Ghaṭīkāra,	Leaving him, apparently, naked standing in the water.
mn81:8.6	‘Enough, dear Ghaṭīkāra.	NA
mn81:8.7	What’s the use of seeing that shaveling, that fake ascetic?’	NA
mn81:9.1	Then Ghaṭīkāra grabbed Jotipāla by the hair of his freshly-washed head and said,	Manusmṛti 4.83 forbids grabbing hair (_keśagraha_), which was an act of dominance in wrestling. It is forbidden in anger, notes Medhātithi’s commentary, but permitted in sex. Mahābhārata 5.91.11a beautifully explains how such rules are meant to be understood in context: “The learned regard him to be a wretch who does not by his solicitation seek to save a friend who is about to sink in calamity. Striving to the best of his might, even to the extent of seizing him by the hair, one should seek to dissuade a friend from an improper act. In that case, he that acts so, instead of incurring blame, reaps praise” (Kisari Mohan Ganguli’s translation, Section 93, Bhagavat-yāna Parva).
mn81:9.2	‘Dear Jotipāla, the Buddha Kassapa’s monastery is not far away.	NA
mn81:9.3	Let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn81:9.4	For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’	NA
mn81:9.5	Then Jotipāla thought,	NA
mn81:9.6	‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing,	NA
mn81:9.7	how this potter Ghaṭīkāra, though of lowly birth, should presume to grab me by the hair of my freshly-washed head!	Pottery is said to be a low craft at [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:2.1.30]().
mn81:9.8	This must be no ordinary matter.’	NA
mn81:9.9	He said to Ghaṭīkāra,	NA
mn81:9.10	‘You’d even milk it to this extent, dear Ghaṭīkāra?’	_Dohī_ is “milking”, as in _anavasesadohī_ “milk dry”, an idiom which is used in the sense of “pushing things too far” ([mn33:13.1](), [an11.17:12.1]()).
mn81:9.11	‘I even milk it to this extent, dear Jotipāla.	NA
mn81:9.12	For that is how holy I deem it to see that Blessed One.’	NA
mn81:9.13	‘Well then, dear Ghaṭīkāra, release me, we shall go.’	NA
mn81:10.1	Then Ghaṭīkāra the potter and Jotipāla the student went to the Buddha Kassapa. Ghaṭīkāra bowed and sat down to one side, but Jotipāla exchanged greetings with the Buddha and sat down to one side.	NA
mn81:10.2	Ghaṭīkāra said to the Buddha Kassapa,	NA
mn81:10.3	‘Sir, this is the student Jotipāla, my dear friend.	NA
mn81:10.4	Please teach him the Dhamma.’	NA
mn81:10.5	Then the Buddha Kassapa educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Ghaṭīkāra and Jotipāla with a Dhamma talk.	NA
mn81:10.6	Then they got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha Kassapa, keeping him on their right, before leaving.	NA
mn81:11.1	Then Jotipāla said to Ghatīkāra,	NA
mn81:11.2	‘Dear Ghaṭīkāra, you have heard this teaching, so why don’t you go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	NA
mn81:11.3	‘Don’t you know, dear Jotipāla, that I  provide for my blind old parents?’	NA
mn81:11.4	‘Well then, dear Ghaṭīkāra, I shall go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’	NA
mn81:12.1	Then Ghaṭīkāra and Jotipāla went to the Buddha Kassapa, bowed and sat down to one side. Ghaṭīkāra said to the Buddha Kassapa,	NA
mn81:12.2	‘Sir, this is the student Jotipāla, my dear friend.	NA
mn81:12.3	Please give him the going forth.’	NA
mn81:12.4	And Jotipāla the student received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	NA
mn81:13.1	Not long after Jotipāla’s ordination, a fortnight later, the Buddha Kassapa—having stayed in Vebhaliṅga as long as he pleased—set out for Varanasi.	Varanasi, one of the oldest cities in the world, was the capital of the Kāsī kingdom. It lost its status as an independent kingdom shortly before the Buddha, when it was taken over by Kosala. It appears in countless Buddhist stories of the past as the dominant city of the region in what appears to be a timeless and ageless past. However, despite its great antiquity, it is a historical settlement, of which the discovered remains date back to perhaps 1200 BCE; it was a capital city from perhaps 800 BCE. It would have enjoyed its status as a major city for a period of a few hundred years before the Buddha, during which time all these stories were set.
mn81:13.2	Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Varanasi,	NA
mn81:13.3	where he stayed near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana.	NA
mn81:14.1	King Kikī of Kāsi heard that he had arrived.	Kikī (“blue jay”) is also the king in the time of Kassapa at [dn14:1.12.20](). No king of this name appears to be attested in Puranic lineages. By the time of the Buddha, the much-conquered city of Varanasi was subject to first Kosala and then Magadha. This sutta establishes, however, that the true ancient king of the city was in fact a disciple of the past Buddha. | The suttas of this chapter all deal with kings in one way or another. Leaving aside the final five, all of which which Pasenadi of Kosala, we encounter royalty of of Kuru, Kāsī, Videha, Sūrasena, Bhaggā, and indirectly of Avanti and Kosambī. Thus the chapter serves to show that not just the well-known cases of Pasenadi and Bimbisāra, as well as the republican nations such as Vajjī and Sakya, were devoted to the Buddha, but the overwhelming majority of the kings of the time. Many, perhaps all, of these kings belong to what the Puranas later called the “lunar” dynasty, in contrast with the Buddha’s “solar” lineage.
mn81:14.2	He had the finest carriages harnessed. He then mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp from Varanasi to see the Buddha Kassapa.	NA
mn81:14.3	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the Buddha Kassapa on foot. He bowed and sat down to one side.	NA
mn81:14.4	The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk.	NA
mn81:14.5	Then King Kikī said to the Buddha,	NA
mn81:14.6	‘Sir, would the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?’	NA
mn81:14.7	The Buddha Kassapa consented with silence.	NA
mn81:15.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, King Kikī got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	NA
mn81:16.1	And when the night had passed, King Kikī had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home—soft saffron rice with the dark grains picked out, served with many soups and sauces. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	For “soft saffron rice” prefer the reading _paṇḍumudikassa_.
mn81:16.2	‘Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.’	NA
mn81:17.1	Then Kassapa Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of King Kikī, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.	NA
mn81:17.2	Then King Kikī served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	NA
mn81:17.3	When the Buddha Kassapa had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, King Kikī took a low seat and sat to one side.	NA
mn81:17.4	There he said to the Buddha Kassapa,	NA
mn81:17.5	‘Sir, may the Buddha please accept my invitation to reside in Varanasi for the rainy season.	NA
mn81:17.6	The Saṅgha will be looked after in the same style.’	The king is promising that the offerings for the whole Sangha will be as luxurious as the ones just offered.
mn81:17.7	‘Enough, great king.	NA
mn81:17.8	I have already accepted an invitation for the rains residence.’	NA
mn81:17.9	For a second time …	NA
mn81:17.10	and a third time King Kikī said to the Buddha Kassapa,	NA
mn81:17.11	‘Sir, may the Buddha please accept my invitation to reside in Varanasi for the rainy season.	NA
mn81:17.12	The Saṅgha will be looked after in the same style.’	NA
mn81:17.13	‘Enough, Great King.	NA
mn81:17.14	I have already accepted an invitation for the rains residence.’	NA
mn81:17.15	Then King Kikī, thinking, ‘The Buddha does not accept my invitation to reside for the rains in Varanasi,’ became sad and upset.	NA
mn81:17.16	Then King Kikī said to the Buddha Kassapa,	NA
mn81:17.17	‘Sir, do you have another supporter better than me?’	The Buddha does not take the bait of describing someone  as “better”; rather, he describes Ghaṭīkāra’s qualities.
mn81:18.1	‘Great king, there is a market town named Vebhaliṅga,	NA
mn81:18.2	where there is a potter named Ghaṭīkāra.	NA
mn81:18.3	He is my chief supporter.	NA
mn81:18.4	Now, great king, when you thought, “The Buddha does not accept my invitation to reside for the rains in Varanasi,” you became sad and upset.	NA
mn81:18.5	But Ghaṭīkāra doesn’t get upset, nor will he.	NA
mn81:18.6	Ghaṭīkāra has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.	NA
mn81:18.7	He doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.	NA
mn81:18.8	He has experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and has the ethics loved by the noble ones.	NA
mn81:18.9	He is free of doubt regarding suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.	This shows him to be one of the noble ones.
mn81:18.10	He eats in one part of the day; he’s chaste, ethical, and of good character.	This is equivalent to the eight precepts.
mn81:18.11	He has set aside gems and gold, and rejected gold and currency.	The same is said of Buddhist mendicants at [sn42.10:2.4](). This parallels the ten precepts of the _sāmaṇera_, which forbid using money ([pli-tv-kd1:56.1.14]()).
mn81:18.12	He has put down the shovel and doesn’t dig the earth with his own hands.	Also said of ancient Brahmanical hermits at [dn27:22.6](). Digging the earth is an offence for mendicants ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc10]()).
mn81:18.13	He takes what has crumbled off by a riverbank or been dug up by mice, and brings it back in a carrier. When he has made a pot, he says,	NA
mn81:18.14	“Anyone may leave bagged sesame, mung beans, or chickpeas here and take what they wish.”	He made a living by purely voluntary exchange rather than contractual obligations.
mn81:18.15	He provided for his blind old parents.	NA
mn81:18.16	And since he has ended the five lower fetters, Ghaṭīkāra will be reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.	He is a non-returner.
mn81:19.1	This one time, great king, I was staying near the market town of Vebhaliṅga.	NA
mn81:19.2	Then I robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, went to the home of Ghaṭīkāra’s parents, where I said to them,	NA
mn81:19.3	“Excuse me, where has Bhaggava gone?”	The Buddha uses Ghaṭīkāra’s clan name, as he does at [sn1.50:11.2]().
mn81:19.4	“Your supporter has gone out, sir. But take rice from the pot and sauce from the pan and eat.”	NA
mn81:19.5	So that’s what I did. And after eating I got up from my seat and left.	This appears to technically violate [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc40](), which requires that food be given with the hands, not simply by speech. However, not all Buddhas lay down the exact same Vinaya rules. Several parallels explain this by saying that Kassapa was following the customs of the mystical land of Uttarakuru (MA 63 at T i 502a19; T i 502b8; Saṅghabhedavastu 17:391 at Gnoli 1978a:27,14 and D (1) *’dul ba*, *ga* 8a3), where no-one had any possessions ([dn32:7.4]()).
mn81:19.6	Then Ghaṭīkāra went up to his parents and said,	NA
mn81:19.7	“Who took rice from the pot and sauce from the pan, ate it, and left?”	NA
mn81:19.8	“It was the Buddha Kassapa, my dear.”	NA
mn81:19.9	Then Ghaṭīkāra thought,	NA
mn81:19.10	“I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate,	NA
mn81:19.11	in that the Buddha Kassapa trusts me so much!”	NA
mn81:19.12	Then joy and happiness did not leave him for a fortnight, or his parents for a week.	NA
mn81:20.1	Another time, great king, I was staying near that same market town of Vebhaliṅga.	NA
mn81:20.2	Then I robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, went to the home of Ghaṭīkāra’s parents, where I said to them,	NA
mn81:20.3	“Excuse me, where has Bhaggava gone?”	NA
mn81:20.4	“Your supporter has gone out, sir. But take porridge from the pot and sauce from the pan and eat.”	NA
mn81:20.5	So that’s what I did. And after eating I got up from my seat and left.	NA
mn81:20.6	Then Ghaṭīkāra went up to his parents and said,	NA
mn81:20.7	“Who took porridge from the pot and sauce from the pan, ate it, and left?”	NA
mn81:20.8	“It was the Buddha Kassapa, my dear.”	NA
mn81:20.9	Then Ghaṭīkāra thought,	NA
mn81:20.10	“I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate,	NA
mn81:20.11	to be trusted so much by the Buddha Kassapa!”	NA
mn81:20.12	Then joy and happiness did not leave him for a fortnight, or his parents for a week.	NA
mn81:21.1	Another time, great king, I was staying near that same market town of Vebhaliṅga.	NA
mn81:21.2	Now at that time my hut leaked.	NA
mn81:21.3	So I addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn81:21.4	“Mendicants, go to Ghaṭīkāra’s home and find some grass.”	NA
mn81:21.5	When I said this, those mendicants said to me,	NA
mn81:21.6	“Sir, there’s no grass there, but his workshop has a grass roof.”	_Āvesana_ is found here and at [mn140:2.1]() of a potter’s workshop, at [pli-tv-kd15:11.5.15]() of a sewing hut, and is mentioned at Manu 9.264 as an “artisan’s workshop” (_kārukāveśana_).
mn81:21.7	“Then go to the workshop and strip the grass.”	NA
mn81:21.8	So that’s what they did.	NA
mn81:21.9	Then Ghaṭīkāra’s parents said to those mendicants,	NA
mn81:21.10	“Who’s stripping the grass from the workshop?”	NA
mn81:21.11	“It’s the mendicants, sister. The Buddha’s hut is leaking.”	NA
mn81:21.12	“Take it, sirs! Take it, dearest ones!”	NA
mn81:21.13	Then Ghaṭīkāra went up to his parents and said,	NA
mn81:21.14	“Who stripped the grass from the workshop?”	NA
mn81:21.15	“It was the mendicants, dear. It seems the Buddha’s hut is leaking.”	NA
mn81:21.16	Then Ghaṭīkāra thought,	NA
mn81:21.17	“I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate,	NA
mn81:21.18	to be trusted so much by the Buddha Kassapa!”	NA
mn81:21.19	Then joy and happiness did not leave him for a fortnight, or his parents for a week.	NA
mn81:21.20	Then the workshop remained with the atmosphere for a roof for the whole three months, but the heavens did not rain on it.	NA
mn81:21.21	And that, great king, is what Ghaṭīkāra the potter is like.’	NA
mn81:21.22	‘Ghaṭīkāra the potter is fortunate, very fortunate,	NA
mn81:21.23	to be so trusted by the Buddha Kassapa.’	NA
mn81:22.1	Then King Kikī sent around five hundred loads of rice, soft saffron rice, and suitable sauce to Ghaṭīkāra.	“Suitable sauce” (_tadupiyañca sūpeyyaṁ_) is also at [dn17:2.15.10]() and [sn22.96:4.10](), where it describes a similarly luxurious meal. | A secondary theme of this parable is to highlight the different attitudes to offering. Kikī is generous, but his offering is extravagant and indulgent, and ultimately serves his desires, whereas Ghaṭīkāra is concerned only to help with what is needed at the time.
mn81:22.2	Then one of the king’s men approached Ghaṭīkāra and said,	NA
mn81:22.3	‘Sir, these five hundred loads of rice, soft saffron rice, and suitable sauce have been sent to you by King Kikī of Kāsi.	NA
mn81:22.4	Please accept them.’	NA
mn81:22.5	‘The king has many duties, and much to do.	NA
mn81:22.6	I have enough.	The two words _alaṁ me_ encapsulate the radical basis of a Buddhist economy.
mn81:22.7	Let this be for the king himself.’	NA
mn81:23.1	Ānanda, you might think:	NA
mn81:23.2	‘Surely the student Jotipāla must have been someone else at that time?’	This phrase marks canonical Jātaka stories at [dn17:2.14.2](), [mn83:21.2](), [an3.15:5.2](), and [an9.20:5.2]().
mn81:23.3	But you should not see it like this.	NA
mn81:23.4	I myself was the student Jotipāla at that time.”	NA
mn81:23.5	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn81:23.6	Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn82:0.1	Middle Discourses 82	NA
mn82:0.2	With Raṭṭhapāla	NA
mn82:1.1	So I have heard.	The story of Raṭṭhapāla, the “guardian of the nation”, has become one of the most famous and beloved parables from early Buddhism. It is a testament to a young man’s resolution to go forth out of faith, a quality for which he was later honored ([an1.210:1.1]()). But the power of Raṭṭhapāla’s determination should not overshadow the moving conversation he has with King Koravya at the end.
mn82:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kurus together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Kurus named Thullakoṭṭhika.	Thullakoṭṭhika (“place of fat granaries”; Sanskrit _sthūlakoṣṭhaka_) only appears in the story of Raṭṭhapāla.
mn82:2.1	The brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhika heard:	NA
mn82:2.2	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Thullakoṭṭhika, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	NA
mn82:2.3	He has this good reputation:	NA
mn82:2.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
mn82:2.5	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	NA
mn82:2.6	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
mn82:2.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	NA
mn82:3.1	Then the brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhika went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.	NA
mn82:3.2	When they were seated, the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk.	NA
mn82:4.1	Now at that time a gentleman named Raṭṭhapāla, the son of the leading clan in Thullakoṭṭhika, was sitting in the assembly.	NA
mn82:4.2	He thought,	NA
mn82:4.3	“As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	From this point, the narrative is largely echoed in the story of Sudinna ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.7]()), with, however, a very different outcome. While the exact relationship between these shared narratives is not easy to determine, it seems likely that Sudinna’s story adopted elements of Raṭṭhapāla’s.
mn82:4.4	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from lay life to homelessness?”	NA
mn82:5.1	Then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, the brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhika got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving.	NA
mn82:6.1	Soon after they left, Raṭṭhapāla went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
mn82:6.2	“Sir, as I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	NA
mn82:6.3	I wish to shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn82:6.4	Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?	NA
mn82:6.5	May the Buddha please give me the going forth!”	NA
mn82:6.6	“But, Raṭṭhapāla, do you have your parents’ permission?”	This Vinaya rule is not mentioned elsewhere in the suttas, although it was required also of Sudinna ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.14]()). It was instituted on the emotional request of the Buddha’s own father, who was distraught when his grandson Rāhula went forth while still a boy ([pli-tv-kd1:54.4.2]()). It originally applied to novices, who went forth as young as fifteen or “when old enough to scare crows” ([pli-tv-kd1:51.1.14]()). Over time the requirements for ordination tend to become stricter as things required in a particular context are applied generally. If this is the case here, the process must have happened quickly, so that even in the canonical full ordination procedure a candidate, who must be twenty years at least, must have permission of their parents ([pli-tv-kd1:76.1.12]()). However, there are many people who cannot get such permission, such as orphans. Thus if one does give the going-forth to someone without permission of the parents, it is a minor offence of wrong-doing for the mendicant performing the ordination, but it does not invalidate it ([pli-tv-kd1:54.6.5]()).
mn82:6.7	“No, sir.”	NA
mn82:6.8	“Raṭṭhapāla, Buddhas don’t give the going forth to the child of parents who haven’t given their permission.”	NA
mn82:6.9	“I’ll make sure, sir, to get my parents’ permission.”	NA
mn82:7.1	Then Raṭṭhapāla got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha. Then he went to his parents and said,	NA
mn82:7.2	“Mum and dad, as I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	NA
mn82:7.3	I wish to shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn82:7.4	Please give me permission to go forth.”	NA
mn82:7.5	When he said this, Raṭṭhapāla’s parents said to him,	NA
mn82:7.6	“But, dear Raṭṭhapāla, you’re our only child. You’re dear to us and we love you. You’re dainty and raised in comfort.	NA
mn82:7.7	You know nothing of suffering.	NA
mn82:7.8	Even when you die we will lose you against our wishes.	NA
mn82:7.9	So how can we allow you to go forth while you’re still alive?”	NA
mn82:7.10	For a second time,	NA
mn82:7.11	and a third time, Raṭṭhapāla asked his parents for permission, but got the same reply.	NA
mn82:7.12	NA	NA

mn82:7.17	NA	NA
mn82:7.18	NA	NA
mn82:7.19	NA	NA
mn82:7.20	Then Raṭṭhapāla thought,	NA
mn82:7.21	“My parents don’t allow me to go forth.” He laid down right there on the bare ground, saying,	A similar method was employed by Bhaddā Kuṇḍalakesā, according to the commentary to [thig5.9](). She lay face down until her parents allowed her to marry the man she desired, who was, unfortunately, a convicted criminal. The marriage did not end well, but she persevered and ultimately triumphed.
mn82:7.22	“I’ll either die right here or go forth.”	NA
mn82:7.23	And he refused to eat, up to the seventh meal.	NA
mn82:8.1	Then Raṭṭhapāla’s parents said to him,	NA
mn82:8.2	“Dear Raṭṭhapāla, you’re our only child. You’re dear to us and we love you. You’re dainty and raised in comfort.	NA
mn82:8.3	You know nothing of suffering.	NA
mn82:8.4	When you die we will lose you against our wishes.	NA
mn82:8.5	So how can we allow you to go forth from lay life to homelessness while you’re still living?	NA
mn82:8.6	Get up, Raṭṭhapāla! Eat, drink, and amuse yourself.	NA
mn82:8.7	While enjoying sensual pleasures, delight in making merit.	NA
mn82:8.8	We don’t allow you to go forth.	NA
mn82:8.9	When you die we will lose you against our wishes.	NA
mn82:8.10	So how can we allow you to go forth while you’re still alive?”	NA
mn82:8.11	When they said this, Raṭṭhapāla kept silent.	NA

mn82:10.1	Then Raṭṭhapāla’s friends went to him and said,	NA
mn82:10.2	“Our friend Raṭṭhapāla, you are your parents’ only child. You’re dear to them and they love you. You’re dainty and raised in comfort.	NA

mn82:12.1	Raṭṭhapāla got up and regained his strength. He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
mn82:12.2	“Sir, I have my parents’ permission to go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn82:12.3	May the Buddha please give me the going forth.”	NA
mn82:13.1	And Raṭṭhapāla received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	NA
mn82:13.2	Not long after Venerable Raṭṭhapāla’s ordination, a fortnight later, the Buddha—having stayed in Thullakoṭṭhika as long as he pleased—set out for Sāvatthī.	NA
mn82:13.3	Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sāvatthī,	NA
mn82:13.4	where he stayed in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn82:14.1	Then Venerable Raṭṭhapāla, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	While the conventional phrase “soon” (_nacirasseva_) is used, the commentary says it was twelve years, which would explain why his family did not immediately recognize him.
mn82:14.2	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	NA
mn82:14.3	And Venerable Raṭṭhapāla became one of the perfected.	NA
mn82:15.1	Then he went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
mn82:15.2	“Sir, I would like to visit my parents, if the Buddha allows it.”	NA
mn82:15.3	Then the Buddha focused on comprehending Raṭṭhapāla’s mind.	NA
mn82:15.4	When he knew that	NA
mn82:15.5	it was impossible for Raṭṭhapāla to resign the training and return to a lesser life, he said,	NA
mn82:15.6	“Please, Raṭṭhapāla, go at your convenience.”	NA
mn82:16.1	And then Raṭṭhapāla got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Thullakoṭṭhika.	NA
mn82:16.2	Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Thullakoṭṭhika,	NA
mn82:16.3	where he stayed in King Koravya’s deer range.	NA
mn82:16.4	Then Raṭṭhapāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Thullakoṭṭhika for alms.	NA
mn82:16.5	Wandering indiscriminately for almsfood, he approached his own father’s house.	NA
mn82:17.1	Now at that time Raṭṭhapāla’s father was having his hair dressed in the hall of the middle gate.	This is a sign of the dandified life expected of Raṭṭhapāla. Hairstyles for upper class men of the time were quite fancy, or at least they are depicted so in the early sculptures at Sanchi.
mn82:17.2	He saw Raṭṭhapāla coming off in the distance	NA
mn82:17.3	and said,	NA
mn82:17.4	“Our dear and beloved only son was made to go forth by these shavelings, these fake ascetics!”	NA
mn82:17.5	And at his own father’s home Raṭṭhapāla received neither alms nor a polite refusal,	NA
mn82:17.6	but only abuse.	NA
mn82:18.1	Now at that time a family bondservant wanted to throw away the previous night’s porridge.	NA
mn82:18.2	So Raṭṭhapāla said to her,	NA
mn82:18.3	“If that’s to be thrown away, sister, pour it here in my bowl.”	NA
mn82:18.4	As she was pouring the porridge into his bowl, she recognized the features of his hands, feet, and voice.	This detail is remarkably similar to the *Odyssey* 19:361–475, where due to the marks on his feet, the maidservant Eurycleia recognizes Odysseus on his return even though his own wife did not.
mn82:18.5	She then went to his mother and said,	NA
mn82:18.6	“Please, madam, you should know this.	NA
mn82:18.7	Master Raṭṭhapāla has arrived.”	NA
mn82:18.8	“If you speak the truth, wench, I’ll make you a free woman!”	NA
mn82:18.9	Then Raṭṭhapāla’s mother went to his father and said,	NA
mn82:18.10	“Please householder, you should know this.	NA
mn82:18.11	It seems our son Raṭṭhapāla has arrived.”	NA
mn82:19.1	Now at that time Raṭṭhapāla was eating last night’s porridge by a wall.	NA
mn82:19.2	Then Raṭṭhapāla’s father went up to him and said,	NA
mn82:19.3	“Dear Raṭṭhapāla! How can you be eating last night’s porridge?	The same syntax recurs at [an5.166:11.2](), where it is clear the future tense expresses indignation rather than future time.
mn82:19.4	Why not go to your own home?”	In the Vinaya, the exchange between Raṭṭhapāla and his father is expressed in verse ([pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.5.1]()).
mn82:19.5	“Householder, how could those of us who have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness have a house?	NA
mn82:19.6	We are homeless, householder.	NA
mn82:19.7	I came to your house, but there I received neither alms nor a polite refusal,	NA
mn82:19.8	but only abuse.”	NA
mn82:19.9	“Come, dear Raṭṭhapāla, let’s go to the house.”	NA
mn82:19.10	“Enough, householder. My meal is finished for today.”	NA
mn82:19.11	“Well then, dear Raṭṭhapāla, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me.”	NA
mn82:19.12	Raṭṭhapāla consented with silence.	NA
mn82:20.1	Then, knowing that Raṭṭhapāla had consented, his father went back to his own house. He made a heap of gold, both coined and uncoined, and hid it under mats. Then he addressed Raṭṭhapāla’s former wives,	NA
mn82:20.2	“Please, daughters-in-law, adorn yourselves in the way that our son Raṭṭhapāla found you most adorable.”	NA
mn82:21.1	And when the night had passed Raṭṭhapāla’s father had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home, and announced the time to the Venerable Raṭṭhapāla, saying,	NA
mn82:21.2	“Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.”	NA
mn82:22.1	Then Raṭṭhapāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to his father’s home, and sat down on the seat spread out. Raṭṭhapāla’s father, revealing the heap of gold, both coined and uncoined, said to him,	NA
mn82:22.2	“Dear Raṭṭhapāla, this is your maternal fortune. There’s another paternal fortune, and an ancestral one.	NA
mn82:22.3	You can both enjoy your wealth and make merit.	NA
mn82:22.4	Come, return to a lesser life, enjoy wealth, and make merit!”	NA
mn82:22.5	“If you’d follow my advice, householder, you’d have this heap of gold, both coined and uncoined, loaded on a cart and carried away to be dumped in the middle of the Ganges river.	NA
mn82:22.6	Why is that?	NA
mn82:22.7	Because this will bring you nothing but sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.”	NA
mn82:23.1	Then Raṭṭhapāla’s former wives each clasped his feet and said,	NA
mn82:23.2	“What are they like, master, the nymphs for whom you lead the spiritual life?”	NA
mn82:23.3	“Sisters, I don’t lead the spiritual life for the sake of nymphs.”	Raṭṭhapāla refers to his former wives as sisters, an indication that he sees them in accordance with the advice in [sn35.127:1.6](), to regard women of one’s one age as a sister. Notably, he has already used the same respectful term when addressing the household maid, whereas his mother uses the disrespectful “wench” (_je_).
mn82:23.4	Saying, “Our master Raṭṭhapāla addresses us as sisters!” they fainted right away.	NA
mn82:24.1	Then Raṭṭhapāla said to his father,	NA
mn82:24.2	“If there is food to be given, householder, please give it.	NA
mn82:24.3	But don’t harass me.”	NA
mn82:24.4	“Eat, dear Raṭṭhapāla. The meal is ready.”	NA
mn82:24.5	Then Raṭṭhapāla’s father served and satisfied Venerable Raṭṭhapāla with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	NA
mn82:24.6	When he had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, he recited this verse while standing right there:	NA
mn82:25.1	“See this fancy puppet,	The following verses are also found in Raṭṭhapāla’s verses at [thag16.4]().
mn82:25.2	a body built of sores,	NA
mn82:25.3	diseased, obsessed over,	NA
mn82:25.4	in which nothing lasts at all.	NA
mn82:25.5	See this fancy figure,	NA
mn82:25.6	with its gems and earrings;	NA
mn82:25.7	it is bones encased in skin,	NA
mn82:25.8	made pretty by its clothes.	NA
mn82:25.9	Rouged feet	NA
mn82:25.10	and powdered face	NA
mn82:25.11	may be enough to beguile a fool,	NA
mn82:25.12	but not a seeker of the far shore.	NA
mn82:25.13	Hair in eight braids	NA
mn82:25.14	and eyeshadow	NA
mn82:25.15	may be enough to beguile a fool,	NA
mn82:25.16	but not a seeker of the far shore.	NA
mn82:25.17	A rotting body all adorned	NA
mn82:25.18	like a freshly painted makeup box	NA
mn82:25.19	may be enough to beguile a fool,	NA
mn82:25.20	but not a seeker of the far shore.	NA
mn82:25.21	The hunter laid his snare,	NA
mn82:25.22	but the deer didn’t spring the trap.	NA
mn82:25.23	I’ve eaten the bait and now I go,	NA
mn82:25.24	leaving the trapper to lament.”	NA
mn82:26.1	Then Raṭṭhapāla, having recited this verse while standing, went to King Koravya’s deer range and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation.	NA
mn82:27.1	Then King Koravya addressed his gamekeeper,	Koravya (Sanskrit _kauravya_ or _kaurava_) is the conventional name for descendants of the legendary Kuru, founding king of the Kurus.
mn82:27.2	“My good gamekeeper, tidy up the park of the deer range.	NA
mn82:27.3	We will go to see the scenery.”	NA
mn82:27.4	“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied the gamekeeper. While tidying the deer range he saw Raṭṭhapāla sitting in meditation.	NA
mn82:27.5	Seeing this, he went to the king, and said,	NA
mn82:27.6	“The deer range is tidy, sire.	NA
mn82:27.7	And the gentleman named Raṭṭhapāla, the son of the leading clan in Thullakoṭṭhika, of whom you have often spoken highly, is meditating there at the root of a tree.”	NA
mn82:27.8	“Well then, my good gamekeeper, that’s enough of the park for today.	NA
mn82:27.9	Now I shall pay homage to the worthy Raṭṭhapāla.”	NA
mn82:28.1	And then King Koravya said, “Give away the fresh and cooked foods that have been prepared there.” He had the finest carriages harnessed. Then he mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp from Thullakoṭṭhika to see Raṭṭhapāla.	NA
mn82:28.2	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached Raṭṭhapāla on foot, together with a group of eminent officials. They exchanged greetings, and, when the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side and said to Raṭṭhapāla:	NA
mn82:28.3	“Here, worthy Raṭṭhapāla, sit on this elephant rug.”	NA
mn82:28.4	“Enough, great king, you sit on it.	NA
mn82:28.5	I’m sitting on my own seat.”	NA
mn82:28.6	So the king sat down on the seat spread out, and said:	NA
mn82:29.1	“Worthy Raṭṭhapāla, there are these four kinds of decay. Because of these, some people shave off their hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn82:29.2	What four?	NA
mn82:29.3	Decay due to old age, decay due to sickness, decay of wealth, and decay of relatives.	NA
mn82:30.1	And what is decay due to old age?	NA
mn82:30.2	It’s when someone is old, elderly, and senior, advanced in years, and has reached the final stage of life.	NA
mn82:30.3	They reflect:	NA
mn82:30.4	‘I’m now old, elderly, and senior. I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life.	NA
mn82:30.5	It’s not easy for me to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth I’ve already acquired.	NA
mn82:30.6	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	NA
mn82:30.7	So because of that decay due to old age they go forth.	NA
mn82:30.8	This is called decay due to old age.	NA
mn82:30.9	But worthy Raṭṭhapāla is now a youth, young, with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life.	While Raṭṭhapāla’s age is not given, he seems quite young when he went forth. He addresses his parents with the familiar “mum and dad”; permission of his parents is required; his friends play a major role influencing his decisions; and he lies on the ground refusing to move until he gets what he wants from his parents. All this sounds like a teenager. True, he was married, but such marriages could be arranged young. And now here, twelve years later according to the commentary, he is still a young man.
mn82:30.10	You have no decay due to old age.	NA
mn82:30.11	So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth?	NA
mn82:31.1	And what is decay due to sickness?	NA
mn82:31.2	It’s when someone is sick, suffering, gravely ill.	NA
mn82:31.3	They reflect:	NA
mn82:31.4	‘I’m now sick, suffering, gravely ill.	NA
mn82:31.5	It’s not easy for me to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth I’ve already acquired.	NA
mn82:31.6	Why don’t I go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	NA
mn82:31.7	So because of that decay due to sickness they go forth.	NA
mn82:31.8	This is called decay due to sickness.	NA
mn82:31.9	But worthy Raṭṭhapāla is now rarely ill or unwell. Your stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold.	NA
mn82:31.10	You have no decay due to sickness.	NA
mn82:31.11	So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth?	NA
mn82:32.1	And what is decay of wealth?	NA
mn82:32.2	It’s when someone is rich, affluent, and wealthy.	NA
mn82:32.3	But gradually their wealth dwindles away.	NA
mn82:32.4	They reflect:	NA
mn82:32.5	‘I used to be rich, affluent, and wealthy.	NA
mn82:32.6	But gradually my wealth has dwindled away.	NA
mn82:32.7	It’s not easy for me to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth I’ve already acquired.	NA
mn82:32.8	Why don’t I go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	NA
mn82:32.9	So because of that decay of wealth they go forth.	NA
mn82:32.10	This is called decay of wealth.	NA
mn82:32.11	But worthy Raṭṭhapāla is the son of the leading clan here in Thullakoṭṭhika.	NA
mn82:32.12	You have no decay of wealth.	NA
mn82:32.13	So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth?	NA
mn82:33.1	And what is decay of relatives?	NA
mn82:33.2	It’s when someone has many friends and colleagues, relatives and kin.	NA
mn82:33.3	But gradually their relatives dwindle away.	NA
mn82:33.4	They reflect:	NA
mn82:33.5	‘I used to have many friends and colleagues, relatives and kin.	NA
mn82:33.6	But gradually they’ve dwindled away.	NA
mn82:33.7	It’s not easy for me to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth I’ve already acquired.	NA
mn82:33.8	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	NA
mn82:33.9	So because of that decay of relatives they go forth.	NA
mn82:33.10	This is called decay of relatives.	NA
mn82:33.11	But worthy Raṭṭhapāla has many friends and colleagues, relatives and kin right here in Thullakoṭṭhika.	NA
mn82:33.12	You have no decay of relatives.	NA
mn82:33.13	So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth?	NA
mn82:34.1	There are these four kinds of decay. Because of these, some people shave off their hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn82:34.2	Worthy Raṭṭhapāla has none of these.	NA
mn82:34.3	So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth?”	NA
mn82:35.1	“Great king, the Blessed One who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha has taught these four summaries of the teaching for recitation. It was after knowing and seeing and hearing these that I went forth from the lay life to homelessness.	While these four summaries reflect key teachings of the Buddha, they are not found as such in early texts.
mn82:35.2	What four?	NA
mn82:36.1	‘The world is unstable and swept away.’	NA
mn82:36.2	This is the first summary.	NA
mn82:36.3	‘The world has no shelter and no savior.’	NA
mn82:36.4	This is the second summary.	NA
mn82:36.5	‘The world has no owner—you must leave it all behind and pass on.’	NA
mn82:36.6	This is the third summary.	NA
mn82:36.7	‘The world is wanting, insatiable, the slave of craving.’	NA
mn82:36.8	This is the fourth summary.	NA
mn82:37.1	The Blessed One who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha taught these four summaries of the teaching. It was after knowing and seeing and hearing these that I went forth from the lay life to homelessness.”	NA
mn82:38.1	“‘The world is unstable and swept away.’	NA
mn82:38.2	So the worthy Raṭṭhapāla said.	NA
mn82:38.3	How should I see the meaning of this statement?”	NA
mn82:38.4	“What do you think, great king?	NA
mn82:38.5	When you were twenty or twenty-five years of age, were you proficient at riding elephants, horses, and chariots, and at archery and swordsmanship? Were you strong in thigh and arm, capable, and battle-hardened?”	For _alamatto_ read _alamattho_, “capable”.
mn82:38.6	“I was, worthy Raṭṭhapāla.	NA
mn82:38.7	Sometimes it seems as if I had superpowers then. I don’t see anyone who could have equalled me in strength.”	NA
mn82:38.8	“What do you think, great king?	NA
mn82:38.9	These days are you just as strong in thigh and arm, capable, and battle-hardened?”	NA
mn82:38.10	“No, worthy Raṭṭhapāla.	NA
mn82:38.11	For now I am old, elderly, and senior, I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life. I am eighty years old.	NA
mn82:38.12	Sometimes I intend to step in one place, but my foot goes somewhere else.”	NA
mn82:38.13	“This is what the Buddha was referring to when he said:	NA
mn82:38.14	‘The world is unstable and swept away.’”	NA
mn82:38.15	NA	NA
mn82:38.16	“It’s incredible, worthy Raṭṭhapāla, it’s amazing,	NA
mn82:38.17	how well said this was by the Buddha.	NA
mn82:38.18	NA	NA
mn82:38.19	For the world is indeed unstable and swept away.	NA
mn82:39.1	In this royal court you can find divisions of elephants, cavalry, chariots, and infantry. They will serve to defend us from any threats. Yet you said:	NA
mn82:39.2	‘The world has no shelter and no savior.’	NA
mn82:39.3	NA	NA
mn82:39.4	How should I see the meaning of this statement?”	NA
mn82:39.5	“What do you think, great king?	NA
mn82:39.6	Do you have any chronic ailments?”	NA
mn82:39.7	“Yes, I do.	NA
mn82:39.8	Sometimes my friends and colleagues, relatives and kin surround me, thinking:	NA
mn82:39.9	‘Now the king will die! Now the king will die!’”	NA
mn82:39.10	“What do you think, great king?	NA
mn82:39.11	Can you get your friends and colleagues, relatives and kin to help:	NA
mn82:39.12	‘Please, my dear friends and colleagues, relatives and kin, all of you here share my pain so that I may feel less pain.’	NA
mn82:39.13	Or must you alone feel that pain?”	NA
mn82:39.14	“I can’t get my friends to share my pain.	NA
mn82:39.15	NA	NA
mn82:39.16	Rather, I alone must feel it.”	NA
mn82:39.17	“This is what the Buddha was referring to when he said:	NA
mn82:39.18	‘The world has no shelter and no savior.’”	NA

mn82:39.23	For the world indeed has no shelter and no savior.	NA
mn82:40.1	In this royal court you can find abundant gold, both coined and uncoined, stored above and below ground. Yet you said:	NA
mn82:40.2	‘The world has no owner—you must leave it all behind and pass on.’	NA

mn82:40.7	you will continue to amuse yourself in the same way, supplied and provided with the same five kinds of sensual stimulation? Or will others make use of this property, while you pass on according to your deeds?”	NA
mn82:40.8	“There’s no way to ensure that I will continue to amuse myself in the same way.	NA

mn82:40.10	Rather, others will take over this property, while I pass on according to my deeds.”	NA

mn82:41.34	“This is what the Buddha was referring to when he said:	NA
mn82:41.35	‘The world is wanting, insatiable, the slave of craving.’	This passage is a counterweight to the ideal of the Wheel-turning Monarch, who “after conquering this land girt by sea, reigns by principle, without rod or sword” (eg. [mn91:5.8]()). The Wheel-turning Monarch is in turn a Buddhist recasting of the Brahmanical notion of a king who rules by favor of the gods as demonstrated in the horse sacrifice. The idea of a righteous king whom all obey without coercion belongs rightly to legend, while as Raṭṭhapāla so eloquently, not to mention bravely, points out, the very desire to rule is founded on craving.
mn82:41.36	And it was after knowing and seeing and hearing this that I went forth from the lay life to homelessness.”	NA
mn82:41.37	“It’s incredible, worthy Raṭṭhapāla, it’s amazing,	NA
mn82:41.38	how well said this was by the Buddha.	NA

mn82:42.1	This is what Venerable Raṭṭhapāla said.	NA
mn82:42.2	Then he went on to say:	NA
mn82:42.3	“I see rich humans in the world who,	NA
mn82:42.4	because of delusion, give not <j>the wealth they’ve earned.	NA
mn82:42.5	Greedily, they hoard their riches,	NA

mn82:42.7	A king who conquered the earth by force,	NA
mn82:42.8	ruling the land from sea to sea,	NA
mn82:42.9	unsatisfied with the near shore of the ocean,	NA

mn82:42.16	saying ‘Ah! Alas! They’re not immortal!’	NA
mn82:42.17	They take out the body wrapped in a shroud,	NA
mn82:42.18	heap up a pyre, and burn it there.	NA

mn82:42.27	Longevity isn’t gained by riches,	NA

mn82:42.31	The rich and the poor feel its touch;	NA

mn83:0.1	Middle Discourses 83	NA
mn83:0.2	About King Maghadeva	NA
mn83:1.1	So I have heard.	Versions of this story are told in the Maghadeva Jātaka ([ja9]()) and Nimi Jātaka ([ja541]()).
mn83:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Mithilā in the Maghadeva Mango Grove.	Mithilā was the capital of Videha, to the north east of the Vajjian federation, nestled against the Himalayas. Mithilā was a dominant kingdom before the Buddha, its king Janaka featuring prominently in early Upaniṣads. It features rarely in the suttas ([mn91](), [thig6.2](), [thig13.4]()) and had apparently declined in importance. It is unclear whether Mithilā had been subsumed into the Vajjian federation or remained as a minor independent kingdom until conquered by Magadha some years later. [dn19:36.7]() establishes the mythic origins of the land from a Buddhist perspective, whereas Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.4.1.10–19 depicts its origins in terms of the spread of fire-worship from the west by the founding king Māthava Videgha with his priest Gotama Rāhūgaṇa.
mn83:2.1	Then the Buddha smiled at a certain spot.	NA
mn83:2.2	Then Venerable Ānanda thought,	NA
mn83:2.3	“What is the cause, what is the reason why the Buddha smiled?	NA
mn83:2.4	Realized Ones do not smile for no reason.”	NA
mn83:2.5	So Ānanda arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,	NA
mn83:2.6	“What is the cause, what is the reason why the Buddha smiled?	NA
mn83:2.7	Realized Ones do not smile for no reason.”	NA
mn83:3.1	“Once upon a time, Ānanda, right here in Mithilā there was a just and principled king named Maghadeva, a great king who stood by his duty.	Maghadeva (“bounteous god”) is from the Vedic _magha_ (“bounty”; see [sn11.12:1.3]()). Pali variants are _makhādeva_ and _māghadeva_, while Sanskrit sources usually have _mahādeva_; a Bharhut stūpa inscription has _maghādeva_.  | For “stood by his duty” (_dhamme ṭhito_) compare “standing by the tree’s duty” (_rukkhadhamme ṭhito_) at [an6.54:12.4](). In such instances, _dhamma_ anticipates the later Hindu notion of _svadharma_, i.e. the duty appropriate for ones’ station.
mn83:3.2	He justly treated brahmins and householders, and people of town and country.	NA
mn83:3.3	And he observed the sabbath on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.	NA
mn83:4.1	Then, after many years, many hundred years, many thousand years had passed, King Maghadeva addressed his barber,	Maghadeva’s story of renunciation shares much in common with that of Daḷhanemi ([dn26:2.1]()).
mn83:4.2	‘My dear barber, when you see grey hairs growing on my head, please tell me.’	NA
mn83:4.3	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the barber.	NA
mn83:4.4	When many thousand years had passed, the barber saw grey hairs growing on the king’s head.	NA
mn83:4.5	He said to the king,	NA
mn83:4.6	‘The messengers of the gods have shown themselves to you. Grey hairs can be seen growing on your head.’	Such “messengers of the gods” appear as reminders for the dangers of mortality in [mn130]() and [an3.36]().
mn83:4.7	‘Well then, my dear barber, carefully pull them out with tweezers and place them in my cupped hands.’	NA
mn83:4.8	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the barber, and he did as the king said.	This event is depicted in a Barhut relief.
mn83:4.9	The king gave the barber a prize village, then summoned the crown prince and said,	NA
mn83:4.10	‘Dear prince, the messengers of the gods have shown themselves to me.	NA
mn83:4.11	Grey hairs can be seen growing on my head.	NA
mn83:4.12	I have enjoyed human pleasures.	NA
mn83:4.13	Now it is time to seek heavenly pleasures.	It is an expected virtue of a good ruler to retire when signs of aging appear. | The notion that spiritual practice is for the elderly is expressed at [pli-tv-bi-vb-pc21:1.4](), where sex workers teased nuns, suggesting they enjoy themselves while young and ordain when old. The Buddhist position is that Dhamma can be practiced at any age.
mn83:4.14	Come, dear prince, rule the realm.	_Rajjaṁ_ means ”realm” rather than “kingship”.
mn83:4.15	I shall shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	The signs of the renunciate predate Buddhism.
mn83:4.16	For dear prince, you too will one day see grey hairs growing on your head. When this happens, after giving a prize village to the barber and carefully instructing the crown prince in kingship, you should shave off your hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn83:4.17	Keep up this good practice that I have founded. Do not be my final man.	NA
mn83:4.18	When a pair of men are living, the one who breaks such good practice is their final man.	NA
mn83:4.19	Therefore I say to you,	NA
mn83:4.20	“Keep up this good practice that I have founded. Do not be my final man.”’	NA
mn83:5.1	And so, after giving a prize village to the barber and carefully instructing the crown prince in kingship, King Maghadeva shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness here in this mango grove.	NA
mn83:5.2	He meditated spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, he spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	NA
mn83:5.3	He meditated spreading a heart full of compassion …	NA
mn83:5.4	rejoicing …	NA
mn83:5.5	equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, he spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	NA
mn83:6.1	For 84,000 years King Maghadeva played games as a child, for 84,000 years he acted as viceroy, for 84,000 years he ruled the realm, and for 84,000 years he led the spiritual life after going forth here in this mango grove.	84,000 is 12 times 7 times 1000, where 12 is the months of the year (a full cycle) and in addition, a multiple of 4, the number of fullness and balance. 7 signifies the entire cycle of birth and death, being the days of the week and the visible “planets” (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn). 1000 is a major multiplier. Thus the overall sense of 84,000 is an abundant fullness (especially of time), in which sense it became a popular mystic number in Buddhism.
mn83:6.2	And having developed the four divine meditations, when his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in a good place, a realm of divinity.	Living the “spiritual (divine) life” (_brahmacariya_), he practiced the “divine meditations” (_brahmavihāra_) and was reborn in the “divine realm of Brahmā” (_brahmaloka_). The Buddha is presenting an idealized vision of the ancient Brahmanical path as a coherent spiritual practice guided by the notion of _brahma_ as spiritual or divine excellence (see too [mn99:22.14](), [dn13:38.2]()). | As the exemplar of an ideal Brahmanized king, Maghadeva is perhaps to be identified with Māthava Videgha, the founder and Brahmanizer of Mithilā. His name ought probably be read _mādhava_ (“possessor of _madhu_”) where _madhu_ (“honey”) is a common term for Soma. Māthava Videgha was the first king who carried out the Soma rites in the region, bringing Agni to “burn over” (civilize) the newly-brahmanized land.
mn83:7.1	Then, after many years, many hundred years, many thousand years had passed, King Maghadeva’s son addressed his barber,	NA
mn83:7.2	‘My dear barber, when you see grey hairs growing on my head, please tell me.’	NA
mn83:7.3	And all unfolded as in the case of his father.	NA

mn83:10.1	And a lineage of 84,000 kings, sons of sons of King Maghadeva, shaved off their hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness here in this mango grove.	NA

mn83:11.4	For 84,000 years they played games as a child, for 84,000 years they acted as viceroy, for 84,000 years they ruled the realm, and for 84,000 years they led the spiritual life after going forth here in this mango grove.	This totals 28.224 billion years, while the current estimate of the age of the Universe is half that at about 13.8 billion years; we are estimated to be less than half way through the current Universe. Thus the Buddhist scope of time falls within the same order of magnitude as modern cosmology. Similar durations emerge from different contexts in the suttas. The lifespan of the lowest Brahma realm is implied to be 37 billion years ([an3.70:34.4]()), while the duration in hell is about 25 billion ([an10.89:15.3]() = [snp3.10:8.1]()).
mn83:11.5	And having developed the four divine meditations, when their bodies broke up, after death, they were reborn in a good place, a realm of divinity.	NA
mn83:12.1	Nimi was the last of those kings, a just and principled king, a great king who stood by his duty.	Nimi is widely known in Sanskrit literature as one of the three main sons of Ikṣvāku (Okkāka), the legendary ancestor of the solar dynasty and the source of the Sakyan royal lineage (Bhāgavata Purāṇa 9.6.4). As the king of Videha, Nimi was the direct ancestor of Mahājanaka (Rāmāyaṇa 1.71.3). While his legends underwent proliferation, it seems the kernel of the story is common, as Mahābhārata says that “Nimi, the ruler of the Videhas, gave away his kingdom” (14.234 of Kisari Mohan Ganguli’s translation).
mn83:12.2	He justly treated brahmins and householders, and people of town and country.	NA
mn83:12.3	And he observed the sabbath on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.	NA
mn83:13.1	Once upon a time, Ānanda, while the gods of the thirty-three were sitting together in the Hall of Justice, this discussion came up among them:	NA
mn83:13.2	‘The people of Videha are so fortunate, so very fortunate	NA
mn83:13.3	to have Nimi as their king. He is a just and principled king, a great king who stands by his duty.	NA
mn83:13.4	He justly treats brahmins and householders, and people of town and country.	NA
mn83:13.5	And he observes the sabbath on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.’	NA
mn83:13.6	Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the thirty-three,	NA
mn83:13.7	‘Good fellows, would you like to see King Nimi?’	NA
mn83:13.8	‘We would.’	NA
mn83:13.9	Now at that time it was the fifteenth day sabbath, and King Nimi had bathed his head and was sitting upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbath.	NA
mn83:13.10	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, Sakka vanished from the thirty-three gods and reappeared in front of King Nimi.	NA

mn83:14.9	‘Take me both ways, Mātali.’	Despite this, no journey to the lower realms is mentioned here, which perhaps indicates textual loss. It is, however, told in detail in [ja541]().
mn83:15.1	Mātali brought King Nimi to the Hall of Justice.	NA
mn83:15.2	Sakka saw King Nimi coming off in the distance,	NA

mn83:20.1	But King Nimi had a son named Kaḷārajanaka.	The Janakas were the famed kingly house of Videha, here framed as the source of the kingdom’s decline. A King Janaka was Sītā’s father in the Rāmāyaṇa, and one discussed philosophy with Yājñavalkya in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. A Janaka is also featured in the Jātakas ([ja539]()). It seems impossible to determine which, if any, are the same person.
mn83:20.2	He didn’t go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn83:20.3	He broke that good practice.	NA
mn83:20.4	He was their final man.	NA
mn83:21.1	Ānanda, you might think,	NA
mn83:21.2	‘Surely King Maghadeva, by whom that good practice was founded, must have been someone else at that time?’	NA
mn83:21.3	But you should not see it like this.	NA
mn83:21.4	I myself was King Maghadeva at that time.	NA
mn83:21.5	I was the one who founded that good practice,	NA
mn83:21.6	which was kept up by those who came after.	NA
mn83:21.7	But that good practice doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the realm of divinity.	According to the doctrine of the “perfections” (_pāramī_), which emerged around two to four centuries after the Buddha’s passing, the practices he undertook in past lives laid the foundation for awakening in this life. Here, however, the Buddha states that his former practices did not lead to awakening. Rather, since they were based on the wrong view of eternal bliss in the Brahmā realm, they only led to a good rebirth so long as that kamma lasted. It is the eightfold path, which the Buddha discovered in his final life, which leads to awakening. The same saying in a similar context is found at [dn19:61.4]().
mn83:21.8	But now I have founded a good practice that does lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.	NA
mn83:21.9	And what is that good practice?	NA
mn83:21.10	It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:	NA
mn83:21.11	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.	NA
mn83:21.12	This is the good practice I have now founded that leads to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.	NA
mn83:21.13	Ānanda, I say to you:	NA
mn83:21.14	‘You all should keep up this good practice that I have founded. Do not be my final men.’	The Buddha changes to the plural so as to include the whole Saṅgha.
mn83:21.15	When a pair of men are living, the one who breaks such good practice is their final man.	NA
mn83:21.16	Ānanda, I say to you:	NA
mn83:21.17	‘You all should keep up this good practice that I have founded. Do not be my final men.’”	NA
mn83:21.18	That is what the Buddha said.	NA

mn84:0.1	Middle Discourses 84	NA
mn84:0.2	At Madhurā	NA
mn84:1.1	So I have heard.	The fact that the Buddha is not mentioned usually signifies a discourse set after his passing, which is confirmed towards the end of this sutta.
mn84:1.2	At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying near Madhurā, in Gunda’s Grove.	Madhurā (Sanskrit Mathurā), located  on the north-western trade route, between modern Agra and Delhi, was the capital of Sūrasena. Painted Grey Ware at the site attests to its settlement in the Vedic era, long before the Buddha’s day with its characteristic Northen Black Polished Ware, which is also found there. Early suttas place the Buddha on the road to Madhurā ([an4.43]()), and attribute one short sutta where he complained about how bad it was ([an5.220]()). SA 36 in Chinese translation places him at the Umbrella Mango Tree Park on the bank of the Bhadra River, where he gave a discourse whose Pali parallel is in Sāvatthī ([sn22.43]()). Despite its minor role in early Buddhism, it soon became a major Buddhist center, and as spiritual home of the great arahants Śaṇavāsin, Upagupta, and Moggaliputtatissa played a major role in spreading Buddhism.
mn84:2.1	King Avantiputta of Madhurā heard,	Avanti’s northern capital Ujjeni lay 600km south of Madhurā. The commentary explains that the former king of Madhurā (perhaps the Subāhu of Lalitavistara 3.24 = Vaidya 16 who ruled when the Bodhisatta was born) had married the sister of Pajjota, king of Avanti, hence their son was named “Son of Avanti”. The unification of their houses was, according to the Purānas, in fact a reunification, as both descended from the lunar Yadava lineage. The Yadavas were said to have settled as far as the key port on the Arabian sea at Dvāraka. Avantiputta, however, is not attested outside of this sutta, for which the Chinese parallel says rather, “the king of Mathurā, a western prince”.
mn84:2.2	“It seems the ascetic Kaccāna is staying near Madhurā, in Gunda’s Grove.	NA
mn84:2.3	He has this good reputation:	NA
mn84:2.4	‘He is astute, competent, clever, learned, a brilliant speaker, eloquent, mature, a perfected one.’	NA
mn84:2.5	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	NA
mn84:3.1	And then King Avantiputta had the finest carriages harnessed. He mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp from Madhurā to see Mahākaccāna.	NA
mn84:3.2	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached Mahākaccāna on foot. They exchanged greetings, and when the greetings and polite conversation were over, the king sat down to one side and said to Mahākaccāna:	NA
mn84:4.1	“Worthy Kaccāna, the brahmins say:	Kaccāna appears in Madhurā also at [an2.38](), where he has a discussion on a similar topic with the brahmin Kandarāyana. Kaccāna often stayed at Avanti, both before and after the Buddha’s passing, where he also dealt with the question of the status of the brahimns ([sn35.132]()). The commentary says he was in fact the son of the chief priest (_purohita_) of Avanti, which would explain his connection with Avanti, his discussions on the topic of brahminhood, and his skill in analyzing scripture. Kaccāna ultimately established Buddhism in the region, from where it was later brought to Sri Lanka by another “son of Avanti”, the great monk Mahinda.
mn84:4.2	‘Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior.	NA
mn84:4.3	Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark.	NA
mn84:4.4	Only brahmins are purified, not others.	NA
mn84:4.5	Only brahmins are the true-born sons of divinity, born from his mouth, born of divinity, created by divinity, heirs of divinity.’	“True-born” is _orasa_, signifying a natural heir to a legitimately married couple (Manusmṛti 9.159, Skandapurāṇa 223.5, Kauṭilya’s Arthaśāstra 3.7). The literal translation “bosom sons” is tempting, but “bosom” in English conveys intimacy and comfort rather than legitimacy. While _putta_ can mean “son” or “child”, in this case the gendered sense is required, since in Brahmanical context the concept is intended to explain how the male child takes precedence in inheritance (Manusmṛti 9.134).

mn84:9.20	Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark.	Mahābhārata 12.181.5 says that brahmins are the white class, aristocrats red, peasants yellow, and menials black. Underlying this is an assumption of the superiority of the fair-skinned northerners of Indo-Aryan descent over the dark-skinned natives (see [dn3:1.10.3]()).
mn84:9.21	Only brahmins are purified, not others.	I cannot trace this statement to Brahmanical texts, and indeed they have a strong tendency to push back against the idea that only brahmins can find purity.
mn84:9.22	Only brahmins are divinity’s true-born sons, born from his mouth, born of divinity, created by divinity, heirs of divinity.’”	An allusion to the famous Puruṣasūkta (Rig Veda 10.90.12): “His (the cosmic Man’s) mouth became the brahmin, his arms became the ruler (_rājanya_, an alternate name for the _khattiyas_), his thighs became the peasant (_vaiśya_); the menial (_sūdra_) was born from his feet.” This belongs to the latest portion of the Rig Veda, and probably represents a time when the system of four castes was established in the late Vedic period, some centuries before the Buddha. Apart from this, the Rig Veda hardly mentions any of these as castes, let alone all four together.

mn85:0.1	Middle Discourses 85	NA
mn85:0.2	With Prince Bodhi	NA
mn85:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn85:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.	NA
mn85:2.1	Now at that time a new stilt longhouse named Pink Lotus had recently been constructed for Prince Bodhi. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all.	The commentary says that Bodhi’s father was Udena, king of Kosambī, while his mother was Vāsuladattā, daughter of King Pajjota of Avanti, whose marriage became one of the great romantic legends of Indian story. Bodhi would then be the first cousin once removed of King Avantiputta of Madhurā ([mn84]()). It seems that the Bhaggas were vassals of the Vacchas of Kosambī. The ending of our text shows that Bodhi was conceived in Kosambī and raised at Crocodile Hill, where he was currently dwelling as suzerain.
mn85:3.1	Then Prince Bodhi addressed the student Sañjikāputta,	NA
mn85:3.2	“Please, dear Sañjikāputta, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	NA
mn85:3.3	NA	NA
mn85:3.4	And then ask him whether he	NA
mn85:3.5	might accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the mendicant Saṅgha.”	NA
mn85:4.1	“Yes, worthy sir,” Sañjikāputta replied. He did as Prince Bodhi asked, and	NA
mn85:4.2	NA	NA
mn85:4.3	NA	NA
mn85:4.4	NA	NA
mn85:4.5	NA	NA
mn85:4.6	the Buddha consented with silence.	NA
mn85:4.7	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Sañjikāputta got up from his seat, went to Prince Bodhi, and said,	NA
mn85:4.8	“I gave your message to the worthy Gotama,	NA
mn85:4.9	NA	NA
mn85:4.10	NA	NA
mn85:4.11	NA	NA
mn85:4.12	and he accepted.”	NA
mn85:5.1	And when the night had passed Prince Bodhi had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home. He also had the Pink Lotus longhouse spread with white cloth down to the last step of the staircase. Then he said to Sañjikāputta,	NA
mn85:5.2	“Please, dear Sañjikāputta, go to the Buddha, and announce the time, saying,	NA
mn85:5.3	‘Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.’”	NA
mn85:5.4	“Yes, worthy sir,” Sañjikāputta replied, and he did as he was asked.	NA
mn85:5.5	NA	NA
mn85:6.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Prince Bodhi’s home.	NA
mn85:7.1	Now at that time Prince Bodhi was standing outside the gates waiting for the Buddha.	NA
mn85:7.2	Seeing the Buddha coming off in the distance,	NA
mn85:7.3	he went out to greet him. After bowing and inviting the Buddha to go first, he approached the Pink Lotus longhouse.	NA
mn85:7.4	But the Buddha stopped by the last step of the staircase.	NA
mn85:7.5	Then Prince Bodhi said to him,	NA
mn85:7.6	“Sir, let the Blessed One ascend on the cloth! Let the Holy One ascend on the cloth!	NA
mn85:7.7	It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”	NA
mn85:7.8	But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent.	NA
mn85:7.9	For a second time …	NA
mn85:7.10	and a third time, Prince Bodhi said to him,	NA
mn85:7.11	“Sir, let the Blessed One ascend on the cloth! Let the Holy One ascend on the cloth!	NA
mn85:7.12	It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”	NA
mn85:7.13	Then the Buddha glanced at Venerable Ānanda.	With just a glance Ānanda knew what to do.
mn85:7.14	So Ānanda said to Prince Bodhi,	NA
mn85:7.15	“Fold up the cloth, Prince.	NA
mn85:7.16	The Buddha will not step upon white cloth.	According to the commentary, Bodhi was childless. He thought that if the Buddha stepped on the cloth it would show that he would have a child in the future, whereas if he did not then he would have no child. In the commentary to [dhp157](), the Buddha confirms to Bodhi that he will have no child. Under this explanation, then, by refusing to step on the cloth the Buddha was giving Bodhi an answer. The canonical account, however, reads as if the Buddha is simply refusing to indulge Bodhi’s superstition. Nonetheless, the fact that the Vinaya account (see below) concerns a woman who cannot have a child confirms that the blessing concerns fertility.
mn85:7.17	The Realized One has sympathy for future generations.”	Pali editions vary between “has regard” (_apaloketi_) and “has compassion” (_anukampati_), while the Chinese and Sanskrit fragments agree on “compassion”. The reading _apaloketi_ (or _oloketi_ in the Dhammapada commentary) seems to have arisen to conform with the idea that the Buddha was looking into the future to see if Bodhi would have a child.
mn85:8.1	So Prince Bodhi had the cloth folded up and the seats spread out upstairs in the longhouse.	NA
mn85:8.2	Then the Buddha ascended the longhouse and sat on the seats spread out together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.	NA
mn85:9.1	Then Prince Bodhi served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	The discourse thus far is also found at [pli-tv-kd15:21.1.1](). The Vinaya version omits the following teaching, and instead provides an occasion for the Buddha to make it a minor offence to step on a cloth covering ([pli-tv-kd15:21.3.6]()). But when a woman who is either barren or has miscarried (_apagatagabbha_) complains, the Buddha made a compassionate exception for stepping on a cloth for superstitious laypeople (_maṅgalikā_) seeking blessings ([pli-tv-kd15:21.4.11]()). The commentary says this only applies for women without child or with a difficult pregnancy.
mn85:9.2	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Prince Bodhi took a low seat, sat to one side,	NA
mn85:9.3	and said to him,	NA
mn85:9.4	“Sir, this is what I think:	NA
mn85:9.5	‘Pleasure is not gained through pleasure; pleasure is gained through pain.’”	This is a Jain view ([mn14:20.1]()). This lends support to the Jain tradition that claims Bodhi’s grandfather Pajjota as a disciple. | Bodhi’s spirituality was inclusive: he is close to the brahmin Sañjikāputta, inquires into Buddhism, asserts a Jain view, and practices superstitions.
mn85:10.1	“Prince, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought:	NA
mn85:10.2	‘Pleasure is not gained through pleasure; pleasure is gained through pain.’	The Buddha confirms that this Jain view drove his practices before awakening.
mn85:11.1	Some time later, while still with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn85:11.2	Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	See [mn26:15.1]() for notes.
mn85:11.3	‘Reverend Kālāma, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’	NA
mn85:11.4	Āḷāra Kālāma replied,	NA
mn85:11.5	‘Stay, venerable.	NA
mn85:11.6	This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’	NA
mn85:11.7	I quickly memorized that teaching.	NA
mn85:11.8	As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.	NA
mn85:11.9	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:11.10	‘It is not solely by mere faith that Āḷāra Kālāma declares: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”	NA
mn85:11.11	Surely he meditates knowing and seeing this teaching.’	NA
mn85:12.1	So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	NA
mn85:12.2	‘Reverend Kālāma, to what extent do you say you’ve realized this teaching with your own insight?’	NA
mn85:12.3	When I said this, he declared the dimension of nothingness.	NA
mn85:12.4	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:12.5	‘It’s not just Āḷāra Kālāma who has faith,	NA
mn85:12.6	energy,	NA
mn85:12.7	mindfulness,	NA
mn85:12.8	immersion,	NA
mn85:12.9	and wisdom; I too have these things.	NA
mn85:12.10	Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Āḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insight?’	NA
mn85:12.11	I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.	NA
mn85:12.12	So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	NA
mn85:12.13	‘Reverend Kālāma, is it up to this point that you realized this teaching with your own insight, and declare having achieved it?’	NA
mn85:12.14	‘I have, reverend.’	NA
mn85:12.15	‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’	NA
mn85:12.16	‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate	NA
mn85:12.17	to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!	NA
mn85:12.18	So the teaching that I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it.	NA
mn85:12.19	The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it, I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it.	NA
mn85:12.20	So the teaching that I know, you know, and the teaching you know, I know.	NA
mn85:12.21	I am like you and you are like me.	NA
mn85:12.22	Come now, reverend! We should both lead this community together.’	NA
mn85:12.23	And that is how my tutor Āḷāra Kālāma placed me, his pupil, on the same position as him, and honored me with lofty praise.	NA
mn85:12.24	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:12.25	‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingness.’	NA
mn85:12.26	Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.	NA
mn85:12.27	I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	NA
mn85:12.28	‘Reverend, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’	NA
mn85:12.29	Uddaka replied,	NA
mn85:12.30	‘Stay, venerable.	NA
mn85:12.31	This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’	NA
mn85:12.32	I quickly memorized that teaching.	NA
mn85:12.33	As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.	NA
mn85:12.34	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:12.35	‘It is not solely by mere faith that Rāma declared: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”	NA
mn85:12.36	Surely he meditated knowing and seeing this teaching.’	NA
mn85:13.1	So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	NA
mn85:13.2	‘Reverend, to what extent did Rāma say he’d realized this teaching with his own insight?’	NA
mn85:13.3	When I said this, Uddaka son of Rāma declared the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	NA
mn85:13.4	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:13.5	‘It’s not just Rāma who had faith,	NA
mn85:13.6	energy,	NA
mn85:13.7	mindfulness,	NA
mn85:13.8	immersion,	NA
mn85:13.9	and wisdom; I too have these things.	NA
mn85:13.10	Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Rāma said he had realized with his own insight?’	NA
mn85:13.11	I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.	NA
mn85:13.12	So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	NA
mn85:13.13	‘Reverend, had Rāma realized this teaching with his own insight up to this point, and declared having achieved it?’	NA
mn85:13.14	‘He had, reverend.’	NA
mn85:13.15	‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’	NA
mn85:13.16	‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate	NA
mn85:13.17	to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!	NA
mn85:13.18	So the teaching that Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it.	NA
mn85:13.19	The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it, Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it.	NA
mn85:13.20	So the teaching that Rāma directly knew, you know, and the teaching you know, Rāma directly knew.	NA
mn85:13.21	Rāma was like you and you are like Rāma.	NA
mn85:13.22	Come now, reverend! You should lead this community.’	NA
mn85:13.23	And that is how my spiritual companion Uddaka son of Rāma placed me in the position of a tutor and honored me with lofty praise.	NA
mn85:13.24	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:13.25	‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’	NA
mn85:13.26	Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.	NA
mn85:14.1	I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands, I arrived at the town of Senā in Uruvelā.	NA
mn85:14.2	There I saw a delightful park, a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby was a village to resort to for alms.	NA
mn85:14.3	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:14.4	‘This park is truly delightful, a lovely grove with a flowing river that’s clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby there’s a village to resort to for alms.	NA
mn85:14.5	This is good enough for striving for a gentleman wanting to strive.’	NA
mn85:14.6	So I sat down right there, thinking,	NA
mn85:14.7	‘This is good enough for striving.’	NA
mn85:15.1	And then these three similes, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me.	NA
mn85:16.1	Suppose there was a green, sappy log, and it was lying in water.	NA
mn85:16.2	Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking	NA
mn85:16.3	to light a fire and produce heat.	NA
mn85:16.4	What do you think, Prince?	NA
mn85:16.5	By drilling the stick against that green, sappy log lying in water, could they light a fire and produce heat?”	NA
mn85:16.6	“No, sir.	NA
mn85:16.7	Why is that?	NA
mn85:16.8	Because it’s a green, sappy log, and it’s lying in the water.	NA
mn85:16.9	That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.”	NA
mn85:17.1	“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who don’t live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures. They haven’t internally given up or stilled desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and passion for sensual pleasures. Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings because of their efforts, they are incapable of knowledge and vision, of supreme awakening.	NA
mn85:17.2	NA	NA
mn85:17.3	NA	NA
mn85:17.4	This was the first example that occurred to me.	NA
mn85:18.1	Then a second example occurred to me.	NA
mn85:18.2	Suppose there was a green, sappy log, and it was lying on dry land far from the water.	NA
mn85:18.3	Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking	NA
mn85:18.4	to light a fire and produce heat.	NA
mn85:18.5	What do you think, Prince?	NA
mn85:18.6	By drilling the stick against that green, sappy log on dry land far from water, could they light a fire and produce heat?”	NA
mn85:18.7	“No, sir.	NA
mn85:18.8	Why is that?	NA
mn85:18.9	Because it’s still a green, sappy log, despite the fact that it’s lying on dry land far from water.	NA
mn85:18.10	That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.”	NA
mn85:18.11	“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures. But they haven’t internally given up or stilled desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and passion for sensual pleasures. Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings because of their efforts, they are incapable of knowledge and vision, of supreme awakening.	NA
mn85:18.12	NA	NA
mn85:18.13	NA	NA
mn85:18.14	This was the second example that occurred to me.	NA
mn85:19.1	Then a third example occurred to me.	NA
mn85:19.2	Suppose there was a dried up, withered log, and it was lying on dry land far from the water.	NA
mn85:19.3	Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking	NA
mn85:19.4	to light a fire and produce heat.	NA
mn85:19.5	What do you think, Prince?	NA
mn85:19.6	By drilling the stick against that dried up, withered log on dry land far from water, could they light a fire and produce heat?”	NA
mn85:19.7	“Yes, sir.	NA
mn85:19.8	Why is that?	NA
mn85:19.9	Because it’s a dried up, withered log, and it’s lying on dry land far from water.”	NA
mn85:19.10	“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures. And they have internally given up and stilled desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and passion for sensual pleasures. Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings because of their efforts, they are capable of knowledge and vision, of supreme awakening.	NA
mn85:19.11	NA	NA
mn85:19.12	NA	NA
mn85:19.13	This was the third example that occurred to me.	NA
mn85:19.14	These are the three similes, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, that occurred to me.	NA
mn85:20.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:20.2	‘Why don’t I, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, squeeze, squash, and scorch mind with mind?’	NA
mn85:20.3	So that’s what I did,	NA
mn85:20.4	until sweat ran from my armpits.	NA
mn85:20.5	It was like when a strong man grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes, squashes, and crushes them.	NA
mn85:20.6	In the same way, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, I squeezed, squashed, and crushed mind with mind until sweat ran from my armpits.	NA
mn85:20.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	NA
mn85:21.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:21.2	‘Why don’t I practice the breathless absorption?’	NA
mn85:21.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose.	NA
mn85:21.4	But then winds came out my ears making a loud noise,	NA
mn85:21.5	like the puffing of a blacksmith’s bellows.	NA
mn85:21.6	NA	NA
mn85:21.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	NA
mn85:22.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:22.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	NA
mn85:22.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears.	NA
mn85:22.4	But then strong winds ground my head,	NA
mn85:22.5	like a strong man was drilling into my head with a sharp point.	NA
mn85:22.6	NA	NA
mn85:22.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	NA
mn85:23.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:23.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	NA
mn85:23.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears.	NA
mn85:23.4	But then I got a severe headache,	NA
mn85:23.5	like a strong man was tightening a tough leather strap around my head.	NA
mn85:23.6	NA	NA
mn85:23.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	NA
mn85:24.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:24.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	NA
mn85:24.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears.	NA
mn85:24.4	But then strong winds carved up my belly,	NA
mn85:24.5	like a deft butcher or their apprentice was slicing my belly open with a sharp meat cleaver.	NA
mn85:24.6	NA	NA
mn85:24.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	NA
mn85:25.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:25.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	NA
mn85:25.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears.	NA
mn85:25.4	But then there was an intense burning in my body,	NA
mn85:25.5	like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals.	NA
mn85:25.6	NA	NA
mn85:25.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	NA
mn85:26.1	Then some deities saw me and said,	NA
mn85:26.2	‘The ascetic Gotama is dead.’	NA
mn85:26.3	Others said,	NA
mn85:26.4	‘He’s not dead, but he’s dying.’	NA
mn85:26.5	Others said,	NA
mn85:26.6	‘He’s not dead or dying. The ascetic Gotama is a perfected one, for that is how the perfected ones live.’	NA
mn85:27.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:27.2	‘Why don’t I practice completely cutting off food?’	NA
mn85:27.3	But deities came to me and said,	NA
mn85:27.4	‘Good fellow, don’t practice totally cutting off food.	NA
mn85:27.5	If you do, we’ll infuse heavenly nectar into your pores and you will live on that.’	NA
mn85:27.6	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:27.7	‘If I claim to be completely fasting while these deities are infusing heavenly nectar in my pores, that would be a lie on my part.’	NA
mn85:27.8	So I dismissed those deities, saying, ‘There’s no need.’	NA
mn85:28.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:28.2	‘Why don’t I just take a little bit of food each time, a handful of broth made from mung beans, horse gram, chickpeas, or green gram?’	NA
mn85:28.3	So that’s what I did,	NA
mn85:28.4	until my body became extremely emaciated.	NA
mn85:28.5	Due to eating so little, my major and minor limbs became like the joints of an eighty-year-old or a dying man,	NA
mn85:28.6	my bottom became like a camel’s hoof,	NA
mn85:28.7	my vertebrae stuck out like beads on a string,	NA
mn85:28.8	and my ribs were as gaunt as the broken-down rafters on an old barn.	NA
mn85:28.9	Due to eating so little, the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets, like the gleam of water sunk deep down a well.	NA
mn85:28.10	Due to eating so little, my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bitter-gourd in the wind and sun.	NA
mn85:28.11	Due to eating so little, the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone, so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone, and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my belly.	NA
mn85:28.12	Due to eating so little, when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right there.	NA
mn85:28.13	Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out.	NA
mn85:29.1	Then some people saw me and said, ‘The ascetic Gotama is black.’	NA
mn85:29.2	Some said, ‘He’s not black, he’s brown.’	NA
mn85:29.3	Some said, ‘He’s neither black nor brown. The ascetic Gotama has tawny skin.’	NA
mn85:29.4	That’s how far the pure, bright complexion of my skin had been ruined by taking so little food.	NA
mn85:30.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:30.2	‘Whatever ascetics and brahmins have experienced painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion—whether in the past, future, or present—this is as far as it goes, no-one has done more than this.	NA
mn85:30.3	NA	NA
mn85:30.4	NA	NA
mn85:30.5	But I have not achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones by this severe, gruelling work.	NA
mn85:30.6	Could there be another path to awakening?’	NA
mn85:31.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:31.2	‘I recall sitting in the cool shade of a black plum tree while my father the Sakyan was off working. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn85:31.3	Could that be the path to awakening?’	NA
mn85:31.4	Stemming from that memory came the understanding:	NA
mn85:31.5	‘*That* is the path to awakening!’	NA
mn85:32.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:32.2	‘Why am I afraid of that pleasure, for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities?’	NA
mn85:32.3	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:32.4	‘I’m not afraid of that pleasure, for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities.’	NA
mn85:33.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:33.2	‘I can’t achieve that pleasure with a body so excessively emaciated. Why don’t I eat some solid food, some rice and porridge?’	NA
mn85:33.3	So I ate some solid food.	NA
mn85:33.4	Now at that time the group of five mendicants were attending on me, thinking,	NA
mn85:33.5	‘The ascetic Gotama will tell us of any truth that he realizes.’	NA
mn85:33.6	But when I ate some solid food, they left disappointed in me, saying,	NA
mn85:33.7	‘The ascetic Gotama has become indulgent; he has strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence.’	NA
mn85:34-37.1	After eating solid food and gathering my strength, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption …	NA
mn85:34-37.2	second absorption …	NA
mn85:34-37.3	third absorption …	NA
mn85:34-37.4	fourth absorption.	NA
mn85:34-37.5	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward recollection of past lives.	NA
mn85:34-37.6	I recollected many past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	NA
mn85:34-37.7	This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the night.	NA
mn85:34-37.8	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	NA
mn85:38.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	NA
mn85:38.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	NA
mn85:39.1	This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	NA
mn85:40.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	NA
mn85:40.2	I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.	NA
mn85:40.3	I truly understood: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.	NA
mn85:41.1	Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	NA
mn85:41.2	When it was freed, I knew it was freed.	NA
mn85:41.3	I understood: ‘Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.’	NA
mn85:42.1	This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the last watch of the night.	NA
mn85:42.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	NA
mn85:43.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:43.2	‘This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute.	NA
mn85:43.3	But people like clinging, they love it and enjoy it.	NA
mn85:43.4	It’s hard for them to see this topic; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination.	NA
mn85:43.5	It’s also hard for them to see this topic; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.	NA
mn85:43.6	And if I were to teach this principle, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.’	NA
mn85:43.7	And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me:	NA
mn85:43.8	‘I’ve struggled hard to realize this,	NA
mn85:43.9	enough with trying to explain it!	NA
mn85:43.10	Those mired in greed and hate	NA
mn85:43.11	can’t really understand this teaching.	NA
mn85:43.12	It goes against the stream, subtle,	NA
mn85:43.13	deep, obscure, and very fine.	NA
mn85:43.14	Those besotted by greed cannot see,	NA
mn85:43.15	for they’re shrouded in a mass of darkness.’	NA
mn85:43.16	And as I reflected like this, my mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.	NA
mn85:44.1	Then the divinity Sahampati, knowing my train of thought, thought,	NA
mn85:44.2	‘Oh lord! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.’	NA
mn85:44.3	Then the divinity Sahampati, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared in front of me.	NA
mn85:44.4	He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward me, and said,	NA
mn85:44.5	‘Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma!	NA
mn85:44.6	There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching.	NA
mn85:44.7	There will be those who understand the teaching!’	NA
mn85:44.8	That’s what the divinity Sahampati said.	NA
mn85:44.9	Then he went on to say:	NA
mn85:44.10	‘Among the Magadhans there appeared in the past	NA
mn85:44.11	an impure teaching thought up by the stained.	NA
mn85:44.12	Fling open the door to freedom from death!	NA
mn85:44.13	Let them hear the teaching <j>the immaculate one discovered.	NA
mn85:44.14	Standing high on a rocky mountain,	NA
mn85:44.15	you can see the people all around.	NA
mn85:44.16	In just the same way, All-seer, so intelligent,	NA
mn85:44.17	having ascended the Temple of Truth,	NA
mn85:44.18	rid of sorrow, look upon the people	NA
mn85:44.19	swamped with sorrow,  <j>oppressed by rebirth and old age.	NA
mn85:44.20	Rise, hero! Victor in battle, leader of the caravan,	NA
mn85:44.21	wander the world free of debt.	NA
mn85:44.22	Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma!	NA
mn85:44.23	There will be those who understand!’	NA
mn85:45.1	Then, understanding the Divinity’s invitation, I surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, because of my compassion for sentient beings.	NA
mn85:45.2	And I saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not.	NA
mn85:45.3	It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them.	NA
mn85:45.4	NA	NA
mn85:45.5	Then I replied in verse to the divinity Sahampati:	NA
mn85:45.6	‘Flung open are the doors to freedom from death!	NA
mn85:45.7	Let those with ears to hear commit to faith.	NA
mn85:45.8	Thinking it would be troublesome, Divinity, <j>I did not teach	NA
mn85:45.9	the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among mankind.’	NA
mn85:45.10	Then the divinity Sahampati, knowing that his request for me to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled me, keeping me on his right, before vanishing right there.	NA
mn85:46.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:46.2	‘Who should I teach first of all?	NA
mn85:46.3	Who will quickly understand the teaching?’	NA
mn85:46.4	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:46.5	‘That Āḷāra Kālāma is astute, competent, clever, and has long had little dust in his eyes.	NA
mn85:46.6	Why don’t I teach him first of all?	NA
mn85:46.7	He’ll quickly understand the teaching.’	NA
mn85:46.8	But a deity came to me and said,	NA
mn85:46.9	‘Sir, Āḷāra Kālāma passed away seven days ago.’	NA
mn85:46.10	And knowledge and vision arose in me,	NA
mn85:46.11	‘Āḷāra Kālāma passed away seven days ago.’	NA
mn85:46.12	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:46.13	‘This is a great loss for Āḷāra Kālāma.	NA
mn85:46.14	If he had heard the teaching, he would have understood it quickly.’	NA
mn85:47.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:47.2	‘Who should I teach first of all?	NA
mn85:47.3	Who will quickly understand the teaching?’	NA
mn85:47.4	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:47.5	‘That Uddaka son of Rāma is astute, competent, clever, and has long had little dust in his eyes.	NA
mn85:47.6	Why don’t I teach him first of all?	NA
mn85:47.7	He’ll quickly understand the teaching.’	NA
mn85:47.8	But a deity came to me and said,	NA
mn85:47.9	‘Sir, Uddaka son of Rāma, passed away just last night.’	NA
mn85:47.10	And knowledge and vision arose in me,	NA
mn85:47.11	‘Uddaka son of Rāma, passed away just last night.’	NA
mn85:47.12	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:47.13	‘This is a great loss for Uddaka.	NA
mn85:47.14	If he had heard the teaching, he would have understood it quickly.’	NA
mn85:48.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:48.2	‘Who should I teach first of all?	NA
mn85:48.3	Who will quickly understand the teaching?’	NA
mn85:48.4	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:48.5	‘The group of five mendicants were very helpful to me. They looked after me during my time of resolute striving.	NA
mn85:48.6	Why don’t I teach them first of all?’	NA
mn85:48.7	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn85:48.8	‘Where are the group of five mendicants staying these days?’	NA
mn85:48.9	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw that the group of five mendicants were staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana.	NA
mn85:49.1	So, when I had stayed in Uruvelā as long as I pleased, I set out for Varanasi.	NA
mn85:49.2	While I was traveling along the road between Gayā and Bodhgaya, the Ājīvaka ascetic Upaka saw me	NA
mn85:49.3	and said,	NA
mn85:49.4	‘Reverend, your faculties are so very clear, and your complexion is pure and bright.	NA
mn85:49.5	In whose name have you gone forth, reverend? Who is your Teacher? Whose teaching do you believe in?’	NA
mn85:49.6	I replied to Upaka in verse:	NA
mn85:49.7	‘I am the champion, the knower of all,	NA
mn85:49.8	unsullied in the midst of all things.	NA
mn85:49.9	I’ve given up all, freed in the ending of craving.	NA
mn85:49.10	Since I know for myself, whose follower should I be?	NA
mn85:49.11	I have no tutor.	NA
mn85:49.12	There is no-one like me.	NA
mn85:49.13	In the world with its gods,	NA
mn85:49.14	I have no rival.	NA
mn85:49.15	For in this world, I am the perfected one;	NA
mn85:49.16	I am the supreme Teacher.	NA
mn85:49.17	I alone am fully awakened,	NA
mn85:49.18	cooled, quenched.	NA
mn85:49.19	I am going to the city of Kāsi	NA
mn85:49.20	to roll forth the Wheel of Dhamma.	NA
mn85:49.21	In this world that is so blind,	NA
mn85:49.22	I’ll beat the drum of freedom from death!’	NA
mn85:49.23	‘According to what you claim, reverend, you ought to be the Infinite Victor.’	NA
mn85:49.24	‘The victors are those who, like me,	NA
mn85:49.25	have reached the ending of defilements.	NA
mn85:49.26	I have conquered bad qualities, Upaka—	NA
mn85:49.27	that’s why I’m a victor.’	NA
mn85:49.28	When I had spoken, Upaka said: ‘If you say so, reverend.’ Shaking his head, he took a wrong turn and left.	NA
mn85:50.1	Traveling stage by stage, I arrived at Varanasi, and went to see the group of five mendicants in the deer park at Isipatana.	NA
mn85:50.2	The group of five mendicants saw me coming off in the distance	NA
mn85:50.3	and stopped each other, saying,	NA
mn85:50.4	‘Here comes the ascetic Gotama. He’s so indulgent; he strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence.	NA
mn85:50.5	We shouldn’t bow to him or rise for him or receive his bowl and robe.	NA
mn85:50.6	But we can set out a seat; he can sit if he likes.’	NA
mn85:50.7	Yet as I drew closer, the group of five mendicants were unable to stop themselves as they had agreed.	NA
mn85:50.8	Some came out to greet me and receive my bowl and robe, some spread out a seat, while others set out water for washing my feet.	NA
mn85:50.9	But they still addressed me by name and as ‘reverend’.	NA
mn85:51.1	So I said to them,	NA
mn85:51.2	‘Mendicants, don’t address me by name and as “reverend”.	NA
mn85:51.3	The Realized One is Perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn85:51.4	Listen up, mendicants: I have achieved freedom from death! I shall instruct you, I will teach you the Dhamma.	NA
mn85:51.5	By practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’	NA
mn85:51.6	But they said to me,	NA
mn85:51.7	‘Reverend Gotama, even by that conduct, that practice, that grueling work you did not achieve any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. How could you have achieved such a state now that you’ve become indulgent, strayed from the struggle and fallen into indulgence?’	NA
mn85:51.8	So I said to them,	NA
mn85:51.9	‘The Realized One has not become indulgent, strayed from the struggle and fallen into indulgence.	NA
mn85:51.10	The Realized One is Perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn85:51.11	Listen up, mendicants: I have achieved freedom from death! I shall instruct you, I will teach you the Dhamma.	NA
mn85:51.12	By practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’	NA
mn85:51.13	But for a second time they said to me,	NA
mn85:51.14	‘Reverend Gotama … you’ve fallen into indulgence.’	NA
mn85:51.15	So for a second time I said to them,	NA
mn85:51.16	‘The Realized One has not become indulgent …’	NA
mn85:51.17	NA	NA
mn85:51.18	NA	NA
mn85:51.19	NA	NA
mn85:51.20	But for a third time they said to me,	NA
mn85:51.21	‘Reverend Gotama … you’ve fallen into indulgence.’	NA
mn85:52.1	So I said to them,	NA
mn85:52.2	‘Mendicants, have you ever known me to speak like this before?’	NA
mn85:52.3	‘No, sir.’	NA
mn85:52.4	‘The Realized One is Perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn85:52.5	Listen up, mendicants: I have achieved freedom from death! I shall instruct you, I will teach you the Dhamma.	NA
mn85:52.6	By practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’	NA
mn85:53.1	I was able to persuade the group of five mendicants.	NA
mn85:53.2	Then sometimes I advised two mendicants, while the other three went for alms.	NA
mn85:53.3	Then those three would feed all six of us with what they brought back.	NA
mn85:53.4	Sometimes I advised three mendicants, while the other two went for alms.	NA
mn85:53.5	Then those two would feed all six of us with what they brought back.	NA
mn85:54.1	As the group of five mendicants were being advised and instructed by me like this, they soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. They lived having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.”	NA
mn85:55.1	When he had spoken, Prince Bodhi said to the Buddha,	NA
mn85:55.2	“Sir, when a mendicant has the Realized One as trainer, how long would it take for them to realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life?”	NA
mn85:55.3	“Well then, prince, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.	NA
mn85:55.4	What do you think, prince?	NA
mn85:55.5	Are you skilled in the art of wielding a hooked goad while riding an elephant?”	According to the commentary, it was Pajjota’s desire to learn the art of training elephants from Bodhi’s father Udena that, after a colorful series of events, ultimately led to the joining of their houses and the birth of Bodhi. While the story is framed as a romantic adventure, it shows the strategic importance of trained elephants for royal power.
mn85:55.6	“Yes, sir.”	NA
mn85:56.1	“What do you think, prince?	NA
mn85:56.2	Suppose a man were to come along thinking,	NA
mn85:56.3	‘Prince Bodhi knows the art of wielding a hooked goad while riding an elephant.	NA
mn85:56.4	I’ll train in that art under him.’	NA
mn85:56.5	If he’s faithless,	NA
mn85:56.6	he wouldn’t achieve what he could with faith.	NA

mn85:56.15	What do you think, prince?	NA
mn85:56.16	Could that man still train under you in the art of wielding a hooked goad while riding an elephant?”	NA
mn85:56.17	“Sir, if he had even a single one of these factors he couldn’t train under me, let alone all five.”	NA
mn85:57.1	“What do you think, prince?	NA
mn85:57.2	Suppose a man were to come along thinking,	NA

mn85:57.17	“Sir, if he had even a single one of these factors he could train under me, let alone all five.”	NA
mn85:58.1	“In the same way, prince, there are these five factors that support meditation.	_Padhāna_ is literally to “fix” or “place” and hence to “try” or “strive”. Its core application is to apply oneself to spiritual practices, and hence in Buddhism it overlaps in meaning with “meditation”; a _padhānasāla_ is a “meditation hall”. Here the five factors are qualities that are essential foundations for meditation.
mn85:58.2	What five?	NA
mn85:58.3	It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:	NA
mn85:58.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
mn85:58.5	They are rarely ill or unwell. Their stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and fit for meditation.	NA
mn85:58.6	They’re not devious or deceitful. They reveal themselves honestly to the Teacher or sensible spiritual companions.	NA
mn85:58.7	They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.	NA
mn85:58.8	They’re wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.	NA
mn85:58.9	These are the five factors that support meditation.	NA
mn85:59.1	When a mendicant with these five factors that support meditation has the Realized One as trainer, they could	NA
mn85:59.2	realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in seven years.	NA

mn85:60.1	When he had spoken, Prince Bodhi said to the Buddha,	NA
mn85:60.2	“Oh, the Buddha! Oh, the teaching! Oh, how well explained is the teaching!	NA
mn85:60.3	For someone could be instructed in the evening and achieve distinction in the morning, or be instructed in the morning and achieve distinction in the evening.”	NA
mn85:61.1	When he said this, Sañjikāputta said to Prince Bodhi,	NA

mn85:61.3	NA	NA
mn85:61.4	you don’t go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.”	NA
mn85:61.5	“Don’t say that, dear Sañjikāputta, don’t say that!	NA
mn85:61.6	I have heard and learned this in the presence of my lady mother.	His “lady mother” (_ayyā_), as noted above, was Queen Vāsuladattā, daughter of Pajjota and wife of Udena. | This is the only place in the Pali canon where the idiom “heard and learned this in the presence” is applied to anyone other than the Buddha.
mn85:61.7	This one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery.	NA
mn85:61.8	Then my pregnant lady mother went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA

mn85:61.10	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember them as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.’	NA
mn85:61.11	Another time the Buddha was staying here in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.	NA
mn85:61.12	Then my nursemaid, carrying me on her hip, went to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	NA

mn85:61.14	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember him as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.’	NA

mn86:0.1	Middle Discourses 86	NA
mn86:0.2	With Aṅgulimāla	NA
mn86:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn86:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn86:2.1	Now at that time in the realm of King Pasenadi of Kosala there was a bandit named Aṅgulimāla. He was violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.	This is a rare sutta where the Buddha’s words take a back seat to dramatic narrative. The reform of the serial killer Aṅgulimāla became one of the most popular stories in Buddhism, with is its message of redemption even for the most wicked. The narrative with extensive backstory has been elaborated in the Pali commentaries and several parallels, with various overlaps and divergences, where events become inflated to an implausible degree. The tendency to exaggeration is found even here, for example in the claim that Aṅgulimāla laid waste to entire countries.
mn86:2.2	He laid waste to villages, towns, and countries.	NA
mn86:2.3	He was constantly murdering humans, and he wore their fingers as a necklace.	Aṅgulimāla’s eponymous grotesquerie of a “finger garland” is explained by the commentary and some parallels as being a count of his victims killed by order of his former Brahmanical teacher, who assigned him this task out of jealousy. This unlikely scenario was rejected by Richard Gombrich (*How Buddhism Began*, pg. 151), who proposed that Aṅgulimāla belonged to a violent cult. The shared core of canonical accounts, however, ascribe no religious motivation to his acts: he is just a killer. He is driven by untrammeled will to power, the need to show he is stronger and better.
mn86:3.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	NA
mn86:3.2	Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, he walked down the road that led to Aṅgulimāla.	NA
mn86:3.3	The cowherds, shepherds, farmers, and travelers saw him on the road,	NA
mn86:3.4	and said to him,	NA
mn86:3.5	“Don’t take this road, ascetic.	NA
mn86:3.6	On this road there is a bandit named Aṅgulimāla. He is violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.	NA
mn86:3.7	He has laid waste to villages, towns, and countries.	NA
mn86:3.8	He is constantly murdering humans, and he wears their fingers as a necklace.	NA
mn86:3.9	People travel along this road only after banding closely together in groups of ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty.	NA
mn86:3.10	Still they meet their end by Aṅgulimāla’s hand.”	_Attha_ in _hatthattha_ means “death, end” (commentary: _atthaṁ vināsaṁ_).
mn86:3.11	But when they said this, the Buddha went on in silence.	NA
mn86:3.12	For a second time …	NA
mn86:3.13	and a third time, they urged the Buddha to turn back.	NA
mn86:3.14	NA	NA
mn86:3.15	NA	NA
mn86:3.16	NA	NA
mn86:3.17	NA	NA
mn86:4.1	But when they said this, the Buddha went on in silence.	NA
mn86:4.2	The bandit Aṅgulimāla saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,	NA
mn86:4.3	and thought,	NA
mn86:4.4	“Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!	NA
mn86:4.5	People travel along this road only after banding closely together in groups of ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty.	NA
mn86:4.6	Still they meet their end by my hand.	NA
mn86:4.7	But still this ascetic comes along alone and unaccompanied, like a conqueror.	For “like a conqueror” (_pasayha maññe_) compare how the “fierce-fanged lion, king of beasts” wanders as conqueror at [snp1.3:38.1](). Aṅgulimāla sees the Buddha’s strength as a challenge; he needs to prove himself the mightiest.
mn86:4.8	Why don’t I take his life?”	NA
mn86:5.1	Then Aṅgulimāla donned his sword and shield, fastened his bow and arrows, and followed behind the Buddha.	NA
mn86:5.2	But the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Aṅgulimāla could not catch up with him no matter how hard he tried, even though the Buddha kept walking at a normal speed.	NA
mn86:5.3	Then Aṅgulimāla thought,	NA
mn86:5.4	“Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!	NA
mn86:5.5	Previously, even when I’ve chased a speeding elephant, horse, chariot or deer, I’ve always caught up with them.	NA
mn86:5.6	But I can’t catch up with this ascetic no matter how hard I try, even though he’s walking at a normal speed.”	The decisive turn comes when Aṅgulimāla must admit he is not the strongest.
mn86:5.7	He stood still and said,	NA
mn86:5.8	“Stop, stop, ascetic!”	NA
mn86:5.9	“I’ve stopped, Aṅgulimāla—now you stop.”	NA
mn86:5.10	Then Aṅgulimāla thought,	NA
mn86:5.11	“These ascetics who follow the Sakyan speak the truth.	NA
mn86:5.12	Yet while walking the ascetic Gotama says:	NA
mn86:5.13	‘I’ve stopped, Aṅgulimāla—now you stop.’	NA
mn86:5.14	Why don’t I ask him about this?”	NA
mn86:6.1	Then he addressed the Buddha in verse:	NA
mn86:6.2	“While walking, ascetic, you say ‘I’ve stopped.’	These verses in this sutta are found in Aṅgulimāla’s verses at [thag16.8]().
mn86:6.3	And I have stopped, but you tell me I’ve not.	NA
mn86:6.4	I’m asking you this, ascetic:	NA
mn86:6.5	how is it you’ve stopped and I have not?”	NA
mn86:6.6	“Aṅgulimāla, I have forever stopped—	NA
mn86:6.7	I’ve laid aside violence towards all creatures.	This phrase is shared with the Jains, Sūyagaḍa 14.23: _savvehi pāṇehi nihāya daṇḍaṁ_.
mn86:6.8	But you can’t stop yourself <j>from harming living creatures;	NA
mn86:6.9	that’s why I’ve stopped, but you have not.”	NA
mn86:6.10	“Oh, at long last a renowned great seer,	NA
mn86:6.11	an ascetic has followed me into this deep wood.	Read _samaṇo paccapādi_ per [thag16.8:3.2]().
mn86:6.12	Now that I’ve heard your verse on Dhamma,	NA
mn86:6.13	I shall live without evil.”	NA
mn86:6.14	With these words, <j>the bandit hurled his sword and weapons	NA
mn86:6.15	down a cliff into an abyss.	NA
mn86:6.16	He venerated the Holy One’s feet,	NA
mn86:6.17	and asked him for the going forth right away.	NA
mn86:6.18	Then the Buddha, the compassionate great seer,	NA
mn86:6.19	the teacher of the world with its gods,	NA
mn86:6.20	said to him, “Come, monk!”	NA
mn86:6.21	And with that he became a monk.	NA
mn86:7.1	Then the Buddha set out for Sāvatthī with Venerable Aṅgulimāla as his second monk.	NA
mn86:7.2	Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sāvatthī,	NA
mn86:7.3	where he stayed in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn86:8.1	Now at that time a crowd had gathered by the gate of King Pasenadi’s royal compound making a dreadful racket,	NA
mn86:8.2	“In your realm, Your Majesty, there is a bandit named Aṅgulimāla. He is violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.	NA
mn86:8.3	He has laid waste to villages, towns, and countries.	NA
mn86:8.4	He is constantly murdering humans, and he wears their fingers as a necklace.	NA
mn86:8.5	Your Majesty must put a stop to him!”	NA
mn86:9.1	Then King Pasenadi drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day with around five hundred horses,	NA
mn86:9.2	heading for the monastery.	NA
mn86:9.3	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the Buddha on foot. He bowed and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	NA
mn86:9.4	“What is it, great king? Is King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha angry with you, or the Licchavis of Vesālī, or some other opposing ruler?”	NA
mn86:10.1	“No, sir.	NA
mn86:10.2	In my realm there is a bandit named Aṅgulimāla. He is violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings. …	NA
mn86:10.3	NA	NA
mn86:10.4	NA	NA
mn86:10.5	I shall put a stop to him.”	It is Pasenadi’s duty, not the Buddha’s, to defend his citizens. Yet while the Buddha had already identified the problem, taken action, and solved it, Pasenadi is just now coming to the Buddha to announce his intention to do something about it. A certain criticism of Pasanadi’s weakness can be discerned here.
mn86:11.1	“But great king, suppose you were to see that Aṅgulimāla had shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and gone forth from the lay life to homelessness. And that he was refraining from killing living creatures, stealing, and lying; that he was eating in one part of the day, and was chaste, ethical, and of good character. What would you do to him?”	NA
mn86:11.2	“I would bow to him, rise in his presence, or offer him a seat. I’d invite him to accept robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And I’d organize his lawful guarding and protection.	As Ajātasattu would for a runaway slave who ordained at [dn2:36.2]().
mn86:11.3	But sir, how could such an immoral, evil man ever have such virtue and restraint?”	NA
mn86:12.1	Now at that time Venerable Aṅgulimāla was sitting not far from the Buddha.	NA
mn86:12.2	Then the Buddha pointed with his right arm and said to the king,	NA
mn86:12.3	“Great king, this is Aṅgulimāla.”	NA
mn86:12.4	Then the king became frightened, scared, his hair standing on end.	NA
mn86:12.5	Knowing this, the Buddha said to him,	NA
mn86:12.6	“Do not fear, great king. You have nothing to fear from him.”	Also per Ajātasattu ([dn2:10.8]()).
mn86:12.7	Then the king’s fear died down.	NA
mn86:12.8	Then the king went over to Aṅgulimāla and said,	NA
mn86:12.9	“Sir, is the master really Aṅgulimāla?”	NA
mn86:12.10	“Yes, great king.”	NA
mn86:12.11	“What clans were your father and mother from?”	NA
mn86:12.12	“My father was a Gagga, and my mother a Mantāṇī.”	Gagga is a clan descended from the Vedic seer Garga Bhāradvāja (Rig Veda 6.47). Clan members feature prominently throughout Brahmanical literature (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.1, 3.6, 3.8; Praśna Upaniṣad 4, etc.), none of whom, however, share Aṅgulimāla’s depravity. | Mantāṇī, spelled Maitrāyaṇī in Sanskrit (Mahāvastu 3.377, cf. Puṇṇa son of Mantāṇī at [mn24:2.4]()), is shared with the Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā, the oldest ritual text of the Black Yajurveda.
mn86:12.13	“Sir, may Master Gagga son of Mantāṇī be happy.	NA
mn86:12.14	I’ll make sure that you’re provided with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.”	NA
mn86:13.1	But at that time Venerable Aṅgulimāla lived in the wilderness, ate only almsfood, and owned just three robes.	NA
mn86:13.2	So he said to the king,	NA
mn86:13.3	“Enough, great king. My robes are complete.”	NA
mn86:13.4	Then the king went back to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
mn86:13.5	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	NA
mn86:13.6	How the Buddha tames those who are wild, pacifies those who are violent, and extinguishes those who are unquenched!	NA
mn86:13.7	For I was not able to tame him with the rod and the sword, but the Buddha tamed him without rod or sword.	This heads off a potential criticism of Buddhism that it would allow criminals to flourish. Non-violent approaches are not just morally superior but more effective.
mn86:13.8	Well, now, sir, I must go.	NA
mn86:13.9	I have many duties, and much to do.”	NA
mn86:13.10	“Please, great king, go at your convenience.”	NA
mn86:13.11	Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	NA
mn86:14.1	Then Venerable Aṅgulimāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	NA
mn86:14.2	Then as he was wandering indiscriminately for almsfood he saw a woman undergoing a distressing obstructed labor.	_Mūḷha_ here has the sense of “gone astray” in reference to obstructed labor that prevents birth; see [ud2.8:1.4]().
mn86:14.3	Seeing this, it occurred to him,	NA
mn86:14.4	“Oh, beings undergo such travail!	_Kilissanti_ here has the sense “undergo distress or travail”. Compare _garbhakleśa_ in Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa 22.45 with the sense, “travails of childbirth”.
mn86:14.5	Oh, beings undergo such travail!”	NA
mn86:14.6	Then after wandering for alms in Sāvatthī, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said to him,	NA
mn86:14.7	NA	NA
mn86:14.8	NA	NA
mn86:14.9	NA	NA
mn86:14.10	NA	NA
mn86:15.1	“Well then, Aṅgulimāla, go to that woman and say this:	NA
mn86:15.2	‘Ever since I was born, sister, I don’t recall having intentionally taken the life of a living creature. By this truth, may both you and your baby be safe.’”	The asseveration of truth—the belief that “by this truth” (_tena saccena_, also at [snp2.1]()) effective results could be won—can be traced to Rig Veda 1.21.6 (_tena satyena_).
mn86:15.3	“But sir, wouldn’t that be telling a deliberate lie?	NA
mn86:15.4	For I have intentionally killed many living creatures.”	NA
mn86:15.5	“In that case, Aṅgulimāla, go to that woman and say this:	NA
mn86:15.6	‘Ever since I was born in the noble birth, sister, I don’t recall having intentionally taken the life of a living creature. By this truth, may both you and your baby be safe.’”	This is still used as a blessing for pregnant women in Theravada. | “Noble birth” is a unique way of referring to ordination. It echoes the _upanayana_ initiation, where the teacher is said to become pregnant with the student and give birth to them as a brahmin (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.4; also see notes to [mn26:15.2]() ff.).
mn86:15.7	“Yes, sir,” replied Aṅgulimāla. He went to that woman and said:	NA
mn86:15.8	“Ever since I was born in the noble birth, sister, I don’t recall having intentionally taken the life of a living creature. By this truth, may both you and your baby be safe.”	NA
mn86:15.9	Then that woman was safe, and so was her baby.	NA
mn86:16.1	Then Aṅgulimāla, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn86:16.2	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	NA
mn86:16.3	And Venerable Aṅgulimāla became one of the perfected.	NA
mn86:17.1	Then Venerable Aṅgulimāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	NA
mn86:17.2	Now at that time someone threw a stone that hit Aṅgulimāla, someone else threw a stick, and someone else threw gravel.	NA
mn86:17.3	Then Aṅgulimāla—with cracked head, bleeding, his bowl broken, and his outer robe torn—went to the Buddha.	NA
mn86:17.4	The Buddha saw him coming off in the distance,	NA
mn86:17.5	and said to him,	NA
mn86:17.6	“Endure it, brahmin! Endure it, brahmin!	NA
mn86:17.7	You’re experiencing in this very life the result of deeds that might have caused you to be tormented in hell for many years, many hundreds or thousands of years.”	For the residual effects of kamma, compare such suttas as [sn56.49](), where for a stream-enterer the suffering that has disappeared is like a great mountain, while that which remains is like seven pebbles. For Aṅgulimāla as an arahant there is even less, but not none at all.
mn86:18.1	Later, Venerable Aṅgulimāla was experiencing the bliss of release while in private retreat.	NA
mn86:18.2	On that occasion he expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
mn86:18.3	“He who once was heedless,	NA
mn86:18.4	but turned to heedfulness,	NA
mn86:18.5	lights up the world,	NA
mn86:18.6	like the moon freed from clouds.	NA
mn86:18.7	Someone whose bad deed	NA
mn86:18.8	is supplanted by the good,	NA
mn86:18.9	lights up the world,	NA
mn86:18.10	like the moon freed from clouds.	NA
mn86:18.11	A young mendicant	NA
mn86:18.12	devoted to the Buddha’s teaching,	NA
mn86:18.13	lights up the world,	NA
mn86:18.14	like the moon freed from clouds.	NA
mn86:18.15	May even my enemies <j>hear a Dhamma talk!	NA
mn86:18.16	May even my enemies <j>devote themselves to the Buddha’s teaching!	NA
mn86:18.17	May even my enemies associate with those good men	NA
mn86:18.18	who establish others in the Dhamma!	NA
mn86:18.19	May even my enemies <j>hear Dhamma at the right time,	NA
mn86:18.20	from those who teach acceptance,	NA
mn86:18.21	praising acquiescence;	NA
mn86:18.22	and may they follow that path!	NA
mn86:18.23	For then they’d never wish harm	NA
mn86:18.24	upon myself or others.	NA
mn86:18.25	Having arrived at ultimate peace,	_Pappuyya_ is absolutive.
mn86:18.26	they’d look after creatures firm and frail.	Creatures “firm and frail” (_tasathāvare_) is a common Jain idiom. Examples include _tasesu thāvaresu ya_ (Uttarādhyayana 5.8); _je keī tasathāvarā_ (Sūyagaḍa 3.4.20); _tasaṁ vā thāvaraṁ vā_ (Dasaveyāliya 4.1.42); _tasa-jīvā ya thāvarattāe_ (Ācāraṅgasūtra 9.1.14).

mn86:18.33	But the unaffected one tamed me	NA
mn86:18.34	without rod or sword.	NA
mn86:18.35	My name is ‘Harmless’,	Aṅgulimāla became known as “Harmless” (Ahiṁsaka) after his awakening.

mn86:18.37	The name I bear today is true,	NA
mn86:18.38	for I do no harm to anyone.	NA

mn86:18.41	Swept away in a great flood,	NA
mn86:18.42	I went to the Buddha as a refuge.	NA
mn86:18.43	I used to have blood on my hands,	NA
mn86:18.44	the notorious Aṅgulimāla.	NA
mn86:18.45	See the refuge I’ve found—	NA
mn86:18.46	the conduit to rebirth is eradicated.	NA
mn86:18.47	I’ve done many of the sort of deeds	NA
mn86:18.48	that lead to a bad destination.	NA
mn86:18.49	The result of my deeds has already struck me,	NA
mn86:18.50	so I enjoy my food free of debt.	NA
mn86:18.51	Fools and simpletons	NA
mn86:18.52	devote themselves to negligence.	NA
mn86:18.53	But the wise protect diligence	NA
mn86:18.54	as their best treasure.	NA
mn86:18.55	Don’t devote yourself to negligence,	NA
mn86:18.56	or delight in erotic intimacy.	NA
mn86:18.57	For if you’re diligent and practice absorption,	NA
mn86:18.58	you’ll attain abundant happiness.	NA
mn86:18.59	It was welcome, not unwelcome,	NA
mn86:18.60	the advice I got was good.	NA
mn86:18.61	Of the well-explained teachings,	NA
mn86:18.62	I arrived at the best.	NA
mn86:18.63	It was welcome, not unwelcome,	NA
mn86:18.64	the advice I got was good.	NA
mn86:18.65	I’ve attained the three knowledges	NA
mn86:18.66	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.”	NA
mn87:0.1	Middle Discourses 87	NA
mn87:0.2	Born From the Beloved	NA
mn87:1.1	So I have heard.	King Pasenadi had what seems to be his first conversation and conversion with the Buddha in [sn3.1](). However, it would seem his faith was still weak, as he is frustrated by the devotion of his chief queen, Mallikā (“Jasmine”). Ultimately, her wise counsel persuades him. Similar conversations with Mallikā on attachment to loved ones are found at [sn3.8]() and [ud5.1](). King Pasenadi’s committment to non-attachment was sorely tested with the birth of a daughter ([sn3.16]()), and when Mallikā passed away ([an5.49]()).
mn87:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn87:2.1	Now at that time a certain householder’s dear and beloved only child passed away.	NA
mn87:2.2	After their death he didn’t feel like working or eating.	An unusual use of _paṭibhāti_ (“feel like”); commentary glosses _ruccati_.
mn87:2.3	He would go to the cremation ground and wail,	NA
mn87:2.4	“Where are you, my only child? Where are you, my only child?”	NA
mn87:3.1	Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	NA
mn87:3.2	“Your faculties, householder, are those of one who is unstable in their own mind; there is a deterioration in your faculties.”	NA
mn87:3.3	“And how, sir, could there be no deterioration of my faculties?	NA
mn87:3.4	For my dear and beloved only child has passed away.	NA
mn87:3.5	Since their death I haven’t felt like working or eating.	NA
mn87:3.6	I go to the cremation ground and wail:	NA
mn87:3.7	‘Where are you, my only child? Where are you, my only child?’”	NA
mn87:3.8	“That’s so true, householder! That’s so true, householder!	NA
mn87:3.9	For our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.”	NA
mn87:3.10	“Sir, who on earth could ever think such a thing!	NA
mn87:3.11	NA	NA
mn87:3.12	For our loved ones are a source of joy and happiness.”	NA
mn87:3.13	Disagreeing with the Buddha’s statement, rejecting it, he got up from his seat and left.	NA
mn87:4.1	Now at that time several gamblers were playing dice not far from the Buddha.	NA
mn87:4.2	That householder approached them and told them what had happened.	NA
mn87:4.3	NA	NA
mn87:4.4	NA	NA
mn87:4.5	NA	NA
mn87:4.6	NA	NA

mn87:4.18	For our loved ones are a source of joy and happiness.”	NA
mn87:4.19	Thinking, “The gamblers and I are in agreement,” the householder left.	NA
mn87:5.1	Eventually that topic of discussion reached the royal compound.	Also a scene for gossip in [an3.60]() and [an10.45]().
mn87:5.2	Then King Pasenadi addressed Queen Mallikā,	In addition to the conversations on the theme of attachment to loved ones, unrelated incidents with Mallikā appear at [an4.197](), [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc53:1.1](), and [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.2.7](). She is listed as an eminent lay disciple ([an8.91-117:1.1]()) and maintained a monastery for philosophical debates ([mn78:1.3]()). This is what we know of her from early texts, while later Jātakas and other scriptures tell many colorful tales about her and her unique marriage. | Śvetāmbara Jains hold that, in the far distant past, the nineteenth founding teacher (_tīrthaṅkara_) was the lady Malli (Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra 6.6). Perhaps the Buddhist stories of the wise lady Mallikā helped inspire this legend.
mn87:5.3	“Mallika, your ascetic Gotama said this:	NA
mn87:5.4	‘Our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.’”	NA
mn87:5.5	“If that’s what the Buddha said, great king, then that’s how it is.”	NA
mn87:5.6	“No matter what the ascetic Gotama says, Mallikā agrees with him:	NA
mn87:5.7	‘If that’s what the Buddha said, great king, then that’s how it is.’	NA
mn87:5.8	You’re just like a pupil who agrees with everything their tutor says.	NA
mn87:5.9	NA	NA
mn87:5.10	NA	NA
mn87:5.11	NA	NA
mn87:5.12	Go away, Mallikā, get out of here!”	NA
mn87:6.1	Then Queen Mallikā addressed the brahmin Nāḷijaṅgha,	NA
mn87:6.2	“Please, brahmin, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	NA
mn87:6.3	NA	NA
mn87:6.4	And then say:	NA
mn87:6.5	‘Sir, did the Buddha make this statement:	NA
mn87:6.6	“Our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress”?’	NA
mn87:6.7	Remember well how the Buddha answers and tell it to me.	NA
mn87:6.8	For Realized Ones say nothing that is not so.”	NA
mn87:6.9	“Yes, ma’am,” he replied. He went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn87:6.10	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,	NA
mn87:6.11	“Worthy Gotama, Queen Mallikā bows with her head to your feet. She asks if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	NA
mn87:6.12	And she asks whether	NA
mn87:6.13	the Buddha made this statement:	NA
mn87:6.14	‘Our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.’”	NA
mn87:7.1	“That’s right, brahmin, that’s right!	NA

mn87:8.1	And here’s a way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.	NA
mn87:8.2	Once upon a time right here in Sāvatthī a certain woman’s mother passed away.	NA
mn87:8.3	And because of that she went mad and lost her mind. She went from street to street and from square to square saying,	NA

mn87:22.1	Once upon a time right here in Sāvatthī a certain woman went to live with her relative’s family.	NA
mn87:22.2	But her relatives wanted to divorce her from her husband and give her to another,	NA

mn87:23.1	Then Nāḷijaṅgha the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got up from his seat, went to Queen Mallikā, and told her of all they had discussed. Then Queen Mallikā approached King Pasenadi and said to him,	NA

mn87:28.1	What do you think, great king?	NA
mn87:28.2	Do you love the realms of Kāsi and Kosala?”	Kosala is the native realm of Pasenadi. Kāsi had formerly been an independent kingdom, but was taken over by Pasenadi’s father Mahākosala. Towards the end of the Buddha’s life it was contested between Kosala and Magadha ([sn3.14](), [sn3.15]()). Ultimately it became part of the greater Magadhan empire.
mn87:28.3	“Indeed I do, Mallikā.	NA
mn87:28.4	It’s due to the bounty of Kāsi and Kosala that we use sandalwood imported from Kāsi and wear garlands, fragrance, and makeup.”	NA

mn87:29.3	Come, Mallikā, rinse my hands.”	I think the king held his hands over a bowl and Mallikā poured water over them.
mn87:29.4	Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times:	NA
mn87:29.5	“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	NA
mn87:29.6	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	NA

mn88:0.2	The Imported Cloth	NA
mn88:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn88:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn88:2.1	Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	NA
mn88:2.2	He wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, for the day’s meditation.	NA
mn88:3.1	Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala mounted the Single Lotus Elephant and drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day.	“Single lotus” (_ekapuṇḍarīka_) appears as an auspicious epithet in a prayer for wealth at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.3.6.
mn88:3.2	He saw Ānanda coming off in the distance	NA
mn88:3.3	and said to the chief minister Sirivaḍḍha,	Different persons of the same name appear in [sn47.29]() and [thag1.41]().
mn88:3.4	“My dear Sirivaḍḍha, isn’t that Venerable Ānanda?”	NA
mn88:3.5	“Indeed it is, great king.”	NA
mn88:4.1	Then King Pasenadi addressed a man,	NA
mn88:4.2	“Please, worthy man, go to Venerable Ānanda, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:	NA
mn88:4.3	‘Sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala bows with his head at your feet.’	NA
mn88:4.4	And then say:	NA
mn88:4.5	‘Sir, if you have no urgent business, please wait an hour out of sympathy.’”	NA
mn88:5.1	“Yes, Your Majesty,” that man replied. He did as the king asked.	NA
mn88:5.2	NA	NA
mn88:5.3	NA	NA
mn88:5.4	NA	NA
mn88:6.1	Ānanda consented with silence.	NA
mn88:6.2	Then King Pasenadi rode on the elephant as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached Ānanda on foot. He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Ānanda,	NA
mn88:6.3	“Sir, if you have no urgent business, it would be nice of you to go to the bank of the Aciravatī river out of sympathy.”	NA
mn88:7.1	Ānanda consented with silence.	NA
mn88:7.2	He went to the river bank and sat at the root of a certain tree on a seat spread out.	NA
mn88:7.3	Then King Pasenadi rode on the elephant as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached Ānanda on foot. He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Ānanda,	NA
mn88:7.4	“Here, Venerable Ānanda, sit on this elephant rug.”	NA
mn88:7.5	“Enough, great king,	NA
mn88:7.6	you sit on it.	NA
mn88:7.7	I’m sitting on my own seat.”	NA
mn88:8.1	So the king sat down on the seat spread out,	NA
mn88:8.2	and said,	NA
mn88:8.3	“Honorable Ānanda, would the Buddha engage in the sort of behavior—by way of body, speech, or mind—that is faulted by ascetics and brahmins?”	The commentary says that Pasenadi’s actions were occasioned by the brutal murder of the wanderer Sundarī. Unscrupulous ascetics urged her to visit the Jeta Grove, then killed her so that blame would fall on the Buddha and his community ([ud8.4]()). However, nothing in this sutta or its parallel at MA 214 supports this connection.
mn88:8.4	“No, great king, the Buddha would not engage in the sort of behavior that is faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins.”	NA
mn88:8.5	NA	NA
mn88:8.6	NA	NA
mn88:8.7	NA	NA
mn88:9.1	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	NA
mn88:9.2	For I couldn’t fully express the question, but Venerable Ānanda’s answer completed it for me.	Ānanda completed Pasenadi’s phrasing by adding “sensible” (_viññūhi_), since the Buddha’s conduct was in fact faulted by foolish ascetics and brahmins.
mn88:9.3	I don’t believe that praise or criticism of others spoken by incompetent fools, without examining or scrutinizing, is the most important thing.	NA
mn88:9.4	Rather, I believe that praise or criticism of others spoken by competent and intelligent people after examining and scrutinizing is the most important thing.	NA
mn88:10.1	But Honorable Ānanda, what kind of bodily behavior is faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins?”	This passage describes bad actions from five perspectives, showing that the Buddha’s analysis of morality was not based on a single factor.
mn88:10.2	“Unskillful behavior.”	“Unskillful” (_akusala_) is an unwholesome quality of the mind, so this is the psychological dimension of immorality. What is unskillful is that which leads to the result opposite to that desired: we want happiness, but it leads to suffering.
mn88:10.3	“But what kind of bodily behavior is unskillful?”	NA
mn88:10.4	“Blameworthy behavior.”	“Blameworthy” (_sāvajja_) behavior is that which makes one liable to criticism by others. This is the social dimension of immorality.
mn88:10.5	“But what kind of bodily behavior is blameworthy?”	NA
mn88:10.6	“Hurtful behavior.”	“Hurtful” (_sabyābajjha_) refers to the fact that bad conduct is characterized by hurtful affliction both in its action and its consequences.
mn88:10.7	“But what kind of bodily behavior is hurtful?”	NA
mn88:10.8	“Behavior that results in suffering.”	“Results in suffering” (_dukkhavipāka_) through painful kammic consequences in this life or the future.
mn88:10.9	“But what kind of bodily behavior results in suffering?”	NA
mn88:10.10	“Bodily behavior that leads to hurting yourself, hurting others, and hurting both,	Bad conduct does not just affect oneself, but reverberates in space, by harming others, and in time, by promoting the growth of even more unskillful qualities.
mn88:10.11	and which makes unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline.	NA
mn88:10.12	That kind of bodily behavior is faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins.”	NA
mn88:11.1	“But what kind of verbal behavior …	NA

mn88:14.1	“But sir, what kind of bodily behavior is not faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins?”	The analysis is inverted for good conduct.

mn88:17.1	“Sir, does the Buddha praise embracing all these skillful things?”	NA
mn88:17.2	“Great king, the Realized One has given up all unskillful things and possesses skillful things.”	Ānanda emphasizes that the Buddha does not just praise these things, he embodies them fully.
mn88:18.1	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	NA
mn88:18.2	How well this was said by Venerable Ānanda!	NA
mn88:18.3	I’m delighted and satisfied with what you’ve expressed so well.	NA
mn88:18.4	So much so that	NA
mn88:18.5	if an elephant-treasure was suitable for you, I would give you one.	NA
mn88:18.6	If a horse-treasure was suitable for you, I would give you one.	NA
mn88:18.7	If a prize village was suitable for you, I would give you one.	NA
mn88:18.8	But, sir, I know that	NA
mn88:18.9	these things are not suitable for you.	See eg. [mn94:16.19]().
mn88:18.10	This imported cloth was sent to me by King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, packed in a parasol case. It’s exactly sixteen measures long and eight wide.	The Chinese parallel at MA 214 has <span lang='lzh'>繖</span>, which supports the reading _chatta_ (“parasol”). | For _bāhitikā_, I accept the commentary’s explanation that it means “foreign” or “imported” (cf. Sanskrit _bāhya_).
mn88:18.11	May Venerable Ānanda please accept it out of sympathy.”	NA
mn88:18.12	“Enough, great king. My three robes are complete.”	NA
mn88:19.1	“Sir, we have both seen this river Aciravatī	NA
mn88:19.2	when it has rained heavily in the mountains, and the river overflows both its banks.	NA
mn88:19.3	In the same way, Venerable Ānanda can make a set of three robes for himself from this imported cloak,	NA
mn88:19.4	and you can share your old robes with your fellow monks.	NA
mn88:19.5	In this way my religious donation will come to overflow, it seems to me.	NA
mn88:19.6	Please accept the imported cloth.”	NA
mn88:20.1	So Ānanda accepted it.	NA
mn88:20.2	Then King Pasenadi said to him,	NA
mn88:20.3	“Well, now, sir, I must go.	NA
mn88:20.4	I have many duties, and much to do.”	NA
mn88:20.5	“Please, great king, go at your convenience.”	NA
mn88:20.6	Then King Pasenadi approved and agreed with what Ānanda said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Ānanda, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	NA
mn88:21.1	Soon after he left, Ānanda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,	NA
mn88:21.2	and told him what had happened.	NA
mn88:21.3	He presented the cloth to the Buddha.	NA
mn88:22.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,	NA
mn88:22.2	“Mendicants, King Pasenadi is lucky, so very lucky,	NA
mn88:22.3	to get to see Ānanda and pay homage to him.”	NA
mn88:22.4	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn88:22.5	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn89:0.1	Middle Discourses 89	NA
mn89:0.2	Shrines to the Teaching	NA
mn89:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn89:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near the Sakyan town named Medaḷumpa.	This town, the spelling of which is uncertain, is not mentioned elsewhere.
mn89:2.1	Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Townsville on some business.	“Townsville” is a literal rendering of _nagaraka_. I translate it in homage to the town in northern Queensland where a chance encounter with a joey set me on the path to the Dhamma.
mn89:2.2	Then he addressed Dīgha Kārāyana,	NA
mn89:2.3	“My good Kārāyana, harness the finest chariots. We will go to a park and see the scenery.”	NA
mn89:2.4	“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Dīgha Kārāyana. He harnessed the chariots and informed the king,	NA
mn89:2.5	“Sire, the finest chariots are harnessed.	NA
mn89:2.6	Please go at your convenience.”	NA
mn89:3.1	Then King Pasenadi mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp from Townsville,	NA
mn89:3.2	heading for the park grounds.	The word _ārāma_, from a root meaning “to enjoy”, originally referred to a cultivated and pleasant parkland enjoyed for recreation. Such places were favorite dwelling places for ascetics, and became the sites for developed monasteries. In this sutta we see both senses. Here Pasenadi enjoys an _ārāma_ (“park”) for recreation. Below we see the Buddha staying in an _ārāma_ with a community of mendicants, featuring substantial private dwellings (_vihāra_) with lockable doors; in other words, a “monastery” ([mn89:8.1]()).
mn89:3.3	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the park on foot.	NA
mn89:4.1	As he was going for a walk in the park he saw roots of trees that were impressive and inspiring, quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat.	NA
mn89:4.2	The sight reminded him right away of the Buddha:	NA
mn89:4.3	“These roots of trees, so impressive and inspiring, are like those where we used to pay homage to the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.”	Evidently the Buddha used to meditate on emptiness in these very woods ([mn121:3.1]()).
mn89:4.4	He addressed Dīgha Kārāyana,	NA
mn89:4.5	“These roots of trees, so impressive and inspiring, are like those where we used to pay homage to the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn89:4.6	My good Kārāyana, where is that Buddha at present?”	NA
mn89:5.1	“Great king, there is a Sakyan town named Medaḷumpa.	NA
mn89:5.2	That’s where the Buddha is now staying.”	NA
mn89:5.3	“But how far away is that town?”	NA
mn89:5.4	“Not far, great king,	NA
mn89:5.5	it’s three leagues.	NA
mn89:5.6	We can get there while it’s still light.”	NA
mn89:5.7	“Well then, harness the chariots, and we shall go to see the Buddha.”	NA
mn89:5.8	“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Dīgha Kārāyana. He harnessed the chariots and informed the king,	NA
mn89:5.9	“Sire, the finest chariots are harnessed.	NA
mn89:5.10	Please go at your convenience.”	NA
mn89:6.1	Then King Pasenadi mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out from Townsville to Medaḷumpa.	NA
mn89:6.2	He reached the town while it was still light	NA
mn89:6.3	and headed for the monastery grounds.	NA
mn89:6.4	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot.	NA
mn89:7.1	At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air.	NA
mn89:7.2	King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to them and said,	NA
mn89:7.3	“Sirs, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?	NA
mn89:7.4	For I want to see him.”	NA
mn89:8.1	“Great king, that’s his dwelling, with the door closed. Approach it quietly, without hurrying; go onto the porch, clear your throat, and knock on the door-panel. The Buddha will open the door.”	NA
mn89:8.2	The king right away presented his sword and turban to Dīgha Kārāyana,	NA
mn89:8.3	who thought,	NA
mn89:8.4	“Now the king seeks privacy. I should wait here.”	Kārāyana’s response gives no hint of anything other than loyal service.
mn89:8.5	Then the king approached the Buddha’s dwelling, cleared his throat and knocked on the door-panel, and the Buddha opened the door.	NA
mn89:9.1	King Pasenadi entered the dwelling, and bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name:	For similar gestures, see Koṇḍañña at [sn8.9:1.2](), the brahmin Mānatthaddha (“Stuck-up”) at [sn7.15:3.2](), the brahmin Brahmāyu at [mn91:34.1](), and Pasenadi again at [an10.30:2.2]().
mn89:9.2	“Sir, I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!	NA
mn89:9.3	I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!”	NA
mn89:9.4	“But great king, for what reason do you demonstrate such utmost devotion for this body, conveying your manifest love?”	NA
mn89:10.1	“Sir, I infer about the Buddha from the teaching:	NA
mn89:10.2	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	This is an abbreviated form of the full devotions to the Triple Gem.
mn89:10.3	It happens, sir, that I see some ascetics and brahmins leading the spiritual life only for a limited period: ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years.	NA
mn89:10.4	Some time later—nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed—they amuse themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	He knows this because at least some of these worked for him as spies ([sn3.11:7.3](), [ud6.2:8.3]()).
mn89:10.5	But here I see the mendicants leading the spiritual life entirely full and pure as long as they live, to their last breath.	While Buddhist mendicants may disrobe at any time, their intention is to practice for life.
mn89:10.6	I don’t see any other spiritual life elsewhere so full and pure.	NA
mn89:10.7	That’s why I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:	NA
mn89:10.8	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	NA
mn89:11.1	Furthermore, kings fight with kings, aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, householders fight with householders. A mother fights with her child, child with mother, father with child, and child with father. Brother fights with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, and friend fights with friend.	PTS text includes brother with brother.
mn89:11.2	But here I see the mendicants living in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes.	NA
mn89:11.3	I don’t see any other assembly elsewhere so harmonious.	NA
mn89:11.4	So I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:	NA
mn89:11.5	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	NA
mn89:12.1	Furthermore, I have walked and wandered from monastery to monastery and from park to park.	NA
mn89:12.2	There I’ve seen some ascetics and brahmins who are thin, haggard, pale, and veiny—hardly a captivating sight for people, you’d think.	This is a standard description of monastics who are unhappy and dissatisfied for whatever reason, eg. [pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:1.1.3]().
mn89:12.3	It occurred to me:	NA
mn89:12.4	‘Clearly these venerables lead the spiritual life dissatisfied, or they’re hiding some bad deed they’ve done.	NA
mn89:12.5	That’s why they’re thin, haggard, pale, and veiny—hardly a captivating sight for people, you’d think.’	NA
mn89:12.6	I went up to them and said:	NA
mn89:12.7	‘Venerables, why are you so thin, haggard, pale, and veiny—hardly a captivating sight for people, you’d think?’	NA
mn89:12.8	They say:	NA
mn89:12.9	‘We have jaundice, great king.’	The commentary glosses _kularogo_ (“family sickness”), showing it must accept the reading _bandhu_ (“relative”). However, the parallel at MA 213 has <span lang='lzh'>白病</span>, which supports the variant _paṇḍukarogino_ (“jaundice”).
mn89:12.10	But here I see mendicants always smiling and joyful, obviously happy, with cheerful faces, living relaxed, unruffled, surviving on charity, their hearts free as a wild deer.	NA
mn89:12.11	It occurred to me:	NA
mn89:12.12	‘Clearly these venerables have realized a higher distinction in the Buddha’s instructions than they had before.	NA
mn89:12.13	That’s why these venerables are always smiling and joyful, obviously happy, with cheerful faces, living relaxed, unruffled, surviving on charity, their hearts free as a wild deer.’	NA
mn89:12.14	So I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:	NA
mn89:12.15	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	NA
mn89:13.1	Furthermore, as an anointed aristocratic king	NA
mn89:13.2	I am able to execute, fine, or banish those who are guilty.	NA
mn89:13.3	Yet when I’m sitting in court they interrupt me.	Read _aḍḍa_ (variants _attha_, _aṭṭa_) which in Sanskrit has the senses “solve, infer, argue, discern”. The commentary interprets _aḍḍakaraṇa_ as the “place of judgement” i.e. the court, which is clearly the case at [dn17:1.11.1]().
mn89:13.4	And I can’t get them	NA
mn89:13.5	to stop interrupting me and wait until I’ve finished speaking.	Pasenadi speaks of his frustrations in judging at [sn3.7](). He was getting old and passing his duties to his son.
mn89:13.6	NA	NA
mn89:13.7	But here I’ve seen the mendicants	NA
mn89:13.8	while the Buddha is teaching an assembly of many hundreds, and there is no sound of his disciples coughing or clearing their throats.	NA
mn89:13.9	Once it so happened that the Buddha was teaching an assembly of many hundreds.	NA
mn89:13.10	Then one of his disciples cleared their throat.	NA
mn89:13.11	And one of their spiritual companions nudged them with their knee, to indicate:	NA
mn89:13.12	‘Hush, venerable, don’t make a sound! Our teacher, the Blessed One, is teaching!’	NA
mn89:13.13	It occurred to me:	NA
mn89:13.14	‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing,	NA
mn89:13.15	how an assembly can be so well trained without rod or sword!’	The future tense _bhavissati_ here expresses surprise or wonder, for which compare [an4.36:1.6]().
mn89:13.16	I don’t see any other assembly elsewhere so well trained.	For the poor behavior of other ascetics, see [mn77:6.21]().
mn89:13.17	So I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:	NA
mn89:13.18	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	NA
mn89:14.1	Furthermore, I’ve seen some clever aristocrats who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters. You’d think they live to demolish convictions with their intellect.	This passage on conversion of disputants is also found at [mn27:4.2]().
mn89:14.2	They hear:	NA
mn89:14.3	‘So, gentlemen, that ascetic Gotama will come down to such and such village or town.’	NA
mn89:14.4	They formulate a question, thinking:	NA
mn89:14.5	‘We’ll approach the ascetic Gotama and ask him this question.	NA
mn89:14.6	If he answers like this, we’ll refute him like that;	NA
mn89:14.7	and if he answers like that, we’ll refute him like this.’	NA
mn89:14.8	When they hear that	NA
mn89:14.9	he has come down	NA
mn89:14.10	they approach him.	NA
mn89:14.11	The Buddha educates, encourages, fires up, and inspires them with a Dhamma talk.	NA
mn89:14.12	They don’t even get around to asking their question to the Buddha, so how could they refute his answer?	NA
mn89:14.13	Invariably, they become his disciples.	NA
mn89:14.14	So I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:	NA

mn89:17.14	And he gives them the going-forth.	NA
mn89:17.15	Soon after going forth, living withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, they realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. They live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn89:17.16	They say:	NA
mn89:17.17	‘We were almost lost! We almost perished!	NA
mn89:17.18	For we used to claim that we were ascetics, brahmins, and perfected ones, but we were none of these things.	NA
mn89:17.19	But now we really are ascetics, brahmins, and perfected ones!’	NA
mn89:17.20	So I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:	NA
mn89:17.21	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	NA
mn89:18.1	Furthermore, these chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa share my meals and my carriages. I give them a livelihood and bring them renown.	NA
mn89:18.2	And yet they don’t show me the same level of devotion that they show to the Buddha.	NA
mn89:18.3	Once it so happened that while I was leading a military campaign and testing Isidatta and Purāṇa I took up residence in a cramped house.	NA
mn89:18.4	They spent much of the night discussing the teaching, then they lay down with their heads towards where the Buddha was and their feet towards me.	NA
mn89:18.5	It occurred to me:	NA
mn89:18.6	‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!	NA
mn89:18.7	These chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa share my meals and my carriages. I give them a livelihood and bring them renown.	NA
mn89:18.8	And yet they don’t show me the same level of devotion that they show to the Buddha.	NA
mn89:18.9	Clearly these venerables have realized a higher distinction in the Buddha’s instructions than they had before.’	They were at least stream-enterers ([sn55.6:18.1](), [an6.120-139:1.12]()), and died as once-returners ([an6.44:2.3](), [an10.75:2.2]()). | The king refers to his subordinates with _āyasmā_, normally reserved for addressing mendicants. When used by lay people of other lay people it indicates deep respect, often, as here, in reference to noble individuals on the path ([mn68:18.5](), [sn55.54:2.2]()), or else used by a criminal beseeching the mercy of the crowd ([an4.244:2.2]()).
mn89:18.10	So I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:	NA
mn89:18.11	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	NA
mn89:19.1	Furthermore, the Buddha is an aristocrat, and so am I.	NA
mn89:19.2	The Buddha is Kosalan, and so am I.	The Sakyans were vassals of Kosala ([snp3.1:18.4]()).
mn89:19.3	The Buddha is eighty years old, and so am I.	This sets these events in the last year of the Buddha’s life.
mn89:19.4	Since this is so,	NA
mn89:19.5	it’s proper for me to show the Buddha such utmost devotion and demonstrate such friendship.	NA
mn89:20.1	Well, now, sir, I must go.	NA
mn89:20.2	I have many duties, and much to do.”	NA
mn89:20.3	“Please, great king, go at your convenience.”	NA
mn89:20.4	Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	While the sutta and its parallels do not hint at anything other than a respectful visit to the Buddha, there is a tradition that this event led to Pasenadi’s downfall. Apparently, Dīgha Kārāyana blamed Pasenadi for the death of his uncle, Pasenadi’s former general Bandhula. Seeking revenge, he took the royal insignia and crowned Pasanadi’s dubious son Viḍūḍabha ([mn90:6.1]()) in his stead. Abandoned and alone, Pasenadi sought shelter in Rājagaha with his nephew Ajātasattu, but arrived too late and died while spending the night outside the walls. The details are improbable—why flee his friends the Sakyans for the untrustworthy Ajātasattu, 500 kms distant? And why would a city watch bar a king in need? Nonetheless, the outline of this story is found widely, not just in the Pali commentary (see [ja465](), T 1451 at T xxiv 238c1, T 211 at T iv 583a16, D (6) _’dul ba_, _tha_ 86a7).
mn89:21.1	Soon after the king had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:	NA
mn89:21.2	“Mendicants, before he got up and left, King Pasenadi spoke shrines to the teaching.	NA
mn89:21.3	Learn these shrines to the teaching!	NA
mn89:21.4	Memorize these shrines to the teaching!	NA
mn89:21.5	Remember these shrines to the teaching!	NA
mn89:21.6	These shrines to the teaching are beneficial and relate to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.”	NA
mn89:21.7	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn89:21.8	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn90:0.1	Middle Discourses 90	NA
mn90:0.2	At Kaṇṇakatthala	NA
mn90:1.1	So I have heard.	The narrative of this sutta is entertainingly chaotic, with characters appearing and disappearing at random, many of whom are unknown or little-known elsewhere. This is a lifelike impression of how hard it is to maintain a rational dialogue among the comings and goings. Historically it gives a brief but telling character portrait of Viḍūḍabha, the ill-starred prince of Kosala.
mn90:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Ujuññā, in the deer park at Kaṇṇakatthala.	Ujuññā was a Kosalan town at which discussed asceticism with the naked ascetic Kassapa in [dn8](). | “Deer parks” were nature reservations where the animals were safe from hunters.
mn90:2.1	Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Ujuññā on some business.	NA
mn90:2.2	Then he addressed a man,	NA
mn90:2.3	“Please, worthy man, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	NA
mn90:2.4	NA	NA
mn90:2.5	And then say:	NA
mn90:2.6	‘Sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala will come to see you today when he has finished breakfast.’”	NA
mn90:2.7	“Yes, Your Majesty,” that man replied. He did as the king asked.	NA
mn90:2.8	NA	NA
mn90:2.9	NA	NA
mn90:2.10	NA	NA
mn90:3.1	The sisters Somā and Sakulā heard this.	These sisters were apparently both married to the King and, like his chief queen Mallikā, were devoted to the Buddha. Somā is perhaps the devout laywoman mentioned at [an8.91-117:1.1](), but is probably not the bhikkhunī of the same name mentioned at [sn5.2]() and [thig3.8](). Sakulā likewise is probably not the same person as the bhikkhunī mentioned in [thig5.7]() and [an1.242:1.1]().
mn90:3.2	NA	NA
mn90:3.3	While the meal was being served, they approached the king and said,	NA
mn90:3.4	“Great king, since you are going to the Buddha, please bow in our name with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”	NA
mn90:3.5	NA	NA
mn90:4.1	When he had finished breakfast, King Pasenadi went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
mn90:4.2	“Sir, the sisters Somā and Sakulā bow with their heads to your feet. They ask if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”	NA
mn90:4.3	“But, great king, couldn’t they get any other messenger?”	NA
mn90:4.4	So Pasenadi explained the circumstances of the message.	NA
mn90:4.5	NA	NA
mn90:4.6	NA	NA
mn90:4.7	NA	NA
mn90:4.8	NA	NA
mn90:4.9	The Buddha said, “May the sisters Somā and Sakulā be happy, great king.”	NA
mn90:5.1	Then the king said to the Buddha,	NA
mn90:5.2	“I have heard, sir, that the ascetic Gotama says this:	NA
mn90:5.3	‘There is no ascetic or brahmin who will ever claim to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception: that is not possible.’	The Buddha was well aware of the fact that people did, in fact, make such claims, as he discussed them several times (eg. [mn76:21.1]()). He just thought the claims were wrong. One unique detail of the phrasing here is that it is in future tense (also used below at [mn90:8.5]()). The implication seems to be that not only is it the case that no-one currently makes such claims, but that no-one ever will in the future. | Compare with other statements on omniscience at [mn14:17.3]() and [mn71:5.2]().
mn90:5.4	Do those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?”	NA
mn90:5.5	“Great king, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false and untrue.”	NA
mn90:6.1	Then King Pasenadi addressed General Viḍūḍabha,	The King’s son and heir, whose disastrous reign heralded the destruction of the Sakyans and the collapse of the Kosalan empire.
mn90:6.2	“General, who introduced this topic of discussion to the royal compound?”	NA
mn90:6.3	“It was Sañjaya, great king, the brahmin of the Ākāsa clan.”	_Ākāsa_ here is the Pali form of Sanskrit _āgastya_, the clan descending from the Vedic seer Agastya.
mn90:7.1	Then the king addressed a man,	NA
mn90:7.2	“Please, worthy man, in my name tell Sañjaya that	NA
mn90:7.3	King Pasenadi summons him.”	NA
mn90:7.4	“Yes, Your Majesty,” that man replied. He did as the king asked.	NA
mn90:7.5	NA	NA
mn90:8.1	Then the king said to the Buddha,	NA
mn90:8.2	“Sir, might the Buddha have spoken in reference to one thing, but that person believed it was something else?	NA
mn90:8.3	How then do you recall making this statement?”	NA
mn90:8.4	“Great king, I recall making this statement:	NA
mn90:8.5	‘There is no ascetic or brahmin who will ever know all and see all simultaneously: that is not possible.’”	Consciousness is conditioned, so any instance of knowing depends on a particular stimulus. At [mn76:52.5]() the Buddha discusses the related point of whether knowledge is continuous, illustrating it with a simile of an amputee.
mn90:8.6	“What the Buddha says appears reasonable.	NA
mn90:8.7	NA	NA
mn90:9.1	Sir, there are these four classes:	NA
mn90:9.2	aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials.	NA

mn90:9.6	“Of the four classes, two are said to be preeminent—	NA
mn90:9.7	the aristocrats and the brahmins.	NA
mn90:9.8	That is, when it comes to bowing down, rising up, greeting with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette.”	The Buddha acknowledges the social distinctions between the classes.
mn90:10.1	“Sir, I am not asking you about this life,	NA
mn90:10.2	but about the life to come.”	NA
mn90:10.3	NA	NA

mn90:10.5	NA	NA
mn90:10.6	“Great king, there are these five factors that support meditation.	NA
mn90:10.7	What five?	NA
mn90:10.8	It’s when a mendicant has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:	NA
mn90:10.9	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
mn90:10.10	They are rarely ill or unwell. Their stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and fit for meditation.	NA
mn90:10.11	They’re not devious or deceitful. They reveal themselves honestly to the Teacher or sensible spiritual companions.	NA
mn90:10.12	They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.	NA
mn90:10.13	They’re wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.	NA
mn90:10.14	These are the five factors that support meditation.	NA
mn90:10.15	There are these four classes:	NA
mn90:10.16	aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials.	NA
mn90:10.17	If they had these five factors that support meditation,	NA
mn90:10.18	that would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.”	NA
mn90:11.1	“Sir, there are these four classes:	NA
mn90:11.2	aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials.	NA
mn90:11.3	If they had these five factors that support meditation,	NA
mn90:11.4	would there be any difference between them?”	NA
mn90:11.5	“In that case, I say it is the diversity of their efforts in meditation.	NA
mn90:11.6	Suppose there was a pair of elephants or horses or oxen in training who were well tamed and well trained. And there was a pair who were not tamed or trained.	NA
mn90:11.7	What do you think, great king?	NA
mn90:11.8	Wouldn’t the pair that was well tamed and well trained perform the tasks of the tamed, and reach the level of the tamed?”	NA
mn90:11.9	“Yes, sir.”	NA
mn90:11.10	“But would the pair that was not tamed and trained perform the tasks of the tamed and reach the level of the tamed, just like the tamed pair?”	NA
mn90:11.11	“No, sir.”	NA
mn90:11.12	“In the same way, there are things that must be attained by someone with faith, health, integrity, energy, and wisdom. It’s not possible for a faithless, unhealthy, deceitful, lazy, witless person to attain them.”	NA
mn90:12.1	“What the Buddha says appears reasonable.	NA
mn90:12.2	Sir, there are these four classes:	NA
mn90:12.3	aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and workers.	NA
mn90:12.4	If they had these five factors that support meditation, and if they practiced rightly,	NA
mn90:12.5	would there be any difference between them?”	NA
mn90:12.6	“In that case, I say that there is no difference between the freedom of one and the freedom of the other.	NA
mn90:12.7	Suppose a person took dry teak wood and lit a fire and produced heat.	NA
mn90:12.8	Then another person did the same using sāl wood,	NA
mn90:12.9	another used mango wood,	NA
mn90:12.10	while another used wood of the cluster fig.	NA
mn90:12.11	What do you think, great king?	NA
mn90:12.12	Would there be any difference between the fires produced by these different kinds of wood, that is, in the flame, color, or light?”	NA
mn90:12.13	“No, sir.”	NA
mn90:12.14	“In the same way, when fire has been churned by energy and produced by effort, I say that there is no difference between the freedom of one and the freedom of the other.”	_Nimmathita_ refers to the process whereby a flame is produced by “churning” with a fire-drill. See Rig Veda 3.23.1a, 3.29.12a, 6.48.5, 8.48.6a, etc.
mn90:13.1	“What the Buddha says appears reasonable.	NA
mn90:13.2	But sir, do gods survive?”	The sense of _atthi devā_ (“do gods survive?”) is made clear by the following discussion. Compare _atthi attā_ (“the self survives”) at [sn44.10:1.3]() and [mn2:8.2]() in the same sense. In such cases the verb _atthi_ implies continued existence in a future life. We find a similar usage in Kaṭha Upaniṣad 1.20, where Naciketa wonders what happens to a man after he dies, as “some say he survives, while others say he does not survive” (_astīty eke nāyam astīti caike_).
mn90:13.3	“But what exactly are you asking?”	Questions with _atthi_ (“exists”, “survives”) about the self and rebirth are routinely met indirectly. Here the Buddha asks for clarification; at [sn44.10:1.3]() he avoids answering; at [mn100:42.5]() he answers in an oblique fashion. The reason for this seems to be that the verb _atthi_ conveys the metaphysical implication of “eternal existence”. The king clarifies that he wants to know what happens when a god passes away, showing that he is asking about rebirth rather than eternal existence.
mn90:13.4	NA	NA
mn90:13.5	“Whether those gods come back to this place or not.”	NA
mn90:13.6	“Those gods who are afflicted come back to this place, but those who are unafflicted do not come back.”	This builds on the discussion with Pasenadi in [mn88:10.6](), where “hurtful” or “afflicted” (_sabyābajjha_) behavior leads to suffering, elsewhere described as rebirth in a “hurtful” realm (eg. [mn57:8.2]()).
mn90:14.1	When he said this, General Viḍūḍabha said to the Buddha,	NA
mn90:14.2	“Sir, will the gods who are afflicted topple or expel from their place the gods who are unafflicted?”	In a few words we learn a lot about how Viḍūḍabha sees himself: he is an afflicted god.
mn90:14.3	Then Venerable Ānanda thought,	NA
mn90:14.4	“This General Viḍūḍabha is King Pasenadi’s son,	NA
mn90:14.5	and I am the Buddha’s son.	NA
mn90:14.6	Now is the time for one son to confer with another.”	NA
mn90:14.7	So Ānanda addressed General Viḍūḍabha,	NA
mn90:14.8	“Well then, general, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.	NA
mn90:14.9	What do you think, general?	NA
mn90:14.10	As far as the dominion of King Pasenadi of Kosala extends, where he rules as sovereign lord, can he topple or expel from that place any ascetic or brahmin, regardless of whether they are good or bad, or whether or not they are genuine spiritual practitioners?”	NA
mn90:14.11	“He can, worthy.”	_Bho_ (“worthy”) is typically used by brahmins; he also uses it in reference to the king below.
mn90:14.12	“What do you think, general?	NA
mn90:14.13	As far as the dominion of King Pasenadi does not extend, where he does not rule as sovereign lord, can he topple or expel from that place any ascetic or brahmin, regardless of whether they are good or bad, or whether or not they are genuine spiritual practitioners?”	NA
mn90:14.14	“He cannot, worthy.”	NA
mn90:14.15	“What do you think, general?	NA
mn90:14.16	Have you heard of the gods of the thirty-three?”	NA
mn90:14.17	“Yes, worthy,	NA
mn90:14.18	I’ve heard of them,	NA
mn90:14.19	and so has the worthy King Pasenadi.”	NA
mn90:14.20	“What do you think, general?	NA
mn90:14.21	Can King Pasenadi topple or expel from their place the gods of the thirty-three?”	NA
mn90:14.22	“King Pasenadi can’t even see the gods of the thirty-three, so how could he possibly topple or expel them from their place?”	NA
mn90:14.23	“In the same way, general, the gods who are afflicted can’t even see the gods who are unafflicted, so how could they possibly topple or expel them from their place?”	Compare the discussion in the Jain Viyāhapaṇṇatti 6.9.144, where pure gods are beyond the scope of impure gods.
mn90:15.1	Then the king said to the Buddha,	NA
mn90:15.2	“Sir, what is this mendicant’s name?”	If Pasenadi does not know Ānanda, this must be a very early encounter, perhaps his first.
mn90:15.3	“Ānanda, great king.”	NA
mn90:15.4	“A joy he is, and a joy he seems!	NA
mn90:15.5	What Venerable Ānanda says seems reasonable.	NA
mn90:15.6	But sir, does a divinity survive?”	NA
mn90:15.7	“But what exactly are you asking?”	NA
mn90:15.8	NA	NA
mn90:15.9	“Whether that Divinity comes back to this place or not.”	NA
mn90:15.10	“A divinity who is afflicted comes back to this place, but one who is unafflicted does not come back.”	NA
mn90:16.1	Then a certain man said to the king,	NA
mn90:16.2	“Great king, Sañjaya, the brahmin of the Ākāsa clan, has come.”	NA
mn90:16.3	Then King Pasenadi asked Sañjaya,	NA
mn90:16.4	“Brahmin, who introduced this topic of discussion to the royal compound?”	NA
mn90:16.5	“It was General Viḍūḍabha, great king.”	NA
mn90:16.6	But Viḍūḍabha said,	NA
mn90:16.7	“It was Sañjaya, great king, the brahmin of the Ākāsa clan.”	Not only does Viḍūḍabha exhibit poor leadership by blaming a subordinate, he is evidently lying about it.
mn90:17.1	Then a certain man said to the king,	NA
mn90:17.2	“It’s time to depart, great king.”	NA
mn90:17.3	So the king said to the Buddha,	NA
mn90:17.4	“Sir, I asked you about omniscience, and you answered.	NA
mn90:17.5	I endorse and accept this, and am satisfied with it.	NA
mn90:17.6	I asked you about purification in the four classes,	NA
mn90:17.7	NA	NA
mn90:17.8	about the gods,	NA
mn90:17.9	NA	NA
mn90:17.10	and about divinities, and you answered in each case.	NA
mn90:17.11	NA	NA
mn90:17.12	Whatever I asked the Buddha about, he answered.	NA
mn90:17.13	I endorse and accept this, and am satisfied with it.	NA
mn90:17.14	Well, now, sir, I must go.	NA
mn90:17.15	I have many duties, and much to do.”	NA
mn90:17.16	“Please, great king, go at your convenience.”	NA
mn90:18.1	Then King Pasenadi approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	NA

mn91:0.1	Middle Discourses 91	NA
mn91:0.2	With Brahmāyu	NA
mn91:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn91:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Videhans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants.	Videha was famous as the site of philosophical conversations in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, especially between Yājñavalkya and King Janaka. In my view, this sutta is constructed to show the Buddha’s conversion of a senior brahmin in Yājñavalkya’s tradition, possibly even a direct student.
mn91:2.1	Now at that time the brahmin Brahmāyu was residing in Mithilā. He was old, elderly, and senior, advanced in years, having reached the final stage of life; he was a hundred and twenty years old. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.	This brahmin seems to only be known from this sutta. | A few other people are said to have reached the advanced age of 120: Pasenadi’s grandmother ([sn3.22:2.1]()), some brahmins ([an3.51](), [an3.52]()), and Dhammasavapitu who went forth at 120 ([thag1.108]()). | “Vocabularies” is _nighaṇḍu_ (Sanskrit _nighaṇṭu_), known from the Nirukta of Yāska. | _Keṭubha_ lacks an obvious Sanskrit form. The commentary explains, “The study of proper and improper actions for the assistance of poets.” This suggests a connection with ritual performance, which is the special area of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. There we often find phrases such as _kṛtam bhavati_, “it is performed”, of which _keṭubha_ is perhaps a contraction. | _Akkhara_ (literally “syllable”) is explained by the commentary as _sikkhā_ (Sanskrit _śikṣā_), which is the study of pronunciation. This can be traced back to Pāṇinī, and is sometimes referred to as _akṣara-samāmnāya_, “collation of syllables”. | _Pabheda_ is found in Buddhist Sanskrit texts as _padaprabheda_, “classification of words”, such as into the different parts of speech. The commentary identifies it with _nirutti_. | _Padaka_ is one skilled in the _padapāṭha_ recitation of Vedas, which separates the individual words. | For “testaments” (_itihāsa_) see _itihāsa-purāṇa_ in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.6.8, explained by the commentator there as legends of creation and olden times. | “Cosmology” (_lokāyata_) here is a branch of Vedic learning, not the heterodox school known by this name in later times ([an9.38](), [sn12.48]()).
mn91:3.1	He heard:	NA
mn91:3.2	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is wandering in the land of the Videhans, together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants.	NA
mn91:3.3	He has this good reputation:	NA
mn91:3.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
mn91:3.5	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	NA
mn91:3.6	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
mn91:3.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	NA
mn91:4.1	Now at that time the brahmin Brahmāyu had a pupil named Uttara. He too had mastered the Vedic curriculum.	Uttara is a common name and it is unclear if this is the same person as any of the other Uttaras.
mn91:4.2	Brahmāyu told Uttara of the Buddha’s presence in the land of the Videhans, and added:	NA
mn91:4.3	NA	NA
mn91:4.4	NA	NA
mn91:4.5	NA	NA
mn91:4.6	NA	NA
mn91:4.7	“Please, dear Uttara, go to the ascetic Gotama and find out whether or not he lives up to his reputation.	Similar quests were enjoined by Pokkharasāti on Ambaṭṭha ([dn3:dn3:1.48]()), and by the elderly brahmin Bāvari on his sixteen students [snp5.1:22.1]().
mn91:4.8	NA	NA
mn91:4.9	Through you I shall learn about the worthy Gotama.”	Following PTS and BJT editions, which read _tayā_ for _tathā_.
mn91:5.1	“But sir, how shall I find out whether or not the ascetic Gotama lives up to his reputation?”	NA
mn91:5.2	NA	NA
mn91:5.3	“Dear Uttara, the thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.	In Buddhist texts the marks are presented as the fulfillment of Brahmanical prophecy, but they are not found in any Brahmanical texts of the Buddha’s time. However, later astrological texts such as the Gārgīyajyotiṣa (1st century BCE?) and Bṛhatsaṁhitā (6th century CE?) contain references to many of these marks, albeit in a different context, so it seems likely the Buddhist texts are drawing on now-lost Brahmanical scriptures. | The notion of a two-fold course for a great hero—worldly success or spiritual—can be traced back as far as the epic of Gilgamesh.
mn91:5.4	If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures.	The idea of the wheel-turning monarch draws from the Vedic horse sacrifice, which establishes the authority of a king from sea to sea. The Buddhist telling is divested of all coarse and violent elements. The wheeled chariot gave military supremacy to the ancient Indo-Europeans, allowing them to spread from their ancient homeland north of the Black Sea. In Buddhism, the wheel, which also has solar connotations, symbolizes unstoppable power. For a legendary account of such a king, see the Mahāsudassanasutta ([dn17]()). Rig Veda 8.63.8 speaks of Indra as the “wheel turner”.
mn91:5.5	He has the following seven treasures:	Various “treasures” (_ratana_) or “gems” of a king are discussed in such texts as Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.3.1. They are described in detail at [mn129:34.1]() ff.
mn91:5.6	the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure.	NA
mn91:5.7	He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.	The sacrificial horse on its journey across the land is protected by a hundred sons.
mn91:5.8	After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword.	NA
mn91:5.9	But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world.	NA
mn91:5.10	But, dear Uttara, I am the one who gives the hymns,	NA
mn91:5.11	and you are the one who receives them.”	NA
mn91:6.1	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Uttara. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Brahmāyu before setting out for the land of the Videhans where the Buddha was wandering.	NA
mn91:6.2	Traveling stage by stage, he came to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn91:6.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,	NA
mn91:6.4	and scrutinized his body for the thirty-two marks of a great man.	NA
mn91:6.5	He saw all of them except for two,	NA
mn91:6.6	which he had doubts about:	NA
mn91:6.7	whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.	NA
mn91:6.8	Then it occurred to the Buddha,	NA
mn91:6.9	“This student Uttara sees all the marks except for two,	NA
mn91:6.10	which he has doubts about:	NA
mn91:6.11	whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.”	NA
mn91:7.1	So the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Uttara would see his private parts covered in a foreskin.	NA
mn91:7.2	And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue.	NA
mn91:8.1	Then Uttara thought,	NA
mn91:8.2	“The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks.	NA
mn91:8.3	Why don’t I follow him and observe his deportment?”	NA
mn91:8.4	So Uttara followed the Buddha like a shadow for seven months.	In [an4.192]() the Buddha says it is only possible to really know a person’s character by living with them for a long time.
mn91:8.5	When seven months had passed he set out wandering towards Mithilā.	NA
mn91:8.6	There he approached the brahmin Brahmāyu, bowed, and sat down to one side. Brahmāyu said to him,	NA
mn91:8.7	“Well, dear Uttara, does the worthy Gotama live up to his reputation or not?”	NA
mn91:8.8	NA	NA
mn91:8.9	“He does, sir.	NA
mn91:8.10	NA	NA
mn91:8.11	The worthy Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks.	The marks are also listed at [dn14:1.32.7]() and analyzed in kammic terms at [dn30:1.2.4](). Here I list the related marks in the Bṛhatsaṁhitā as identified by Nathan McGovern (*On the Origins of the 32 Marks of a Great Man*, Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, 2016, vol. 39, pp. 207–247).
mn91:9.1	He has well-planted feet.	This echoes the posture of the newborn bodhisatta, and has the same meaning: that he will become awakened by “standing on his own two feet”.
mn91:9.2	NA	NA
mn91:9.3	On the soles of his feet there are thousand-spoked wheels, with rims and hubs, complete in every detail.	These leave marks that were seen by Doṇa ([an4.36:1.3]()). They are often depicted in Buddhist art, signifying the perfection and completeness of the traces that the Buddha leaves behind in his teachings and practice. Bṛhatsaṁhitā 69.17 lists several auspicious marks, including the wheel.
mn91:9.4	He has stretched heels.	Described as “abundantly long” at [dn30:1.12.8]().
mn91:9.5	He has long fingers.	Same at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.36.
mn91:9.6	His hands and feet are tender.	Tender feet at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.2.
mn91:9.7	He has serried hands and feet.	Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.2 has _śliṣtāṅgulī_ (“compact or sticky fingers”). The commentary denies that the Pali _jāla_ means a physical web. I think it means that the fingers and toes were usually held together rather than splayed, hence not letting things slip through the fingers.
mn91:9.8	The tops of his feet are arched.	_Ussaṅkha_ means “(curved) up like a shell”, while Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.2 says “curved up like a tortoise”. The descriptive verse at [dn30:1.21.12]() shows that it refers to the tops of the feet.
mn91:9.9	His calves are like those of an antelope.	These are presumably the long, elegant rear calves of the Indian Blackbuck.
mn91:9.10	When standing upright and not bending over, the palms of both hands touch the knees.	This agrees with Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.35.
mn91:9.11	His private parts are covered in a foreskin.	Same at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.8.
mn91:9.12	He is golden colored; his skin shines like lustrous gold.	Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.102 says kings have a shining complexion.
mn91:9.13	He has delicate skin, so delicate that dust and dirt don’t stick to his body.	Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.102 mentions a “clean complexion” (_śuddha_).
mn91:9.14	His hairs grow one per pore.	Same at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.5.
mn91:9.15	His hairs stand up; they’re blue-black and curl clockwise.	Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.26 says those with hairs turning right become kings.
mn91:9.16	His body is tall and straight-limbed.	Here _brahm-_ is an adjective from √_brah_ + _ma_, equivalent to the Sanskrit _bṛṁh_, having the sense “grown, extended”. The Sanskrit form here is _bṛhadṛjugātra_.
mn91:9.17	He has bulging muscles in seven places.	Hands, feet, shoulders, and chest ([dn30:1.13.5]()).
mn91:9.18	His chest is like that of a lion.	Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.18 compares not the chest but the hips with a lion.
mn91:9.19	He is filled out between the shoulders.	Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.27 says the heart is raised and muscular.
mn91:9.20	He has the proportional circumference of a banyan tree: the span of his arms equals the height of his body.	Bṛhatsaṁhitā 69.13 has the same proportions without the simile. These are the normal human proportions, yet we cannot touch our knees without bending. The only way these marks could be reconciled is if the arms were extra long and the length of the legs below the knees was extra long as well. And this is exactly what we are told: the ankles are stretched and long, and the calves are like those of an antelope, whose rear calves are long proportionate to the thigh. Thus in this regard the marks appear to be internally consistent, though not describing normal human anatomy.
mn91:9.21	His torso is cylindrical.	NA
mn91:9.22	He has ridged taste buds.	“Ridged taste buds” is _rasaggasaggī_. _Rasa_ can mean either “taste” or “nutrition”, but the use of _ojā_ in [dn30:2.9.8]() confirms the latter. _Gasa_ is “swallow” and per [dn30:2.7.4]() it is the “conveyance of savor” (_rasaharaṇīyo_). _Agga_ often means “best”, but this is derived from the primary sense of “peak”. The descriptors _uddhagga_ (“raised”) at [dn30:2.7.4]() and _susaṇṭhitā_ (“prominent”) at [dn30:2.9.8]() confirm that the latter is meant. The mark refers to taste buds raised in noticeable ridges on the tongue that absorb nutrition and aid digestion. It has often been interpreted as “excellent (_aggī_) sense (_gasa_) of taste (_rasa_)”, but this, being imperceptible to others, is rather a secondary consequence of the mark.
mn91:9.23	His jaw is like that of a lion.	NA
mn91:9.24	He has forty teeth.	NA
mn91:9.25	His teeth are even.	Even, gapless, and white teeth are at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.52.
mn91:9.26	His teeth have no gaps.	NA
mn91:9.27	His teeth are perfectly white.	NA
mn91:9.28	He has a large tongue.	Same at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.53.
mn91:9.29	He has the voice of the Divinity, like a cuckoo’s call.	NA
mn91:9.30	His eyes are indigo.	At [thig13.1:6.2]() Ambapālī describes her eyes as _abhinīla_. While some Indians do indeed have blue eyes, this probably describes a black so deep it appears blue.
mn91:9.31	He has eyelashes like a cow’s.	Cows have long and elegant eyelashes.
mn91:9.32	Between his eyebrows there grows a tuft, soft and white like cotton-wool.	NA
mn91:9.33	The crown of his head is like a turban.	The _uṇhīsa_ is depicted as a bulge on the Buddha’s crown.
mn91:9.34	These are the thirty-two marks of a great man possessed by the worthy Gotama.	NA
mn91:10.1	When he’s walking he takes the first step with the right foot.	From here Uttara describes the Buddha’s conduct, showing his keen observation of details.
mn91:10.2	He doesn’t lift his foot too far or place it too near.	NA
mn91:10.3	He doesn’t walk too slow or too fast.	NA
mn91:10.4	He walks without knocking his knees or ankles together.	_Adduva_ means “knee” according to the commentary.
mn91:10.5	When he’s walking he keeps his thighs neither too straight nor too bent, neither too tight nor too loose.	NA
mn91:10.6	When he walks, only the lower half of his body moves, and he walks effortlessly.	NA
mn91:10.7	When he turns to look he does so with the whole body.	This is the so-called “elephant look” ([dn16:4.1.2]()).
mn91:10.8	He doesn’t look directly up or down.	NA
mn91:10.9	He doesn’t look all around while walking, but focuses a plough’s length in front. Beyond that he has unhindered knowledge and vision.	As at [snp3.1:6.4]().
mn91:11.1	When entering an inhabited area he keeps his body neither too straight nor too bent, neither too tight nor too loose.	NA
mn91:12.1	He turns around neither too far nor too close to the seat. He doesn’t lean on his hand when sitting down. And he doesn’t just plonk his body down on the seat.	NA
mn91:12.2	When sitting in inhabited areas he doesn’t fidget with his hands or feet.	NA
mn91:12.3	He doesn’t sit with his knees or ankles crossed.	NA
mn91:12.4	He doesn’t sit with his hand holding his chin.	NA
mn91:12.5	When sitting in inhabited areas he doesn’t shake, tremble, quake, or get nervous, and so he is not nervous at all.	NA
mn91:12.6	When sitting in inhabited areas he still practices seclusion.	NA
mn91:13.1	When receiving water for rinsing the bowl, he holds the bowl neither too straight nor too bent, neither too tight nor too loose.	NA
mn91:14.1	He receives neither too little nor too much water.	NA
mn91:14.2	He rinses the bowl without making a sloshing noise, or spinning it around. He doesn’t put the bowl on the ground to rinse his hands; his hands and bowl are rinsed at the same time.	NA
mn91:14.3	He doesn’t throw the bowl rinsing water away too far or too near, or splash it about.	NA
mn91:14.4	When receiving rice, he holds the bowl neither too straight nor too bent, neither too close nor too loose.	NA
mn91:14.5	He receives neither too little nor too much rice.	NA
mn91:14.6	He eats sauce in a moderate proportion, and doesn’t put too much sauce on his portions.	NA
mn91:14.7	He chews over each portion two or three times before swallowing.	NA
mn91:14.8	But no grain of rice enters his body unchewed, and none remain in his mouth.	NA
mn91:14.9	Only then does he raise another portion to his lips.	NA
mn91:14.10	He eats experiencing the taste, but without experiencing greed for the taste.	NA
mn91:14.11	He eats food thinking of eight reasons:	NA
mn91:14.12	‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will have the means to keep going, blamelessness, and a comfortable abiding.’	This is the traditional reflection on the meal ([mn2:14.2]()).
mn91:15.1	After eating, when receiving water for washing the bowl, he holds the bowl neither too straight nor too bent, neither too tight nor too loose.	NA
mn91:15.2	He receives neither too little nor too much water.	NA
mn91:15.3	He washes the bowl without making a sloshing noise, or spinning it around. He doesn’t put the bowl on the ground to wash his hands; his hands and bowl are washed at the same time.	NA
mn91:15.4	He doesn’t throw the bowl washing water away too far or too near, or splash it about.	NA
mn91:16.1	After eating he doesn’t put the bowl on the ground too far away or too close. He’s not careless with his bowl, nor does he spend too much time on it.	NA
mn91:17.1	After eating he sits a while in silence, but doesn’t wait too long to give the verses of appreciation.	NA
mn91:17.2	After eating he expresses appreciation without criticizing the meal or expecting another one.	This is the _anumodanā_ recited for the meal offering. Examples are found at [dn16:1.31.1](), [snp3.7:34.3]() = [mn92:25.6](), [sn55.26:20.1](), [pli-tv-kd1:15.14.4](), and [pli-tv-kd1:1.5.1](). | It is worth noting that no early _anomodanā_ uses the imperative verb form _-tu_ signifying giving a blessing (eg. _bhavatu sabbamaṅgalaṁ_, “may all blessings be”). They strictly use the indicative _-ti_ to teach cause and effect: if you do this, that happens.
mn91:17.3	Invariably, he educates, encourages, fires up, and inspires that assembly with a Dhamma talk.	NA
mn91:17.4	Then he gets up from his seat and leaves.	NA
mn91:18.1	He walks neither too fast nor too slow, without wanting to get out of there.	NA
mn91:19.1	He wears his robe on his body neither too high nor too low, neither too clinging nor too loose.	NA
mn91:19.2	The wind doesn’t blow his robe off his body.	NA
mn91:19.3	And dust and dirt don’t stick to his body.	NA
mn91:20.1	When he has gone to the monastery he sits on a seat spread out and washes his feet.	NA
mn91:20.2	But he doesn’t waste time with pedicures.	NA
mn91:20.3	When he has washed his feet, he sits down cross-legged, sets his body straight, and establishes mindfulness in his presence.	NA
mn91:20.4	He has no intention to hurt himself, hurt others, or hurt both.	NA
mn91:20.5	He only wishes for the welfare of himself, of others, of both, and of the whole world.	NA
mn91:21.1	In the monastery when he teaches Dhamma to an assembly, he neither flatters them nor rebukes them.	NA
mn91:21.2	Invariably, he educates, encourages, fires up, and inspires that assembly with a Dhamma talk.	NA
mn91:21.3	The sound of his voice has eight qualities:	NA
mn91:21.4	it is clear, comprehensible, charming, audible, lucid, undistorted, deep, and resonant.	NA
mn91:21.5	He makes sure his voice is intelligible as far as the assembly goes, but the sound doesn’t extend outside the assembly.	NA
mn91:21.6	And when they’ve been inspired with a Dhamma talk by the worthy Gotama they get up from their seats and leave looking back at him alone, and not forgetting their lesson.	NA
mn91:22.1	I have seen the worthy Gotama walking and standing; entering inhabited areas, and sitting and eating there; sitting silently after eating, and expressing appreciation; going to the monastery, sitting silently there, and teaching Dhamma to an assembly there.	NA
mn91:22.2	Such is the worthy Gotama; such he is and more than that.”	NA
mn91:23.1	When he had spoken, the brahmin Brahmāyu got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and uttered this aphorism three times:	NA
mn91:23.2	“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	NA
mn91:23.3	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	NA
mn91:23.4	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	NA
mn91:23.5	Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet him, and we can have a discussion.”	NA
mn91:24.1	And then the Buddha, traveling stage by stage in the Videhan lands, arrived at Mithilā,	NA
mn91:24.2	where he stayed in the Maghadeva Mango Grove.	The story of Maghadeva is told in [mn83]().
mn91:24.3	The brahmins and householders of Mithilā heard:	NA
mn91:24.4	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Mithilā, where he is staying in the Maghadeva Mango Grove.	NA
mn91:24.5	He has this good reputation:	NA
mn91:24.6	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
mn91:24.7	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	NA
mn91:24.8	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
mn91:24.9	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	NA
mn91:25.1	Then the brahmins and householders of Mithilā went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.	NA
mn91:26.1	The brahmin Brahmāyu also heard that the Buddha had arrived.	NA
mn91:26.2	So he went to the Maghadeva Mango Grove together with several disciples.	NA
mn91:26.3	Not far from the grove he thought,	NA
mn91:26.4	“It wouldn’t be appropriate for me to go to see the ascetic Gotama without first letting him know.”	This shows his deep respect and politeness.
mn91:26.5	So he addressed one of his young students:	NA
mn91:26.6	“Here, young student, go to the ascetic Gotama and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	NA
mn91:26.7	NA	NA
mn91:26.8	And then say:	NA
mn91:26.9	‘Worthy Gotama, , the brahmin Brahmāyu is old, elderly, and senior, advanced in years, having reached the final stage of life; he is a hundred and twenty years old. He has mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knows them word-by-word, and their grammar. He is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.	NA
mn91:26.10	Of all the brahmins and householders residing in Mithilā, Brahmāyu is said to be the foremost in	NA
mn91:26.11	wealth,	NA
mn91:26.12	NA	NA
mn91:26.13	hymns,	NA
mn91:26.14	NA	NA
mn91:26.15	lifespan, and fame.	NA
mn91:26.16	He wants to see the worthy Gotama.’”	NA
mn91:26.17	“Yes, worthy sir,” that young student replied. He did as he was asked, and the Buddha said,	NA
mn91:26.18	NA	NA
mn91:26.19	NA	NA
mn91:26.20	NA	NA
mn91:26.21	NA	NA

mn91:26.26	NA	NA
mn91:26.27	NA	NA
mn91:26.28	NA	NA
mn91:26.29	“Please, student, let Brahmāyu come when he’s ready.”	NA
mn91:27.1	The young student went back to Brahmāyu and said to him,	NA
mn91:27.2	“Your request for an audience with the ascetic Gotama has been granted.	NA
mn91:27.3	Please go at your convenience.”	NA
mn91:28.1	Then the brahmin Brahmāyu went up to the Buddha.	NA
mn91:28.2	The assembly saw him coming off in the distance,	NA
mn91:28.3	and made way for him, as he was well-known and famous.	NA
mn91:28.4	Brahmāyu said to that retinue,	NA
mn91:28.5	“Enough, gentlemen.	NA
mn91:28.6	Please sit on your own seats.	NA
mn91:28.7	I shall sit here by the ascetic Gotama.”	NA
mn91:29.1	Then the brahmin Brahmāyu went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn91:29.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,	NA
mn91:29.3	and scrutinized the Buddha’s body for the thirty-two marks of a great man.	NA
mn91:29.4	He saw all of them except for two,	NA
mn91:29.5	which he had doubts about:	NA
mn91:29.6	whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.	NA
mn91:29.7	Then Brahmāyu addressed the Buddha in verse:	NA
mn91:29.8	“I have learned of the thirty-two	NA
mn91:29.9	marks of a great man.	NA
mn91:29.10	There are two that I don’t see	NA
mn91:29.11	on the body of the worthy Gotama.	NA
mn91:29.12	Are the private parts covered in a foreskin,	NA
mn91:29.13	O supreme person?	NA
mn91:29.14	Though called by a word of the feminine gender,	“Tongue” in Pali is the feminine _jivhā_.
mn91:29.15	perhaps your tongue is a manly one?	Read _narassikā_.
mn91:29.16	Perhaps your tongue is large,	NA
mn91:29.17	as we have been informed.	NA
mn91:29.18	Please stick it out in its full extent,	NA
mn91:29.19	and so, O seer, dispel my doubt.	NA
mn91:29.20	For my welfare and benefit in this life,	NA
mn91:29.21	and happiness in the next.	NA
mn91:29.22	And I ask you to grant the opportunity	NA
mn91:29.23	to ask whatever I desire.”	NA
mn91:30.1	Then the Buddha thought,	NA
mn91:30.2	“Brahmāyu sees all the marks except for two,	NA
mn91:30.3	which he has doubts about:	NA
mn91:30.4	whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.”	NA
mn91:30.5	So the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Divinityyu would see his private parts covered in a foreskin.	NA
mn91:30.6	And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue.	NA
mn91:30.7	Then the Buddha replied to Brahmāyu in verse:	NA
mn91:31.1	“The thirty-two marks of a great man	NA
mn91:31.2	that you have learned	NA
mn91:31.3	are all found on my body:	NA
mn91:31.4	so do not doubt, brahmin.	NA
mn91:31.5	I have known what should be known,	This four-line verse encompasses the four noble truths with their duties: suffering is to be known; the origin of suffering is to be given up; the path is to be developed. The third noble truth, the witnessing of Nibbana, is implied in the final line.
mn91:31.6	and developed what should be developed,	NA
mn91:31.7	and given up what should be given up:	NA
mn91:31.8	and so, brahmin, I am a Buddha.	NA
mn91:31.9	For your welfare and benefit in this life,	NA
mn91:31.10	and happiness in the next:	NA
mn91:31.11	I grant you the opportunity	NA
mn91:31.12	to ask whatever you desire.”	NA
mn91:32.1	Then Brahmāyu thought:	NA
mn91:32.2	“My request has been granted.	NA
mn91:32.3	Should I ask him about	NA
mn91:32.4	what is beneficial in this life or the next?”	NA
mn91:32.5	Then he thought,	NA
mn91:32.6	“I’m well versed in the benefits that apply to this life,	NA
mn91:32.7	and others ask me about this.	NA
mn91:32.8	Why don’t I ask the ascetic Gotama about the benefit that specifically applies to lives to come?”	NA
mn91:32.9	So Brahmāyu addressed the Buddha in verse:	NA
mn91:32.10	“How do you become a brahmin?	For some reason, the Buddha does not actually answer these questions, except the final two on the sage and the awakened one. Most of the others are technical terms in Brahmanism, and they are elsewhere defined by the Buddha in his own terms (eg. [mn39:23.1]() ff.). The Chinese parallels at MA 161 and T 76 have fewer items than the Pali, but do a better job of matching the answers to the questions.
mn91:32.11	And how do you become a knowledge master?	NA
mn91:32.12	How a master of the three knowledges?	NA
mn91:32.13	And how is one called a scholar?	NA
mn91:32.14	How do you become a perfected one?	NA
mn91:32.15	And how a consummate one?	NA
mn91:32.16	How do you become a sage?	NA
mn91:32.17	And how is one declared to be awakened?”	NA
mn91:33.1	Then the Buddha replied to Brahmāyu in verse:	NA
mn91:33.2	“One who knows their past lives,	NA
mn91:33.3	sees heaven and places of loss,	NA
mn91:33.4	and has attained the end of rebirth:	NA
mn91:33.5	such a sage has perfect insight.	NA
mn91:33.6	They know their mind is pure,	NA
mn91:33.7	completely freed from greed;	NA
mn91:33.8	they’ve given up birth and death,	NA
mn91:33.9	and have completed the spiritual journey.	NA
mn91:33.10	Gone beyond all things,	NA
mn91:33.11	such a one is declared to be awakened.”	NA
mn91:34.1	When he said this, Brahmāyu got up from his seat and arranged his robe on one shoulder. He bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name:	NA
mn91:34.2	“I am the brahmin Brahmāyu, worthy Gotama!	NA
mn91:34.3	I am the brahmin Brahmāyu!”	NA
mn91:35.1	Then that assembly, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought,	NA
mn91:35.2	“Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing,	NA
mn91:35.3	that Divinityyu, who is so well-known and famous, should show the Buddha such utmost devotion.”	NA
mn91:35.4	Then the Buddha said to Brahmāyu,	NA
mn91:35.5	“Enough, brahmin. Get up, and sit in your own seat, since your mind has such confidence in me.”	NA
mn91:35.6	So Brahmāyu got up and sat in his own seat.	NA
mn91:36.1	Then the Buddha taught him step by step, with	NA
mn91:36.2	a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven.	NA
mn91:36.3	He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation.	NA
mn91:36.4	And when the Buddha knew that Divinityyu’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas:	NA
mn91:36.5	suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.	NA
mn91:36.6	Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye,	NA
mn91:36.7	in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the brahmin Brahmāyu:	NA
mn91:36.8	“Everything that has a beginning has an end.”	NA
mn91:36.9	Then Brahmāyu saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha:	NA
mn91:37.1	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	NA
mn91:37.2	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
mn91:37.3	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
mn91:37.4	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.	NA
mn91:37.5	Would you and the mendicant Saṅgha please accept a meal from me tomorrow?”	NA
mn91:37.6	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
mn91:37.7	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Brahmāyu got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	NA
mn91:38.1	And when the night had passed Brahmāyu had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	NA
mn91:38.2	“It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.”	NA
mn91:38.3	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the brahmin Brahmāyu, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.	NA
mn91:38.4	For seven days, Brahmāyu served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	NA
mn91:39.1	When the seven days had passed, the Buddha departed to wander in the Videhan lands.	NA
mn91:39.2	Not long after the Buddha left, Brahmāyu passed away.	NA
mn91:39.3	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
mn91:39.4	“Sir, Brahmāyu has passed away.	NA
mn91:39.5	Where has he been reborn in his next life?”	NA
mn91:39.6	“Mendicants, the brahmin Brahmāyu was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings.	NA
mn91:39.7	With the ending of the five lower fetters, he’s been reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.”	NA
mn91:39.8	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn91:39.9	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn92:0.1	Middle Discourses 92	NA
mn92:0.2	With Sela	NA
mn92:1.1	So I have heard.	This entire sutta is repeated at [snp3.7]().
mn92:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants in the land of the Aṅguttarāpans when he arrived at a town of theirs named Āpaṇa.	NA
mn92:2.1	The matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya heard:	NA
mn92:2.2	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Āpaṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.	NA
mn92:2.3	He has this good reputation:	NA
mn92:2.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
mn92:2.5	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	NA
mn92:2.6	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
mn92:2.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	NA
mn92:3.1	So Keṇiya approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	Keṇiya features also in the Vinaya, where at this point he offered the Buddha and the Sangha a drink in the evening, reasoning that the Brahmanical sages of the past did likewise ([pli-tv-kd6:35.1.2]()). As a result, the Buddha allowed fruit juice and other drinks in the evening.
mn92:3.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.	NA
mn92:3.3	The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk.	NA
mn92:3.4	Then he said to the Buddha,	NA
mn92:3.5	“Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”	NA
mn92:3.6	When he said this, the Buddha said to him,	NA
mn92:3.7	“The Saṅgha is large, Keṇiya; there are 1,250 mendicants. And you are devoted to the brahmins.”	NA
mn92:3.8	For a second time, Keṇiya asked the Buddha to accept a meal offering.	NA
mn92:3.9	“Never mind that the Saṅgha is large, with 1,250 mendicants, and that I am devoted to the brahmins.	NA
mn92:3.10	Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”	NA
mn92:3.11	And for a second time, the Buddha gave the same reply.	NA
mn92:3.12	NA	NA
mn92:3.13	For a third time, Keṇiya asked the Buddha to accept a meal offering.	NA
mn92:3.14	“Never mind that the Saṅgha is large, with 1,250 mendicants, and that I am devoted to the brahmins.	NA
mn92:3.15	Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”	NA
mn92:3.16	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
mn92:4.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Keṇiya got up from his seat and went to his own hermitage. There he addressed his friends and colleagues, relatives and kin,	NA
mn92:4.2	“My friends and colleagues, relatives and kin: please listen!	NA
mn92:4.3	The ascetic Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal.	NA
mn92:4.4	Please help me out with the manual preparations.”	“Manual preparations” is _kāyaveyyāvaṭikaṁ_. Ten kinds of service are enumerated in the Jain Tattvārthasūtra 9.24.
mn92:4.5	“Yes, worthy sir,” they replied. Some dug ovens, some chopped wood, some washed dishes, some set out a water jar, and some spread out seats.	NA
mn92:4.6	Meanwhile, Keṇiya set up the pavilion himself.	NA
mn92:5.1	Now at that time the brahmin Sela was residing in Āpaṇa. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. And he was teaching three hundred young students to recite the hymns.	NA
mn92:6.1	And at that time Keṇiya was devoted to Sela.	NA
mn92:6.2	Then Sela, while going for a walk escorted by the three hundred young students, approached Keṇiya’s hermitage.	NA
mn92:6.3	He saw the preparations going on,	NA
mn92:7.1	and said to Keṇiya,	NA
mn92:7.2	“Keṇiya, is your son or daughter being married? Or are you setting up a big sacrifice? Or has King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha been invited for tomorrow’s meal?”	Aṅga was subject to Magadha at that time. | This passage is partially echoed in the account of Anāthapiṇḍika’s conversion ([pli-tv-kd16:4.1.10]()).
mn92:8.1	“There is no marriage, Sela, and the king is not coming.	NA
mn92:8.2	Rather, I am setting up a big sacrifice.	NA
mn92:8.3	The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Āpaṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.	NA
mn92:8.4	He has this good reputation:	NA
mn92:8.5	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
mn92:8.6	He has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal together with the mendicant Saṅgha.”	NA
mn92:9.1	“Worthy Keṇiya, did you say ‘the awakened one’?”	Anāthapiṇḍika responded in the same way when hearing of the Buddha ([pli-tv-kd16:4.2.10]()). Also compare Bāvari’s elation at [snp5.1:19.1]().
mn92:9.2	“I said ‘the awakened one’.”	NA
mn92:9.3	“Did you say ‘the awakened one’?”	NA
mn92:9.4	“I said ‘the awakened one’.”	NA
mn92:10.1	Then Sela thought,	NA
mn92:10.2	“It’s hard to even find the word ‘awakened one’ in the world.	NA
mn92:10.3	The thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.	NA
mn92:10.4	If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures.	NA
mn92:10.5	He has the following seven treasures:	NA
mn92:10.6	the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure.	NA
mn92:10.7	He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.	NA
mn92:10.8	After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword.	NA
mn92:10.9	But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world.”	NA
mn92:11.1	“But Keṇiya, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”	NA
mn92:11.2	When he said this, Keṇiya pointed with his right arm and said,	NA
mn92:11.3	“There, worthy Sela, at that line of blue forest.”	NA
mn92:12.1	Then Sela, together with his young students, approached the Buddha.	NA
mn92:12.2	He said to his young students,	NA
mn92:12.3	“Come quietly, gentlemen, tread gently.	NA
mn92:12.4	For the Buddhas are intimidating, like a lion living alone.	_Durāsada_ (“intimidating”) is also at [an4.42:4.1](), which shows that the sense is that they are hard to defeat in debate.
mn92:12.5	When I’m consulting with the ascetic Gotama, don’t interrupt.	NA
mn92:12.6	Wait until I’ve finished speaking.”	NA
mn92:13.1	Then Sela went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn92:13.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,	NA
mn92:13.3	and scrutinized the Buddha’s body for the thirty-two marks of a great man.	NA
mn92:13.4	He saw all of them except for two,	NA
mn92:13.5	which he had doubts about:	NA
mn92:13.6	whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.	NA
mn92:13.7	Then it occurred to the Buddha,	NA
mn92:13.8	“Sela sees all the marks except for two,	NA
mn92:13.9	which he has doubts about:	NA
mn92:13.10	whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.”	NA
mn92:14.1	The Buddha used his psychic power to will that Sela would see his private parts covered in a foreskin.	NA
mn92:14.2	And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue.	NA
mn92:15.1	Then Sela thought,	NA
mn92:15.2	“The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks completely, lacking none.	NA
mn92:15.3	But I don’t know whether or not he is an awakened one.	As his verses make clear, Sela has not ruled out the possibility that Gotama’s destiny is to become a wheel-turning monarch rather than a Buddha.
mn92:15.4	I have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior, the tutors of tutors, said,	NA
mn92:15.5	‘Those who are perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas reveal themselves when praised.’	This idea is not found elsewhere in the Pali.
mn92:15.6	Why don’t I extoll him in his presence with fitting verses?”	NA
mn92:15.7	Then Sela extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses:	NA
mn92:16.1	“O Blessed One, your body’s perfect,	These are also found in Sela’s verses at [thag16.6]().
mn92:16.2	you’re radiant, handsome, lovely to behold;	NA
mn92:16.3	golden colored,	NA
mn92:16.4	with teeth so white; you’re strong.	NA
mn92:16.5	The characteristics	NA
mn92:16.6	of a handsome man,	NA
mn92:16.7	the marks of a great man,	NA
mn92:16.8	are all found on your body.	NA
mn92:16.9	Your eyes are clear, your face is fair,	NA
mn92:16.10	you’re formidable, upright, majestic.	NA
mn92:16.11	In the midst of the Saṅgha of ascetics,	NA
mn92:16.12	you shine like the sun.	NA
mn92:16.13	You’re a mendicant fine to see,	NA
mn92:16.14	with skin that shines like lustrous gold.	NA
mn92:16.15	But with such excellent appearance,	NA
mn92:16.16	what do you want with the ascetic life?	NA
mn92:16.17	You’re fit to be a king,	NA
mn92:16.18	a wheel-turning monarch, chief of charioteers,	NA
mn92:16.19	victorious in the four quarters,	NA
mn92:16.20	lord of the Black Plum Tree Land.	NA
mn92:16.21	Aristocrats, nobles, and kings	NA
mn92:16.22	ought follow your rule.	NA
mn92:16.23	Gotama, may you reign	NA
mn92:16.24	as king of kings, lord of mankind!”	NA
mn92:17.1	“I am a king, Sela,	NA
mn92:17.2	the supreme king of the teaching.	NA
mn92:17.3	By the teaching I roll forth the wheel	NA
mn92:17.4	which cannot be rolled back.”	This is of course a reference to the first sermon ([sn56.11]()).
mn92:18.1	“You claim to be awakened,	NA
mn92:18.2	the supreme king of the teaching.	NA
mn92:18.3	‘I roll forth the teaching’:	NA
mn92:18.4	so you say, Gotama.	NA
mn92:18.5	Then who is your general,	The title “General of the Dhamma” belongs to Sāriputta ([ud2.8:16.2](), [thag18.1:33.1]()).
mn92:18.6	the disciple who follows the Teacher’s way?	NA
mn92:18.7	Who keeps rolling the wheel	NA
mn92:18.8	of teaching you rolled forth?”	NA
mn92:19.1	“By me the wheel was rolled forth,”	NA
mn92:19.2	said the Buddha,	NA
mn92:19.3	“the supreme wheel of teaching.	NA
mn92:19.4	Sāriputta, taking after the Realized One,	NA
mn92:19.5	keeps it rolling on.	_Anujāta_ is said at [iti74:4.1]() to be a child who “takes after” the good qualities of their parents.
mn92:19.6	I have known what should be known,	As at [mn91:31.5]().
mn92:19.7	and developed what should be developed,	NA
mn92:19.8	and given up what should be given up:	NA
mn92:19.9	and so, brahmin, I am a Buddha.	NA
mn92:19.10	Dispel your doubt in me—	NA
mn92:19.11	make up your mind, brahmin!	NA
mn92:19.12	The sight of a Buddha	NA
mn92:19.13	is hard to find again.	_Abhiṇhaso_ means “repeatedly”. Here the force of the saying is, I think, “It is hard enough to encounter a Buddha even once, let alone repeatedly.”
mn92:19.14	I am a Buddha, brahmin,	NA
mn92:19.15	the supreme surgeon,	NA
mn92:19.16	one of those whose appearance in the world	NA
mn92:19.17	is hard to find again.	NA
mn92:19.18	A manifestation of divinity, unequaled,	NA
mn92:19.19	crusher of Māra’s army;	NA
mn92:19.20	having subdued all my opponents,	NA
mn92:19.21	I rejoice, fearing nothing from any quarter.”	NA
mn92:20.1	“Pay heed, sirs, to what	NA
mn92:20.2	is spoken by the Clear-eyed One.	NA
mn92:20.3	The surgeon, the great hero,	NA
mn92:20.4	roars like a lion in the jungle.	NA
mn92:20.5	A manifestation of divinity, unequaled,	NA
mn92:20.6	crusher of Māra’s army;	NA
mn92:20.7	who would not be inspired by him,	NA
mn92:20.8	even one born in a dark class?	The “dark class” refers to those born in an unfortunate state ([an6.57:11.1]()). Sela is saying that the Buddha’s path is for everyone, not just the fortunate.
mn92:20.9	Those who wish may follow me;	NA
mn92:20.10	those who don’t may go.	NA
mn92:20.11	Right here, I’ll go forth in his presence,	NA
mn92:20.12	the one of such splendid wisdom.”	NA
mn92:21.1	“Sir, if you endorse	NA
mn92:21.2	the teaching of the Buddha,	NA
mn92:21.3	we’ll also go forth in his presence,	NA
mn92:21.4	the one of such splendid wisdom.”	NA
mn92:22.1	“These three hundred brahmins	NA
mn92:22.2	with joined palms held up, ask:	NA
mn92:22.3	‘May we lead the spiritual life	NA
mn92:22.4	in your presence, Blessed One?’”	NA
mn92:23.1	“The spiritual life is well explained,”	NA
mn92:23.2	said the Buddha,	NA
mn92:23.3	“apparent in the present life, immediately effective.	NA
mn92:23.4	Here the going forth isn’t in vain	NA
mn92:23.5	for one who trains with diligence.”	NA
mn92:24.1	And the brahmin Sela together with his assembly received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	NA
mn92:25.1	And when the night had passed Keṇiya had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own hermitage. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	NA
mn92:25.2	“It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.”	NA
mn92:25.3	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Keṇiya’s hermitage, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.	NA
mn92:25.4	Then Keṇiya served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	NA
mn92:25.5	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Keṇiya took a low seat and sat to one side.	NA
mn92:25.6	The Buddha expressed his appreciation with these verses:	NA
mn92:26.1	“The foremost of sacrifices <j>is the offering to the sacred flame;	Here _yaññā_ is a truncated genitive plural (“of sacrifices”).
mn92:26.2	the Sāvitrī Mantra <j>is the foremost of poetic meters;	The Sāvitrī (or Gāyatrī) is the “head” of metres (_śiro gāyatryaḥ_, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa  8.6.2.3, 8.6.2.6), and was “praised as the foremost of recitations” (_gāyatrāṇy uktha mukhanai śaṁsanti_, Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 17.7.1). It was the first verse taught a new initiate (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.4.13).
mn92:26.3	of humans, the king is the foremost;	NA
mn92:26.4	the ocean’s the foremost of rivers;	NA
mn92:26.5	the foremost of stars is the moon;	NA
mn92:26.6	the sun is the foremost of lights;	NA
mn92:26.7	for those who sacrifice seeking merit,	NA
mn92:26.8	the Saṅgha is the foremost.”	NA
mn92:26.9	When the Buddha had expressed his appreciation to Keṇiya the matted-hair ascetic with these verses, he got up from his seat and left.	NA
mn92:27.1	Then Venerable Sela and his assembly, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. They lived having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn92:27.2	They understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	NA
mn92:27.3	And Venerable Sela together with his assembly became perfected.	NA
mn92:28.1	Then Sela with his assembly went to see the Buddha. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:	NA
mn92:28.2	“This is the eighth day since	NA
mn92:28.3	we went for refuge, O Clear-eyed One.	NA
mn92:28.4	In these seven days, Blessed One,	NA
mn92:28.5	we’ve become tamed in your teaching.	NA

mn93:0.1	Middle Discourses 93	NA
mn93:0.2	With Assalāyana	NA
mn93:1.1	So I have heard.	This discourse records how the brahmin student Assalāyana took on the Buddha on the question of the four classes, an attempt that Assalāyana knew was doomed from the start. Like similar contests such as the Ambaṭṭhasutta ([dn3]()), it is rich in historical connections.
mn93:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn93:2.1	Now at that time around five hundred brahmins from abroad were residing in Sāvatthī on some business.	Similar gatherings were noted at Campā ([dn4:4.1]()) and Opāsāda ([mn95:7.1]()).
mn93:2.2	Then those brahmins thought,	NA
mn93:2.3	“This ascetic Gotama advocates purification for all four classes.	NA
mn93:2.4	Who is capable of debating with him about this?”	NA
mn93:3.1	Now at that time the student Assalāyana was residing in Sāvatthī. He was young, tonsured, and sixteen years old. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.	While this description is similar to that of brahmin students such as Ambaṭṭha ([dn3:1.3.1]()), it is only here and at [mn95:11.2]() that we find the additional details that they are tonsured and sixteen years of age. | “Tonsured” (_vuttasira_) literally means “circlehead” and it refers to the practice of shaving off all but a topknot (cf. _nivṛttacūḍaka_ at Manusmṛiti 5.67). According to Manusmṛiti 2.65, the ceremony of tonsure (there called _keśānta_) is to be given to brahmins at sixteen, so this must be meant here. Contrast the usual brahmanical pejorative of _muṇḍaka_ (“shaveling”, [mn81:6.8]()).
mn93:3.2	Then those brahmins thought,	NA
mn93:3.3	NA	NA
mn93:3.4	“This Assalāyana is capable of debating with the ascetic Gotama about this.”	Assalāyana may be identified with Kauśalyaṣcāśvalāyana (“Assalāyana of Kosala”) who asked the sage Pippalāda about the nature of _prāṇa_ (breath/life energy) in Praśna Upaniṣad 3. He was probably a grandson or further descendant (as indicated by the _naḍādi_ formation of his name) of the Aśvala of Videha who debated Yājñavalkya (see note below).
mn93:4.1	So they approached Assalāyana and said to him,	NA
mn93:4.2	“This ascetic Gotama advocates purification for all four classes.	NA
mn93:4.3	Please, worthy Assalāyana, debate with the ascetic Gotama about this.”	NA
mn93:4.4	When they said this, Assalāyana said to them,	NA
mn93:4.5	“They say that the ascetic Gotama is a speaker of principle.	NA
mn93:4.6	But speakers of principle are hard to debate.	NA
mn93:4.7	I’m not capable of debating with the ascetic Gotama about this.”	This dialogue is modeled after the debate at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.1 between Yājñavalkya and Aśvala. Foreign brahmins had come to Videha from Kuru and Pañcāla, the older-established and more prestigious Brahmanical lands (cf. the “western brahmins” of [sn42.6:2.1]() and [an10.176:1.5]()). King Janaka offered an extravagant prize of a thousand cows with gold-tipped horns for the greatest brahmin among them. But none dared step forward, so Yājñavalkya started to drive the cows home. Aśvala, the priest in charge of litany (_hotṛ_) for Janaka, challenged him to a debate, but was ultimately silenced.
mn93:4.8	For a second time, those brahmins said to him	NA
mn93:4.9	“This ascetic Gotama advocates purification for all four classes.	NA
mn93:4.10	Please, worthy Assalāyana, debate with the ascetic Gotama about this.	NA
mn93:4.11	For you have lived as a wanderer.”	This agrees with Praśna Upaniṣad 1.2, where Assalāyana, along with his fellow-seekers, is asked to live another year in fervor, spiritual practice, and faith (_bhūya eva tapasā brahmacaryeṇa śraddhayā saṁvatsaraṁ_).
mn93:4.12	And for a second time, Assalāyana refused.	NA
mn93:4.13	NA	NA
mn93:4.14	NA	NA
mn93:4.15	NA	NA
mn93:4.16	For a third time, those brahmins said to him,	NA
mn93:4.17	“This ascetic Gotama advocates purification for all four classes.	NA
mn93:4.18	Please, worthy Assalāyana, debate with the ascetic Gotama about this.	NA
mn93:4.19	For you have lived as a wanderer.	NA
mn93:4.20	Don’t admit defeat before going into battle!”	NA
mn93:4.21	When they said this, Assalāyana said to them,	NA
mn93:4.22	“Clearly, good fellows, I’m not getting through to you when I say:	NA
mn93:4.23	‘They say that the ascetic Gotama is a speaker of principle.	NA
mn93:4.24	But speakers of principle are hard to debate.	NA
mn93:4.25	I’m not capable of debating with the ascetic Gotama about this.’	NA
mn93:4.26	Nevertheless, I shall go at your bidding.”	NA
mn93:5.1	Then Assalāyana together with a large group of brahmins went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn93:5.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:	NA
mn93:5.3	“Worthy Gotama, the brahmins say:	NA
mn93:5.4	‘Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior.	This verse is also at [dn27:3.6]() and [mn84:9.19]().
mn93:5.5	Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark.	NA
mn93:5.6	Only brahmins are purified, not others.	NA
mn93:5.7	Only brahmins are true-born sons of divinity, born from his mouth, born of divinity, created by divinity, heirs of divinity.’	NA
mn93:5.8	What do you say about this?”	NA
mn93:5.9	“But Assalāyana, brahmin women are seen menstruating, being pregnant, giving birth, and breastfeeding.	NA
mn93:5.10	Yet even though they’re born from a brahmin womb they say:	NA
mn93:5.11	‘Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior.	NA
mn93:5.12	Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark.	NA
mn93:5.13	Only brahmins are purified, not others.	NA
mn93:5.14	Only brahmins are true-born sons of divinity, born from his mouth, born of divinity, created by divinity, heirs of divinity.’”	NA
mn93:6.1	“Even though you say this, still the brahmins maintain their belief.”	NA
mn93:6.2	NA	NA
mn93:6.3	NA	NA
mn93:6.4	“What do you think, Assalāyana?	NA
mn93:6.5	Have you heard that in Greece and Persia and other foreign lands there are only two classes, masters and bonded servants; and that masters may become servants, and servants masters?”	“Greece” (_yona_, from “Ionia”) and “Persia” (_kamboja_) are loose exonyms indicating the regions dominated by Greek and Iranian culture. | The Greeks and other foreigners are mentioned in Ashokan edicts, but this is the only reference to Greece in an early Buddhist text. The Sanskrit _yavana_ appears shortly after the Buddha in Pāṇini 4.1.49. The Indic terms are derived from the Persian _yauna_, first attested in an inscription of Darius I (522–486 BCE), who conquered three Indian realms: _gandāra_ (Gandhāra), _hindush_ (Indus valley), and _thataguš_ (Sattagydia, around modern Bannu in Pakistan). Soldiers from these realms served under Achaemenid kings from this time. Moreover, several Greek and Achaemenid coins dating back as far as Darius I have been found in the Kabul hoard as well as the Shaikhan Dheri hoard at the site of Puṣkalāvatī, capital of Gandhāra. | “Persia” is one of the sixteen great nations ([an3.70:28.2]()). It was the home of horses, lying to the west of Gandhāra (Pakistan) in modern Afghanistan. This was the easternmost extent of Iranian culture, and the passage here shows how different it was considered compared to the other nations. At this date, I think _kamboja_ meant not just the specific location in Afghanistan, but more generally the Iranian peoples west of Gandhāra, just as _yona_ (“Ionian”) is used for all people of Greek culture. | The perceived difference in slave culture mirrors the Greek ambassador Megasthenes who, writing over a century later, said there were no slaves in India.

mn93:11.5	Suppose an anointed aristocratic king were to gather a hundred people of various births and say to them:	Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5 relates how Purūravas, longing to be reunited with his queen, the nymph Urvaśī, was required by the Gandharvas to make a special fire. It must be generated by wood from a tree that grew from the ashes of celestial fire provided by themselves, the upper drill-stick of _aśvattha_ (i.e. Bodhi tree) and the lower stick of _śamī_. In that legend, the essence of the fire is determined by its divine origin, against which the Buddha poses a naturalistic explanation.
mn93:11.6	‘Please gentlemen, let anyone here who was born in a family of aristocrats, brahmins, or chieftains take a drill-stick made of teak, sal, frankincense wood, sandalwood, or cherry wood, light a fire and produce heat.	This seems to be the only mention of the _padumaka_ tree in Pali. It may be the Sanskrit _padmaka_, for which one possible identification is *Prunus cerasoides*, the wild Himalayan cherry. | Here we find both _sāka_ and _sāla_, so I translate _sāka_ as “teak”, whereas at [dn3:1.15.10]() I have sakhua, an alternate name for the sal tree.
mn93:11.7	And let anyone here who was born in a family of corpse-workers, hunters, bamboo-workers, chariot-makers, or scavengers take a drill-stick made from a dog’s drinking trough, a pig’s trough, a dustbin, or castor-oil wood, light a fire and produce heat.’	_Caṇḍālas_ (“corpse-workers”) are frequently depicted as the lowest of untouchables as seen by Brahmins. However, the usual rendering of “outcast” is unsatisfactory, as all the groups here are defined positively by their occupation, and moreover some, such as the scavengers, would also have been untouchable. The Pali commentaries equate the _caṇḍāla_ with the _chavaka_ (or _chapaka_) of [pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.12.1](), a “corpse disposer” (_chavachaḍḍakacaṇḍālā_; see also _chavakacaṇḍālo_ at [mil5.4.7:2.4]()). They were known for their “bone-washing” ceremony ([dn1:1.13.2](), [an10.107:1.1]()). This agrees with Rāmāyana 1.58.10, which describes a _caṇḍāla_ as dark-complexioned, dirty, with disheveled hair, his body smeared with graveyard ash. Mahāvaṁsa 10.91–94 tells how King Paṇḍukābhaya employed _caṇḍālas_ for cleaning streets and toilets, bearing the dead, and watching over cemeteries, with their village adjoining the cemetery.

mn93:12.5	Suppose an aristocrat boy was to sleep with a brahmin girl, and they had a child.	Since the brahmins declared their own class the highest, such a union is considered to be _pratiloma_ (“contrary to the natural order”). Arthaśāstra 3.7.28 says such a child is a _sūta_; Manusmṛti 10.11 agrees, adding that their livelihood is a charioteer (10.47).

mn93:18.2	“Once upon a time, Assalāyana, seven brahmin seers settled in leaf huts in a wilderness region. They had the following harmful misconception:	The “seven brahmin seers”  (Sanskrit _saptarṣi_, (eg. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13.8.1.9, Atharva Veda 4.11.9c, Vājasaneyi Saṁhitā 13.26b) were renowned sages to whom the Vedic lineages (_gottā_) were attributed  As the sutta’s conclusion will show, they are introduced here to demonstrate that the fallacy of geneology has been there since the beginning. | A similar practice of living in wilderness is described at [mn25:9.5](), [sn11.9](), [dn23:21.3](), [dn3:2.3.3](), and [dn27:22.9](). Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.10.1–5 compares the forest contemplatives destined for the Brahmā realm with the ritualists who are reborn on the moon before returning to earth.
mn93:18.3	‘Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior.	NA
mn93:18.4	Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark. Only brahmins are purified, not others.	Mahābhārata 12.181.5 says that brahmins are the white class, aristocrats red, peasants yellow, and menials black.
mn93:18.5	Only brahmins are true-born sons of divinity, born from his mouth, born of divinity, created by divinity, heirs of divinity.’	NA
mn93:18.6	The seer Devala the Dark heard about this.	Asita Devala is probably meant to be the legendary seer known as Asita or Devala son of Kāśyapa who composed Rig Veda 9.5–24, although they seem to share little but the name. He is an example of the “dark hermit” archetype, irrupting within Brahmanical traditions to subvert from within, relying on his mysterious power of otherness. See also Asita Kaṇhasiri (or Kāladevala, [snp3.11:1.1]()), Kaṇha ([dn3:1.23.6]()), Kaṇhadīpāyana ([cp31:1.2]()), and Sāma ([cp33:1.1]()). Such encounters show how the contention between Vedic ritualism and native contemplatives challenged and elevated both traditions. In this way they invert the stereotype of Brahmanical colorism, paving the way for the ascension of the dark god Krishna.

His behavior is disrespectful, like that of Vepacitti, and unlike that of Sakka at [sn11.9]().

mn93:18.58	how an embryo is conceived?’	NA
mn93:18.59	‘We do know that, sir.	NA
mn93:18.60	NA	NA
mn93:18.61	An embryo is conceived when these three things come together—the mother and father come together, the mother is in the fertile phase of her menstrual cycle, and the virile spirit is ready.’	The _gandhabba_ (normally “centaur”, here “virile spirit”) is, per the commentary, the being to be reborn. He represents the element of male sexuality in procreation. He is “father, begetter, kinsman”, by whose knowledge one becomes the “father’s father” (Arthavaveda 2.1.2–3). He is said to guard (Rig Veda 9.83.4) or steal (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3.2.4) or actually be (Rig Veda 9.86.36) the vitalizing liquid Soma, who is extracted on an altar as semen is extracted in the vagina (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.3). He thus lies within the waters (Rig Veda 9.86.36, 10.10.4) or within the womb (Rig Veda 10.177.2). It seems that, since semen is “a man’s essence” (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.1, Aitareya Upaniṣad 2.1), the seed of past lovers—curses against whom are helpfully provided (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.9–12)—remains in the womb. This is why the _gandhabba_ possesses women (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.7.1, 3.3.1) and, unless placated with proper worship, might become a “hairy one” who devours embryos (Artharva Veda 8.6.23, see 8.6.18–19). To ward against such risks, in the rites of marriage and procreation, the _gandharva_ king Viśvāvasa, a playboy and deadbeat father, is asked to “rise up” out of the woman (Rig Veda 10.85.21–22, Atharva Veda 14.2.33–6, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.19) and find his pleasures with another, so that the husband may father the child. This contrasts with the Pali passage, where the _gandhabba_ “is ready” for conception; in other words, a being is driven by their karma to be born there.
mn93:18.62	‘But do you know	NA
mn93:18.63	for sure whether that virile spirit is an aristocrat, a brahmin, a peasant, or a menial?’	Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.10.3–7 details the “path of the fathers” after death; they follow a winding path to the moon Soma, only to return as rain, grow as plants, be eaten, and ultimately be emitted as semen, thus determining the caste of the child. It seems from this passage, however, that this doctrine, convincing as it may seem, was not sufficient to allay male anxiety over paternity. Indeed, the very baroqueness of these conceptions show the doctrinal and ritual lengths required to fix paternity.
mn93:18.64	‘We don’t know that.’	NA
mn93:18.65	NA	NA
mn93:18.66	‘In that case, sirs, don’t you know	NA
mn93:18.67	what you are?’	NA
mn93:18.68	‘In that case, sir, we don’t know	NA
mn93:18.69	what we are.’	NA
mn93:18.70	Given that even those seven brahmin seers could not prevail when pursued, pressed, and grilled by the seer Devala on their own genealogy,	The syntax of this passage mirrors [an6.18:4.12]() and [pli-tv-kd16:6.4.1](). In each case, _te hi nāma_ introduces a passage referring to events of the past whose outcome is framed in future tense (from the past point of view).
mn93:18.71	how could you prevail now being grilled by me on your own genealogy when you and your tradition do not so much as pick up the last spoonful?”	_Puṇṇo dabbigāho_ is a highly specific reference to a detail of the Sākamedha ritual that marks the beginning of winter. From the rice offering on the first day, a pot is set aside until the next morning, when the very last “full spoon” (_pūrṇā darvi_) is scraped up, with the invocation, “Full, O spoon, fly off, and fly back to us well filled!” (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.5.3.16–17, Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 5.6.20; invocation found at Atharva Veda 3.10.7c, Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 1.10.2, Vājasaneyi Saṁhitā 3.49a). This ensures that present prosperity will be renewed after the barren cold season (just as life is renewed after death, or as last season’s grain is sown on the field). The implication is that present-day brahmins don’t even fulfill the rites of continuity in their own tradition, so how can they assert the continuity of caste over generations? | _Yesaṁ_ refers back to _te_ of the previous portion, i.e. the seven brahmin seers, whose tradition modern brahmins are supposed to continue.

mn94:1.1	So I have heard.	As usual, the lack of mention of the Buddha at the start suggests that this sutta is set after his passing away, a detail confirmed at the end.

mn94:1.2	At one time Venerable Udena was staying near Varanasi in the Khemiya Mango Grove.	Neither monk nor monastery are mentioned elsewhere in early texts.
mn94:2.1	Now at that time the brahmin Ghoṭamukha had arrived at Varanasi on some business.	This may be the Ghoṭamukha (“Beard-face”) of Kauṭilya’s Arthaśāstra 5.5.11. On the question of when a courtier should know that his king is displeased with him, a series of expert opinions are cited, each one bewilderingly cryptic. Ghoṭamukha says such a king is like a “wet cloth”. The key to these clues is provided in a particular story, which is deliberately unmentioned, presumably because of the delicacy of the subject.
mn94:2.2	Then as he was going for a walk he went to the Khemiya Mango Grove.	NA

mn94:2.8	Yet I have not seen honorable ones such as yourself, or a relevant teaching.”	NA
mn94:3.1	When he said this, Udena stepped down from the walking path, entered his dwelling, and sat down on the seat spread out.	Udena takes care to ensure the setting is appropriate for a serious discussion.
mn94:3.2	Ghoṭamukha also stepped down from the walking path and entered the dwelling, where he stood to one side.	NA

Udena, noticing his awkwardness, makes sure that Ghoṭamukha understands that he can engage in a conversation without impropriety.

mn94:18.8	If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint.	NA

mn94:19.1	They act with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.	NA
mn94:20.1	When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, this noble contentment, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness,	NA
mn94:20.2	they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.	NA
mn94:21.1	After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in their presence.	NA
mn94:21.2	Giving up covetousness for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness.	NA
mn94:21.3	Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of sympathy for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will.	NA

mn94:21.5	Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.	NA
mn94:21.6	Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.	NA
mn94:22.1	They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.	NA
mn94:22.2	Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn94:23.1	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn94:24.1	And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA
mn94:25.1	Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
mn94:26.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives.	NA
mn94:26.2	They recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food.

mn94:27.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	NA
mn94:27.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place.

mn94:31.1	When he had spoken, Ghoṭamukha said to him,	NA
mn94:31.2	“Excellent, worthy Udena! Excellent!	NA
mn94:31.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the worthy Udena has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
mn94:31.4	I go for refuge to the worthy Udena, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
mn94:31.5	From this day forth, may the worthy Udena remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	NA
mn94:32.1	“Brahmin, don’t go for refuge to me.	As at [mn84:10.6]().
mn94:32.2	You should go for refuge to that same Blessed One to whom I have gone for refuge.”	NA
mn94:32.3	“But worthy Udena, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”	NA
mn94:32.4	“Brahmin, the Buddha has already become fully quenched.”	NA
mn94:32.5	“Worthy Udena, if I heard that the Buddha was within ten leagues, or twenty, or even up to a hundred leagues away, I’d go a hundred leagues to see him.	NA

mn94:32.12	From this day forth, may the worthy Udena remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.	NA
mn94:33.1	Worthy Udena, the king of Aṅga gives me a regular daily allowance. I will give you one portion of that.”	The mention of the king of Aṅga is unique. Aṅga had been conquered by Bimbisāra long ago and became part of Magadha. There is a faint memory of a time when Rājagaha was a city of Aṅga ([ja546:36.2]()), but Aṅga’s glory days were long past. Perhaps “king of Aṅga” was a title of the king of Magadha, or else of a vassal ruler. | _Niccabhikkhā_ at [ja398:4.1]() refers to the daily offering of food to a _yakkha_, which must be the early meaning. But here and at [sn3.13:4.4]() it refers to money.
mn94:33.2	“But brahmin, what does the king of Aṅga give you as a regular daily allowance?”	NA
mn94:33.3	“Five hundred dollars.”	A _kahāpaṇa_ is in the ballpark of a US dollar. At [an10.46 ]() the wages for an honest day’s work start at half a _kahāpaṇa_, which compares with the poverty line in modern India of 38 rupees/day or 48 US cents. The upper level income is a thousand _kahāpaṇas_ per day, so Ghoṭamukha’s allowance made him a rich man.
mn94:33.4	“It’s not proper for us to receive gold and currency.”	NA
mn94:33.5	“If that’s not proper, I will have a dwelling built for the worthy Udena.”	A _vihāra_ was a “dwelling” in a monastery, not, as in later usage, an entire monastery.
mn94:33.6	“If you want to build me a dwelling, then build an assembly hall for the Saṅgha at Pāṭaliputta.”	This reflects the central role of the new capital of Pāṭaliputta after the Buddha died ([dn16:1.28.7]()). Compare the similar offering at [mn52:16.1]().
mn94:33.7	“Now I’m even more delighted and satisfied with the worthy Udena, since he encourages me to give to the Saṅgha.	NA
mn94:33.8	So with this allowance and another one I will have an assembly hall built for the Saṅgha at Pāṭaliputta.”	NA
mn94:33.9	And so he had that hall built.	NA
mn94:33.10	And these days it’s called the “Ghoṭamukhī”.	NA
mn95:0.1	Middle Discourses 95	NA
mn95:0.2	With Caṅkī	NA
mn95:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn95:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Opāsāda.	Opāsāda does not appear anywhere else. We later hear of Caṅkī’s longhouse (_pāsāda_), a luxurious residence to the north of the town on the way to the Godswood. Perhaps, then, Opāsāda means “below the mansion”.
mn95:1.3	He stayed in the Godswood of sal trees to the north of Opāsāda.	A grove in which offerings were made to the gods.
mn95:2.1	Now at that time the brahmin Caṅkī was living in Opāsāda. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.	Caṅkī is regularly mentioned along with other senior brahmins Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jānussoṇi, and Todeyya ([dn13:2.2](), [mn98:2.2](), [mn99:13.5](), [snp3.9:1.4]()). His name is obscure; spelled _caṅgī_ in Sanskrit, it is perhaps related to the _gatāgate caṅgimā_ of Mahā-subhāṣita-Saṁgraha 7235-1, where it refers to the sensual walk of a young woman; dictionaries record the sense “beautiful” for Kannada _caṁgi_ and Sanskrit _caṅgiman_. | “Royal park” is _rājadāya_ (cp. _migadāya_, “deer park”). | A _brahmadeyya_ is a gift of land by a king to a brahmin, which was an outstanding feature of Indian feudalism. Similar grants are mentioned in the Dīgha Nikāya at [dn3:1.2.1](), [dn5:1.4](), [dn12:1.3](), and [dn23:1.4]().
mn95:3.1	The brahmins and householders of Opāsāda heard:	NA
mn95:3.2	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Opāsāda together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. He is staying in the Godswood to the north.	NA
mn95:3.3	He has this good reputation:	NA
mn95:3.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
mn95:3.5	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	NA
mn95:3.6	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
mn95:3.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	NA
mn95:4.1	Then, having departed Opāsāda, they formed into companies and headed north to the Godswood.	NA
mn95:5.1	Now at that time the brahmin Caṅkī had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap.	Also a favored siesta location for Soṇadaṇḍa ([dn5:3.1]()), Kūṭadanta ([dn4:3.1]()), and Pāyāsi ([dn23:3.1]()).
mn95:5.2	He saw the brahmins and householders heading for the Godswood,	NA
mn95:5.3	and addressed his butler,	The _khatta_ (“butler”; Sanskrit _kṣattṛ_) was a senior member of the household staff, responsible for management of activities (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.3.1.7).
mn95:5.4	“My butler, why are the brahmins and householders heading north for the Godswood?”	NA

mn95:7.4	They approached Caṅkī and said to him,	NA

mn95:9.37	Well then, gentlemen, let’s all go to see the ascetic Gotama.”	NA
mn95:10.1	Then Caṅkī together with a large group of brahmins went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn95:10.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.	NA
mn95:11.1	Now at that time the Buddha was sitting engaged in some polite conversation together with some very senior brahmins.	NA
mn95:11.2	And the student Kāpaṭika was sitting in that assembly. He was young, tonsured, and sixteen years old. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.	This student’s education is like that of Assalāyana ([mn93:3.1]()), but his character could not be more different. His name has a variety of spellings in Pali and Sanskrit, but the correct form is _kāpaṭika_ from _kapaṭa_, “fraud”. Kauṭilya explains that fraudulent students (_chātraḥ kāpaṭikaḥ_) were spies installed by kings to test the loyalty of subjects (Arthaśāstra 1.10.11, 1.11.1–2), for which they were paid handsomely (5.3.22). Note that the Buddha calls him Bhāradvāja; this follows the convention in Pali that brahmins of that name are distinguished by epithets, often unflattering: Bhāradvāja the Farmer ([snp1.4:1.3]()), Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper ([snp1.7:1.4]()), Bhāradvāja the Alms-Gatherer ([sn35.127:1.1]()), Bhāradvāja the Builder ([sn7.17:1.2]()), Bhāradvāja the Rude ([sn7.2:1.2]()), Bhāradvāja the Fiend ([sn7.3:1.2]()), Bhāradvāja the Bitter ([sn7.4:1.2]()), and so on. Thus Kāpaṭika would have been an epithet recognizing that he was the king’s spy, a practice to which Pasenadi openly admits ([sn3.11:7.1](), [ud6.2:8.1]()). This was the downside of building a religious institution on the king’s largess. Whether he was recognized as a spy at the time, or the epithet was applied later, is uncertain, but at some point it seems the meaning was forgotten and the epithet was taken to be his proper name.
mn95:11.3	While the senior brahmins were conversing together with the Buddha, he interrupted.	NA
mn95:11.4	Then the Buddha rebuked Kāpaṭika,	NA
mn95:11.5	“Venerable Bhāradvāja, don’t interrupt the senior brahmins.	It is rare for the Buddha to address a lay person as “venerable” (_āyasmā_). It seems the form is excessively polite to soften the rebuke.
mn95:11.6	Wait until they’ve finished speaking.”	NA
mn95:11.7	When he had spoken, Caṅkī said to the Buddha,	NA
mn95:11.8	“Worthy Gotama, don’t rebuke the student Kāpaṭika.	NA
mn95:11.9	He’s a gentleman, learned and astute, who enunciates well. He is capable of debating with the worthy Gotama about this.”	NA
mn95:12.1	Then it occurred to the Buddha,	This passage is unique to to this sutta.
mn95:12.2	“Clearly the student Kāpaṭika will talk about the scriptural heritage of the three Vedas.	NA
mn95:12.3	That’s why the brahmins put him at the front.”	NA
mn95:12.4	Then Kāpaṭika thought,	NA
mn95:12.5	“When the ascetic Gotama looks at me, I’ll ask him a question.”	NA
mn95:12.6	Then the Buddha, knowing Kāpaṭika’s train of thought, looked at him.	NA
mn95:12.7	Then Kāpaṭika thought,	NA
mn95:12.8	“The ascetic Gotama is engaging with me.	NA
mn95:12.9	Why don’t I ask him a question?”	NA
mn95:12.10	Then he said,	NA
mn95:12.11	“Worthy Gotama, regarding that which by the lineage of testament and by canonical authority is the ancient hymnal of the brahmins, the brahmins come to the categorical conclusion:	The “lineage of testament” (_itihitihaparamparā_); “canonical authority” (_piṭakasampadā_); “ancient hymnal” (_porāṇaṁ mantapadaṁ_): these refer to the Vedas.
mn95:12.12	‘This is the only truth, anything else is futile.’	NA
mn95:12.13	What do you say about this?”	NA
mn95:13.1	“Well, Bhāradvāja, is there even a single one of the brahmins who says this:	Compare [mn99:9.8]().
mn95:13.2	‘I know this, I see this:	NA
mn95:13.3	this is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”	NA
mn95:13.4	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
mn95:13.5	“Well, is there even a single tutor of the brahmins, or a tutors’ tutor, or anyone back to the seventh generation of tutors, who says this:	Compare [dn13:12.1]().
mn95:13.6	‘I know this, I see this:	NA
mn95:13.7	this is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”	NA
mn95:13.8	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
mn95:13.9	“Well, what of the ancient seers of the brahmins, namely Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu? They were the authors and propagators of the hymns. Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times; and these days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it, chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taught.	The ten names in Pali include the seven authors of the so-called “family books” of the Rig Veda (Maṇḍalas 2–8). As founders of poetic lineages, we often find works by their descendants, which are not always confined to their dedicated family book. Poems by the other three authors are mostly outside the family books. Thus the sages listed here cover most of the Rig Veda, although the Vedic tradition records many other authors as well. | Atri Bhauma (Maṇḍala 5, rather than Aṣṭaka Vaiśvāmitra of 10.104); Vamra(ka) Vaikhānasa (10.99; see 9.66); Vāmadeva Gautama (Maṇḍala 4); Viśvāmitra Gāthina (Maṇḍala 3); Jamadagni Bhārgava was a descendant of Bhṛgu (several hymns mostly in Maṇḍalas 9 and 10); Aṅgirasa is identified with Agni as the founder of a lineage of poet-singers (Maṇḍala 8); Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya (Maṇḍala 6); Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi (Maṇḍala 7); Kaśyapa Mārīca (several hymns mostly in Maṇḍalas 9 and 10); Bhṛgu was the bringer of fire from heaven whose adoptive descendant was Gṛtsamada Bhārgava Śaunaka (Maṇḍala 2).

mn95:13.23	Suppose there was a queue of blind men, each holding the one in front: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see.	The “blind following the blind” is also at [mn95:13.24]() and [mn99:9.25](). Maitrī Upaniṣad 7.8–9 turns it around, saying that the blind teach false doctrines aimed at destroying the Vedas, “the doctrine of not-self” (_nairātmyavāda_), an obvious reference to Buddhists. We also find it at Kaṭha Upaniṣad 1.2.5, Mahābhārata 2.38.3, and the Jain Sūyagaḍa 1.1.2.19.

Bhāgavata Purāṇa 5.8.29; Śrīdhara’s commentary on Bhagavad-Gītā 18.3). | See too [mn76:24.1]().

mn97:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn97:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
mn97:2.1	Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was wandering in the Southern Hills together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	The Southern Hills (_dakkhiṇāgiri_, “Deccan”) is the Vindhya Range that lies on the southern border of Magadha, leading southwest to Avanti. The Buddha and his disciples visited there so rarely that people complained ([pli-tv-kd1:53.1.3]()). Nonetheless, the present narrative suggests that Sāriputta had stayed there for an extended period of time, long enough to lose touch with his friends back home.
mn97:2.2	Then a certain mendicant who had completed the rainy season residence in Rājagaha went to the Southern Hills, where he approached Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn97:2.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to him,	NA
mn97:2.4	“Reverend, I hope the Buddha is healthy and strong?”	NA
mn97:2.5	“He is, reverend.”	NA
mn97:2.6	“And I hope that the mendicant Saṅgha is healthy and strong.”	NA
mn97:2.7	“It is.”	NA
mn97:2.8	“Reverend, at the rice checkpoint at the city gate there is a brahmin named Dhanañjāni.	The “rice checkpoint at the city gate” (_taṇḍulapālidvārā_) was a gate of Rājagaha where rice would be inspected and tolls collected. Here _pāli_ has the sense “guard” (cp. Sanskrit _pālin_). This was not Dhanañjāni’s residence, but where he worked and, it would seem, skimmed off funds for his own benefit. | Kauṭilya discusses corruption among government servants (Arthaśāstra 2.9), sets out the duties of the toll collector (2.21), and lists the various tolls (2.22).
mn97:2.9	I hope that he is healthy and strong?”	NA
mn97:2.10	“He too is well.”	NA
mn97:2.11	“But is he diligent?”	NA
mn97:2.12	“How could he possibly be diligent?	NA
mn97:2.13	Dhanañjāni robs the brahmins and householders in the name of the king, and he robs the king in the name of the brahmins and householders.	Dhanañjāni is a Pali variation of the Vedic _dhanañjaya_, “winner of wealth”, an apt description of his activities. See too note on [sn7.1:1.3]().
mn97:2.14	His wife, a lady of faith who he married from a family of faith, has passed away.	A faithful laywoman named Dhanañjānī features in [mn100]() and [sn7.1](), but this was a different person.
mn97:2.15	And he has taken a new wife who has no faith.”	NA
mn97:2.16	“Oh, it’s bad news	NA
mn97:2.17	to hear that Dhanañjāni is negligent.	NA
mn97:2.18	Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet him, and we can have a discussion.”	NA
mn97:3.1	When Sāriputta had stayed in the Southern Hills as long as he pleased, he set out for Rājagaha.	NA
mn97:3.2	Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Rājagaha,	NA
mn97:3.3	where he stayed in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
mn97:4.1	Then he robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.	NA
mn97:4.2	Now at that time Dhanañjāni was having his cows milked in a cow-shed outside the city.	NA
mn97:4.3	Then Sāriputta wandered for alms in Rājagaha. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he approached Dhanañjāni.	NA
mn97:4.4	Seeing Sāriputta coming off in the distance,	NA
mn97:4.5	Dhanañjāni went to him and said,	NA
mn97:4.6	“Here, worthy Sāriputta, drink some fresh milk before the meal time.”	NA
mn97:4.7	“Enough, brahmin,	NA
mn97:4.8	I’ve finished eating for today.	NA
mn97:4.9	I shall be at the root of that tree for the day’s meditation.	NA
mn97:4.10	Come see me there.”	NA
mn97:4.11	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Dhanañjāni.	NA
mn97:5.1	When Dhanañjāni had finished breakfast he went to Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn97:5.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to him,	NA
mn97:5.3	“I hope you’re diligent, Dhanañjāni?”	NA
mn97:5.4	“How can I possibly be diligent, worthy Sāriputta? I have to provide for my mother and father, my wives and children, and my bondservants and workers. And I have to make the proper offerings to friends and colleagues, relatives and kin, guests, ancestors, deities, and king. And then this body must also be fattened and built up.”	The five “proper offerings” correspond with the five to whom _bali_ offerings are made ([an4.61:15.2](), [an5.41:4.2]()). | In agreement with _brūhetabbo_ (“to be built up”), _pīṇetabbo_ is from _pīṇa_ in the sense “fatten” rather than “gladden”.

mn97:28.2	“I hope you’re keeping well, Dhanañjāni; I hope you’re all right. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”	NA

mn97:30.1	“Dhanañjāni, which do you think is better:	NA

mn97:30.9	“Human life is better.”	NA
mn97:30.10	“Which do you think is better:	NA
mn97:30.11	human life or as one of the gods of the four great kings?”	NA
mn97:30.12	“The gods of the four great kings.”	The “gods of the four great kings” (_cātumahārājikā devā_) are deities born in a realm subject to the overlords known as the Four Great Kings: Kuvera (also called Vessavaṇa) lord of spirits (_yakkha_) in the north; Dhataraṭṭha lord of centaurs (_gandhabba_) in the east; Virūḷha lord of goblins (_kumbhaṇḍa_) in the south; and Virūpakkha lord of dragons (_nāga_) in the west (see [dn32]()). Sanskrit sources sometimes multiply their number to eight (eg. Śivapurāṇa 2.2.22.43).
mn97:30.13	“Which do you think is better:	NA
mn97:30.14	the gods of the four great kings or the gods of the thirty-three?”	NA
mn97:30.15	“The gods of the thirty-three.”	The “gods of the thirty-three” (_tāvatiṁsā devā_), who are subjects of Sakka (also called Indra), enjoy refined sensual delights. The number is a reduplication of the trinity. In Buddhist texts they are not enumerated, but Yājñavalkya reckons them as eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Ādityas, plus Indra and Prajāpati (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.9.2). The final pair are elsewhere said to be Dyaus (“Heaven” = Zeus) and Pṛthivī (“Earth”), or the twin Aśvins.
mn97:30.16	“Which do you think is better:	NA
mn97:30.17	the gods of the thirty-three or the gods of Yama?”	NA
mn97:30.18	“The gods of Yama.”	Gods in this realm (spelled _yāma_, “of Yama”) are subjects of Yama, the god who guards the paths to the land of the dead ([sn1.33:10.3](), [mn130:3.1](), [dhp235]()). He was the son of Vivasvant (the sun) and brother of Manu, and as the first person to die, Rig Veda 10.4 tells us that he discovered the paths to the lands of the dead that he now guards with his pair of hounds. Yama is a righteous god, but sinners see him as horrifying due to their own guilt (Brahma Purāṇa 106.46).
mn97:30.19	“Which do you think is better:	NA
mn97:30.20	the gods of Yama or the joyful gods?”	NA
mn97:30.21	“The joyful gods.”	The “joyful gods” (_tusitā devā_) were known to the Jains, who classed them among the gods of the world’s end (_lokāntika_; Tattvārthasūtra 4.25; Viyāhapaṇṇatti 5.3.95). Later Hindu tradition says they were the sons of Kaśyapa through Aditi, otherwise known as the twelve Ādityas: Viṣṇu, Śakra, Tvaṣṭṛ, Dhātṛ, Aryaman, Pūṣan, Vivasvat, Savitṛ, Mitra, Varuṇa, Bhaga, and Aṁśu. (Agnipurāṇa 19.1–3, Liṅgapurāṇa 63.22b–26). In Buddhism, this realm is famed as the final home of Bodhisattas before they descend to the human realm to become Buddhas.
mn97:30.22	“Which do you think is better:	NA
mn97:30.23	the joyful gods or the gods who love to imagine?”	NA
mn97:30.24	“The gods who love to imagine.”	These deities (_nimmānaratī devā_) are said to create whatever delights they wish and enjoy them, living in a world of their own projection. They seem to be primarily Buddhist, perhaps influenced by such passages as Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.9, which says that in dreams one creates a new body that is revealed by one’s inner light. They are, however, mentioned in later texts such as Viṣṇupurāṇa 3.2.30 as one of three groups of thirty, and Mārkaṇḍeyapurāṇa 44, which adds that they preside over the months, seasons, and days.
mn97:30.25	“Which do you think is better:	NA
mn97:30.26	the gods who love to imagine or the gods who control what is imagined by others?”	NA
mn97:30.27	“The gods who control what is imagined by others.”	Deities in this, the highest of the sensual realms, control the visions seen by others (_paranimmitavasavattī_). Their most famous member is Māra, who uses this skill for wicked ends. Again they seem primarily Buddhist, although we probably hear an echo of them in Mahābhārata 12,325.004E, which lists the _parinirmita_ and _vaśavartin_ as two separate groups.
mn97:31.1	“Which do you think is better:	NA
mn97:31.2	the gods who control what is imagined by others or the realm of divinity?”	NA
mn97:31.3	“Worthy Sāriputta speaks of the realm of divinity!	NA
mn97:31.4	Worthy Sāriputta speaks of the realm of divinity!”	NA
mn97:31.5	Then Sāriputta thought:	NA
mn97:31.6	“These brahmins are devoted to the realm of divinity.	NA
mn97:31.7	Why don’t I teach him a path to the company of Divinity?”	NA
mn97:31.8	“Dhanañjāni, I shall teach you a path to the company of Divinity.	NA
mn97:31.9	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn97:31.10	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Dhanañjāni.	NA
mn97:31.11	Venerable Sāriputta said this:	NA
mn97:32.1	“And what is a path to company with Divinity?	While it is possible to be reborn in even the highest of the sensual realms through the power of ordinary goodness, rebirth in the Brahmā and higher realms requires the development of absorption meditation.
mn97:32.2	Firstly, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	NA
mn97:32.3	This is a path to company with Divinity.	NA
mn97:33-35.1	Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion …	NA
mn97:33-35.2	They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing …	NA
mn97:33-35.3	They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	NA
mn97:33-35.4	This is a path to company with Divinity.”	NA
mn97:36.1	“Well then, worthy Sāriputta, in my name bow with your head at the Buddha’s feet. Say to him:	NA
mn97:36.2	‘Sir, the brahmin Dhanañjāni is sick, suffering, gravely ill.	NA
mn97:36.3	He bows with his head to your feet.’”	NA
mn97:36.4	Then Sāriputta, after establishing Dhanañjāni in the inferior realm of divinity, got up from his seat and left while there was still more left to do.	NA
mn97:36.5	Not long after Sāriputta had departed, Dhanañjāni passed away and was reborn in the realm of divinity.	NA
mn97:37.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,	NA
mn97:37.2	“Mendicants, Sāriputta, after establishing Dhanañjāni in the inferior realm of divinity, got up from his seat and left while there was still more left to do.”	NA
mn97:38.1	Then Sāriputta went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said,	NA
mn97:38.2	“Sir, the brahmin Dhanañjāni is sick, suffering, gravely ill.	NA
mn97:38.3	He bows with his head to your feet.”	NA
mn97:38.4	“But Sāriputta, after establishing Dhanañjāni in the inferior realm of divinity, why did you get up from your seat and leave while there was still more left to do?”	NA
mn97:38.5	“Sir, I thought:	NA
mn97:38.6	‘These brahmins are devoted to the realm of divinity. Why don’t I teach him a path to the company of Divinity?’”	NA
mn97:38.7	“And Sāriputta, the brahmin Dhanañjāni has passed away and been reborn in the realm of divinity.”	This is a rare instance of someone taking rebirth due to deathbed kamma. Presumably Dhanañjāni had developed absorption based on the divine meditations, which overpowered the limited bad kamma he had made previously ([mn99:24.3]()). Another instance of kamma at death influencing rebirth is found at [sn42.3:2.7](), where a warrior who dies in battle goes to hell. In Theravada circles today, it is commonly held that one’s mental state at death determines one’s rebirth. These examples show that this is true only in exceptional cases where one is actively making strong good or bad kamma at that time.
mn98:0.1	Middle Discourses 98	NA
mn98:0.2	With Vāseṭṭha	NA
mn98:1.1	So I have heard.	This sutta is repeated verbatim at [snp3.9:69.3]().
mn98:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.	NA
mn98:2.1	Now at that time several very well-known well-to-do brahmins were residing in Icchānaṅgala. They included	NA
mn98:2.2	the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jānussoṇi, Todeyya, and others.	Also at [dn13:2.2]() and [mn99:13.5]().
mn98:3.1	Then as the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began to discuss the question:	We meet Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja as the students of Pokkharasāti and Tārukkha respectively in [dn13](), at the end of which they went for refuge. Some time later they must have sought the monkhood, as in [dn27:1.3]() they are living in the Sangha awaiting ordination.
mn98:3.2	“How do you become a brahmin?”	NA
mn98:3.3	Bhāradvāja said this:	NA
mn98:3.4	“When you’re well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation—	The ideal of brahminhood was a long-standing one, and so was the conflict over what exactly made someone a brahmin. Bhāradvāja expresses the most obvious and socially widespread understanding that it is simply a matter of birth.
mn98:3.5	then you’re a brahmin.”	NA
mn98:3.6	Vāseṭṭha said this:	NA
mn98:3.7	“When you’re ethical and accomplished in doing your duties—	_Vattasampanno_ (Sanskrit _vṛttasaṁpanna_) means “one of good conduct¸one who has fulfilled their duties” rather than having a technical sense of fulfilling religious observances or rites. For example, Manusmṛti 8.179 advises that one should deposit money with someone who is “of good conduct, knows the law, and speaks the truth” (_vṛttasampanne dharmajñe satyavādini_. See also eg. Mahābhārata 3.188.90b, 13.61.029a, Rāmāyaṇa 1.47.25c). | Compare the discussion at [dn4:21.1](), where the Buddha leads Soṇadaṇḍa to agree that the essential qualities of a brahmin were ethical conduct and wisdom.
mn98:3.8	then you’re a brahmin.”	NA
mn98:4.1	But neither was able to persuade the other.	NA
mn98:5.1	So Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja,	NA
mn98:5.2	“Worthy Bhāradvāja, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.	NA
mn98:5.3	He has this good reputation:	NA
mn98:5.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
mn98:5.5	Come, let’s go to see him and ask him about this matter.	NA
mn98:5.6	As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”	NA
mn98:5.7	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Bhāradvāja.	NA
mn98:6.1	So they went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn98:6.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side,	NA
mn98:6.3	and Vāseṭṭha addressed the Buddha in verse:	NA
mn98:7.1	“We’re both authorized masters	NA
mn98:7.2	of the three Vedas.	NA
mn98:7.3	I’m a student of Pokkharasāti,	Pokkharasāti’s conversion to Buddhism is recorded in [dn3](), which marks a turning point in the embracing of Buddhism by leading brahmins. The suttas of the Dīgha Nikāya that follow reverberate with the consequences of this encounter. He was one of the most influential brahmins of his time, although the Buddha elsewhere denied that he had any special knowledge ([mn99:15.5]()). Brahmanical texts know him as an influential teacher around the time of the Buddha; his name is spelled Pauṣkarasādi in Sanskrit. He is cited on grammar by Kātyāyana and Patañjali, and in the Taittirīya-prātiśākhya; on allowable food and theft in the Āpastamba Dharmasūtra; and on Vedic ritual in the Śāṅkhāyana-Āraṇyaka. [mn99:10.3]() clarifies that he is of the Upamañña lineage.
mn98:7.4	and he of Tārukkha.	In Pali we never meet Tārukkha and he is only mentioned in his absence. Bhāradvāja advocates his path at [dn13:5.2]() but without details. There is a Tārukṣya of Aitareya Āraṇyaka 3.1.6.1 whose view was that union (with Brahmā) arose with the conjunction of speech and breath; this was discussed alongside the views of many other brahmins. In Rig Veda 8.46.32 a certain Balbūtha Tarukṣa the Dāsa makes an offering to a sage. Sāyaṇa, the Vedic commentator, says that Balbūtha Tarukṣa was a guardian of cows, evidently alluding to the Aitareya Āraṇyaka, which describes Tārukṣya as a guardian of his teacher’s cows, thus locating Tārukṣya in the lineage of Tarukṣa. Hiraṇyakeśīgṛhyasūtra 2.8.19 also mentions him as a teacher, there spelled Tarukṣa.

mn98:7.7	As philologists and grammarians,	NA
mn98:7.8	we match our tutors in recitation.	NA
mn98:7.9	We have a dispute	NA
mn98:7.10	regarding genealogy.	NA
mn98:7.11	For Bhāradvāja says that	NA
mn98:7.12	one is a brahmin due to birth,	NA
mn98:7.13	but I declare it’s because of one’s deeds.	NA
mn98:7.14	Oh Clear-eyed One, know this as our debate.	NA
mn98:7.15	Since neither of us was able	NA
mn98:7.16	to convince the other,	NA
mn98:7.17	we’ve come to ask you, sir,	NA
mn98:7.18	renowned as the awakened one.	NA
mn98:7.19	As people honor with joined palms	NA

mn98:7.22	Gotama in the world.	NA
mn98:7.23	We ask this of Gotama,	The Buddha as “eye” evokes the common (eg. Rig Veda 1.164.14, 5.40.8, 5.59.5, 10.10.9) Vedic image of the Sun as the “eye of all” (_viśvacakṣāḥ_, 7.63.1), the “eye” for “eyes to see” (10.158.4), moving as an unaging wheel through the sky (1.164.14). See [dn16:5.6.3]().
mn98:7.24	the Eye arisen in the world:	NA
mn98:7.25	is one a brahmin due to birth,	NA
mn98:7.26	or else because of deeds?	NA
mn98:7.27	We don’t know, please tell us,	NA
mn98:7.28	so we can recognize a brahmin.”	NA
mn98:8.1	“I shall explain to you,”	NA
mn98:8.2	said the Buddha,	NA
mn98:8.3	“accurately and in sequence,	NA
mn98:8.4	the taxonomy of living creatures,	NA
mn98:8.5	for species are indeed diverse.	NA

mn98:8.7	though they lack self-awareness.	NA
mn98:8.8	They’re defined by birth,	NA
mn98:8.9	for species are indeed diverse.	Notice how the Buddha responds clearly, yet without immediately contradicting either of them. As usual, he begins by identifying common ground, pointing out things that they will all agree on.

mn98:10.6	who lives off various professions:	_Sippa_ here is usually translated “craft”, but this refers primarily to occupations making things by hand. In DN 2 there is a long list of _sippa_, only a few of which are “crafts”. “Profession” fits better.

mn98:10.26	who lives off priesthood:	NA
mn98:10.27	know them, Vāseṭṭha,	NA
mn98:10.28	as a sacrificer, not a brahmin.	The Buddha has been carefully leading up to this rhetorical thrust: a true brahmin is not one who performs the traditional rituals revered by the brahmins.
mn98:10.29	Anyone among humans	NA
mn98:10.30	who taxes village and nation,	Read _bhuñjati_ at [mn98:10.30]() with _yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha_ at [dn17:1.9.4](), [dn26:6.7](), and [mn129:35.7](). Translators have rendered these with “eat”, “enjoy”, or “govern”. But compare the archaic English “use” meaning “the benefit or profit of lands”. Thus _yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha_ means “use as has been used”, i.e. “maintain the current level of taxation”.
mn98:10.31	know them, Vāseṭṭha,	NA

mn98:11.5	Having nothing, taking nothing:	NA
mn98:11.6	that’s who I declare a brahmin.	The Buddha categorically rejects Bhāradvāja’s genealogical understanding of a brahmin and endorses Vāseṭṭha’s understanding in terms of good conduct. Nonetheless, while a brahmin must have good conduct, the true meaning of the word lies in liberation and transcendence. In this, the Buddha’s position approaches that of Yājñavalkya, who argued that a brahmin, knowing the Self, gives up desire for sons, wealth, and heaven and wanders seeking alms (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.5.1); ultimately, only one who knows the imperishable is a brahmin (3.8.10).

However, this was the central topic of conversation between Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja at [dn13:3.1](), where they were concerned to distinguish one path as correct.

mn98:11.40	against creatures firm and frail;	NA
mn98:11.41	not killing or making others kill:	NA
mn98:11.42	that’s who I declare a brahmin.	A brahmin is identified with Mitra, the “friendly” god of alliances (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 4.1.4). The Brahmanical tradition endorses harmlessness except in the sacrifice (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.15.1), which can be read as either sheer hypocrisy or as a sacred and effective limitation on the scope of killing. Either way, the Buddha made no such exception.

mn99:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn99:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn99:2.1	Now at that time the student Subha, Todeyya’s son, was residing in Sāvatthī at a certain householder’s home on some business.	The same Subha later met the Buddha in [mn135](), where he asked about kamma, and, following the Buddha’s passing, met with Ānanda in [dn10](). | Subha’s father Todeyya was a prominent brahmin, often mentioned alongside Pokkharasāti. The two apparently lived not far from each other, as, according to the commentary, Todeyya was named for his village of Tudi outside of Sāvatthī (see Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī 4.3.94).
mn99:2.2	Then Subha said to that householder,	NA

mn99:2.7	You can pay homage to him.”	NA
mn99:3.1	Acknowledging that householder, Subha went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn99:3.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:	NA
mn99:4.1	“Worthy Gotama, the brahmins say:	NA
mn99:4.2	‘Laypeople succeed in the system of the skillful teaching, not renunciates.’	The “the system of the skillful teaching” (or perhaps “principle”, _ñāyaṁ dhammaṁ kusalaṁ_), though attributed to the brahmins, is a very Buddhist-sounding phrase; I have not been able to identify anything similar in Brahmanical texts. The sentiment, however, is Brahmanical, since Vedism was for a long time practiced by householders, and the renunciate path advocated by Yājñavalkya was still controversial (see eg. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.22).
mn99:4.3	What do you say about this?”	NA
mn99:4.4	“On this point, student, I speak after analyzing the question,	“One who speaks after analyzing the question” is _vibhajjavāda_, a term that in later years characterized the Buddha’s teachings as a whole, or else a school or group of schools of whom the Sri Lankan Theravāda was one.

mn99:8.6	“Well, speak then, student.”	NA
mn99:9.1	“Worthy Gotama, truth is the first thing.	NA
mn99:9.2	Fervor is the second thing.	Given that this is said to be a practice for householders, it would seem that _tapas_ here means “fervor” rather than “mortification”. | A somewhat similar list of four things is found at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.22: a brahmin realizes the Self by means of study of Vedas, sacrifice, generosity, and the fervor of fasting (_vedānuvacanena … yajñena dānena tapasānāśakena_). Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.5.3 further identifies fasting with _brahmacariya_ and living in the forest.
mn99:9.3	Chastity is the third thing.	NA
mn99:9.4	Recitation is the fourth thing.	NA
mn99:9.5	Generosity is the fifth thing.	NA
mn99:9.6	These are the five things that the brahmins prescribe for making merit and succeeding in the skillful.	NA
mn99:9.7	What do you say about this?”	NA
mn99:9.8	“Well, student, is there even a single one of the brahmins who says this:	Compare [mn95:13.1]().
mn99:9.9	‘I declare the result of these five things after realizing it with my own insight’?”	NA
mn99:9.10	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA

mn99:9.12	‘I declare the result of these five things after realizing it with my own insight’?”	NA
mn99:9.13	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
mn99:9.14	“Well, what of the ancient seers of the brahmins, namely Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu? They were the authors and propagators of the hymns. Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times; and these days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it, chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taught.	NA
mn99:9.15	Did even they say:	NA
mn99:9.16	‘We declare the result of these five things after realizing it with our own insight’?”	NA
mn99:9.17	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
mn99:9.18	“So, student, it seems that there is not a single one of the brahmins,	NA
mn99:9.19	NA	NA
mn99:9.20	not even anyone back to the seventh generation of tutors,	NA
mn99:9.21	NA	NA

mn99:9.25	Suppose there was a queue of blind men, each holding the one in front: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see.	NA
mn99:9.26	In the same way, it seems to me that the brahmins’ statement turns out to be comparable to a queue of blind men: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see.”	NA
mn99:10.1	When he said this, Subha became angry and upset with the Buddha because of the simile of the queue of blind men. He even attacked and badmouthed the Buddha himself, saying,	NA
mn99:10.2	“The ascetic Gotama will be worsted!” He said to the Buddha:	NA
mn99:10.3	“Worthy Gotama, the brahmin Pokkharasāti Upamañña of the Subhaga Forest says:	The Subhaga Forest outside Ukkaṭṭha was the scene of cosmic drama demonstrating the superiority of the Buddha over the brahmins, likely chosen because it was Pokkharasāti’s home ([mn1:1.2](), [mn49:2.1](); see also [dn14:3.29]()). | The Upamañña clan (_gotra_) traces to Upamanyu Vāsiṣṭha, the author of three verses in homage of Indra and Soma (Rig Veda 9.97.13–15). The association with Soma worship continued with Prācīnaśāla son of Upamanyu, who worshiped the Self in the sky only, which, though limited, brings an abundance of Soma libations and food in the family (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.12; cf. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.1.3). An Upamanyu descendant hailed from Kamboja (Persia); his teacher Madragāra Śauṅgāyani was from the neighboring Madra (Vaṁśa-Brāhmaṇa 1.17). It is perhaps this Upamanyu who is cited for his linguistic expertise in Yāska’s Nirukta (1.1, etc.). Insofar as any conclusions can be drawn from all this, it agrees with the sutta depiction of Pokkharasāti as a family man, devoted to Brahmanical traditions, and learned in the Vedas. Later, the Purāṇas would depict an Upamanyu as a devotee of Śiva.
mn99:10.4	‘This is exactly what happens with some ascetics and brahmins. They claim to have a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.	NA
mn99:10.5	But their statement turns out to be a joke—mere words, vacuous and hollow.	NA
mn99:10.6	For how on earth can a human being know or see or realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones?	NA
mn99:10.7	That is not possible.’”	This attitude sharply contrasts with [dn3:1.2.6](), where he is inspired to hear of the Buddha’s reputation for meditative insight. Presumably this was earlier. He may have grown more interested in the Buddha over time, as his reputation spread.
mn99:11.1	“But student, does Pokkharasāti understand the minds of all these ascetics and brahmins, having comprehended them with his mind?”	NA
mn99:11.2	“Worthy Gotama, Pokkharasāti doesn’t even know the mind of his own bonded maid Puṇṇikā, so how could he know all those ascetics and brahmins?”	NA
mn99:12.1	“Suppose there was a person blind from birth. They couldn’t see sights that are dark or bright, or blue, yellow, red, or magenta. They couldn’t see even and uneven ground, or the stars, or the moon and sun.	NA
mn99:12.2	They’d say:	NA
mn99:12.3	‘There’s no such thing as dark and bright sights, and no-one who sees them.	NA
mn99:12.4	There’s no such thing as blue,	NA

mn99:12.11	I don’t know it or see it,	NA
mn99:12.12	therefore it doesn’t exist.’	A logic still all too familiar today.
mn99:12.13	Would they be speaking rightly?”	NA
mn99:12.14	“No, worthy Gotama.	NA
mn99:12.15	There are such things as dark and bright sights, and one who sees them.	NA
mn99:12.16	There is blue,	NA
mn99:12.17	yellow,	NA

mn99:13.12	“That it’s beneficial.”	NA

mn99:14.2	If this is so, does Pokkharasāti’s speech agree or disagree with the consensus of opinion?”	NA
mn99:14.3	“It disagrees, worthy Gotama.”	NA
mn99:14.4	“Is it thoughtful or thoughtless?”	NA
mn99:14.5	“Thoughtless.”	NA

mn99:22.8	And as soon as they left the town some people asked them for the road to Naḷakāra.	NA
mn99:22.9	Would they be slow or hesitant to answer?”	NA
mn99:22.10	“No, worthy Gotama.	NA
mn99:22.11	Why is that?	NA
mn99:22.12	Because they were born and raised in Naḷakāra. They’re well acquainted with all the roads to the village.”	NA
mn99:22.13	“Still, it’s possible they might be slow or hesitant to answer. But the Realized One is never slow or hesitant when questioned about the realm of divinity or the practice that leads to the realm of divinity.	NA
mn99:22.14	I understand divinity, the realm of divinity, and the practice that leads to the realm of divinity, practicing in accordance with which one is reborn in the realm of divinity.”	NA
mn99:23.1	“Worthy Gotama, I have heard that	NA
mn99:23.2	the ascetic Gotama teaches a path to company with divinity.	NA
mn99:23.3	Please teach me that path.”	As at [dn13:39.2](). Sāriputta teaches a similar path at [mn97:31.3](), but without being asked.
mn99:23.4	“Well then, student, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn99:23.5	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Subha.	NA
mn99:23.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn99:24.1	“And what is a path to company with divinity?	NA
mn99:24.2	Firstly, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	NA
mn99:24.3	When the heart’s release by love has been developed like this, any limited deeds they’ve done don’t remain or persist there.	NA
mn99:24.4	Suppose there was a powerful horn blower. They’d easily make themselves heard in the four quarters.	NA
mn99:24.5	In the same way, when the heart’s release by love has been developed like this, any limited deeds they’ve done don’t remain or persist there.	NA
mn99:24.6	This is a path to company with divinity.	NA
mn99:25-27.1	Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion …	NA
mn99:25-27.2	They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing …	NA
mn99:25-27.3	They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	NA
mn99:25-27.4	When the heart’s release by equanimity has been developed and cultivated like this, any limited deeds they’ve done don’t remain or persist there.	NA
mn99:25-27.5	Suppose there was a powerful horn blower. They’d easily make themselves heard in the four quarters.	NA
mn99:25-27.6	In the same way, when the heart’s release by equanimity has been developed and cultivated like this, any limited deeds they’ve done don’t remain or persist there.	NA
mn99:25-27.7	This too is a path to company with divinity.”	NA
mn99:28.1	When he had spoken, Subha said to him,	NA
mn99:28.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	NA
mn99:28.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
mn99:28.4	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	He is said to have gone for refuge again in [mn135:21.4]() and [dn10:2.37.9]().
mn99:28.5	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.	NA
mn99:28.6	Well, now, worthy Gotama, I must go.	NA
mn99:28.7	I have many duties, and much to do.”	Echoing his earlier acknowledgment of the many duties of lay folk at [mn99:5.2]().
mn99:29.1	“Please, student, go at your convenience.”	NA
mn99:29.2	And then Subha approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	NA
mn99:30.1	Now at that time the brahmin Jānussoṇi drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day in an all-white chariot drawn by mares.	NA
mn99:30.2	He saw the student Subha coming off in the distance,	NA
mn99:30.3	and said to him,	NA
mn99:30.4	“So, worthy Bhāradvāja, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”	NA
mn99:30.5	“Just now, good fellow, I’ve come from the presence of the ascetic Gotama.”	NA
mn99:30.6	“What do you think of the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom? Do you think he’s astute?”	NA
mn99:30.7	“My good man, who am I to judge the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom?	NA
mn99:30.8	You’d really have to be on the same level to judge his lucidity of wisdom.”	NA
mn99:30.9	“Worthy Bhāradvāja praises the ascetic Gotama with lofty praise indeed.”	NA
mn99:30.10	“Who am I to praise the ascetic Gotama?	NA
mn99:30.11	He is praised by the praised as the best among gods and humans.	NA
mn99:30.12	The five things that the brahmins prescribe for making merit and succeeding in the skillful	NA
mn99:30.13	he says are prerequisites of the mind for	NA
mn99:30.14	developing a mind free of enmity and ill will.”	NA
mn99:31.1	When he had spoken, Jānussoṇi got down from his chariot, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times,	NA
mn99:31.2	“King Pasenadi of Kosala is lucky, so very lucky	NA
mn99:31.3	that the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is living in his realm!”	NA
mn100:0.1	Middle Discourses 100	NA
mn100:0.2	With Saṅgārava	NA
mn100:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn100:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	NA
mn100:2.1	Now at that time a brahmin lady named Dhanañjānī was residing at Caṇḍalakappa. She was devoted to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.	NA
mn100:2.2	Once, she tripped and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times:	A brahmin lady of the same name also trips and utters praise of the Buddha in [sn7.1](). Nonetheless, most other details of the stories are different, including the location and the subsequent teaching. There, her husband gets angry, goes to confront by the Buddha, but is converted by his teaching on the harm of anger. The historical relation between these two texts is unclear. Regardless, they do attest to the use of Buddhist invocations from an early date. A similar invocation is expressed for the Great Steward at [dn19:58.5]().
mn100:2.3	“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	NA
mn100:2.4	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	NA
mn100:2.5	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!”	NA
mn100:3.1	Now at that time the student Saṅgārava was residing in Caṇḍalakappa. He was young, newly tonsured; he was sixteen years old. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.	A “brahmin” Saṅgārava of Sāvatthī appears in a number of discourses, and his spiritual progression can be traced. He practiced purification in water ([sn7.21]()) and (apparently later) asked the Buddha about sacrifice ([an3.60]()). He further asked how hymns are remembered ([sn46.55](), [an5.193]()). In all these discourses he was said to have gone for refuge at the end, as does the Saṅgārava of the current discourse. Finally he asks the more meaningful spiritual question about the near shore and far shore ([an10.117](), [an10.169]()). It is possible that the teenage “student” (_māṇava_) Saṅgārava living at Caṇḍalakappa graduated and moved to nearby Sāvatthī where he became known as the “brahmin” Saṅgārava. This would only make sense, however, if we disregard the statements on going for refuge, as he clearly followed the Brahmanical path for quite some time.
mn100:3.2	Hearing Dhanañjānī’s exclamation,	NA
mn100:3.3	he said to her,	NA
mn100:3.4	“The brahmin lady Dhanañjānī is a disgrace! Though brahmins proficient in the three Vedas are found, she praises that shaveling, that fake ascetic.”	The relationship between Saṅgārava and Dhanañjānī is not specified in the text, but she was probably the wife of his brahmin teacher.
mn100:3.5	“But dearest boy, you don’t understand the Buddha’s ethics and wisdom.	NA
mn100:3.6	If you did, you’d never think of abusing or insulting him.”	NA
mn100:3.7	“Well then, ma’am, let me know when the Buddha arrives in Caṇḍalakappa.”	NA
mn100:3.8	“I will, dearest,” she replied.	NA
mn100:4.1	And then the Buddha, traveling stage by stage in the Kosalan lands, arrived at Caṇḍalakappa,	NA
mn100:4.2	where he stayed in the mango grove of the Todeyya brahmins.	NA
mn100:5.1	Dhanañjānī heard that he had arrived.	NA
mn100:5.2	So she went to Saṅgārava and told him, adding,	NA
mn100:5.3	NA	NA
mn100:5.4	“Please, dearest boy, go at your convenience.”	NA
mn100:5.5	“Yes, ma’am,” replied Saṅgārava. He went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	Text drops a _-ti_, apparently by mistake; _evaṁ bhoti_ should be _evaṁ bhotīti_.
mn100:5.6	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:	NA
mn100:6.1	“Worthy Gotama, there are some ascetics and brahmins who claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life having attained perfection and consummation of insight in this life.	For the phrase “having attained perfection and consummation of insight”, see [mn77:15.6]().
mn100:6.2	Where do you stand regarding these?”	NA
mn100:7.1	“I say there is a diversity among those who claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life having attained perfection and consummation of insight in this life.	NA
mn100:7.2	There are some ascetics and brahmins who are oral transmitters.	NA
mn100:7.3	Through oral transmission they claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life.	NA
mn100:7.4	For example, the brahmins who are proficient in the three Vedas.	NA
mn100:7.5	There are some ascetics and brahmins who solely by mere faith claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life.	NA
mn100:7.6	For example, those who rely on logic and inquiry.	Elsewhere, reason and faith are regarded as two distinct means of knowledge (eg. [mn95:14.5]()), and their conflation here is probably a redaction error. In the Sanskrit parallel, faith applies to all the means of knowledge, in the sense that they have faith in those means. (Lixiang Zhang, *Das Śaṁkarasūtra*, 2004, cited in Anālayo, *Comparative Study* volume 2.)
mn100:7.7	There are some ascetics and brahmins who, having directly known for themselves the principle regarding teachings not learned before from another, claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life.	NA
mn100:7.8	I am one of those.	NA
mn100:8.1	And here’s a way to understand that I am one of them.	NA
mn100:9.1	Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought:	NA
mn100:9.2	‘Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide open.	NA
mn100:9.3	It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	NA
mn100:9.4	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	NA
mn100:9.5	Some time later, while still with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn100:9.6	Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	See [mn26:14.1]()ff. for notes.
mn100:9.7	‘Reverend Kālāma, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’	NA
mn100:9.8	Āḷāra Kālāma replied,	NA
mn100:9.9	‘Stay, venerable.	NA
mn100:9.10	This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’	NA
mn100:9.11	I quickly memorized that teaching.	NA
mn100:9.12	As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.	NA
mn100:9.13	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn100:9.14	‘It is not solely by mere faith that Āḷāra Kālāma declares: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”	NA
mn100:9.15	Surely he meditates knowing and seeing this teaching.’	NA
mn100:10.1	So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him:	NA
mn100:10.2	‘Reverend Kālāma, to what extent do you say you’ve realized this teaching with your own insight?’	NA
mn100:10.3	When I said this, he declared the dimension of nothingness.	NA
mn100:10.4	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn100:10.5	‘It’s not just Āḷāra Kālāma who has faith,	NA
mn100:10.6	energy,	NA
mn100:10.7	mindfulness,	NA
mn100:10.8	immersion,	NA
mn100:10.9	and wisdom; I too have these things.	NA
mn100:10.10	Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Āḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insight?’	NA
mn100:10.11	I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.	NA
mn100:10.12	So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	NA
mn100:10.13	‘Reverend Kālāma, is it up to this point that you realized this teaching with your own insight, and declare having achieved it?’	NA
mn100:10.14	‘I have, reverend.’	NA
mn100:10.15	‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’	NA
mn100:10.16	‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate	NA
mn100:10.17	to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!	NA
mn100:10.18	So the teaching that I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it.	NA
mn100:10.19	The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it, I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it.	NA
mn100:10.20	So the teaching that I know, you know, and the teaching you know, I know.	NA
mn100:10.21	I am like you and you are like me.	NA
mn100:10.22	Come now, reverend! We should both lead this community together.’	NA
mn100:10.23	And that is how my tutor Āḷāra Kālāma placed me, his pupil, on the same position as him, and honored me with lofty praise.	NA
mn100:10.24	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn100:10.25	‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingness.’	NA
mn100:10.26	Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.	NA
mn100:11.1	I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	NA
mn100:11.2	‘Reverend, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’	NA
mn100:11.3	Uddaka replied,	NA
mn100:11.4	‘Stay, venerable.	NA
mn100:11.5	This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’	NA
mn100:11.6	I quickly memorized that teaching.	NA
mn100:11.7	As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.	NA
mn100:11.8	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn100:11.9	‘It is not solely by mere faith that Rāma declared: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”	NA
mn100:11.10	Surely he meditated knowing and seeing this teaching.’	NA

mn100:11.12	‘Reverend, to what extent did Rāma say he’d realized this teaching with his own insight?’	NA
mn100:11.13	When I said this, Uddaka son of Rāma declared the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	NA
mn100:11.14	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn100:11.15	‘It’s not just Rāma who had faith,	NA
mn100:11.16	energy,	NA
mn100:11.17	mindfulness,	NA
mn100:11.18	immersion,	NA
mn100:11.19	and wisdom; I too have these things.	NA
mn100:11.20	Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Rāma said he had realized with his own insight?’	NA
mn100:11.21	I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.	NA
mn100:12.1	So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	NA
mn100:12.2	‘Reverend, had Rāma realized this teaching with his own insight up to this point, and declared having achieved it?’	NA
mn100:12.3	‘He had, reverend.’	NA

mn100:12.8	The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it, Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it.	NA
mn100:12.9	So the teaching that Rāma directly knew, you know, and the teaching you know, Rāma directly knew.	NA
mn100:12.10	Rāma was like you and you are like Rāma.	NA
mn100:12.11	Come now, reverend! You should lead this community.’	NA
mn100:12.12	And that is how my spiritual companion Uddaka son of Rāma placed me in the position of a tutor, and honored me with lofty praise.	NA
mn100:12.13	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn100:12.14	‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’	NA
mn100:12.15	Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.	NA
mn100:13.1	I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands, I arrived at the town of Senā in Uruvelā.	NA
mn100:13.2	There I saw a delightful park, a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby was a village to resort to for alms.	NA
mn100:13.3	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn100:13.4	‘This park is truly delightful, a lovely grove with a flowing river that’s clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby there’s a village to resort to for alms.	NA
mn100:13.5	This is good enough for striving for a gentleman wanting to strive.’	NA
mn100:13.6	So I sat down right there, thinking:	NA
mn100:13.7	‘This is good enough for striving.’	NA
mn100:14.1	And then these three similes, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me.	See [mn36:17.1]()ff. for notes.
mn100:14.2	Suppose there was a green, sappy log, and it was lying in water.	NA
mn100:14.3	Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking	NA
mn100:14.4	to light a fire and produce heat.	NA
mn100:14.5	What do you think, Bhāradvāja?	NA
mn100:14.6	By drilling the stick against that green, sappy log lying in water, could they light a fire and produce heat?”	NA
mn100:14.7	“No, worthy Gotama.	NA
mn100:14.8	Why is that?	NA
mn100:14.9	Because it’s a green, sappy log, and it’s lying in the water.	NA
mn100:14.10	That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.”	NA
mn100:14.11	“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who don’t live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures. They haven’t internally given up or stilled desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and passion for sensual pleasures. Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion, they are incapable of knowledge and vision, of supreme awakening.	NA
mn100:14.12	This was the first example that occurred to me.	NA
mn100:15.1	Then a second example occurred to me.	NA
mn100:15.2	Suppose there was a green, sappy log, and it was lying on dry land far from the water.	NA
mn100:15.3	Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking	NA
mn100:15.4	to light a fire and produce heat.	NA
mn100:15.5	What do you think, Bhāradvāja?	NA
mn100:15.6	By drilling the stick against that green, sappy log on dry land far from water, could they light a fire and produce heat?”	NA
mn100:15.7	“No, worthy Gotama.	NA
mn100:15.8	Why is that?	NA
mn100:15.9	Because it’s still a green, sappy log, despite the fact that it’s lying on dry land far from water.	NA
mn100:15.10	That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.” “In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures. But they haven’t internally given up or stilled desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and passion for sensual pleasures.

mn100:15.11	This was the second example that occurred to me.	NA
mn100:16.1	Then a third example occurred to me.	NA
mn100:16.2	Suppose there was a dried up, withered log, and it was lying on dry land far from the water.	NA
mn100:16.3	Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking	NA
mn100:16.4	to light a fire and produce heat.	NA
mn100:16.5	What do you think, Bhāradvāja?	NA
mn100:16.6	By drilling the stick against that dried up, withered log on dry land far from water, could they light a fire and produce heat?”	NA
mn100:16.7	“Yes, worthy Gotama.	NA
mn100:16.8	Why is that?	NA
mn100:16.9	Because it’s a dried up, withered log, and it’s lying on dry land far from water.”	NA
mn100:16.10	“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures.

mn100:16.11	This was the third example that occurred to me.	NA
mn100:16.12	These are the three similes, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, that occurred to me.	NA
mn100:17.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn100:17.2	‘Why don’t I, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, squeeze, squash, and scorch mind with mind?’	NA
mn100:17.3	So that’s what I did,	NA
mn100:17.4	until sweat ran from my armpits.	NA
mn100:17.5	It was like when a strong man grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes, squashes, and crushes them.	NA
mn100:17.6	In the same way, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, I squeezed, squashed, and crushed mind with mind until sweat ran from my armpits.	NA
mn100:17.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	NA
mn100:18.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn100:18.2	‘Why don’t I practice the breathless absorption?’	NA
mn100:18.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose.	NA
mn100:18.4	But then winds came out my ears making a loud noise,	NA
mn100:18.5	like the puffing of a blacksmith’s bellows.	NA
mn100:18.6	NA	NA
mn100:18.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	NA
mn100:19.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn100:19.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	NA
mn100:19.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose.	NA

mn100:23.2	‘The ascetic Gotama is dead.’	NA
mn100:23.3	Others said,	NA
mn100:23.4	‘He’s not dead, but he’s dying.’	NA

mn100:24.4	‘Good fellow, don’t practice totally cutting off food.	NA
mn100:24.5	If you do, we’ll infuse heavenly nectar into your pores and you will live on that.’	NA
mn100:24.6	NA	NA

mn100:24.9	NA	NA
mn100:24.10	So I dismissed those deities, saying, ‘There’s no need.’	NA
mn100:25.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn100:25.2	‘Why don’t I just take a little bit of food each time, a handful of broth made from mung beans, horse gram, chickpeas, or green gram?’	NA
mn100:25.3	So that’s what I did,	NA
mn100:25.4	until my body became extremely emaciated.	NA
mn100:25.5	Due to eating so little, my major and minor limbs became like the joints of an eighty-year-old or a dying man,	NA
mn100:25.6	my bottom became like a camel’s hoof,	NA
mn100:25.7	my vertebrae stuck out like beads on a string,	NA
mn100:25.8	and my ribs were as gaunt as the broken-down rafters on an old barn.	NA
mn100:25.9	Due to eating so little, the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets, like the gleam of water sunk deep down a well.	NA
mn100:25.10	Due to eating so little, my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bitter-gourd in the wind and sun.	NA
mn100:25.11	Due to eating so little, the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone, so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone, and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my belly.	NA
mn100:25.12	Due to eating so little, when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right there.	NA
mn100:25.13	Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out.	NA
mn100:26.1	Then some people saw me and said: ‘The ascetic Gotama is black.’	NA
mn100:26.2	Some said: ‘He’s not black, he’s brown.’	NA
mn100:26.3	Some said: ‘He’s neither black nor brown. The ascetic Gotama has tawny skin.’	NA
mn100:26.4	That’s how far the pure, bright complexion of my skin had been ruined by taking so little food.	NA
mn100:27.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn100:27.2	‘Whatever ascetics and brahmins have experienced painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion—whether in the past, future, or present—this is as far as it goes, no-one has done more than this.	NA
mn100:27.3	NA	NA
mn100:27.4	NA	NA
mn100:27.5	But I have not achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones by this severe, grueling work.	NA
mn100:27.6	Could there be another path to awakening?’	NA
mn100:28.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn100:28.2	‘I recall sitting in the cool shade of a black plum tree while my father the Sakyan was off working.

NA
mn100:28.3	Could that be the path to awakening?’	NA
mn100:28.4	Stemming from that memory came the understanding:	NA
mn100:28.5	‘*That* is the path to awakening!’	NA
mn100:29.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn100:29.2	‘Why am I afraid of that pleasure, for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities?’	NA
mn100:29.3	I thought,	NA
mn100:29.4	‘I’m not afraid of that pleasure, for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities.’	NA
mn100:30.1	Then it occurred to me,	NA
mn100:30.2	‘I can’t achieve that pleasure with a body so excessively emaciated. Why don’t I eat some solid food, some rice and porridge?’	NA
mn100:30.3	NA	NA
mn100:30.4	So I ate some solid food.	NA
mn100:30.5	Now at that time the five mendicants were attending on me, thinking,	NA
mn100:30.6	‘The ascetic Gotama will tell us of any truth that he realizes.’	NA
mn100:30.7	But when I ate some solid food, they left disappointed in me, saying,	NA
mn100:30.8	‘The ascetic Gotama has become indulgent; he has strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence.’	NA

mn100:36-38.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds …	NA
mn100:36-38.3	This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of the night.	NA
mn100:36-38.4	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	NA

mn100:42.1	When he had spoken, Saṅgārava said to the Buddha,	This final passage has been widely misunderstood. K.R. Norman (“The Buddha’s View of Devas”) argued that the passage is corrupt, and Bodhi, while not endorsing Norman’s emendations, agrees. However, while there are difficulties in readings and interpretations, for the most part the Pali makes good sense. The opening showed Saṅgārava being overreactive and dogmatic, an impression reinforced here by his sudden changes of topic and misunderstandings. Note too that the Saṅgārava of [an3.60]() is evasive and a little rude, reminiscent of the prickly and unpredictable personality on display in the current sutta. I think the bulk of the difficulties simply represent a lively but somewhat chaotic exchange, although textual corruption cannot be ruled out. However, note that Sanskrit fragments indicate that in that version this discussion happened before the bulk of the sutta teachings. I agree with Anālayo that the Sanskrit form makes better sense (*Comparative Study*, volume ii, page 583).
mn100:42.2	“The striving of the worthy Gotama was indeed assiduous and that of a true person,	Read _aṭṭhita_ as _ā+ṭhita_, “assiduous”; see [ja242:2.1]() in the same sense, and compare Sanskrit _āsthita_. | I follow the variant _vata_ rather than _vataṁ_, as exclamations with repeated _vata_ are idiomatic.
mn100:42.3	since he is a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn100:42.4	But worthy Gotama, do gods survive?”	The sense of _atthi devā_ is established from such passages as [mn90:13.2]().
mn100:42.5	“I’ve understood about gods in terms of causes.”	_Ṭhānaso_ here means “in terms of cause” or “by way of cause”. It typically appears in the context of kamma and rebirth, followed by a verb of knowing, eg. _ṭhānaso hetuso vipākaṁ yathābhūtaṁ pajānāti_, “understands results (of kamma) in terms of grounds and causes” ([mn12:11.2]()). The Buddha’s point is that the survival of gods is not a metaphysical absolute but depends on their kamma. | As usual, the Buddha answers such questions framed with _atthi_ indirectly; see note on [mn90:13.2](). | That _adhideva_ means “about the gods” is established at [mn90:17.8]().
mn100:42.6	NA	NA
mn100:42.7	“But worthy Gotama, when asked ‘Do gods survive?’ why did you say that you have understood about gods in terms of causes?	NA
mn100:42.8	That being so, is it not hollow and false?”	Normally such a phrase would include a reference to the Buddha’s speech (as eg. [mn80:3.15]()). But this is lacking in the Pali so I omit it.
mn100:42.9	“When asked ‘Do gods survive’, whether you reply ‘Gods survive’ or ‘I’ve understood in terms of causes’	NA
mn100:42.10	a sensible person would come to the categorical conclusion in this matter that	NA
mn100:42.11	gods survive.”	This should be read in light of [sn12.15:2.2](), where “survival” or “existence” (_atthita_) is understood by seeing “origin” (_samudaya_), while non-existence is understood by seeing “cessation”. Here too the survival of gods is understood in terms of cause.
mn100:42.12	“But why didn’t you say that in the first place?”	The Buddha’s answer relied on the implication that since gods depend on causes they “survive” in the sense of being reborn, but not in the sense of eternal existence. Saṅgārava didn’t follow the argument.
mn100:42.13	“It is agreed by the eminent in the world that gods survive.”	I think the Buddha felt that since it is agreed “by the eminent” (_uccena_)—which would include the brahmanical teachers of Saṅgārava—that gods are real, this could be assumed. So the Buddha’s response was aimed at clarifying the *kind* of existence that gods have, namely, a conditioned and impermanent existence determined by the kamma. When faced with the same question at [mn90:13.2](), the Buddha’s immediate response was to ask for a clarification, so the confusion did not arise.

mn101:0.1	Middle Discourses 101	NA
mn101:0.2	At Devadaha	NA
mn101:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn101:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near the Sakyan town named Devadaha.	Devadaha also appears in [sn22.2]() and [sn35.134](). The name is explained in the commentary as “royal lake”, taking _deva-_ as a term for kings, and _-daha_ as equivalent to the Sanskrit _hrada_, “lake”. However it is spelled _devadṛśa_ in the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya ([San Mu Kd 17:16](https://suttacentral.net/san-mu-kd17/san/gbm#sc16)). _Dṛśa_ means “sight, appearance”, thus occupying a completely different semantic space than “lake”. It is a Vedic term that commonly describes Agni’s fiery gleam (Rig Veda 3.17.4, 6.10.4, 7.1.1, etc.). This suggests a Pali derivation from √_ḍah_, “to burn”. This in turn recalls Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.4.1.14, which allegorically depicts the spread of Aryan culture eastward as Agni “burning” (_dadāha_) the lands, i.e. introducing the civilized practice of Vedic fire worship. I think the meaning of _devadaha_ is, therefore, “burned by the god”, or “place of the god’s flame”. It became famous in later Buddhism as the birthplace of the sisters Māyā and Mahāpajāpatī of the Koliyan clan, the Buddha’s birth mother and foster mother. These details are not mentioned in early texts, however, where the town is said to be Sakyan rather than Koliyan. It is identified with Devdaha in the Rupandehi District of Nepal.
mn101:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn101:2.1	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn101:2.2	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn101:2.3	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn101:2.4	“Mendicants, there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	NA
mn101:2.5	‘Everything this individual experiences—pleasurable, painful, or neutral—is because of past deeds.	The view that all experiences are caused by past kamma is consistently rejected in the suttas (eg. [an3.61:2.1](), [sn36.21]()). This is reflected in the later Theravada commentaries, which describe five interacting _niyāmas_, or systems of natural law: seasons (_utu_), genetics (_bīja_), moral or immoral deeds (_kamma_), mind (_citta_), and principles of the teaching (_dhamma_). Nonetheless, the view that all experiences are caused by kamma is extremely common among modern Buddhists, and is often heard even from learned scholars. This is a harmful misunderstanding, as it has led to discrimination against the poor and disabled in Buddhist countries. One point of confusion is that rebirth into a particular life is caused by kamma, so in that general sense, kamma is a necessary condition for having a life in which one can experience anything. But the feelings experienced in that life are caused by a variety of things, not necessarily by kamma.
mn101:2.6	So, due to eliminating past deeds by fervent mortification, and not doing any new deeds, there’s nothing to come up in the future.	Jains believed that karma was material, made up of particles. The practice of _tapas_ (“fervent mortification”) creates an intense bodily heat which burns off these karmic particles, freeing the soul (_jīva_) to shine in its intrinsic purity. | This passage also at [mn14:17.7]().
mn101:2.7	With no future consequence, deeds end. With the ending of deeds, suffering ends. With the ending of suffering, feeling ends. And with the ending of feeling, all suffering will have been worn away.’	The mention of “feeling” after “suffering” here is found consistently in Pali sources, but not in their parallels. | _Nijiṇṇa_ (“worn away”) is a characteristic Jain term that is sometimes applied to kamma in the suttas as well.
mn101:2.8	Such is the doctrine of the Jain ascetics.	The idea that the elimination of karma leads to freedom from suffering is indeed a fundamental tenet of Jain thought.
mn101:3.1	I’ve gone up to the Jain ascetics who say this and said,	NA

mn101:11.6	In this case, what faith in your teacher do you have when it comes to the past? What endorsement, oral transmission, reasoned train of thought, or acceptance of a view after deliberation?’	NA
mn101:11.7	When I said this, I did not see any legitimate defense of their doctrine from the Jains.	NA
mn101:12.1	Furthermore, I said to those Jain ascetics,	NA
mn101:12.2	‘What do you think, reverends?	NA
mn101:12.3	At a time of intense exertion and striving do you suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion?	NA
mn101:12.4	Whereas at a time without intense exertion and striving do you not suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion?’	NA
mn101:12.5	‘Reverend Gotama, at a time of intense exertion we suffer painful, sharp feelings due to overexertion,	NA
mn101:12.6	not without intense exertion.’	NA
mn101:13.1	‘So it seems that only at a time of intense exertion do you suffer painful, sharp feelings due to overexertion,	NA
mn101:13.2	not without intense exertion.	NA
mn101:13.3	In that case, it’s not appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare:	NA

mn101:13.5	NA	NA
mn101:13.6	NA	NA

mn101:14.5	NA	NA

mn101:15.1	But since this is not the case,	NA
mn101:15.2	NA	NA
mn101:15.3	aren’t you experiencing painful, sharp feelings due only to your own exertion, which out of ignorance, unknowing, and confusion you misconstrue to imply:	This is a difficult sentence, and different translators handle it in quite different ways. I take _vipaccetha_ as second plural optative, intended as a rhetorical question. The sense, I think, plays on the common meaning of “ripen”, but in the sense “make something out of it that it isn’t”, i.e. (mis)construe.
mn101:15.4	“Everything this individual experiences—pleasurable, painful, or neutral—is because of past deeds. …”?’	NA

mn101:16.2	‘What do you think, reverends? If a deed is to be experienced in this life, can exertion make it be experienced in lives to come?’	Just as different deeds have differing characteristics, the results of those deeds also have different characteristics, which constrain the result in certain ways. This does not mean that they are fully deterministic, however. Compare the sprouting of a seed. A mango seed cannot give rise to an orange tree. And it has certain conditions under which it cannot sprout—if it is out of season, or the soil is inadequate, or there is no water, etc. Still, there are many different ways that it *can* sprout, and the tree and its fruit that result will vary according to conditions.

mn101:20.2	‘No, reverend.’	NA
mn101:20.3	‘But if a deed is not to be experienced, can exertion make it be experienced?’	This is a deed that has no opportunity to bear fruit, like a good seed on barren soil.
mn101:20.4	‘No, reverend.’	NA
mn101:21.1	‘So it seems that exertion cannot change the way deeds are experienced in any of these ways.	NA
mn101:21.2	This being so, your exertion and striving are fruitless.’	NA
mn101:22.1	Such is the doctrine of the Jain ascetics.	NA
mn101:22.2	Saying this, the Jain ascetics deserve rebuttal and criticism on ten legitimate grounds.	The “ten legitimate grounds” are, as explained below, the five grounds and their inversions. Whether or not the ground is true, the Jains deserve censure.
mn101:22.3	If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of past deeds,	NA
mn101:22.4	clearly the Jains have done bad deeds in the past, since they now experience such intense pain.	NA

mn101:22.7	If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of circumstance and nature,	This is the Ājīvika doctrine of the Bamboo-staffed Ascetic Gosāla, for which see [dn2:20.6](), [mn60:21.7](), and [an3.61]().

mn101:22.23	Such is the doctrine of the Jain ascetics.	NA
mn101:22.24	The Jain ascetics who say this deserve rebuttal and criticism on these ten legitimate grounds.	NA
mn101:22.25	That’s how exertion and striving is fruitless.	NA
mn101:23.1	And how is exertion and striving fruitful?	NA
mn101:23.2	It’s when a mendicant doesn’t bring suffering upon themselves; and they don’t forsake legitimate pleasure, but they’re not besotted with that pleasure.	NA
mn101:23.3	They understand:	NA
mn101:23.4	‘When I actively strive I become dispassionate towards this source of suffering. But when I develop equanimity I become dispassionate towards this other source of suffering.’	NA
mn101:23.5	So they either actively strive or develop equanimity as appropriate.	NA
mn101:23.6	NA	NA
mn101:23.7	Through active striving they become dispassionate towards that specific source of suffering,	NA

mn101:24.1	Suppose a man is in love with a woman, full of intense desire and lust.	NA
mn101:24.2	Then he sees her standing together with another man, chatting, giggling, and laughing.	NA
mn101:24.3	What do you think, mendicants?	NA
mn101:24.4	Would that give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress for him?”	NA
mn101:24.5	“Yes, sir.	NA
mn101:24.6	Why is that?	NA
mn101:24.7	Because that man is in love with that woman, full of intense desire and lust.”	NA
mn101:24.8	NA	NA
mn101:25.1	“Then that man might think:	NA
mn101:25.2	‘I’m in love with that woman, full of intense desire and lust.	NA

mn101:25.4	Why don’t I give up that desire and lust for that woman?’	NA
mn101:25.5	So that’s what he did.	NA

mn101:25.7	What do you think, mendicants?	NA

mn101:25.9	“No, sir.	NA
mn101:25.10	Why is that?	NA

mn101:27.7	After some time, they no longer strive painfully.	NA
mn101:27.8	Why is that?	NA

mn101:36.3	After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in their presence.	NA
mn101:37.1	Giving up covetousness for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness.	NA
mn101:37.2	Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of sympathy for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will.	NA

mn101:39.2	That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful.	NA
mn101:40.1	Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA
mn101:40.2	That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful.	NA
mn101:41.1	Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
mn101:41.2	That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful.	NA
mn101:42.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives.	NA
mn101:42.2	They recollect many kinds of past lives, that is, one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended.

mn101:42.3	That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful.	NA
mn101:43.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	NA
mn101:43.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	NA
mn101:43.3	That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful.	NA

mn101:45.1	Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	NA
mn101:45.2	When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.	NA

mn102:1.1	So I have heard.	This sutta is something of a “middle length” version of the better-known Brahmajālasutta ([dn1]()). Both these texts emphasize the importance of understanding the views of others. This is important, because we live and communicate in a cultural context, and our views are shared with those of others. Some of the views defined here are still current today, while others have disappeared in history. But we can still learn from the Buddha’s method to learn how to approach different views today. | A Tibetan translation of the Mūlasarvāstivāda Pañcatraya Sūtra is discussed by Peter Skilling in *Mahāsūtras II*, pp. 469–511.
mn102:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn102:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn102:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn102:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn102:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn102:2.1	“Mendicants, there are some ascetics and brahmins who speculate and theorize about the future, and assert various hypotheses concerning the future.	NA
mn102:2.2	Some propose this: ‘The self is percipient and healthy after death.’	The first three are varieties of eternalism. | _Aroga_ (“free of disease”) is explained by the commentary as “permanent” (_nicca_), drawing on the root sense of the word, “unbroken”. However, _aroga_ is always used in the sense “free of disease, well, healthy” (eg. [mn97:2.4]()), and this applies to the Brahmanical tradition as well as the Buddhist. Chandogya Upaniṣad 7.26.2 says that one who sees (the self) does not see death, they have no disease or pain. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.12 similarly says that one who sees the self will not suffer in the wake of the body, which Śaṅkāra explains, “Struggling with desires for himself, for his son, for his wife, and so on, he is born and dies again and again, and is diseased when his body is diseased.”

mn102:2.4	Some propose this: ‘The self is non-percipient and healthy after death.’	NA
mn102:2.5	NA	NA
mn102:2.6	Some propose this: ‘The self is neither percipient nor non-percipient and healthy after death.’	NA
mn102:2.7	NA	NA
mn102:2.8	But some assert the annihilation, eradication, and obliteration of an existing being, while others propose extinguishment in this life.	“Extinguishment in the present life” sounds like the Buddhist view, but since it is collected here with wrong views, it refers to misapprehension of absorption as being Nibbāna ([mn102:24.1]()). This is similar to the five views of [dn1:3.19.1](). DN 1 adds sensual pleasures as a kind of false Nibbāna; it also makes it explicit that it is the extinguishment of “an existing being”. | In both suttas “extinguishment in the present life” is included with the views about the future, for unclear reasons. Skilling notes, however, that in the Pañcatraya Sūtra, “extinguishment in the present life” constitutes a separate category.
mn102:2.9	Thus they assert an existent self that is free of disease after death; or they assert the annihilation of an existing being; while some propose extinguishment in this life.	NA
mn102:2.10	In this way five become three, and three become five.	That is, there are five total propositions, of which the first three are varieties of eternalism, which if treated as a group, gives three kinds of views.
mn102:2.11	This is the summary recital of the five and three.	NA
mn102:3.1	Now, the ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is percipient and healthy after death describe it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless. Or they describe it as of unified perception, or of diverse perception, or of limited perception, or of limitless perception. Or some among those who go beyond this propose universal consciousness, limitless and imperturbable.	The Buddha subdivides the first kind of eternalist according to the kind of self that is envisaged. | The “form” of the self may be either “coarse” form such as a human body, or “subtle form” like the heaven realms. | A formless self is associated with formless attainments. | “Having form and being formless” is not meant as a paradox. It could mean that the self evolves or transitions through different states, sometimes having form, sometimes not. Or it could refer to something like different layers of sheaths of the self, where everything is the self, but may be lesser attributes of self. | Unified perception results from _jhāna_, diverse perception from sense experience. | Limited perception is associated with sense consciousness or a limited attainment of absorption, while limitless perception is associated with a limitless absorption. This seems to refer to the first formless attainment. | “Universal consciousness” (_viññāṇakasiṇa_) is equivalent to the second formless attainment, which is mentioned by both the Pali commentary and the Pañcatraya Sūtra.
mn102:4.1	The Realized One understands this as follows.	NA
mn102:4.2	There are ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is percipient and healthy after death, describing it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless. Or they describe it as of unified perception, or of diverse perception, or of limited perception, or of limitless perception.	NA
mn102:4.3	NA	NA
mn102:4.4	Or some, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, propose the dimension of nothingness, limitless and imperturbable. They declare that this is the purest, highest, best, and supreme of all those perceptions, whether of form or of formlessness or of unity or of diversity.	This is the third formless attainment. | The fourth formless attainment, “neither perception nor non-perception” is so subtle that it cannot be considered an attainment with perception.
mn102:4.5	‘That much is conditioned and crude. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’	This describes the development of insight based on deep absorption. Even the most refined states are still conditioned and therefore “coarse” compared to Nibbāna.
mn102:4.6	Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.	NA
mn102:5.1	Now, the ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is non-percipient and healthy after death describe it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless.	The suttas occasionally mention the “non-percipient beings” ([dn1:2.31.1]()). The commentaries explain this as a realm of pure form, where consciousness is suspended for a long time. This is tricky to interpret in line with the Buddhist classes of existence, since such a state could not be considered “formless”. A similar problem comes when the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception is considered to have form ([mn102:8.1]()). Such cases must refer to sectarian views that do not fit within the Buddhist system.
mn102:6.1	So they reject those who assert a self that is percipient and healthy after death.	NA
mn102:6.2	Why is that?	NA
mn102:6.3	Because they believe that perception is a disease, a boil, a dart, and that the state of non-perception is peaceful and sublime.	NA
mn102:7.1	The Realized One understands this as follows.	NA
mn102:7.2	There are ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is non-percipient and healthy after death, describing it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless.	NA
mn102:7.3	But if any ascetic or brahmin should say this:	NA
mn102:7.4	‘Apart from form, feeling, perception, and choices, I will describe the coming and going of consciousness, its passing away and reappearing, its growth, increase, and maturity.’	Also at [sn22.53:2.2](), etc. | The process of rebirth is often described in terms of consciousness, as in dependent origination or, say, the “stream of consciousness” ([dn28:7.13]()). However, consciousness never exists by itself, but only in relation to the other aggregates. | The case of the formless realm might seem to be somewhat of an exception. However even formless rebirth is dependent on form of the past, since a meditator must undertake the practice, and also the four “form” absorptions are the basis for the formless attainments. Thus while the formless realms can be described without reference to *present* form they cannot be described without reference to form at all.
mn102:7.5	That is not possible.	NA
mn102:7.6	‘All that is conditioned and crude. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’	NA
mn102:7.7	Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.	NA

mn102:9.2	Why is that?	NA
mn102:9.3	Because they believe that perception is a disease, a boil, a dart; that non-perception is a stupor; and that the state of neither perception nor non-perception is peaceful and sublime.	This is the highest of the formless attainments. | “Stupor” is _sammoha_.

mn102:10.3	Some ascetics or brahmins assert the embracing of that dimension merely through the conditioned phenomena of what is able to be seen, heard, thought, and known. But that is said to be a disastrous approach.	The commentary resolves the compound _diṭṭhasutamutaviññātabba_ by applying the future passive participle _viññātabba_ to the preceding items: _diṭṭhaviññātabbamattena sutaviññātabbamattena mutaviññātabbamattena_. However the same phrase occurs at [sn35.95:10.1]() and [an4.24:7.5](), and in both cases the future passive sense is clearly meant to be distributed to each item. Thus it means “what is seeable, hearable, thinkable, and knowable”.
mn102:10.4	For that dimension is said to be not attainable by means of conditioned phenomena,	Cp. [sn14.11]().
mn102:10.5	but only with a residue of conditioned phenomena.	This “residue” is the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception itself.

mn102:11.2	Why is that?	NA
mn102:11.3	Because they think: ‘All of those ascetics and brahmins only assert their attachment to heading upstream:	For _uddhaṁ saraṁ_ (“heading upstream”) in the sense “heading for rebirth in a higher realm”, compare _uddhaṁsoto_ (“one who heads upstream”), a term for a non-returner.

mn102:12.4	“After death we shall be like this! After death we shall be like that!”’	NA
mn102:12.5	The Realized One understands this as follows.	NA
mn102:12.6	The ascetics and brahmins who assert the annihilation, eradication, and obliteration of an existing being; from fear and disgust with substantial reality, they just keep running and circling around substantial reality.	“Fear and disgust” is what in the second Noble Truth is called “craving for non-existence” (_vibhavataṇhā_). | “Substantial reality” (_sakkāya_) is the five aggregates that make up the three realms of existence, and which are grasped at as an “existing being” (_sato sattassa_).
mn102:12.7	Suppose a dog on a leash was tethered to a strong post or pillar. It would just keeping running and circling around that post or pillar.	_Sā_ (Sanskrit _śvan_) is a short form for “dog” (in masculine). This simile is also at [sn22.99:2.1]().
mn102:12.8	In the same way, those ascetics and brahmins, from fear and disgust with substantial reality, just keep running and circling around substantial reality.	NA
mn102:12.9	‘All that is conditioned and crude. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’	NA
mn102:12.10	Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.	NA
mn102:13.1	Whatever ascetics and brahmins speculate and theorize about the future, and propose various hypotheses concerning the future, all of them propose one or other of these five theses.	This statement seems misplaced here, as the introduction included “extinguishment in the present life” which has not yet been discussed. Probably it should occur further down, perhaps at [mn102:25.1]().
mn102:14.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past, and propose various hypotheses concerning the past. They propose the following, each insisting that theirs is the only truth and that everything else is wrong.	“Theories of the past” are not mentioned in the introduction. In the Brahmajālasutta, such theories are logically described *before* theories of the future. The theories of the past are similar to those of the Brahmajālasutta, but not identical, so they cannot have been simply copied over. These theories may have originally been mentioned in the introduction and listed at the start of the sutta, but displaced due to textual corruption. We have already seen in the preceding segment that corruption is likely at this point. Analayo discusses this issue in detail (*Comparative Study*, vol. ii, p. 597ff).
mn102:14.2	‘The self and the cosmos are eternal.’	See the four kinds of eternalism at [dn1:1.30.1](). | The phrase “self and cosmos” (_attā ca loko ca_) refers to the Upaniṣadic view, where the Self is ultimately a contingent aspect of the divinity that is the cosmos. That is why they occur together, as their nature and fate is inseparable. This is not true of other philosophies, as for example where a “soul” is created in a pre-existing universe, or when the universe is felt to be impermanent but the soul is eternal.
mn102:14.3	‘The self and the cosmos are not eternal.’	This implies that at some point in the past, the self and the world appeared, which the commentary equates with the two kinds of “origination by chance” of [dn1:2.30.1]().
mn102:14.4	‘The self and the cosmos are both eternal and not eternal.’	Compare the four kinds of “partial eternalism” ([dn1:2.1.1]()).
mn102:14.5	‘The self and the cosmos are neither eternal nor not eternal.’	The commentary suggests that these are the “endless flip-floppers” of [dn1:2.23.1](). That may be so, but they are characterized by the refusal to make a statement, whereas here we have a definite statement, even if the exact sense is unclear. As a rule, constructions of the “neither … nor” type point to a subtle state that does not fit a dualistic description. Perhaps it refers to a philosophy that words such as “eternal” are inadequate, because “eternal” means “live for an infinite time” whereas they believed in a destiny that transcends time.
mn102:14.6	‘The self and the cosmos are finite.’	These four views correspond to the same four “theories of the past” at [dn1:2.16.1](). In addition, all the following items in this list are “theories of the future” at [dn1:2.38.7](). Clearly it is possible to have similar views in relation to both the past and future. The classification of the finitude of the cosmos in relation to time seems puzzling, although in a relativistic universe time and distance are inextricably linked by the speed of light.
mn102:14.7	‘The self and the cosmos are infinite.’	NA
mn102:14.8	‘The self and the cosmos are both finite and infinite.’	NA

mn102:15.2	‘The self and the cosmos are eternal. This is the only truth, anything else is futile.’ It’s simply not possible for them to have personal knowledge of this that is pure and bright, apart from faith, endorsement, oral transmission, reasoned train of thought, or acceptance of a view after deliberation.	NA
mn102:15.3	But in the absence of personal knowledge that is pure and bright, even the portion of knowledge they illuminate is said to be grasping on their part.	The phrase “pure and bright” (_parisuddhe pariyodāte_) normally describes the fourth absorption. The argument here may be parsed as follows. Even in the highest form of consciousness it is not possible to directly know such things as whether the cosmos is infinite. Any such doctrine, therefore, must be inferred from experience through the five forms of unreliable knowledge starting with faith. They are therefore confidently asserting things of which they have no direct knowledge. Because of this, even the portion of genuine knowledge and insight their meditation has brought them is corrupted by attachment. | _Pariyodāta_ (“bright”) is glossed by the commentary as _pabhassara_ (“radiant”). But “brighten” doesn’t quite work here for the verbal form _pariyodapenti_, so I use “illuminate”.

mn102:17.1	Now, some ascetics and brahmins, letting go of theories about the past and the future, not fixating on the fetters of sensuality, enter and remain in the rapture of seclusion:	The following section illustrates how genuine experiences of deep meditation become misapprehended as “extinguishment in the present life”. It begins with a lengthy and unique description of the absorptions, before specifying how grasping intervenes. | The “rapture of seclusion” includes the first two absorptions, which are characterized by rapture (_pīti_).

Upon emerging from the bliss of absorption, the mind experiences anew all the flavors of life, including sadness. Typically a meditator is happy and refreshed for a long time after a deep meditation. Still, there can be a sense of loss of the blissful state, and a melancholy reflection that that too is impermanent.

The “pleasure not of the flesh” (_nirāmisaṁ sukhaṁ_) is the third absorption, characterized by the ending of rapture and the persistence of pleasure (_sukha_).

mn102:25.2	liberation by not grasping after truly understanding the six fields of contact’s origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape.”	The Brahmajālasutta also emphasizes how liberation from the “sixty-two” wrong views is achieved through insight into the “six fields of contact” ([dn13.71.12]()).
mn102:25.3	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn102:25.4	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA

mn103:0.2	Is This What You Think Of Me?	NA
mn103:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn103:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kusinārā, in the Forest of Offerings.	NA
mn103:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn103:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn103:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn103:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn103:2.1	“Mendicants, is this what you think of me?	NA
mn103:2.2	‘The ascetic Gotama teaches the Dhamma for the sake of robes, almsfood, lodgings, or rebirth in this or that state.’”	_Bhavābhava_ does not mean “existence and non-existence” but is a distributive compound, “this or that state of existence”. Indian religious texts are full of discussions about different heavens and hells. The Buddha’s goal is liberation, not rebirth in heaven.
mn103:2.3	“No sir, we don’t think of you that way.”	NA
mn103:2.4	NA	NA
mn103:2.5	“If you don’t think of me that way,	NA

mn103:2.10	‘The Buddha is sympathetic and wants what’s best for us.	NA
mn103:2.11	He teaches out of sympathy.’”	NA
mn103:2.12	“So it seems you think	NA
mn103:2.13	NA	NA
mn103:2.14	that I teach out of sympathy.	NA
mn103:3.1	In that case, each and every one of you should train in the things I have taught from my direct knowledge, that is:	NA
mn103:3.2	the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path. You should train in these things in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling.	These are the sets of practices later called the 37 _bodhiyapakkhiyā dhammā_, the “wings to awakening”. Here they are presented as an essential summary of the Buddha’s teachings. They form the backbone of the final book of the Saṁyuttanikāya, the Maggavagga (or Mahāvagga). It is likely that the Buddha was referring to the earliest recension of this text. They are found as a summary of the Buddha’s teachings at [dn16:3.50.5](), [dn29:17.3](), [mn104:5.3](), and [an8.19:17.2]() = [ud5.5:25.2]().
mn103:4.1	As you do so, it may happen that two mendicants disagree about the teaching.	NA
mn103:5.1	Now, you might think,	NA
mn103:5.2	‘These two venerables disagree on both the meaning and the phrasing.’ So you should approach whichever mendicant you think is most amenable and say to them:	“Meaning” is _attha_, the “purpose”, “goal”, or “benefit” of the teaching. “Phrasing is _byañjana_ (also spelled _vyañjana_), the “letter”, “syllable”, or “expression”, with the root sense of “differentiating”. Such passages show that concern for both aspects were present from the earliest times. | “Most amenable” is _suvacatara_, literally, “more easy to speak to”.
mn103:5.3	‘The venerables disagree on the meaning and the phrasing.	NA
mn103:5.4	But the venerables should know that this is how	NA

mn103:9.1	As you train in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, one of the mendicants might commit an offense or transgression.	Namely, a  transgression against the Monastic Code, the Vinaya. Such offences are a collective ethical standard that require other monastics to resolve, at least by hearing a confession.
mn103:10.1	In such a case, you should not be in a hurry to accuse them. The individual should be examined like this:	Vinaya is not meant to be applied legalistically or cruelly, but to uplift and reform. | Punctuation in Mahāsaṅgīti is incorrect. The following _iti_ belongs on this line, as shown in the repetition below.
mn103:10.2	‘I won’t be troubled and the other individual won’t be hurt, for they’re not irritable and acrimonious. They don’t hold fast to their views, but let them go easily. I can draw them away from the unskillful and establish them in the skillful.’	NA
mn103:10.3	If that’s what you think, then it’s appropriate to speak to them.	If the problem can be resolved without resorting to legal proceedings, it should.
mn103:11.1	But suppose you think this:	NA
mn103:11.2	‘I will be troubled and the other individual will be hurt, for they’re irritable and acrimonious. However, they don’t hold fast to their views, but let them go easily. I can draw them away from the unskillful and establish them in the skillful.	NA
mn103:11.3	But for the other individual to get hurt is a minor matter.	NA

mn103:14.3	Don’t underestimate the value of equanimity regarding such a person.	Wisdom knows that sometimes there is nothing to be done. That doesn’t mean one gives up, but rather, that sometimes patience is the best way. Note that this is the last option, however, and gentle intervention is always preferred.
mn103:15.1	As you train in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, the sides might continue to bring up settled issues with each other, with contempt for each other’s views, resentful, bitter, and exasperated.	Readings include _vacīsaṁsāro_, _vacīsaṁhāro_, and _vacīsaṅkhāro_. _Vacīsaṁsāro_ is found, without recorded variants, in the parallel passage at [an2.63:1.1](). The commentary here glosses with _vacanasañcāro_, while the subcommentary to AN 2.63 has _pavattamānā_, both of which support the dominant reading _vacīsaṁsāro_. Their explanations differ, however as the commentary here explains as spreading rumors from one place to another, while at AN 2.63 it is said to be ongoing arguing. Since the normal meaning of _saṁsāra_ is “endless ongoing”, and since, in both MN and AN, this follows a passage where disputes were supposed to have been settled, perhaps the sense is “continuing to bring up matters that have been settled”.
mn103:15.2	In this case you should approach whichever mendicant you think is most amenable among those who side with one party and say to them:	NA
mn103:15.3	‘Reverend, as we were training, the sides continued to bring up settled issues with each other. If the Ascetic knew about this, would he criticize it?’	NA

mn103:15.6	‘But without giving that up, reverend, can one realize extinguishment?’	NA
mn103:15.7	Answering rightly, the mendicant should say:	NA

mn103:17.1	If others should ask that mendicant:	NA
mn103:17.2	‘Were you the venerable who drew those mendicants away from the unskillful and established them in the skillful?’	NA
mn103:17.3	Answering rightly, the mendicant should say:	NA
mn103:17.4	‘Well, reverends, I approached the Buddha. He taught me the Dhamma. After hearing that teaching I explained it to those mendicants.	NA
mn103:17.5	When those mendicants heard that teaching they were drawn away from the unskillful and established in the skillful.’	NA
mn103:17.6	Answering in this way, that mendicant doesn’t glorify themselves or put others down. They answer in line with the teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism.”	NA
mn103:17.7	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn103:17.8	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn104:0.1	Middle Discourses 104	NA
mn104:0.2	At Sāmagāma	NA
mn104:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn104:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near the village of Sāma.	NA
mn104:2.1	Now at that time the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan had recently passed away at Pāvā.	When this event is mentioned at [dn29:1.3]() the Buddha is also in the Sakyan lands, but in a mango grove belonging to a group of Sakyans named Vedhaññā. Both texts tell the story of Cunda conveying the news via Ānanda at Sāma, which was presumably near the mango grove. It does seem strange that two distinct discourses are recorded from the same prompt, but then, why shouldn’t the Buddha give more than one teaching on such an important topic? At [dn33:1.6.1]() the Buddha is at Pāvā in the Mallian lands, and the discourse is spoken by Sāriputta there. Given the evident lateness of DN 33, this is a less convincing framework. A parallel to MN 104 (MA 196 at T i 752c12) says he was in the Vajjian lands at the time; both Sakya and Vajji border on Mallā.
mn104:2.2	With his passing the Jain ascetics split, dividing into two factions, arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words:	While this description of the Jains might seem like sheer sectarian calumny, it is a fact that the Jain tradition is split into two sects, the “sky-clad” Digambara, whose male ascetics went naked, and the “white-clad” Śvetāmbara who wear an unstitched cloth. Jain tradition holds that the split occurred about a century later, in the reign of Candragupta Maurya.
mn104:2.3	“You don’t understand this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training? You’re practicing wrong. I’m practicing right. I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!”	NA
mn104:2.4	You’d think there was nothing but slaughter going on among the Jain ascetics.	A slight on the movement whose signature virtue was non-violence.
mn104:2.5	And the Jain Ñātika’s white-clothed lay disciples were disillusioned, dismayed, and disappointed in the Jain ascetics. They were equally disappointed with a teaching and training so poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha, with broken monument and without a refuge.	“With broken monument” (_bhinnathupe_) is used only in this context. When a great teacher or leader died, a “monument” was built to keep their memory alive. The breaking of a monument—whether physical or symbolic—was, in a way, truly killing them.
mn104:3.1	And then, after completing the rainy season residence near Pāvā, the novice Cunda went to see Venerable Ānanda at Sāma village. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	Cunda took the time to complete his rains residence before conveying the news, reminding us of the speed with which news traveled in those days—slowly. For Cunda’s identity, see the note to [mn8:2.1]() | Apart from the events described here, we hear of Sāma only once ([an6.21]()). The topic there is the decline of the Saṅgha, hinting at a connection with these events.

mn104:4.2	“Reverend Cunda, we should see the Buddha about this matter.	NA
mn104:4.3	Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this.”	NA
mn104:4.4	“Yes, sir,” replied Cunda.	NA
mn104:4.5	Then Ānanda and Cunda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and Ānanda informed him of what Cunda had said. He went on to say,	NA

mn104:4.11	For such a dispute would be for the detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans.’”	NA
mn104:5.1	“What do you think, Ānanda?	NA
mn104:5.2	Do you see even two mendicants whose opinion differs regarding the things I have taught from my direct knowledge, that is,	Two brahmins have a “difference of opinion” (_nānāvāda_) regarding their path at [dn13:8.8]().

mn104:5.4	“No, sir, I do not.	NA
mn104:5.5	NA	NA
mn104:5.6	Nevertheless, there are some individuals who appear to live obedient to the Buddha, but when the Buddha has passed away they might create a dispute in the Saṅgha regarding livelihood or the monastic code.	As in the quarrel at Kosambī ([mn48](), [pli-tv-kd10]()).
mn104:5.7	Such a dispute would be for the detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans.”	NA
mn104:5.8	“Ānanda, dispute about livelihood or the monastic code is a minor matter.	Just as the “phrasing” of the text is a minor matter at [mn103:7.12]().
mn104:5.9	But should a dispute arise in the Saṅgha concerning the path or the practice, that would be for the detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans.	This refers back to the teachings the Buddha has summarized above.
mn104:6.1	Ānanda, there are these six roots of arguments.	The Buddha is more concerned with the unskillful roots of division than with the surface details. The first four pairs of “roots” are also found as “corruptions of mind” at [mn7:3.1]().
mn104:6.2	What six?	NA
mn104:6.3	Firstly, a mendicant is irritable and acrimonious.	NA
mn104:6.4	Such a mendicant lacks respect and reverence for the teacher, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and they don’t fulfill the training.	NA
mn104:6.5	They create a dispute in the Saṅgha, which is for the detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans.	NA
mn104:6.6	If you see such a root of arguments in yourselves or others, you should try to give up this bad thing.	NA
mn104:6.7	If you don’t see it, you should practice so that it doesn’t come up in the future.	NA
mn104:6.8	That’s how to give up this bad root of arguments, so it doesn’t come up in the future.	NA
mn104:7-11.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is offensive and contemptuous …	NA
mn104:7-11.2	They’re jealous and stingy …	NA
mn104:7-11.3	They’re devious and deceitful …	NA
mn104:7-11.4	They have corrupt wishes and wrong view …	NA
mn104:7-11.5	They’re attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go.	NA
mn104:7-11.6	Such a mendicant lacks respect and reverence for the teacher, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and they don’t fulfill the training.	NA
mn104:7-11.7	They create a dispute in the Saṅgha, which is for the detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans.	NA
mn104:7-11.8	If you see such a root of arguments in yourselves or others, you should try to give up this bad thing.	NA

mn104:7-11.10	That’s how to give up this bad root of arguments, so it doesn’t come up in the future.	NA
mn104:7-11.11	These are the six roots of arguments.	NA
mn104:12.1	There are four kinds of disciplinary issues.	NA
mn104:12.2	What four?	NA
mn104:12.3	Disciplinary issues due to disputes, accusations, offenses, or business.	These are formal legal proceedings in the Vinaya, explained at [pli-tv-kd14:14.2.1](). | Here and below I follow the renderings of Brahmali for legal terms.
mn104:12.4	These are the four kinds of disciplinary issues.	NA
mn104:13.1	There are seven methods for the settlement of any disciplinary issues that might arise.	Explained in more detail in the Vinaya ([pli-tv-kd14:14.16.1]()).
mn104:13.2	Resolution face-to-face to be applied. Resolution through recollection to be granted. Resolution because of past insanity to be granted. Acting according to what has been admitted. Majority decision. Further penalty. Covering over as if with grass.	NA
mn104:14.1	And how is there resolution face-to-face?	NA
mn104:14.2	It’s when mendicants are disputing: ‘This is the teaching,’ ‘This is not the teaching,’ ‘This is the monastic law,’ ‘This is not the monastic law.’	NA
mn104:14.3	Those mendicants should all sit together in harmony	NA
mn104:14.4	and thoroughly go over the guidelines of the teaching.	_Samanumajjati_ occurs only here. The root _majj_ has the general sense “stroke, massage”. Here it means that they should go over and over until it is settled. | _Dhammanetti_ (“the guidelines of the teaching”) is another rare term, occurring elsewhere only in the late canonical [mil6.3.12:7.5]().
mn104:14.5	They should settle that disciplinary issue in agreement with the guidelines.	NA
mn104:14.6	That’s how there is resolution face-to-face.	NA
mn104:14.7	And that’s how certain disciplinary issues are settled, that is,	NA
mn104:14.8	by resolution face-to-face.	NA
mn104:15.1	And how is there majority decision?	This explanation is out of order, as it is listed as the second item here, but it is normally the fifth item, as in the summary above.
mn104:15.2	If those mendicants are not able to settle that issue in that monastery,	Normally issues are settled by consensus, so this applies in cases where consensus cannot be reached.
mn104:15.3	they should go to another monastery with more mendicants.	NA
mn104:15.4	There they should all sit together in harmony	NA

mn104:15.8	by majority decision.	NA
mn104:16.1	And how is there resolution through recollection?	NA
mn104:16.2	It’s when mendicants accuse a mendicant of a serious offense; one entailing expulsion, or close to it:	NA
mn104:16.3	‘Venerable, do you recall committing the kind of serious offense that entails expulsion or close to it?’	NA
mn104:16.4	They say:	NA
mn104:16.5	‘No, reverends, I don’t recall committing such an offense.’	The Vinaya operates on good faith, so that the testimony of a clear-headed mendicant is sufficient to clear them from offences in most cases.
mn104:16.6	The resolution through recollection should be granted to them.	NA
mn104:16.7	That’s how there is the resolution through recollection. And that’s how certain disciplinary issues are settled, that is,	NA
mn104:16.8	by resolution through recollection.	NA
mn104:17.1	And how is there resolution because of past insanity?	NA
mn104:17.2	It’s when a mendicant accuses a mendicant of the kind of serious offense that entails expulsion, or close to it:	The offenses entailing expulsion for a mendicant are: willingly engaging in sexual intercourse; intentional killing of a human being; theft of something of value; and deliberately making a false claim to exalted spiritual attainments such as awakening or absorption. | Pali editions vary as to whether the accuser is singular or plural. However, even those editions that use the plural here (Mahāsaṅgīti, PTS) shift to singular below ([mn104:17.6](), [mn104:19.2]()), while in the Vinaya it is also singular ([pli-tv-kd14:14.29.7]()).
mn104:17.3	‘Venerable, do you recall committing the kind of serious offense that entails expulsion or close to it?’	NA
mn104:17.4	They say:	NA
mn104:17.5	‘No, reverend, I don’t recall committing such an offense.’	NA
mn104:17.6	But though they try to get out of it, the mendicant pursues the issue:	NA
mn104:17.7	‘Surely the venerable must know perfectly well if you recall committing an offense that entails expulsion or close to it!’	NA
mn104:17.8	They say:	NA
mn104:17.9	‘Reverend, I had gone mad, I was out of my mind.	NA
mn104:17.10	And while I was mad I did and said many things that are not proper for an ascetic.	NA
mn104:17.11	I don’t remember any of that,	NA
mn104:17.12	I was mad when I did it.’	This evidently refers to an episode of psychosis, during which time a person is subject to hallucinations and delusions, and may exhibit bizarre behavior. There is a blanket exemption in Vinaya for all acts committed in such a state.
mn104:17.13	The resolution because of past insanity should be granted to them.	NA
mn104:17.14	That’s how there is resolution because of past insanity. And that’s how certain disciplinary issues are settled, that is,	NA
mn104:17.15	by resolution because of past insanity.	NA
mn104:18.1	And how is there acting according to what has been admitted?	NA
mn104:18.2	It’s when a mendicant, whether accused or not, recalls an offense and clarifies it and reveals it.	NA
mn104:18.3	After approaching a more senior mendicant, that mendicant should arrange his robe over one shoulder, bow to that mendicant’s feet, squat on their heels, raise their joined palms, and say:	This is the standard way of clearing offenses by confessing them as soon as they are recalled and recognized. Mendicants still confess with this formula today. Most offenses can be cleared in this way, but others require the relinquishment of a certain object (such as money), or undergoing a period of probation, while expulsion offenses cannot be cleared.
mn104:18.4	‘Sir, I have fallen into such-and-such an offense. I confess it.’	NA
mn104:18.5	The senior mendicant says:	NA
mn104:18.6	‘Do you see it?’	NA
mn104:18.7	‘Yes, I see it.’	NA
mn104:18.8	‘Then restrain yourself in future.’	NA
mn104:18.9	‘I shall restrain myself.’	NA
mn104:18.10	That’s how there is acting according to what has been admitted. And that’s how certain disciplinary issues are settled, that is,	NA
mn104:18.11	by acting according to what has been admitted.	NA
mn104:19.1	And how is there a verdict of further penalty?	“Further penalty” renders _tassapāpiyasikā_, more literally “what is worse for him”. In this case, a mendicant tries to deny the accusation but ends up just making it worse.
mn104:19.2	It’s when a mendicant accuses a mendicant of the kind of serious offense that entails expulsion, or close to it:	NA
mn104:19.3	‘Venerable, do you recall committing the kind of serious offense that entails expulsion or close to it?’	NA
mn104:19.4	They say:	NA
mn104:19.5	‘No, reverends, I don’t recall committing such an offense.’	NA
mn104:19.6	But though they try to get out of it, the mendicants pursue the issue:	Normally the mendicant’s denial is sufficient, but the case might be pressed if there is substantial evidence.
mn104:19.7	‘Surely the venerable must know perfectly well if you recall committing an offense that entails expulsion or close to it!’	NA
mn104:19.8	They say:	NA
mn104:19.9	‘Reverends, I don’t recall committing a serious offense of that nature.	NA
mn104:19.10	But I do recall committing a light offense.’	NA
mn104:19.11	But though they try to get out of it, the mendicants pursue the issue:	NA
mn104:19.12	‘Surely the venerable must know perfectly well if you recall committing an offense that entails expulsion or close to it!’	NA
mn104:19.13	They say:	NA
mn104:19.14	‘Reverends, I’ll go so far as to acknowledge this light offense even when not asked.	NA
mn104:19.15	Why wouldn’t I acknowledge a serious offense when asked?’	NA

mn104:19.21	I spoke too hastily when I said	NA
mn104:19.22	that I didn’t recall it.’	NA
mn104:19.23	That’s how there is further penalty. And that’s how certain disciplinary issues are settled, that is,	NA
mn104:19.24	by further penalty.	NA
mn104:20.1	And how is there the covering over as if with grass?	NA
mn104:20.2	It’s when the mendicants continually argue, quarrel, and dispute, doing and saying many things that are not proper for an ascetic.	NA
mn104:20.3	Those mendicants should all sit together in harmony.	NA
mn104:20.4	A competent mendicant of one party, having got up from their seat, arranged their robe over one shoulder, and raised their joined palms, should inform the Saṅgha:	NA
mn104:20.5	‘Sir, let the Saṅgha listen to me.	NA
mn104:20.6	We have been continually arguing, quarreling, and disputing, doing and saying many things that are not proper for an ascetic.	NA
mn104:20.7	If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, then—for the benefit of these venerables and myself—I disclose in the middle of the Saṅgha by means of covering over as if with grass any offenses committed by these venerables and by myself, excepting only those that are gravely blameworthy and those connected with laypeople.’	NA
mn104:20.8	Then a competent mendicant of the other party, having got up from their seat, arranged their robe over one shoulder, and raising their joined palms, should inform the Saṅgha:	NA
mn104:20.9	‘Sir, let the Saṅgha listen to me.	NA
mn104:20.10	We have been continually arguing, quarreling, and disputing, doing and saying many things that are not proper for an ascetic.	NA
mn104:20.11	If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, then—for the benefit of these venerables and myself—I disclose in the middle of the Saṅgha by means of covering over as if with grass any offenses committed by these venerables and by myself, excepting only those that are gravely blameworthy and those connected with laypeople.’	Those that are “gravely blameworthy” include offenses of expulsion (_pārājika_) and suspension (_saṅghādisesa_), while those “connected with laypeople” include cases where the mendicant abuses the laity.
mn104:20.12	That’s how there is the covering over as if with grass. And that’s how certain disciplinary issues are settled, that is,	This final method is a reminder that it is not always necessary to dig down to the bottom of every dispute, especially when blame accrues to both sides. Sometimes the most important thing is to move forward.

mn104:21.1	Ānanda, these six warm-hearted qualities make for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.	Also taught at [mn48:6.2](), [an6.11:1.1](), and [an6.12:1.1](), and collected at [dn33:2.2.37]() and [dn34:1.7.3]().

mn104:21.10	This too is a warm-hearted quality.	NA
mn104:21.11	Furthermore, a mendicant lives according to the precepts shared with their spiritual companions, both in public and in private. Those precepts are intact, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.	NA
mn104:21.12	This too is a warm-hearted quality.	NA
mn104:21.13	Furthermore, a mendicant lives according to the view shared with their spiritual companions, both in public and in private. That view is noble and emancipating, and delivers one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering.	NA
mn104:21.14	This too is a warm-hearted quality.	NA
mn104:21.15	These six warm-hearted qualities make for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.	NA

mn105:2.1	Now at that time several mendicants had declared their enlightenment in the Buddha’s presence:	Also at [sn12.70:4.1](), which concerns the dubious ordination of the wanderer Susīma. | “Enlightenment” is _aññā_, a technical term that refers to the knowledge of perfection (_arahattā_). | A Buddhist mendicant incurs a penalty of expulsion if they deliberately lay false claim to awakening ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4]()), and a penalty of confession if they truthfully claim awakening to someone who is not ordained ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8]()). These rules directly concern laying claim regarding oneself, but the background stories apply when making claims with regards to another. Mendicants may declare their attainments among the community of monks and nuns who are fully ordained. Typically such a solemn matter is spoken of in a formal and respectful manner with one’s teacher.
mn105:2.2	“We understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’”	NA
mn105:2.3	Sunakkhatta the Licchavi heard about this.	This is apparently Sunakkhatta’s first meeting with the Buddha. In [dn6:5.3]() we learn that, after being ordained three years, he spoke of his limited success in meditation. [mn12]() and [dn24]() deal with his bitter criticisms of the Buddha shortly after his disrobal.

mn105:4.5	I trust they did so rightly—or are there some who declared enlightenment out of overestimation?”	By a loophole in the wording of the Vinaya, it is not an offence to tell anyone of your attainments if you are genuinely deluded and falsely believe that you have an attainment that you do not have. The Buddha dismissed such “overestimation” (_adhimāna_) as “negligible” ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:2.1]()).

They don’t associate with that kind of person, and they don’t find it satisfying.	The “imperturbable” refers to high meditative attainments, typically the fourth absorption and above.

mn105:9.12	‘That individual is intent on pleasures of the flesh, for they’re detached from things connected with the imperturbable.’	The reading _āneñjasaṁyojanena hi kho visaṁyutto_ is problematic, as it suggests they are free of the fetter of the imperturbable, which would mean they are an arahant. Several manuscripts omit this phrase, but it is glossed in the commentary. I think it harks back to the immediately prior _āneñjapaṭisaṁyuttāya_; possibly the _paṭi_ dropped out in an old misreading. They’re not detached from the “fetter” of the imperturbable, but from “what is connected with” the imperturbable, i.e. they are disinterested in the talk about it.

mn105:18.4	Having such conceit, though it’s not based in fact,	NA

mn105:19.3	The surgeon would cut open the wound with a scalpel,	NA
mn105:19.4	probe for the arrow,	NA
mn105:19.5	extract it, and expel the poison, leaving some residue behind.	The term _saupādisesa_ is better known as a description of those who have attained Nibbana “with residue”, namely the five aggregates that persist so long as life lasts. The prefix _upādi_ is usually taken as derived from _upādāna_, normally “grasping”, but here in its secondary sense of “material cause, fuel”. The “residue” of poison is the material cause of potential harm, just as the five aggregates still entail a residue of physical suffering for a perfected one.
mn105:19.6	Imagining that no residue remained, the surgeon would say:	For “imagining that no residue remained”, I follow PTS and Siamese editions, which have _anupādiseso ti maññamāno_. Bodhi’s note 1003 to his *Middle Length Discourses* points out that earlier manuscripts support this reading, which seems to have been “corrected” to _saupādisesoti jānamāno_ in the Burmese Sixth Council edition on which SuttaCentral’s Mahāsaṅgīti edition is based. A Sanskrit fragment also supports the PTS/Siamese reading: _(sā)va(ś)eṣaṁ nira(vaśe)ṣaṁ (iti manyamānaḥ)_ (SHT IV 500 folio 3V3, cited in Analayo, *Comparative Study*, p. 611, note 136).
mn105:19.7	‘My good man, the dart has been extracted and the poison expelled without residue.	NA
mn105:19.8	It is still capable of harming you.	Most editions have “not capable” of harming here, which seems odd given that the doctor immediately goes on to describe how to mitigate possible harm. I follow the PTS edition, which is alone in reading _alañ ca te antarāyāya_. This is supported by a Sanskrit fragment, which reads _ala(ṁ)te-t(r)-ānta(rā)yāya_ (SHT IV 500 folio 3V4, cited in Analayo, ibid.).
mn105:19.9	Eat only suitable food. Don’t eat unsuitable food, or else the wound may get infected.	NA
mn105:19.10	Regularly wash the wound and anoint the opening, or else it’ll get covered with pus and blood.	NA
mn105:19.11	Don’t walk too much in the wind and sun, or else dust and dirt will infect the wound.	NA
mn105:19.12	Take care of the wound, my good fellow, heal it.’	NA
mn105:20.1	They’d think:	NA
mn105:20.2	‘The dart has been extracted and the poison expelled with no residue.	NA
mn105:20.3	It’s not capable of harming me.’	Pali editions all agree that the patient thinks it cannot cause harm, which, if we adopt the PTS reading as I have above, implies that the patient misunderstood the doctor’s instructions. A Sanskrit fragment says that he did understand that it could cause harm, suggesting that he did what was unsuitable despite knowing this: _niravaśeṣaḥ a(panīto) viṣa-doṣaḥ alaṁ (me-tr)-ān(ta)rā(yāya)_ (SHT IV 500 folio 3R3, cited in Analayo, ibid.). I don’t follow this as it is not found in any Pali edition.
mn105:20.4	They’d eat unsuitable food, and the wound would get infected.	NA
mn105:20.5	And they wouldn’t regularly wash and anoint the opening, so it would get covered in pus and blood.	NA

mn105:20.7	And they wouldn’t take care of the wound or heal it.	NA
mn105:20.8	Then both because they did what was unsuitable, and because of the residue of unclean poison, the wound would spread,	NA
mn105:20.9	resulting in death or deadly pain.	NA
mn105:21.1	In the same way, it’s possible that a certain mendicant might think:	NA

mn105:21.4	Having such conceit, though it’s not based in fact,	NA
mn105:21.5	they would engage in things unconducive to extinguishment: unsuitable sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and ideas.	NA
mn105:21.6	Doing so, lust infects their mind,	NA
mn105:21.7	resulting in death or deadly pain.	NA
mn105:22.1	For it is death in the training of the Noble One to reject the training and return to a lesser life.	NA
mn105:22.2	And it is deadly pain to commit one of the corrupt offenses.	NA
mn105:23.1	It’s possible that a certain mendicant might think:	NA

mn105:23.3	I have given up the dart of craving and expelled the poison of ignorance; I am rightly intent on extinguishment.’	NA
mn105:23.4	Being rightly intent on extinguishment, they wouldn’t engage in things unconducive to extinguishment: unsuitable sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and ideas.	NA
mn105:23.5	Doing so, lust wouldn’t infect their mind,	NA
mn105:23.6	so no death or deadly pain would result.	NA
mn105:24.1	Suppose a man was struck by an arrow thickly smeared with poison.	NA
mn105:24.2	Their friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would get a surgeon to treat them.	NA
mn105:24.3	The surgeon would cut open the wound with a scalpel,	NA
mn105:24.4	probe for the arrow,	NA
mn105:24.5	extract it, and expel the poison, leaving no residue behind.	NA
mn105:24.6	Knowing that no residue remained, the surgeon would say:	NA
mn105:24.7	‘My good man, the dart has been extracted and the poison expelled with no residue.	NA
mn105:24.8	It’s not capable of harming you.	NA
mn105:24.9	Eat only suitable food. Don’t eat unsuitable food, or else the wound may get infected.	NA
mn105:24.10	Regularly wash the wound and anoint the opening, or else it’ll get covered with pus and blood.	NA
mn105:24.11	Don’t walk too much in the wind and sun, or else dust and dirt will infect the wound.	NA
mn105:24.12	Take care of the wound, my good fellow, heal it.’	NA
mn105:25.1	They’d think:	NA
mn105:25.2	‘The dart has been extracted and the poison expelled with no residue.	NA
mn105:25.3	It’s not capable of harming me.’	NA
mn105:25.4	They’d eat suitable food, and the wound wouldn’t get infected.	NA

mn105:25.7	And they’d take care of the wound and heal it.	NA
mn105:25.8	Then both because they did what was suitable, and the unclean poison had left no residue, the wound would heal,	NA
mn105:25.9	and no death or deadly pain would result.	NA
mn105:26.1	In the same way, it’s possible that a certain mendicant might think:	NA

mn105:27.1	I’ve made up this simile to make a point.	NA
mn105:27.2	And this is the point:	NA
mn105:27.3	‘Wound’ is a term for the six interior sense fields.	NA
mn105:27.4	‘Poison’ is a term for ignorance.	NA
mn105:27.5	‘Dart’ is a term for craving.	NA
mn105:27.6	‘Probing’ is a term for mindfulness.	NA
mn105:27.7	‘Scalpel’ is a term for noble wisdom.	NA
mn105:27.8	‘Surgeon’ is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn105:28.1	Truly, Sunakkhatta, that mendicant practices restraint regarding the six fields of contact.	NA
mn105:28.2	Understanding that attachment is the root of suffering, they are freed with the ending of attachments. It’s not possible that they would apply their body or interest their mind in any attachment.	“Attachment” here is _upadhi_, which is both the things of the world to which we cling, and the inner clinging. The Jains defined _upadhi_ similarly (Tattvārthasūtra 9.26). The dominant meaning in Sanskrit is “fraud”, which perhaps informs the Buddhist sense.
mn105:29.1	Suppose there was a bronze goblet of beverage that had a nice color, aroma, and flavor.	NA
mn105:29.2	But it was mixed with poison.	NA
mn105:29.3	Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain.	NA
mn105:29.4	What do you think, Sunakkhatta?	NA
mn105:29.5	Would that person drink that beverage if they knew that	NA
mn105:29.6	it would result in death or deadly suffering?”	NA
mn105:29.7	“No, sir.”	NA
mn105:29.8	“In the same way, Sunakkhatta, that mendicant practices restraint regarding the six fields of contact.	NA

mn105:30.9	NA	NA
mn105:30.10	That is what the Buddha said.	NA

mn106:0.1	Middle Discourses 106	NA
mn106:0.2	Conducive to the Imperturbable	NA
mn106:1.1	So I have heard.	This sutta describes practices that lead to attaining the formless meditations: three ways to attain the “imperturbable”, three ways to continue to the dimension of nothingness, and finally a way to attain neither perception nor non-perception. One theme of the text is that deep states of absorption are supported by reflective wisdom. The sutta concludes by teaching what is beyond all these, namely not grasping.
mn106:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma.	NA
mn106:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn106:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn106:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn106:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn106:2.1	“Mendicants, sensual pleasures are impermanent, hollow, false, and deceptive.	NA
mn106:2.2	This is made by illusion, mendicants, lamented by fools.	This phrase is sometimes translated as if it was joined to the previous. However, the repeated use of _bhikkhave_, the shift from plural to singular, and the independent occurrence of the former portion ([an10.46:6.5]()) all suggest it is a distinct sentence. | As for _bālalāpana_, at [sn22.95:13.2]() we find _bālalāpinī_ in a similar context, which there follows right after the death of the physical body. This suggests that _lāpinī_ there has the sense “lament” which is attested in Sanskrit. _Bālalāpana_ is found at [thig5.2:2.2]() of a beautiful body; see too [ja421:5.3](). In later Sanskrit, _bālalapitaṁ_ is used by Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa in his Tattvopaplavasiṁha in the sense “prattle of fools”.
mn106:2.3	Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come,	NA
mn106:2.4	sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come;	NA
mn106:2.5	both of these are Māra’s dominion, Māra’s domain, Māra’s lair, and Māra’s range.	NA
mn106:2.6	They conduce to bad, unskillful qualities such as desire, ill will, and aggression.	NA
mn106:2.7	And they create an obstacle for a noble disciple training here.	NA
mn106:3.1	A noble disciple reflects on this:	NA
mn106:3.2	‘Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come,	NA
mn106:3.3	sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come;	NA
mn106:3.4	both of these are Māra’s dominion, Māra’s domain, Māra’s lair, and Māra’s range.	NA
mn106:3.5	They conduce to bad, unskillful qualities such as desire, ill will, and aggression.	NA
mn106:3.6	And they create an obstacle for a noble disciple training here.	NA
mn106:3.7	Why don’t I meditate with an abundant, expansive heart, having mastered the world and stabilized the mind?	NA
mn106:3.8	Then I will have no more bad, unskillful qualities such as desire, ill will, and aggression.	NA
mn106:3.9	And by giving them up my mind, no longer limited, will become limitless and well developed.’	NA
mn106:3.10	Practicing in this way and meditating on it often their mind becomes confident in this dimension.	NA
mn106:3.11	Being confident, they either attain the imperturbable now, or are freed by wisdom.	The Pali has _paññāya vā adhimuccati_ (“they resolve with wisdom”). This appears to be an old confusion between _adhimuccati_ (“resolves”) and _vimuccati_ (“is freed”). Elsewhere in Pali we find one who is “freed by wisdom” (eg. [sn22.45:1.6]()) but we don’t find _adhimuccati_ used in this way. The commentary accepts the reading _adhimuccati_, but explains it as referring to either the realization of arahantship or the development of the path to arahantship, which agrees with the idea of “freedom”. Finally, the Chinese parallel (MA 75 at T i 542b23) has <span lang='lzh'>解</span>, while the Tibetan parallel in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya (D (4094) mngon pa, ju 228a2) has _rnam par grol ba_, both of which appear to translate _vimuccati_. If this reading is accepted, it also adds greater coherence to the sutta as a whole, for after discussing the various ways to the imperturbable, the final section is devoted to the “noble liberation”, where _vimokkha_ is a synonym of _vimutti_ ([mn106:13.3]()).
mn106:3.12	When their body breaks up, after death, it’s possible that that conducive consciousness will be reborn in the imperturbable.	_Saṁvattanika_ means “conducive, leading to”. The 
 state of consciousness developed in meditation leads to a rebirth in a plane where the normal level of consciousness is that of the corresponding meditation attainment. Thus if they have developed the fourth absorption, they will be reborn in a corresponding Brahmā realm.
mn106:3.13	This is said to be the first way of practice suitable for attaining the imperturbable.	NA
mn106:4.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:	NA
mn106:4.2	‘Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come,	NA

mn106:5.3	sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come,	NA
mn106:5.4	visions in this life and in lives to come,	Here _rūpa_ is neither “matter” nor “sights” but “visions” seen in meditation.
mn106:5.5	perceptions of visions in this life and in lives to come;	NA

mn106:5.11	This is said to be the third way of practice suitable for attaining the imperturbable.	NA
mn106:6.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:	NA

mn106:6.7	all are perceptions.	NA
mn106:6.8	Where they cease without anything left over, that is peaceful, that is sublime,	NA
mn106:6.9	namely the dimension of nothingness.’	As in [mn105:12.3](), the “imperturbable” here appears to refer to the fourth absorption and first two formless attainments.

mn106:6.11	Being confident, they either attain the dimension of nothingness now, or are freed by wisdom.	NA

mn106:6.13	This is said to be the first way of practice suitable for attaining the dimension of nothingness.	NA
mn106:7.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this:	NA
mn106:7.2	‘This is empty of a self or what belongs to a self.’	NA
mn106:7.3	Practicing in this way and meditating on it often their mind becomes confident in this dimension.	NA

mn106:8.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:	NA
mn106:8.2	‘I don’t belong to anyone anywhere! And nothing belongs to me anywhere!’	This reflection occurs three times in the Pali. At [an4.185:7.2]() it leads to the dimension of nothingness for a brahmin. It leads to the same attainment in a Buddhist context here (compare [an5.144:7.2]()). At [an3.70:3.11]() it is said to be a Jain practice.

mn106:9.13	This is said to be the way of practice suitable for attaining the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.”	NA
mn106:10.1	When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha:	NA
mn106:10.2	“Sir, take a mendicant who practices like this:	NA
mn106:10.3	‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine. I am giving up what exists, what has come to be.’	See Bodhi’s extensive discussion in his translation of [sn22.55:1.3]() (*Connected Discourses*, vol. iii, note 75). This formula appears several times throughout the suttas, in two forms: the personal form used by non-Buddhists  (“I might not be …”, eg. [sn22.81:12.8](), [an10.29:19.1]()), and the impersonal form as adapted by the Buddha here (“It might not be …”). The formula seems to have a shared among different sectarian groups, like the similar reflection above ([mn106:8.2](). But whereas that reflection is associated with Brahmans and Jains—both classified as “eternalists”—this view is said to be that of the “annihilationists” ([sn22.81:11.10]()).
mn106:10.4	In this way they gain equanimity.	NA
mn106:10.5	Would that mendicant become extinguished or not?”	NA
mn106:10.6	“One such mendicant might become extinguished, Ānanda, while another might not.”	NA
mn106:10.7	“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason for this?”	NA
mn106:10.8	“Ānanda, take a mendicant who practices like this:	NA
mn106:10.9	‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine. I am giving up what exists, what has come to be.’	NA
mn106:10.10	In this way they gain equanimity.	NA
mn106:10.11	They approve, welcome, and keep clinging to that equanimity.	NA
mn106:10.12	Their consciousness has that as support and fuel for grasping.	NA
mn106:10.13	A mendicant with fuel for grasping does not become extinguished.”	NA
mn106:11.1	“But sir, what is that mendicant grasping?”	NA
mn106:11.2	“The dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.”	NA
mn106:11.3	“Sir, it seems that mendicant is grasping the best thing to grasp!”	NA
mn106:11.4	“Indeed, Ānanda.	NA
mn106:11.5	For the best thing to grasp is	NA
mn106:11.6	the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	NA
mn106:12.1	Take a mendicant who practices like this:	NA
mn106:12.2	‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine. I am giving up what exists, what has come to be.’	NA
mn106:12.3	In this way they gain equanimity.	NA
mn106:12.4	They don’t approve, welcome, or keep clinging to that equanimity.	NA
mn106:12.5	So their consciousness doesn’t have that as support and fuel for grasping.	NA
mn106:12.6	A mendicant free of grasping becomes extinguished.”	NA
mn106:13.1	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	NA
mn106:13.2	It seems the Buddha has explained to us how to cross over the flood by relying on one support or another.	This passage shows how the method of attaining such states is secondary, as one might practice it well and yet still have clinging. Any of these “supports”, i.e. the various methods taught above, suffices to develop the mind, but what matters is letting go. | “One support or another” (_nissāya nissāya_) appears at [dn16:4.27.2](), where it means “right beside”. For the sense “support” in this context, compare [iti107:2.3](): “supporting each other … in order to cross over the flood” (_aññamaññaṁ nissāya …  oghassa nittharaṇatthāya_).
mn106:13.3	But sir, what is noble liberation?”	NA
mn106:13.4	“Ānanda, it’s when a noble disciple reflects like this:	NA
mn106:13.5	‘Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come,	NA
mn106:13.6	sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come,	NA
mn106:13.7	visions in this life and in lives to come,	NA
mn106:13.8	perceptions of visions in this life and in lives to come,	NA
mn106:13.9	perceptions of the imperturbable, perceptions of the dimension of nothingness, perceptions of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception;	NA
mn106:13.10	that is substantial reality as far as substantial reality extends.	NA
mn106:13.11	But this is freedom from death, namely the liberation of the mind through not grasping.	NA
mn106:14.1	So, Ānanda, I have taught the ways of practice suitable for attaining the imperturbable, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. I have taught how to cross the flood by relying on one support or another, and I have taught noble liberation.	NA
mn106:15.1	Out of sympathy, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples.	NA
mn106:15.2	Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, Ānanda! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.”	NA
mn106:15.3	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn106:15.4	Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn107:0.1	Middle Discourses 107	NA
mn107:0.2	With Moggallāna the Accountant	NA
mn107:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn107:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.	NA
mn107:1.3	Then the brahmin Moggallāna the Accountant went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn107:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:	NA
mn107:2.1	“Worthy Gotama, in this stilt longhouse we can see gradual progress	NA
mn107:2.2	down to the last step of the staircase.	The Buddha stops on the last step at [mn85:7.4]().
mn107:2.3	Among the brahmins we can see gradual progress	NA
mn107:2.4	in recitation.	Memorizing the Vedic texts, a key skill of the brahmins, was so difficult that they sometimes asked the Buddha for advice ([an5.193:8.4]()). Details on the gradual memorization of texts are found at [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc4:2.1.7](). Texts were learned by line (teacher and student start and finish together), by going after the line (one starts, they finish together), by going after the syllable (the teacher prompts with the first syllable of the line), and by phrase (the teacher says the first phrase, the student the second).
mn107:2.5	Among archers we can see gradual progress	NA
mn107:2.6	in archery.	Archery (_issattha_) is regularly listed as a craft or livelihood ([mn14:7.3]()), which took skill in training ([sn56.45:1.3]()), and to which a mendicant is compared ([an4.196:10.3]()).
mn107:2.7	Among us accountants, who earn a living by accounting, we can see gradual progress	NA
mn107:2.8	in mathematics.	The complexities of accounting are detailed in Kauṭilya’s Arthaśāstra 2.7. There, the “accounts” are called _gāṇanikya_ (2.7.16).
mn107:2.9	For when we get an apprentice we first make them count:	NA
mn107:2.10	‘One one, two twos, three threes, four fours, five fives, six sixes, seven sevens, eight eights, nine nines, ten tens.’	The method of listing things up to tens is the framework of the Dasuttarasutta ([dn34]()). More generally, it seems to underlie the “_aṅguttara_ principle” of organizing teachings by number.
mn107:2.11	We even make them count up to a hundred.	NA
mn107:2.12	Is it possible to similarly describe a gradual training, gradual progress, and gradual practice in this teaching and training?”	NA
mn107:3.1	“It is possible, brahmin.	NA
mn107:3.2	Suppose a deft horse trainer were to obtain a fine thoroughbred. First of all he’d make it get used to wearing the bit.	See [mn65:33.1]().
mn107:3.3	In the same way, when the Realized One gets a person for training they first guide them like this:	NA
mn107:3.4	‘Come, mendicant, be ethical and restrained in the monastic code, conducting yourself well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, keep the rules you’ve undertaken.’	NA

mn107:6.2	‘Come, mendicant, be committed to wakefulness. Practice walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying your mind from obstacles.

mn107:9.1	And they do so.	NA
mn107:9.2	After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in their presence.	NA

mn107:10.1	They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.	NA
mn107:10.2	Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn107:10.3	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn107:10.4	And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA
mn107:10.5	Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
mn107:11.1	That’s how I instruct the mendicants who are trainees—who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.	The “trainee” (_sekha_) in the strict sense is restricted to those who have entered the ranks of the Noble Ones (_ariyapuggala_) through the realization of the four noble truths (eg. [sn48.53:3.1]()); that is to say, the seven Noble Ones excluding the arahant, who is an “adept” beyond training (_asekha_). However, in cases such as this it would be over-strict to insist that the teaching applies only to Noble Ones, as the Gradual Training is the recommended practice for all new monastics. Indeed, the burden of the text is to show how practice is taken up gradually, so above it says that this is how the Buddha “first guides them” (_paṭhamaṁ evaṁ vineti_, [mn107:3.3]()). This agrees with the Chinese parallel, which here mentions a “young monk” (MA 144 at T i 652a29). Late canonical Pali texts introduce the idea of the “ordinary person of good character” (_puthujjanakalyāṇaka_, eg. [cnd8:81.2](), [ps1.1:206.2]()), who is said to “train” like the trainees ([pli-tv-pvr1.1:3.46]()). The commentaries say they may be counted along with the seven Noble Ones as a “trainee” (_sekkhoti puthujjanakalyāṇakena saddhiṁ satta ariyā_, commentaries to Pārājika 1 and Jhānavibhaṅga).
mn107:11.2	But for those mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and are rightly freed through enlightenment—these things lead to blissful meditation in this life, and to mindfulness and awareness.”	NA
mn107:12.1	When he had spoken, Moggallāna the Accountant said to the Buddha,	NA
mn107:12.2	“When his disciples are instructed and advised like this by the worthy Gotama, do all of them achieve the ultimate goal, extinguishment, or do some of them fail?”	NA

mn107:14.3	Are you skilled in the road to Rājagaha?”	Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.14.1–2 illustrates the role of a teacher with the story of a man kidnapped, blindfolded, and abandoned in a wilderness. A kind person looses his bandage and shows him the way to Gandhāra. See too Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13.2.3–2, where the horse knows the way to heaven that humans do not, like one who knows the country.

mn107:14.14	Instructed like this by you, they might still take the wrong road, heading west.	_Pacchāmukha_ means “heading west”. The present sutta is set in Sāvatthī, so for someone wanting to get to Rājagaha in the south-east, west is the wrong way. The word also appears at [thag10.1:3.4]() of the Buddha crossing the Rohiṇī river, which runs north to south; the background story says he was coming from Rājagaha, which again implies he was heading west from Koliya to Sakya.

They don’t care about the ascetic life, and don’t keenly respect the training. They’re indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, lazy, and lacking energy.

mn108:0.1	Middle Discourses 108	NA
mn108:0.2	With Moggallāna the Guardian	NA
mn108:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn108:1.2	At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. It was not long after the Buddha had become fully quenched.	NA
mn108:2.1	Now at that time King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, being suspicious of King Pajjota, was having Rājagaha fortified.	As to the politics of the situation, Pajjota had established a formidable set of alliances by marriage. He had taken to wife Śivā, daughter of Ceṭaka of the Licchavīs. Prince Bodhi of the Bhaggas was Pajjota’s grandson via his mother Vāsuladattā, queen of the powerful King Udena of Kosambī ([mn85:2.1]()). Meanwhile, Subāhu of Madhurā had married Pajjota’s sister ([mn84:2.1]()). Pajjota therefore had allies in Avanti, Bhagga, Vaccha, and Sūrasena, all nations to the west of Magadha, as well as Vajjī, against which Magadha was preparing war to the north. He was also friendly enough with Ajātasattu’s father Bimbisāra to ask him for help in a time of illness ([pli-tv-kd8:1.23.4]()). The Vinaya relates how Pajjota’s illness was treated by Jīvaka, the doctor of the Buddha and of Bimbisāra. Jīvaka, knowing Pajjota would dislike the medicine, escaped his wrath by fleeing after administering the cure. But when the cure worked, Pajjota favored Jīvaka with a gift of fine cloth. Ajātasattu subsequently murdered Bimbisāra and threatened Pajjota’s allies in Vajjī. Racked by guilt, Ajātasattu saw enemies on all sides; he was even afraid of mendicants meditating in a hall ([dn2:10.8]()). His fear of Pajjota was not idle, for Pajjota was known for the power of his elephants as much as for his temperamental character. However, we do not hear that any direct conflict flared up at that time. Roughly half a century later, the matter was settled when the Licchavī Śiśunāga, having usurped the throne of Magadha from the Haryaṅka dynasty founded by Bimbisāra, conquered Avanti, Kosala, and Vaccha.
mn108:3.1	Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.	NA
mn108:3.2	Then it occurred to him,	NA
mn108:3.3	“It’s too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha.	NA
mn108:3.4	Why don’t I go to see the brahmin Moggallāna the Guardian at his place of work?”	NA
mn108:4.1	So that’s what he did.	NA
mn108:4.2	Moggallāna the Guardian saw Ānanda coming off in the distance	NA
mn108:4.3	and said to him,	NA
mn108:4.4	“Come, worthy Ānanda!	NA
mn108:4.5	Welcome, worthy Ānanda!	NA
mn108:4.6	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.	NA
mn108:4.7	Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”	NA
mn108:4.8	Ānanda sat down on the seat spread out,	NA
mn108:4.9	while Moggallāna took a low seat and sat to one side.	NA
mn108:4.10	Then he said to Ānanda,	NA
mn108:5.1	“Worthy Ānanda, is there even a single mendicant who has all the same qualities in each and every way as possessed by the worthy Gotama, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”	NA
mn108:5.2	“No, brahmin, there is not.	NA
mn108:5.3	For the Blessed One gave rise to the unarisen path, gave birth to the unborn path, and explained the unexplained path. He is the knower of the path, the discoverer of the path, the expert on the path.	This links back to the Buddha’s claim in the previous sutta that he is the one who shows the way ([mn107:14.28]()).
mn108:5.4	And now the disciples live following the path; they acquire it later.”	NA
mn108:6.1	But this conversation between Ānanda and Moggallāna the Guardian was left unfinished.	NA
mn108:6.2	For just then the brahmin Vassakāra, a minister of Magadha, while supervising the work at Rājagaha, approached Ānanda at Moggallāna’s place of work and exchanged greetings with him.	Vassakāra must have returned from building Pāṭaliputta to the north on the Ganges, which would eventually become the capital of the expanded Magadhan empire ([dn16:1.26.1]()). | Rājagaha is surrounded by hills, on which remnants of ancient fortifications can be seen.
mn108:6.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda,	NA
mn108:6.4	“Worthy Ānanda, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	NA
mn108:6.5	So Ānanda told him of the conversation that they were having when Vassakāra arrived. Vassakāra said:	NA
mn108:6.6	NA	NA

mn108:7.1	“Worthy Ānanda, is there even a single mendicant who was appointed by the worthy Gotama, saying:	NA
mn108:7.2	‘This one will be your refuge when I have passed away,’ to whom you would now turn?”	Accept reading _paṭidhāveyyāthāti_ (BJT, PTS, Siamese and Khmer editions) against Mahāsaṅgīti’s _paṭipādeyyāthāti_. For this term, see [mn38:23.4]() and note there, and [sn12.20:5.1]().
mn108:7.3	“No, there is not.”	The Buddha made this clear to Ānanda shortly before his death ([dn16:2.24.4]()).
mn108:7.4	NA	NA
mn108:8.1	“But is there even a single mendicant who has been elected to such a position by the Saṅgha and appointed by several senior mendicants?”	The Vinaya sets up procedures whereby the Saṅgha can appoint officials to carry out necessary duties. For example, a monk might be in charge of assigning dwellings ([pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.1.1]()) or teaching the novices ([pli-tv-kd16:21.3.30]()). Such officials have authority within the roles prescribed to them under the Vinaya as implemented by the Saṅgha. However, they have no special authority outside of that role, and there is no provision for a general role of authority over the Saṅgha as a whole. The Saṅgha followed this precedent at the First Council, where Ānanda was appointed to recite the suttas, and Upāli to recite the Vinaya. Mahākassapa led the proceedings, but decisions were made by the Saṅgha in consensus.
mn108:8.2	NA	NA
mn108:8.3	“No, there is not.”	NA
mn108:8.4	NA	NA
mn108:9.1	“But since you lack a refuge, worthy Ānanda, what’s the reason for your harmony?”	The Buddha had, not long before, taught Vassakāra the eight principles of non-decline by which the Vajjis—as well as the Saṅgha—remained strong due to harmony. There, Vassakāra pointedly said that the Vajjis could only be defeated “by bribery or by sowing dissension” ([dn16:1.5.8]()). Here he returns to the question of how harmony creates strength. We can imagine that this question was equally relevant in both weakening their enemies as well as strengthening the Magadhans, who cannot have been happy to live under their brutal and patricidal king.
mn108:9.2	“We don’t lack a refuge, brahmin,	NA
mn108:9.3	we have a refuge.	NA
mn108:9.4	The teaching is our refuge.”	As explained to Ānanda at [dn16:4.7.3](). As will become clear, the “teaching” here includes the Dhamma and Vinaya.
mn108:10.1	“But worthy Ānanda, when asked whether there was even a single mendicant—either appointed by the Buddha,	NA
mn108:10.2	NA	NA
mn108:10.3	NA	NA
mn108:10.4	NA	NA
mn108:10.5	or elected by the Saṅgha and appointed by several senior mendicants—	NA
mn108:10.6	who serves as your refuge after the Buddha passed away, to whom you now turn,	NA
mn108:10.7	you replied, ‘No, there is not.’	NA
mn108:10.8	NA	NA
mn108:10.9	NA	NA
mn108:10.10	But you say that the reason for your harmony is that you have	NA
mn108:10.11	NA	NA
mn108:10.12	the teaching as a refuge.	NA
mn108:10.13	How should I see the meaning of this statement?”	NA
mn108:10.14	“The Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha laid down training rules and recited the monastic code for the mendicants.	This is the _pātimokkha_, which in early days had “over a hundred and fifty rules” and today, in the Pali, has 227 for monks ([an3.84:1.3]()). The story of how the Buddha came to lay down the first rule is related in the Vinaya ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1]()). Before this, however, the joint recitation consisted of the verses known as Ovāda Pātimokkha ([dn14:3.28.1]()). See too [dn2:42.1]() and note there. The primary purpose of the recitation was to create a unified community through shared allegiance to a particular code of ethics.
mn108:10.15	On the day of the sabbath all of us who live in dependence on one village district gather together as one.	The “sabbath” (_uposatha_) falls on the eighth and fourteenth or fifteenth days of the lunar cycle, that is, roughly each week. However the _pātimokkha_ is recited only twice a month, leaving aside the eighth days. See the detailed account in the Vinaya ([pli-tv-kd2]()). | A “village district” (_gāmakhetta_) is the village and surrounding farmlands. The Vinaya account specifies how to create a “boundary” (_sīmā_) within which all resident mendicants must attend. This may or may not correspond with the village district. But it seems reasonable to suppose that the common practice was, in fact, for mendicants from the same village district to join together.
mn108:10.16	We invite one who transmits the code to recite it.	The choice of the verb _pavattati_ (“transmits, rolls forth”) is deliberate. It echoes the first sermon, where the Buddha “rolled forth” the wheel of the Dhamma. All mendicants are supposed to memorize the rules and be ready to recite them when called upon. The commentary explains the phrase as “arrives having rehearsed”.
mn108:10.17	If anyone remembers an offense or transgression while they’re reciting, we make them act in line with the teachings and in line with the instructions.	Offences should be confessed as soon as practicable, but if they have not been previously confessed due to lapse of memory and the like, the recitation may be interrupted to confess them. These days, mendicants normally confess before the recitation to avoid interruptions.
mn108:10.18	It’s not the good fellows who make us act,	NA
mn108:10.19	it’s the teaching that makes us act.”	The Saṅgha proceeds according to the guidelines of the Dhamma and Vinaya, rather than the authority of any individuals. This is again in accordance with some of the Buddha’s final words to Ānanda: “The teaching and training that I have taught and pointed out for you shall be your Teacher after my passing” ([dn16:6.1.1]()).
mn108:11.1	“Worthy Ānanda, is there even a single mendicant who you honor, respect, revere, venerate, and rely on?”	NA
mn108:11.2	“There is not, brahmin.”	The Mahāsaṅgīti and BJT editions read _natthi_ here (“there is not”). The PTS edition reads _atthi_ (“there is”). The commentary is silent, and none of these editions record any variants. I suspect the PTS edition has amended the text to create a contrast between the “single mendicant” who is respected and the one who is taken as refuge. But the contrast per the MS and BJT editions, rather, is between respecting a “single mendicant”, and respecting “whoever” has the qualities that make them worthy of respect.
mn108:11.3	“Worthy Ānanda, when asked whether there was even a single mendicant—either appointed by the Buddha,	NA

mn108:13.3	What ten?	NA

mn108:21.1	They recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	NA
mn108:22.1	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	NA
mn108:23.1	They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.	NA
mn108:23.2	These are the ten inspiring things explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn108:23.3	We honor anyone in whom these things are found, and rely on them.”	The suttas record many monks and nuns of such qualities.
mn108:24.1	When he had spoken, Vassakāra addressed General Upananda,	This Upananda does not appear elsewhere and the commentary is silent.
mn108:24.2	“What do you think, general?	Accept the punctuation in Mahāsaṅgīti rather than PTS.
mn108:24.3	Do these venerables honor, respect, revere, and venerate those who are worthy?”	NA
mn108:24.4	“Indeed they do.	NA
mn108:24.5	For if these venerables were not to honor, respect, revere, and venerate them,	NA
mn108:24.6	then who exactly would they honor?”	NA
mn108:25.1	Then Vassakāra said to Ānanda,	NA
mn108:25.2	“Where are you staying at present?”	NA
mn108:25.3	“In the Bamboo Grove, brahmin.”	NA
mn108:25.4	“I hope the Bamboo Grove is delightful, quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat?”	NA
mn108:25.5	“Indeed it is, brahmin. And it is like that owing to such protectors and guardians as yourself.”	Ānanda graciously recognizes the protection offered by the Magadhan state. Even a morally compromised king such as Ajātasattu honored his duty to protect religious seekers ([dn2:36.2]()).
mn108:25.6	“Surely, worthy Ānanda, it is owing to the good fellows who meditate, making a habit of meditating.	“Habit of meditating” is _jhānasīlī_. Throughout this passage, “meditation” renders _jhāna_. This is the only sutta that speaks of a kind of _jhāna_ with hindrances. My choice to render the term differently in this passage was prefigured by the translator of the Chinese parallel, which here uses the character that normally renders _vicāra_ (MA 145 at T i 655b23).
mn108:25.7	For the good fellows do in fact meditate and make a habit of meditating.	NA
mn108:25.8	This one time, worthy Ānanda, worthy Gotama was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	NA
mn108:25.9	So I went there to see him.	NA
mn108:25.10	And there he spoke about meditation in many ways.	NA
mn108:25.11	He meditated, and made a habit of meditating.	NA
mn108:25.12	And he praised all kinds of meditation.”	NA
mn108:26.1	“No, brahmin, the Buddha did not praise all kinds of meditation, nor did he dispraise all kinds of meditation.	NA
mn108:26.2	And what kind of meditation did he not praise?	NA
mn108:26.3	It’s when someone’s heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire, and they don’t truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen.	NA

mn108:26.13	The Buddha didn’t praise this kind of meditation.	NA
mn108:27.1	And what kind of meditation did he praise?	NA
mn108:27.2	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn108:27.3	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn108:27.4	And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA
mn108:27.5	Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
mn108:27.6	The Buddha praised this kind of meditation.”	NA
mn108:28.1	“Well, worthy Ānanda, it seems that worthy Gotama criticized the kind of meditation that deserves criticism and praised that deserving of praise.	Normally, of course, when the Buddha teaches “meditation” he means the kind of meditation he praises, namely the four _jhānas_, or “absorptions”.
mn108:28.2	Well, now, worthy Ānanda, I must go.	NA
mn108:28.3	I have many duties, and much to do.”	NA
mn108:28.4	“Please, brahmin, go at your convenience.”	NA
mn108:28.5	Then Vassakāra the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what Venerable Ānanda said, got up from his seat and left.	NA
mn108:29.1	Soon after he had left, Moggallāna the Guardian said to Ānanda,	NA
mn108:29.2	“Worthy Ānanda, you still haven’t answered my question.”	NA
mn108:29.3	“But brahmin, didn’t I say:	NA
mn108:29.4	‘There is no single mendicant who has all the same qualities in each and every way as possessed by the worthy Gotama, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	The Chinese parallel differs here, emphasizing instead that there is no difference between the liberation of the Buddha and his arahant disciples (MA 145 at T i 655c27).
mn108:29.5	For the Blessed One gave rise to the unarisen path, gave birth to the unborn path, and explained the unexplained path. He is the knower of the path, the discoverer of the path, the expert on the path.	NA
mn108:29.6	And now the disciples live following the path; they acquire it later.’”	Ānanda is clarifying that his original statement was complete, namely, this is the quality that distinguishes the Buddha from his followers. | The Pali lacks the normal ending, whereas the Chinese ends with Moggallāna inviting Ānanda for a meal.
mn109:0.1	Middle Discourses 109	NA
mn109:0.2	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night	NA
mn109:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn109:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.	After the Jetavana, this was the best-known monastery in Sāvatthī. It was offered by the lady Visākhā, known as Migāra’s mother.
mn109:2.1	Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.	NA
mn109:3.1	Then one of the mendicants got up from their seat, arranged their robe over one shoulder, raised their joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,	NA
mn109:3.2	“I’d like to ask the Buddha about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”	The commentary says that he asked these questions in order to educate his students. This seems probable in view of the fact that the sequence of questions is structured in a way that is clearly purposeful.
mn109:3.3	“Well then, mendicant, take your own seat and ask what you wish.”	NA
mn109:3.4	That mendicant took his seat and said to the Buddha:	NA
mn109:4.1	“Sir, are these the five grasping aggregates:	NA
mn109:4.2	form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?”	NA
mn109:4.3	“Yes, they are,” replied the Buddha.	NA
mn109:4.4	NA	NA
mn109:4.5	Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question:	NA
mn109:5.1	“But sir, what is the root of these five grasping aggregates?”	NA
mn109:5.2	“These five grasping aggregates are rooted in desire.”	“Desire” (_chanda_) is the fundamental driving force underlying all manifestations of the aggregates. It is the same as “craving” (_taṇhā_).
mn109:6.1	“But sir, is that grasping the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates? Or is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates another?”	NA
mn109:6.2	“Neither.	NA
mn109:6.3	The desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates is the grasping there.”	See [mn44:6.3]() and note there.
mn109:7.1	“But sir, can there be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates?”	NA
mn109:7.2	“There can,” said the Buddha.	NA
mn109:7.3	“It’s when someone thinks:	NA
mn109:7.4	‘In the future, may I be of such form, such feeling, such perception, such choices, and such consciousness!’	This assumes the persistence of a “self” through time.
mn109:7.5	That’s how there can be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates.”	NA
mn109:8.1	“Sir, what is the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates?”	NA
mn109:8.2	“Any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of form.	NA
mn109:8.3	Any kind of feeling at all …	NA
mn109:8.4	Any kind of perception at all …	NA
mn109:8.5	Any kind of choices at all …	NA
mn109:8.6	Any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of consciousness.	NA
mn109:8.7	That’s the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates.”	That is to say, the term “aggregate” (_khandha_) is a collective term for all instances of this kind of phenomenon.
mn109:9.1	“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why the aggregate of form is found?	While the “root” of all aggregates is desire, the question now is the immediate basis of each particular aggregate.
mn109:9.2	What is the cause, what is the reason why the aggregate of feeling …	NA
mn109:9.3	perception …	NA
mn109:9.4	choices …	NA
mn109:9.5	consciousness is found?”	NA
mn109:9.6	“The four principal states are the reason why the aggregate of form is found.	NA
mn109:9.7	Contact is the reason why the aggregates of feeling …	In dependent origination, “contact” (_phassa_) is the immediate condition for “feeling” (_vedanā_). But contact can also be regarded as the immediate condition for all three: feeling, perception, and choices (eg. [sn35.93:1.14]()). These things are always active in consciousness, so they can be treated as simultaneous, as arising in sequence, or as mutually conditioning.
mn109:9.8	perception …	Feeling and “perception” (_saññā_) are closely connected, since how we feel conditions how we recognize and interpret. While contact directly underlies feeling, perception works so quickly that is can be included as a direct consequence as well.
mn109:9.9	and choices are found.	Likewise with “choices” (_saṅkhārā_), which are also part of the complex of reactivity that normally take effect immediately. For example, suppose we try eating a berry in the forest. “Contact” with its bitter taste “feels” unpleasant, so we “perceive” it as poisonous, and “choose” to spit it out.
mn109:9.10	Name and form are the reasons why the aggregate of consciousness is found.”	Normally in dependent origination, it is consciousness that is a condition for name and form. The presentation here assumes their mutual conditioning, as spelled out at [dn15:22.1](). Name and form are the embryo that supports consciousness in the process of rebirth, while the physical body with its senses, and the psychological functions included under “name” continue to evolve and grow with consciousness through life.
mn109:10.1	“But sir, how does substantialist view come about?”	As at [mn44:7.1]().
mn109:10.2	“It’s when an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.	NA
mn109:10.3	They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.	NA
mn109:10.4	They regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in feeling.	NA
mn109:10.5	They regard perception as self, self as having perception, perception in self, or self in perception.	NA
mn109:10.6	They regard choices as self, self as having choices, choices in self, or self in choices.	NA
mn109:10.7	They regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.	NA
mn109:10.8	That’s how substantialist view comes about.”	That is to say, the “substantialist” view takes the aggregates, or one of them, to be a “substantial reality” that is identified with the self. Such views are created each time we think or attach to the aggregates as a self.
mn109:11.1	“But sir, how does substantialist view not come about?”	NA
mn109:11.2	“It’s when a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen true persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true persons.	NA
mn109:11.3	They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.	NA
mn109:11.4	They don’t regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in feeling.	NA
mn109:11.5	They don’t regard perception as self, self as having perception, perception in self, or self in perception.	NA
mn109:11.6	They don’t regard choices as self, self as having choices, choices in self, or self in choices.	NA
mn109:11.7	They don’t regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.	NA
mn109:11.8	That’s how substantialist view does not come about.”	Since substantialist view is itself a conditioned phenomenon, it can only continue to exist if it is continually reinforced. Without it, like a fire without a constant supply of fuel, it falters and goes out.
mn109:12.1	“Sir, what’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to form,	We have met these questions before at [mn13:6.2](). Here they build on the previous section by showing a strategy for how to stop identifying them as the substantial reality underlying the self. This can be used as the basis for a contemplative insight meditation.
mn109:12.2	feeling,	NA
mn109:12.3	perception,	NA
mn109:12.4	choices,	NA
mn109:12.5	and consciousness?”	NA
mn109:12.6	“The pleasure and happiness that arise from form: this is its gratification.	NA
mn109:12.7	That form is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback.	NA
mn109:12.8	Removing and giving up desire and greed for form: this is its escape.	NA
mn109:12.9	The pleasure and happiness that arise from feeling …	NA
mn109:12.10	perception …	NA
mn109:12.11	choices …	NA
mn109:12.12	consciousness: this is its gratification.	NA
mn109:12.13	That consciousness is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback.	NA
mn109:12.14	Removing and giving up desire and greed for consciousness: this is its escape.”	NA
mn109:13.1	“Sir, how does one know and see so that there’s no I-making, mine-making, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli?”	From meditative contemplation, the question now turns to realization. The Buddha’s response makes it clear he is now speaking of the penetrative understanding of the aggregates that arises at stream-entry at least. The “underlying tendency to conceit”, however, is only fully overcome by the arahant. | “I-making” (_ahaṅkāra_) emphasizes the active role of the mind in creating a sense of self through its thoughts, habits, and desires. This is in contrast with the English notion of “ego”, which presents self as a given construct. | “Mine-making” (_mamaṅkāra_) is the propensity of the mind to appropriate things as possessions. | “All external stimuli” (_sabbanimitta_) are the “features” (also _nimitta_) that characterize sensory stimulation (eg. [mn112:15.1]()).
mn109:13.2	“One truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	NA
mn109:13.3	One truly sees any kind of feeling …	NA
mn109:13.4	perception …	NA
mn109:13.5	choices …	NA
mn109:13.6	consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near, *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	NA
mn109:13.7	That’s how to know and see so that there’s no I-making, mine-making, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli.”	NA
mn109:14.1	Now at that time one of the mendicants had the thought,	NA
mn109:14.2	“So it seems, good fellow, that form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self.	NA
mn109:14.3	Then what self will the deeds done by not-self affect?”	This monk, missing the point, thinks not-self means he can escape moral responsibility. A theory of self assumes a continuous entity, so that deeds done at one time will affect the same entity at another time. The Buddhist concept, on the other hand, is of a flow, so that, for example, pollution dumped in a stream will affect the river and the sea below, even though they are not materially the “same”.
mn109:14.4	But the Buddha, knowing that mendicant’s train of thought, addressed the mendicants:	NA
mn109:14.5	“It’s possible that some futile person here—unknowing and ignorant, their mind dominated by craving—thinks they can overstep the teacher’s instructions. They think:	NA
mn109:14.6	‘So it seems, good fellow, that form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self.	NA
mn109:14.7	Then what self will the deeds done by not-self affect?’	NA
mn109:14.8	Now, mendicants, you have been educated by me in questioning with regard to all these things in all such cases.	Read _paṭipucchāvinītā_ with [sn22.82:13.4](). It is the name for the method of questioning the Buddha is about to use. The Buddha does not just state doctrine for his students, he has “educated” (_vinīta_) them in the methods for learning. Active questioning breaks up long discourses and encourages reflection and articulation.
mn109:15.1	What do you think, mendicants?	NA
mn109:15.2	Is form permanent or impermanent?”	NA
mn109:15.3	“Impermanent, sir.”	NA
mn109:15.4	“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”	NA
mn109:15.5	“Suffering, sir.”	NA
mn109:15.6	“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:	NA
mn109:15.7	‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”	NA
mn109:15.8	“No, sir.”	NA
mn109:16.1	“What do you think, mendicants?	NA
mn109:16.2	Is feeling …	NA
mn109:16.3	perception …	NA
mn109:16.4	choices …	NA
mn109:16.5	consciousness permanent or impermanent?”	NA
mn109:16.6	“Impermanent, sir.”	NA

mn109:16.10	‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”	NA
mn109:16.11	“No, sir.”	NA
mn109:16.12	“So you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	NA
mn109:17.1	You should truly see any kind of feeling …	NA

mn109:17.4	consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near, *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	NA
mn109:17.5	Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.	NA
mn109:18.1	Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.	NA
mn109:18.2	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’”	NA
mn109:18.3	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn109:18.4	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn109:18.5	And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of sixty mendicants were freed from defilements by not grasping.	NA

mn110:3.1	“Mendicants, could an untrue person know of an untrue person:	Vassakāra asks the Buddha the same questions at [an4.187:2.1](), with an interesting example given from the court gossip.

mn110:4.1	A untrue person has bad qualities, is devoted to untrue persons, and has the intentions, counsel, speech, actions, views, and giving of an untrue person.	_Bhatti_ is given in the Abhidhamma Vibhaṅga as a synonym of _sevanā_, “association” ([vb17:93.2]()). While this is correct, the early Pali contexts are more warmly emotional than the rather austere “association”, connecting it with words such as “faith” (_saddhā_) and “fondness” (_pema_) ([thag5.12:1.3](), [thig15.1:14.1](), [an5.141:5.2]()). This anticipates the later use of _bhakti_ as “(ecstatic religious) devotion”. | “Devotion to untrue persons” is said to be a quality of the Jains ([an10.78:1.7]()).

mn111:0.1	Middle Discourses 111	NA
mn111:0.2	One by One	NA
mn111:1.1	So I have heard.	This discourse describes Sāriputta’s practice of discernment leading to awakening. It fills in the blanks between realizing stream entry and arahantship, reminding us that when a narrative depicts a person realizing the truth while listing to a teaching—as Sāriputta does—there is usually an extensive background of practice behind that. A number of indications suggest that this is among the later discourses: there are no parallels; the exposition is unusually elaborate; there is editorial clumsiness; and a number of terms are unique or characteristic of later texts.
mn111:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn111:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn111:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn111:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn111:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn111:2.1	“Sāriputta is astute, mendicants.	NA
mn111:2.2	He has great wisdom,	These are qualities of the Buddha at [dn30:1.26.6]() and of Sāriputta again at [sn8.7:3.2]().
mn111:2.3	widespread wisdom,	“Widespread wisdom” is defined at [an3.30:3.1]() as one who often listens to teachings, applies their mind while listening, and continues to do so afterwards.
mn111:2.4	laughing wisdom,	NA
mn111:2.5	swift wisdom,	NA
mn111:2.6	sharp wisdom,	NA
mn111:2.7	and penetrating wisdom.	NA
mn111:2.8	For a fortnight he practiced discernment of phenomena one by one.	The fortnight between realizing stream-entry while still a student of Sañjaya ([pli-tv-kd1:23.5.6]()) and arahantship while overhearing the Buddha teach Dīghanakha ([mn74:5.1]()). | _Anupada_ elsewhere means a “following statement” ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc4:2.1.11](), [vv35:7.4](), [vv53:9.4]()). Here it refers to the “discernment” (_vipassanā_) of each individual phenomena one by one as they occur. This methodical style of contemplation is reflected in the similarly detailed and thorough teachings characteristic of Sāriputta.
mn111:2.9	And this is how he did it.	NA
mn111:3.1	Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, he entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn111:4.1	And he distinguished the phenomena of the first absorption one by one: placing and keeping and rapture and bliss and unification of mind; contact, feeling, perception, intention, mind, enthusiasm, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and application of mind.	_Vavatthita_ (“distinguished”) occurs elsewhere in the suttas in only one late verse ([dn20:6.10]()). The Vinaya gives it as an antonym to _sambhinna_, “mixed” ([pli-tv-kd13:33.1.7]()). | The first five items here are the five so-called “jhāna factors”, which in the suttas appear here and at [mn43:19.3](). The list summarizes the normal depiction of the first absorption, as the first four factors are all part of the standard first absorption formula, and all absorption or _samādhi_ is characterized by unification of mind (eg. [mn20:3.3]()). | There is a striking syntactic break between the first five factors and the remainder of the list starting with “contact”. The five factors are articulated in the colloquial Pali fashion connected with _ca_, while the remainder are simply listed without _ca_. This, together with the fact that the first five appear elsewhere as a set and the remainder do not, as well as the fact that the second list is partly redundant (eg. “feeling” is already covered in the five factors), makes it certain that the latter items were appended to the first five. Indeed, the appended items appear elaborated even compared with similar lists in the Abhidhamma (eg. [dt1.2:16.1](), [kv15.10:2.3](); see too [mil3.3.6:7.2]()).
mn111:4.2	He knew those phenomena as they arose, as they remained, and as they went away.	He was mindfully aware as the attainment characterized by these qualities arose, persisted, and fell away. As Anālayo points out, this cannot refer to observing the cessation of phenomena *inside* the absorption, as the absorption itself is defined by their persistence (*Early Buddhist Meditation Studies*, pp. 117 ff.). In other words, he was aware of the impermanence *of* absorption, not of impermanence *in* absorption. | Compare the “development of immersion” that contemplates feelings, perceptions, and thoughts in the same way ([an4.41:4.3]()). According to the suttas, for all conditioned phenomena, “arising is evident, vanishing is evident, and change while persisting is evident” ([an3.47:1.3]()).
mn111:4.3	He understood:	NA
mn111:4.4	‘So it seems that these phenomena, not having been, come to be; and having come to be, they flit away.’	In the previous passage he *observed* them, whereas now he *reflects* on what he has seen. This course of practice anticipates the Niddesa’s notion of three kinds of full knowledge ([cnd11:51.4]()). First comes “full knowledge of the known” (_ñātapariññā_), where the meditator clearly observes each phenomena in experience. Then they reflect and scrutinize the “known” in light of the three characteristics of impermanence, suffering, and not-self, as Sāriputta is doing here (_tīraṇapariññā_). Finally they let go all attachments (_pahānapariññā_), as Sāriputta does below. | “Flit away” (_paṭiventi_) is unique.
mn111:4.5	Regarding those phenomena, he meditated without going near or going away, independent, untied, liberated, detached, his mind free of limits.	“Without going near or going away” (_anupāyo anapāyo_) is explained by the commentary as not being swayed by the power of lust or aversion. It means having a poised and unreactive attitude. It is a rare phrase that also occurs, with the same syntactic context, in the next sutta, creating a link between the two ([mn112:4.2]()).
mn111:4.6	He understood: ‘There is an escape beyond.’	The “escape beyond” (_uttari nissaraṇaṁ_) normally refers to full awakening ([mn7:17.1](), [mn49:2.3](), [an3.66:46.6](), [an7.56:6.1](), [an10.93:14.4]()), but the commentary says that here it refers to the next higher attainment.
mn111:4.7	Repeated practice of that confirmed this for him.	The compound _atthitvevassa_ resolves to: _atthi iti_ (“that it is real”) _eva_ (“indeed”) _assa_ (“for him”). The commentary glosses, “That it is real is reinforced for that monk.”
mn111:5.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, he entered and remained in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn111:6.1	And he distinguished the phenomena of the second absorption one by one: internal confidence and rapture and bliss and unification of mind; contact, feeling, perception, intention, mind, enthusiasm, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and application of mind.	The initial list representing the absorption factors is adjusted according to the level of absorption, while the remainder of the list stays the same.
mn111:6.2	He knew those phenomena as they arose, as they remained, and as they went away.	NA
mn111:6.3	He understood:	NA
mn111:6.4	‘So it seems that these phenomena, not having been, come to be; and having come to be, they flit away.’	NA
mn111:6.5	Regarding those phenomena, he meditated without going near or going away, independent, untied, liberated, detached, his mind free of limits.	NA
mn111:6.6	He understood: ‘There is an escape beyond.’	NA
mn111:6.7	Repeated practice of that confirmed this for him.	NA
mn111:7.1	Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, he entered and remained in the third absorption, where he meditated with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA
mn111:8.1	And he distinguished the phenomena of the third absorption one by one: bliss and mindfulness and awareness and unification of mind; contact, feeling, perception, intention, mind, enthusiasm, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and application of mind.	NA
mn111:8.2	He knew those phenomena as they arose, as they remained, and as they went away.	NA

mn111:8.6	He understood: ‘There is an escape beyond.’	NA
mn111:8.7	Repeated practice of that confirmed this for him.	NA
mn111:9.1	Furthermore, with the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, he entered and remained in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
mn111:10.1	And he distinguished the phenomena of the fourth absorption one by one: equanimity and neutral feeling and mental unconcern due to tranquility and pure mindfulness and unification of mind; contact, feeling, perception, intention, mind, enthusiasm, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and application of mind.	“Unconcern” (_anābhoga_) is a unique term in the suttas. In the Abhidhamma Vibhaṅga, it is said to be a characteristic of the five kinds of sense consciousness, which according to that system do not feel pleasure or pain ([vb16:13.1]()).
mn111:10.2	He knew those phenomena as they arose, as they remained, and as they went away.	NA
mn111:10.3	He understood:	NA
mn111:10.4	‘So it seems that these phenomena, not having been, come to be; and having come to be, they flit away.’	NA

mn111:10.6	He understood: ‘There is an escape beyond.’	NA
mn111:10.7	Repeated practice of that confirmed this for him.	NA
mn111:11.1	Furthermore, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, he entered and remained in the dimension of infinite space.	NA
mn111:12.1	And he distinguished the phenomena of the dimension of infinite space one by one: the perception of the dimension of infinite space and unification of mind; contact, feeling, perception, intention, mind, enthusiasm, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and application of mind.	NA
mn111:12.2	He knew those phenomena as they arose, as they remained, and as they went away.	NA

mn111:12.6	He understood: ‘There is an escape beyond.’	NA
mn111:12.7	Repeated practice of that confirmed this for him.	NA
mn111:13.1	Furthermore, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, he entered and remained in the dimension of infinite consciousness.	NA
mn111:14.1	And he distinguished the phenomena of the dimension of infinite consciousness one by one: the perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness and unification of mind; contact, feeling, perception, intention, mind, enthusiasm, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and application of mind.	NA
mn111:14.2	He knew those phenomena as they arose, as they remained, and as they went away.	NA
mn111:14.3	He understood:	NA

mn111:14.6	He understood: ‘There is an escape beyond.’	NA
mn111:14.7	Repeated practice of that confirmed this for him.	NA
mn111:15.1	Furthermore, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, he entered and remained in the dimension of nothingness.	NA
mn111:16.1	And he distinguished the phenomena of the dimension of nothingness one by one: the perception of the dimension of nothingness and unification of mind; contact, feeling, perception, intention, mind, enthusiasm, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and application of mind.	NA
mn111:16.2	He knew those phenomena as they arose, as they remained, and as they went away.	NA
mn111:16.3	He understood:	NA
mn111:16.4	‘So it seems that these phenomena, not having been, come to be; and having come to be, they flit away.’	NA
mn111:16.5	Regarding those phenomena, he meditated without going near or going away, independent, untied, liberated, detached, his mind free of limits.	NA
mn111:16.6	He understood: ‘There is an escape beyond.’	NA
mn111:16.7	Repeated practice of that confirmed this for him.	NA
mn111:17.1	Furthermore, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, he entered and remained in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	NA
mn111:18.1	And he emerged from that attainment with mindfulness.	NA
mn111:18.2	Then he contemplated the phenomena of that attainment that had passed, ceased, and perished:	NA
mn111:18.3	‘So it seems that these phenomena, not having been, come to be; and having come to be, they flit away.’	In this, the highest of the eight attainments, there is no individual discernment of mental factors, as the function of “perception” is liminal; compare [mn52:14.7](), [mn64:15.5](), and [mn102:4.4](). And rather than observing the arising, persisting, and ceasing of the absorption phenomena, as he had done previously, he reflects on the fact of their come and gone. As Anālayo (*ibid.*, 122) puts it, “there is no continuity of perceptual awareness from before the time one entered these attainments to emergence from them … practitioners could only know that at some time in the past they entered and that by now they have emerged”.
mn111:18.4	Regarding those phenomena, he meditated without going near or going away, independent, untied, liberated, detached, his mind free of limits.	NA
mn111:18.5	He understood: ‘There is an escape beyond.’	NA
mn111:18.6	Repeated practice of that confirmed this for him.	NA
mn111:19.1	Furthermore, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, he entered and remained in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, his defilements came to an end.	NA
mn111:20.1	And he emerged from that attainment with mindfulness.	NA
mn111:20.2	Then he contemplated the phenomena of that attainment that had passed, ceased, and perished:	NA
mn111:20.3	‘So it seems that these phenomena, not having been, come to be; and having come to be, they flit away.’	It is not clear what this refers to, as there are no mental states arising or ceasing in the state of cessation. The commentary says it refers to either the material states present (i.e. the body originated by kamma) or the states of the previous attainment. Perhaps it is simply an editorial slip.
mn111:20.4	Regarding those phenomena, he meditated without going near or going away, independent, untied, liberated, detached, his mind free of limits.	NA
mn111:20.5	He understood: ‘There is no escape beyond.’	He has fully realized Nibbana, beyond which there is nothing higher.
mn111:20.6	By cultivating that he confirmed that there is not.	NA
mn111:21.1	And if there’s anyone of whom it may be rightly said that	NA
mn111:21.2	they have attained mastery and perfection in noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom, it’s Sāriputta.	Compare [mn77:15.6]() and [mn100:6.1]().
mn111:21.3	NA	NA
mn111:22.1	And if there’s anyone of whom it may be rightly said that	NA
mn111:22.2	they’re the Buddha’s true-born son, born from his mouth, born of the teaching, created by the teaching, heir to the teaching, not the heir in things of the flesh, it’s Sāriputta.	Also said of Sāriputta at [sn8.7:3.2]() and of Mahākassapa at [sn16.11:15.2](). The phrase was adopted from the Brahmins’ claim to be born from the mouth of Brahmā ([mn84:4.5](), [dn27:3.9]()).
mn111:22.3	NA	NA
mn111:23.1	Sāriputta rightly keeps rolling the supreme Wheel of Dhamma that was rolled forth by the Realized One.”	Also at [an1.187:1.2](), [an5.132:4.3](), and [sn8.7:3.4](). This is a reference to the Buddha’s first teaching ([sn56.11]()).
mn111:23.2	That is what the Buddha said.	NA

mn112:0.1	Middle Discourses 112	NA
mn112:0.2	The Sixfold Purification	NA
mn112:1.1	So I have heard.	This sutta lays out a method for assessing a mendicant’s claim to realize perfection (_arahatta_). They are taken through a series of questions of increasing complexity, culminating in the entire practice of the Gradual Training.
mn112:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn112:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn112:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn112:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn112:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA

mn112:2.2	‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.”’	NA
mn112:3.1	You should neither approve nor dismiss that mendicant’s statement.	As at [dn29:18.4]() and [dn16:4.11.5]() = [an4.180:2.5]().
mn112:3.2	Rather, you should question them:	NA
mn112:3.3	‘Reverend, these four kinds of expression have been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn112:3.4	What four?	NA
mn112:3.5	One speaks of the seen as seen, the heard as heard, the thought as thought, and the known as known.	As usual, this group of four is not meant to stand for the six senses—which are discussed later—but for the ways in which one learns spiritual truths. That is why one “speaks of” what one has learned. See [mn1:19.1]() and note there.
mn112:3.6	These are the four kinds of expression rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn112:3.7	How does the venerable know and see regarding these four kinds of expression so that your mind is freed from defilements by not grasping?’	NA
mn112:4.1	For a mendicant with defilements ended—who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—it is in line with the teaching to answer:	NA
mn112:4.2	‘Regarding what is seen, reverends, I live without going near or going away, independent, untied, liberated, detached, my mind free of limits.	Also at [mn111:4.5]().
mn112:4.3	Regarding what is heard …	NA

mn112:5.1	Saying ‘Good!’ you should applaud and cheer that mendicant’s statement,	NA

mn112:6.2	‘Reverends, knowing that form is powerless, faded, and unreliable, I understand that my mind is freed through the ending, fading away, cessation, giving away, and letting go of attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendency for form.	_Virāgunaṁ_ is a secondary derivation from _virāga_ with the _-una_ suffix. Also found at [iti77:3.2](). | _Rāga_ can mean “color” or “desire”, so its opposite _virāga_ has the dual connotations of “dispassion” and “colorless” or metaphorically “fading away”. Kauṭilya’s Arthaśāstra 2.10.58 gives an example in the context of writing. In those days, the letters would be etched in a palm leaf with a stylus, then “colored” by applying dye or ink. The surface would then be wiped clean, leaving just the ink staining the etched letters. An example of poorly done writing is _virāga_, “colorless”, i.e. the ink does not take hold, leaving only the near-invisible etching.

mn112:8.2	‘Reverends, I’ve not taken the earth element as self, nor is there a self based on the earth element.	To take (_upagacchi_) the earth element as self is to identify the self with the earth element. A self “based on” (_nissita_) the earth element is one that is not itself the earth element, but which is dependent upon it, like a river on its bed.

The phrase “eye, sights, eye consciousness, and things knowable by eye consciousness” appears redundant, as “sights” (_rūpa_) are precisely what is “knowable by eye consciousness”. Where the phrase occurs elsewhere, _rūpa_ may appear ([sn35.27:1.3](), [sn35.65:2.1](), [sn35.68:1.3]()) or it may not ([mn144:9.1](), [sn35.87:7.1]()). Bodhi summarizes the commentary’s explanations, which he describes as “contrived” (*Middle Length Discourses*, note 1080, and *Connected Discourses* note 12 on book 4). The Chinese parallel omits _rūpa_ here, thus avoiding the redundancy (MA 187 at T i 732c19). It is likely the original passage did not include _rūpa_ and it was added in an old editorial oversight.

mn112:13.3	I gave up stealing. I took only what’s given, and expected only what’s given. I kept myself clean by not thieving.	NA
mn112:13.4	I gave up unchastity. I became chaste, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex.	NA
mn112:13.5	I gave up lying. I spoke the truth and stuck to the truth. I was honest and dependable, not tricking the world with my words.	NA
mn112:13.6	I gave up divisive speech. I didn’t repeat in one place what I heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, I reconciled those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.	NA

NA
mn112:16.2	When I had this entire spectrum of noble ethics, this noble contentment, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness,	NA
mn112:16.3	I frequented a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.	NA
mn112:16.4	After the meal, I returned from almsround, sat down cross-legged, set my body straight, and established mindfulness in his presence.	NA
mn112:17.1	Giving up covetousness for the world, I meditated with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness.	NA
mn112:17.2	Giving up ill will and malevolence, I meditated with a mind rid of ill will, full of sympathy for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will.	NA

mn112:17.4	Giving up restlessness and remorse, I meditated without restlessness, my mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.	NA
mn112:17.5	Giving up doubt, I meditated having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.	NA
mn112:18.1	I gave up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.	NA
mn112:18.2	Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn112:18.3	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption …	NA
mn112:18.4	third absorption …	NA

mn112:19.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	The text omits the usual description of the recollection of past lives and of clairvoyance here.
mn112:19.2	I truly understood: “This is suffering” … “This is the origin of suffering” … “This is the cessation of suffering” … “This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering”.	NA
mn112:19.3	I truly understood: “These are defilements”… “This is the origin of defilements” … “This is the cessation of defilements” … “This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements”.	NA
mn112:20.1	Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	NA
mn112:20.2	When it was freed, I knew it was freed.	NA
mn112:20.3	I understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	NA
mn112:20.4	That is how I know and see so that I have eradicated I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli.’	NA
mn112:21.1	Saying ‘Good!’ you should applaud and cheer that mendicant’s statement,	NA
mn112:21.2	and then say to them:	NA
mn112:21.3	‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate	NA
mn112:21.4	to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!’”	NA
mn112:21.5	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn112:21.6	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	The title of the discourse refers to a “sixfold purity”, whereas the Pali text only has five items. The commentary offers a couple of explanations, one of which, attributed to “overseas Elders”, says the text should include a passage on the four nutriments. As it happens, the Chinese parallel does indeed include the four nutriments (MA 187 at T i 732b18), confirming the suggestion of the “overseas Elders” (Anālayo, *Comparative Study*, vol. ii, p. 638). Thus an accurate memory of the text persisted in the commentarial tradition, even when the text itself suffered loss. As to the identity of these Elders, the commentary to the Ghaṭikārasutta ([mn81:10.5]()) says they taught the ten perfections (_pāramī_). These are a characteristic doctrine of the Mahāvihāra (or Theravāda) school, as other sectarian accounts of the perfections rarely number ten. So we can assume the Elders were not of a different school. Inscriptions at Amarāvatī and Nāgārjunikoṇḍa reveal that there was a Mahāvihāra branch monastery in Andhra, so they may have lived there.

mn114:0.1	Middle Discourses 114	NA
mn114:0.2	What Should and Should Not Be Cultivated	NA
mn114:1.1	So I have heard.	The Buddha begins by speaking of what should and should not be cultivated. Then he goes on to offer three distinct analyses of this, each laid out in a series of dichotomies. After each one, Sāriputta offers a lengthy elaboration, which the Buddha then approves and recapitulates.
mn114:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn114:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn114:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn114:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn114:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn114:2.1	“Mendicants, I will teach you an exposition of the teaching on what should and should not be cultivated.	To “cultivate” is to foster or nurture through repeated association or practice.
mn114:2.2	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn114:2.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
mn114:2.4	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn114:3.1	“I say that there are two kinds of bodily behavior:	The first analysis consists of seven items: bodily, verbal, and mental conduct; arising of thought; and acquisition of perception, views, and reincarnation.
mn114:3.2	that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.	NA
mn114:3.3	And each of these is a kind of bodily behavior.	NA
mn114:3.4	I say that there are two kinds of verbal behavior:	NA
mn114:3.5	that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.	NA
mn114:3.6	And each of these is a kind of verbal behavior.	NA
mn114:3.7	I say that there are two kinds of mental behavior:	NA
mn114:3.8	that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.	NA
mn114:3.9	And each of these is a kind of mental behavior.	NA
mn114:3.10	I say that there are two arisings of thought:	NA
mn114:3.11	that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.	NA
mn114:3.12	And each of these is an arising of thought.	NA
mn114:3.13	I say that there are two acquisitions of perception:	NA
mn114:3.14	that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.	NA
mn114:3.15	And each of these is an acquisition of perception.	NA
mn114:3.16	I say that there are two acquisitions of views:	NA
mn114:3.17	that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.	NA
mn114:3.18	And each of these is an acquisition of views.	NA
mn114:3.19	I say that there are two kinds of reincarnation in a life-form:	“Life-form” is _attabhāva_, literally the “state of the self”, where the “self” comes close in meaning to “body”—whether material or immaterial—which is a secondary sense of _ātman_ in the Upaniṣads. Accordingly, the commentary to [an5.100]() glosses as _sarīrapaṭilābha_. | “Reincarnation” is _paṭilābha_. In the 20th century, Buddhist writers shied away from using “reincarnation”, which they associated with the Hindu idea of a transmigrating soul. But there is nothing in the word “reincarnation” that implies a soul. Rather, it simply refers to going into another body, which is precisely what is meant by _attabhāva_. It is unwise to hang a heavy philosophical cloak upon the feeble hook of a single word.
mn114:3.20	that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.	NA
mn114:3.21	And these are equally reincarnation in a life-form.”	NA
mn114:4.1	When he said this, Venerable Sāriputta said to the Buddha,	Sāriputta proceeds to elaborate each of the seven items in turn.
mn114:4.2	“Sir, this is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement.	NA
mn114:5.1	‘I say that there are two kinds of bodily behavior:	NA
mn114:5.2	that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.	NA
mn114:5.3	And each of these is a kind of bodily behavior.’	NA
mn114:5.4	That’s what the Buddha said,	NA
mn114:5.5	but why did he say it?	NA
mn114:5.6	You should not cultivate the kind of bodily behavior which causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline.	NA
mn114:5.7	And you should cultivate the kind of bodily behavior which causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow.	NA
mn114:5.8	And what kind of bodily behavior causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline?	This includes the first three precepts, or else the first three of the ten ways of skillful deeds.
mn114:5.9	It’s when someone kills living creatures. They’re violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.	NA
mn114:5.10	They steal. With the intention to commit theft, they take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.	NA
mn114:5.11	They commit sexual misconduct. They have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal.	NA
mn114:5.12	That kind of bodily behavior causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline.	NA
mn114:5.13	And what kind of bodily behavior causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow?	NA
mn114:5.14	It’s when someone gives up killing living creatures. They renounce the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings.	NA
mn114:5.15	They give up stealing. They don’t, with the intention to commit theft, take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.	NA
mn114:5.16	They give up sexual misconduct. They don’t have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They don’t have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal.	NA
mn114:5.17	That kind of bodily behavior causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow.	NA

mn114:5.19	that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.	NA
mn114:5.20	And each of these is a kind of bodily behavior.’	NA
mn114:5.21	That’s what the Buddha said, and this is why he said it.	NA
mn114:6.1	‘I say that there are two kinds of verbal behavior:	NA
mn114:6.2	that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.	NA
mn114:6.3	And each of these is a kind of verbal behavior.’	NA
mn114:6.4	That’s what the Buddha said,	NA

mn114:6.6	You should not cultivate the kind of verbal behavior which causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline.	NA
mn114:6.7	And you should cultivate the kind of verbal behavior which causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow.	NA
mn114:6.8	And what kind of verbal behavior causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline?	This is the four verbal ways of skillful deeds.
mn114:6.9	It’s when someone lies. They’re summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, worthy man, say what you know.’ Not knowing, they say ‘I know.’ Knowing, they say ‘I don’t know.’ Not seeing, they say ‘I see.’ And seeing, they say ‘I don’t see.’ So they deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason.	NA
mn114:6.10	They speak divisively. They repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. And so they divide those who are harmonious, supporting division, delighting in division, loving division, speaking words that promote division.	NA
mn114:6.11	They speak harshly. They use the kinds of words that are cruel, nasty, hurtful, offensive, bordering on anger, not leading to immersion.	NA
mn114:6.12	They talk nonsense. Their speech is untimely, and is neither factual nor beneficial. It has nothing to do with the teaching or the training. Their words have no value, and are untimely, unreasonable, rambling, and pointless.	NA
mn114:6.13	That kind of verbal behavior causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline.	NA
mn114:6.14	And what kind of verbal behavior causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow?	NA
mn114:6.15	It’s when a certain person gives up lying. They’re summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, worthy man, say what you know.’ Not knowing, they say ‘I don’t know.’ Knowing, they say ‘I know.’ Not seeing, they say ‘I don’t see.’ And seeing, they say ‘I see.’ So they don’t deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason.	NA
mn114:6.16	They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.	NA
mn114:6.17	They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people.	NA
mn114:6.18	They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.	NA
mn114:6.19	That kind of verbal behavior causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow.	NA
mn114:6.20	‘I say that there are two kinds of verbal behavior:	NA
mn114:6.21	that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.	NA
mn114:6.22	And each of these is a kind of verbal behavior.’	NA
mn114:6.23	That’s what the Buddha said, and this is why he said it.	NA
mn114:7.1	‘I say that there are two kinds of mental behavior:	NA
mn114:7.2	that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.	NA
mn114:7.3	And each of these is a kind of mental behavior.’	NA
mn114:7.4	That’s what the Buddha said,	NA
mn114:7.5	but why did he say it?	NA
mn114:7.6	You should not cultivate the kind of mental behavior which causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline.	NA
mn114:7.7	And you should cultivate the kind of mental behavior which causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow.	NA
mn114:7.8	And what kind of mental behavior causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline?	This is the final three ways of skillful deeds.
mn114:7.9	It’s when someone is covetous. They covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‘Oh, if only their belongings were mine!’	NA
mn114:7.10	They have ill will and malicious intentions: ‘May these sentient beings be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!’	NA

mn114:7.12	And what kind of mental behavior causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow?	NA

mn114:7.19	That’s what the Buddha said, and this is why he said it.	NA
mn114:8.1	‘I say that there are two arisings of thought:	NA
mn114:8.2	that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.	NA
mn114:8.3	And each of these is an arising of thought.’	NA
mn114:8.4	That’s what the Buddha said,	NA
mn114:8.5	but why did he say it?	NA
mn114:8.6	You should not cultivate the arising of thought which causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline.	NA
mn114:8.7	And you should cultivate the arising of thought which causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow.	NA
mn114:8.8	And what arising of thought causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline?	The discussions at [mn8:13.1]() and [an7.53]() show that this refers to the initial thought that precedes action.
mn114:8.9	It’s when someone is covetous, and lives with their heart full of covetousness.	NA
mn114:8.10	They are malicious, and live with their heart full of ill will.	NA
mn114:8.11	They’re hurtful, and live with their heart intent on harm.	NA

mn114:8.20	And each of these is an arising of thought.’	NA
mn114:8.21	That’s what the Buddha said, and this is why he said it.	NA

mn114:9.2	that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.	NA
mn114:9.3	And each of these is an acquisition of perception.’	NA

mn114:9.6	You should not cultivate the acquisition of perception which causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline.	NA
mn114:9.7	And you should cultivate the acquisition of perception which causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow.	NA
mn114:9.8	And what acquisition of perception causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline?	Perception precedes even thought.
mn114:9.9	It’s when someone is covetous, and lives with their perception full of covetousness.	NA
mn114:9.10	They are malicious, and live with their perception full of ill will.	NA

mn114:10.2	that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.	NA
mn114:10.3	And each of these is an acquisition of views.’	NA
mn114:10.4	That’s what the Buddha said,	NA
mn114:10.5	but why did he say it?	NA
mn114:10.6	You should not cultivate the acquisition of views which causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline.	NA
mn114:10.7	And you should cultivate the acquisition of views which causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow.	NA
mn114:10.8	And what acquisition of views causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline?	A view is a perception solidified into a persistent pattern of thought, which becomes a way of seeing the world. View offer explanatory power, provide us with a convenient template for understanding, and often dismissing, what we encounter. Once a view has set in, it tends to reinforce itself, and hence is very slow to change.
mn114:10.9	It’s when someone has such a view:	NA
mn114:10.10	‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’	NA
mn114:10.11	That acquisition of views causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline.	NA
mn114:10.12	And what acquisition of views causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow?	NA
mn114:10.13	It’s when someone has such a view:	NA
mn114:10.14	‘There is meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There are such things as mother and father, and beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’	NA
mn114:10.15	That acquisition of views causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow.	NA
mn114:10.16	‘I say that there are two acquisitions of views:	NA
mn114:10.17	that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.	NA
mn114:10.18	And each of these is an acquisition of views.’	NA
mn114:10.19	That’s what the Buddha said, and this is why he said it.	NA
mn114:11.1	‘I say that there are two kinds of reincarnation in a life-form:	NA
mn114:11.2	that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.	NA
mn114:11.3	And these are equally reincarnation in a life-form.’	NA
mn114:11.4	That’s what the Buddha said,	NA
mn114:11.5	but why did he say it?	NA
mn114:11.6	Reincarnation in a life-form that causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline:	NA
mn114:11.7	you should not cultivate reincarnation in such a life-form.	NA
mn114:11.8	Reincarnation in a life-form that causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow:	NA
mn114:11.9	you should cultivate reincarnation such in a life-form.	NA
mn114:11.10	And reincarnation in what kind of life-form causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline?	As the examples will show, this refers to a kind of rebirth that is not conducive to developing wholesome qualities.
mn114:11.11	For one who generates reincarnation in a hurtful life-form not for the sake of the state of perfection, unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline.	_Apariniṭṭhitabhāvāya_ (“not for the sake of the state of perfection”) is found only here. The commentary explains it in terms of individuals who are reborn in a painful state where they are unable to realize the accomplishment of liberation.
mn114:11.12	And reincarnation in what kind of life-form causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow? For one who generates rebirth in a pleasing life-form for the sake of the state of perfection, unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow.	The question is absent in the Mahāsaṅgīti edition, but present in the PTS and BJT editions.
mn114:11.13	‘I say that there are two kinds of reincarnation in a life-form:	NA
mn114:11.14	that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.	NA
mn114:11.15	And these are equally reincarnation in a life-form.’	NA
mn114:11.16	That’s what the Buddha said, and this is why he said it.	NA
mn114:12.1	Sir, that’s how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement.”	This completes the elaboration of the seven items.
mn114:13.1	“Good, good, Sāriputta!	NA
mn114:13.2	It’s good that you understand the detailed meaning of my brief statement in this way.”	NA
mn114:14.1	And the Buddha went on to repeat and endorse Venerable Sāriputta’s explanation in full. Then he went on to explain further:	NA

mn115:0.1	Middle Discourses 115	NA
mn115:0.2	Many Elements	NA
mn115:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn115:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn115:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn115:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn115:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn115:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn115:2.1	“Whatever dangers there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.	_Paṇḍita_ is normally used for a learned scholar, rather than a contemplative “sage”. Pali has many more terms for “a wise person” than does English, and it is not easy to distinguish the senses. “Astute” is meant to convey the sense of one who is observant and of sound judgment.
mn115:2.2	Whatever perils there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.	NA
mn115:2.3	Whatever hazards there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.	NA
mn115:2.4	It’s like a fire that spreads from a hut made of reeds or grass, and burns down even a bungalow, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with doors fastened and windows shuttered.	NA
mn115:2.5	In the same way, whatever dangers there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.	NA
mn115:2.6	Whatever perils there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.	NA
mn115:2.7	Whatever hazards there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.	NA
mn115:2.8	So, the fool is dangerous, but the astute person is safe.	NA
mn115:2.9	The fool is perilous, but the astute person is not.	NA
mn115:2.10	The fool is hazardous, but the astute person is not.	NA
mn115:2.11	There’s no danger, peril, or hazard that comes from the astute.	NA
mn115:2.12	So you should train like this: ‘We shall be astute, we shall be inquirers.’”	NA
mn115:2.13	NA	NA
mn115:3.1	When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,	NA
mn115:3.2	“Sir, how is a mendicant qualified to be called ‘astute, an inquirer’?”	Notice the different approaches used by Ānanda and Sāriputta in the previous discourse. Sāriputta took up the Buddha’s teaching and elaborated it, whereas Ānanda uses inquiry to prompt the Buddha himself to speak further.
mn115:3.3	“Ānanda, it’s when a mendicant is skilled in the elements, in the sense fields, in dependent origination, and in the possible and the impossible.	NA
mn115:3.4	That’s how a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘astute, an inquirer’.”	NA
mn115:4.1	“But sir, how is a mendicant qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’?”	As emphasized in this sutta, the notion of an “element” (_dhātu_) is a flexible one, including a range of different properties, qualities, or aspects of existence.
mn115:4.2	“There are, Ānanda, these eighteen elements:	NA
mn115:4.3	the elements of the eye, sights, and eye consciousness;	NA
mn115:4.4	the ear, sounds, and ear consciousness;	NA
mn115:4.5	the nose, smells, and nose consciousness;	NA
mn115:4.6	the tongue, tastes, and tongue consciousness;	NA
mn115:4.7	the body, touches, and body consciousness;	NA
mn115:4.8	the mind, ideas, and mind consciousness.	The “mind element” (_manodhātu_) appears a number of times ([sn14.1:2.2](), [sn35.129:1.17](), [sn41.2:3.11]()), but is not defined. See [mn28:37.1]() and note there.
mn115:4.9	When a mendicant knows and sees these eighteen elements,	NA
mn115:4.10	they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’.”	NA
mn115:5.1	“But sir, could there be another way in which a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’?”	The method of building a lengthy discourse by asking for “another way” of exposition is also used at [mn9](), [sn44.6](), [an5.106](), and [snp3.12]().
mn115:5.2	“There could, Ānanda.	NA
mn115:5.3	There are these six elements:	NA
mn115:5.4	the elements of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness.	NA

mn115:6.2	“There could, Ānanda.	NA
mn115:6.3	There are these six elements:	NA
mn115:6.4	the elements of pleasure, pain, happiness, sadness, equanimity, and ignorance.	NA
mn115:6.5	When a mendicant knows and sees these six elements,	NA
mn115:6.6	they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’.”	NA
mn115:7.1	“But sir, could there be another way in which a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’?”	NA
mn115:7.2	“There could, Ānanda.	NA
mn115:7.3	There are these six elements:	NA
mn115:7.4	the elements of sensuality and renunciation, malice and good will, and cruelty and harmlessness.	NA
mn115:7.5	When a mendicant knows and sees these six elements,	NA
mn115:7.6	they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’.”	NA
mn115:8.1	“But sir, could there be another way in which a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’?”	NA
mn115:8.2	“There could, Ānanda.	NA
mn115:8.3	There are these three elements:	NA
mn115:8.4	the elements of the sensual realm, the realm of luminous form, and the formless realm.	NA
mn115:8.5	When a mendicant knows and sees these three elements,	NA
mn115:8.6	they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’.”	NA
mn115:9.1	“But sir, could there be another way in which a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’?”	NA
mn115:9.2	“There could, Ānanda.	NA
mn115:9.3	There are these two elements:	NA
mn115:9.4	the conditioned element and the unconditioned element.	NA
mn115:9.5	When a mendicant knows and sees these two elements,	NA
mn115:9.6	they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’.”	NA
mn115:10.1	“But sir, how is a mendicant qualified to be called ‘skilled in the sense fields’?”	Ānanda moves on to the next topic, the six senses. Perhaps this move was prompted by the mention of the “unconditioned element” of Nibbana, signifying that that method of analysis had reached its culmination.
mn115:10.2	“There are these six interior and exterior sense fields:	NA
mn115:10.3	the eye and sights, the ear and sounds, the nose and smells, the tongue and tastes, the body and touches, and the mind and ideas.	NA
mn115:10.4	When a mendicant knows and sees these six interior and exterior sense fields,	NA
mn115:10.5	they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the sense fields’.”	NA
mn115:11.1	“But sir, how is a mendicant qualified to be called ‘skilled in dependent origination’?”	NA
mn115:11.2	“It’s when a mendicant understands:	NA
mn115:11.3	‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises.	NA
mn115:11.4	When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is:	NA
mn115:11.5	ignorance is a condition for choices.	NA
mn115:11.6	Choices are conditions for consciousness.	NA
mn115:11.7	Consciousness is a condition for name and form.	NA
mn115:11.8	Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields.	NA
mn115:11.9	The six sense fields are conditions for contact.	NA
mn115:11.10	Contact is a condition for feeling.	NA
mn115:11.11	Feeling is a condition for craving.	NA
mn115:11.12	Craving is a condition for grasping.	NA
mn115:11.13	Grasping is a condition for continued existence.	NA
mn115:11.14	Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.	NA
mn115:11.15	Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be.	NA
mn115:11.16	That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.	NA
mn115:11.17	When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease.	NA
mn115:11.18	When choices cease, consciousness ceases.	NA
mn115:11.19	When consciousness ceases, name and form cease.	NA
mn115:11.20	When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease.	NA

mn115:11.27	When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease.	NA
mn115:11.28	That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’	NA
mn115:11.29	That’s how a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘skilled in dependent origination’.”	NA
mn115:12.1	“But sir, how is a mendicant qualified to be called ‘skilled in the possible and impossible’?”	Said to be one of the ten powers of a Realized One ([mn12:10.1](), [an10.22:3.3]()), and to be restricted to those with meditative immersion (_samādhi_, [an6.64:13.1]()). Each item here, split into separate suttas, is found at [an1.168]()–295. Briefer examples of this trope are found at [mn122:3.2](), [sn12.30](), [an6.70](), and [sn6.93](). These all focus on cause and effect as it pertains to development of the path.
mn115:12.2	“It’s when a mendicant understands: ‘It’s impossible for a person accomplished in view to take any condition as permanent. That is not possible.	A stream-enterer (or above) might unthinkingly act as if something were permanent (etc.), but on reflection they would know right away that this is not the case.
mn115:12.3	But it’s possible for an ordinary person to take some condition as permanent. That is possible.’	NA

mn115:13.2	But it’s possible for an ordinary person to murder their mother.’	NA

mn115:13.9	They understand: ‘It’s impossible for a person accomplished in view to dedicate themselves to another teacher.	This does not mean that they cannot learn from another teacher; rather, they know that the Buddha’s path leads to liberation because they have realized it for themselves.
mn115:13.10	But it’s possible for an ordinary person to dedicate themselves to another teacher.’	NA
mn115:14.1	They understand: ‘It’s impossible for two perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas to arise in the same solar system at the same time.	A _lokadhātu_ is a single system with an earth, a sun and moon, planets, and a set of heavenly realms. Thus with due allowance for the different context, it is similar to a “solar system”. While many Buddhas may arise in the same solar system, they may not arise in the same region at the same time. There may, however, be many Buddhas simultaneously throughout the galaxy, an idea developed in later texts (eg. Mahāvastu 1.122).
mn115:14.2	But it is possible for just one perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, to arise in one solar system.’	NA
mn115:14.3	They understand: ‘It’s impossible for two wheel-turning monarchs to arise in the same solar system at the same time.	A wheel-turning monarch was conceived as establishing dominion over the entire land from ocean to ocean, which apparently was believed to be the civilized world at the time the myth was created.
mn115:14.4	But it is possible for just one wheel-turning monarch to arise in one solar system.’	NA
mn115:15.1	They understand: ‘It’s impossible for a woman to be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha.	It is unclear why this is mentioned, and since the Chinese parallel MA 181 lacks this passage entirely, it may be a later addition. It is of no apparent spiritual relevance, since in early Buddhist texts there is no concept of aspiring to become a Buddha in future lives. A woman may, of course, realize full liberation as an arahant, so the issue is not spiritual prowess. As to the reasoning underlying the claim, in this passage the Buddha is followed by a wheel-turning monarch, Sakka, Māra, and Brahmā. What they all have in common is that they are leaders. Since leaders of the time were men, perhaps it was assumed that people would not follow a woman in that role. This reasoning would also seem to be behind the idea that the Buddha was born either an aristocrat or a brahmin, whichever was the leading class of the time ([dn14:1.5.1]()).

mn116:1.1	So I have heard.	This is a devotional sutta that lists the names of sages of the past. It is recited as a protection chant in Sri Lanka. The Chinese parallel shares only the opening passages, after which it is quite different. Moreover, only three of the names are clearly the same: Ariṭṭha, Upariṭṭha, and Sudassana (EA 38.7 at T ii 723a–c). | Ñāṇamoḷī and Bodhi both rightly note that it is difficult to distinguish names from attributes without the commentary. Yet the commentary leaves many problems unsolved, as it omits many names.
mn116:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Isigili Mountain.	Rājagaha is surrounded by an extensive range of hills, upon which ascetics of various kinds could be found striving.

mn116:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn116:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA

mn116:3.1	“It used to have exactly the same label and description.	NA
mn116:3.2	Once upon a time, five hundred Independent Buddhas dwelt for a long time on this Isigili.	The concept of the _paccekabuddha_ allows that there were awakened sages in the long periods of time when there is no _sambuddha_ such as Gotama. Both are Buddhas in the sense of being awakened, but they differ in their relation to others. It is sometimes said that they do not teach, but the tradition attributes to them a number of sayings (notably [snp1.3]()). They are sometimes said to be “solitary”, but here 500 dwell on the same hill, while _pacceka_ Brahmās appear in pairs ([sn6.6:1.3]()). Compare [pli-tv-bu-vb-np9:1.36.1](), where “independent” funds are set up for “independent” robes (rather than combining them); the same idea occurs at [an11.16:11.2](). Likewise, [sn1.37:1.7]() speaks of “independent” verses. Thus the burden of sense in the Pali is that _pacceka_ means “independent’, which here has the sense of not forming a fourfold community, but simply living and practicing independently.
mn116:3.3	They were seen entering the mountain, but after entering were seen no more.	NA
mn116:3.4	When people noticed this they said:	NA
mn116:3.5	‘That mountain swallows these seers!’	NA
mn116:3.6	That’s how it came to be known as Isigili, the “seer-swallower”.	This etymology is a deliberate pun, since the obvious explanation would be that _gili_ is simply _giri_ (“mountain”), as Pali *r* becomes *l* in the Magadhan dialect. This passage is not found in the Chinese parallel.
mn116:3.7	I shall declare the names of the Independent Buddhas;	Mahāvastu 21 lists many past _sambuddhas_, among whom we find names recorded here as _paccekabuddhas_, including Aparājita, Supatiṭṭhita, Bandhumā, Ariṭṭha, Tagarasikhi, Tissa, Sikhin, Accutagāma, Asayha, Uppala, Sudassana, Ketu, Jayanta, and Uttara.
mn116:3.8	I shall extol the names of the Independent Buddhas;	NA
mn116:3.9	I shall teach the names of the Independent Buddhas.	NA
mn116:3.10	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	I give the probable meaning of each name, and attempt, perhaps unwisely, to locate other sages of the past with similar names. In almost every case it is impossible to establish such links with any confidence, due to the lack of contextual details, the prevalence of common names used by many people, the use of names based on places or doctrinal concepts, and so on. Nonetheless, certain patterns emerge, especially the fact that several of the names seem to be shared with Jain _tīrthaṅkaras_. These are the  twenty-four founding fathers of Jainism through the ages, like the Buddhist concept of past Buddhas. As many as eight names might be shared with _tīrthaṅkaras_, while several others might be other Jain sages. Even the name of the sutta itself is the name of a sage Isigiri in Isibhāsiyāiṁ 34. It could be that both Buddhism and Jainism drew on shared traditions of ancient sages, but again, these similarities are all tentative at best.
mn116:3.11	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
mn116:3.12	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn116:4.1	“The independent Buddhas who dwelt for a long time on this Isigili were named Ariṭṭha,	An agent of Kuvera has this name (meaning “indestructible”) at [dn32:7.47](), where it is next to Nemi (below at [mn116:6.7]()). Ariṭṭha and Nemi often appear compounded in Sanskrit as Ariṣṭanemi. This was the name of a past Buddha (Mahāvastu 1.140), the 22nd Jain _tīrthaṅkara_ (Kalpasūtra 170–183), and a Brahmanical sage of remarkable power (Mahābhārata 3.182.8c). Ariṣṭanemi Tārkṣya, although a mythical being, was said to have composed Rig Veda 10.178.
mn116:4.2	Upariṭṭha,	This was the name of Anuruddha in a past life as an ascetic ([thag16.9:19.4]()), although it couldn’t be the same person, since Independent Buddhas are not reborn. It means “son of Ariṭṭha”.
mn116:4.3	Tagarasikhī,	Also named in [sn3.20](), [ud5.3](), and [ja390](), which makes him somewhat of a celebrity by _paccekabuddha_ standards. His name means “jasmine-crested”.
mn116:4.4	Yasassin,	“Renowned”.
mn116:4.5	Sudassana,	“Good-looking”.
mn116:4.6	Piyadassin,	Meaning “one who looks kindly”, this was the favored epithet of King Ashoka.
mn116:4.7	Gandhāra,	Elsewhere known as a nation famed for horses, located around modern Afghanistan (“Kandahar”, [an3.70:28.2]()) and its capital ([dn16:6.28.6]()). It was named after its founder, but he is otherwise not known as a sage. This could be any sage from Gandhāra (eg. Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra 10.11.9; see [ja406]()). Below we find several place names, which likewise probably refer to sages from those places.
mn116:4.8	Piṇḍola,	Meaning “alms-gatherer”, a Bhāradvāja of this name was a famous monk.
mn116:4.9	Upāsabha,	_Āsabha_ or _usabha_ (“bull”) is a common name; this is “son of Bull”.

mn116:5.8	Nīta, Tatha, Sutavā, and Bhāvitatta.	The names of these four occupy a similar semantic space: “Educated”, “True”, “Learned”, “Developed”.
mn116:6.1	Sumbha, Subha, Methula, and Aṭṭhama,	Sumbha is the name of a country, and this might be a sage from there. There is also a powerful _asura_ named Śumbha. | Subha (“beautiful”), Methula (“pair”; variant _matula_), and Aṭṭhama (“eighth”) are otherwise unknown. | This verse is omitted in the commentary.
mn116:6.2	then Assumegha, Anīgha, and Sudāṭha,	Assumegha (“tear-cloud”) should perhaps be read _sumegha_, “lovely cloud”, the name of a mountain. | Anīgha (“untroubled”) is otherwise unknown. | Sudāṭha (‘strong-tooth”) and Subāhu (below, “strong-arm”) are unknown as sages, but a lion and tiger of these names are identified with Sāriputta and Moggallāna in a past life ([ja361]()).
mn116:6.3	Independent Buddhas, <j>enders of the conduit to rebirth;	NA
mn116:6.4	and Hiṅgū and Hiṅga the mighty.	Hiṅgū (“asafoetida”, Hindi “hing”) and Hiṅga (the name of a people in Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa 58) are otherwise unknown.
mn116:6.5	Two sages named Jāli, and Aṭṭhaka;	Jāli (“one who has a net”, sometimes “fisherman”) is the name of one of Vessantara’s children ([ja547]()). | Aṭṭhaka was the name of a Vedic sage (see [mn95:13.9]() and note there).
mn116:6.6	then the awakened one Kosala, then Subāhu;	Kosala is another place name. | Subāhu is a common name for warriors or princes.
mn116:6.7	Upanemi, Nemi, and Santacitta,	Nemi (“rim”) was the name of the 22nd Jain _tīrthaṅkara_, where it is an abbreviation of _ariṣṭanemi_ (“indestructible rim”). | Take _so_ here as connective pronoun.
mn116:6.8	right and true, stainless and astute.	This line is not commented on, so each of these might be taken as a name rather than as attributes.
mn116:6.9	Kāḷa and Upakāḷa, Vijita and Jita,	Kāḷa (“dark/time”) is a common name; Upakāḷa is his son. | We might read _vijito jito_ as _vijito (a)jito_ (“one who has conquered”, “one who is unconquered”), in which case the name Ajita would be shared with the second Jain _tīrthaṅkara_.
mn116:6.10	Aṅga and Paṅga, and Guttijita too;	Aṅga (“limb”) is a kingdom, and is sometimes found as a personal name. | Paṅga may be a variant spelling of Vaṅga, i.e. Bengal. | Guttijita means “guard and conqueror (of the senses)”.
mn116:6.11	Passin gave up attachment, suffering’s root,	Passi most obviously means “seer”. But perhaps it could be from the root _passa_ (“side”), making this the 23rd Jain _tīrthaṅkara_ Pārśva, who immediately preceded Mahāvīra.
mn116:6.12	while Aparājita defeated Māra’s power.	Aparājita (“unconquered by another”) is a common name. It was the name of Śāntinātha, the 16th Jain _tīrthaṅkara_, in a past life.
mn116:6.13	Satthar, Pavattar, Sarabhaṅga, Lomahaṁsa,	Satthar (“teacher”) is used in both Buddhism (usually for the Buddha) and Jainism. Pavattar (“roller-forth”, “proclaimer”) has a similar sense. | Sarabhaṅga (“arrow-breaker”) was a forest hermit in Daṇḍaka. See note at [mn56:13.27](). | Lomahaṁsa means “hair raising”.
mn116:6.14	Uccaṅgamāya, Asita, Anāsava,	Asita (“dark one”) was the name of the sage who attended Siddhattha after his birth ([snp3.11]()), while an Asita Devala also features in [mn93](). The Rig Veda attributes several hymns to Asita or Devala (sometimes said to be his son) of the Kāśyapa clan. Asita Devala also appears in the Jain Isibhāsiyāiṁ chapter 3. | Anāsava means “undefiled”. Freedom from “defilement” is a key concept in Jainism.
mn116:6.15	Manomaya, and Bandhumā the cutter of conceit,	NA
mn116:6.16	then Adhimutta, and Ketumā the immaculate.	The commentary says _tadādhimutto_ is the only name in this line, but I take _tad(ā)_ as a connective pronoun, leaving _adhimutta_ (“faithful”) as the name. Moreover, since the syntax echoes the previous line, I construe it the same way, making _ketumā_ a proper name, meaning one who is “adorned with banners” (like the sun). There are several people and places of this name in Sanskrit, among them at least one sage; it corresponds to Ketu in Mahāvastu 21. See also _ketumatī_, said to be an old name of Varanasi ([dn26:23.8]()). On the other hand, I follow the commentary in taking _vimalo_ as an attribute (“immaculate”), but it could be a proper name, in which case it would be shared with Vimala, the 13th Jain _tīrthaṅkara_.
mn116:6.17	Ketumbharāga, Mātaṅga, and Ariya,	Ketumbharāga is “cloud-colored”. | Mātaṅga (“one who goes where they wish”, i.e. “elephant”) is the name of an outcast who became a sage (Skandapurāṇa 5.2.60). In other Buddhist versions of this story, he ascends to the Brahmā realm ([snp1.7:26.1]()), in which case he is identified with the Bodhisatta ([ja497]()). This contradicts the present sutta, for a _paccekabuddha_ is not reborn anywhere. Either there were several sages of this name, or else the memory of a past sage was rather vaguely specified. In the Jain Isibhāsiyāiṁ chapter 26, he criticizes so-called Brahmins who practice violence. See too note on [mn56:13.27](). | A sage named Ariya is found in Isibhāsiyāiṁ chapter 19, where he teaches a doctrine of “civility”.
mn116:6.18	then Accuta, Accutagāma, and Byāmaka,	Accuta (“unfallen”) is a name of Agni (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.6.1.6) and later Viṣṇu/Kṛṣṇa. | If Accuta is Viṣṇu/Kṛṣṇa, perhaps Accutagāma is a garbled form of his elder brother Balarāma’s name Acyutāgraja (“firstborn of the unfallen”). | Byāmaka means “fathom-long”.
mn116:6.19	Sumaṅgala, Dabbila, Supatiṭṭhita,	Sumaṅgala (“good fortune”) is a common name. A Jain text tells of a king of that name who became an ascetic in later life (Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra 10.6.2). [ja420]() tells of how a park-keeper named Sumaṅgala accidentally killed a _paccekabuddha_. | Dabbila probably refers to one who uses the sacrificial “ladle” (_darvi_, see [mn93:18.71]() and note). | Supatiṭṭhita (“well-established”) might be an attribute; commentary is silent, but Mahāvastu 21 takes it as a name.
mn116:6.20	Asayha, Khemābhirata, and Sorata.	“Unbeatable”, “lover of sanctuary”, and “gentle”.
mn116:6.21	Durannaya, Saṅgha, and also Ujjaya,	Durannaya means “hard to follow”. | Saṅgha (“community”) is a fairly common name in Pali. | Ujjaya (“victory”) in Pali is the name of a brahmin ([an4.39](), [an8.55]()) and a mendicant ([thag1.47]()). The city of Ujjeni in Avantī is sometimes spelled _ujjaya_, so this is perhaps someone from there.
mn116:6.22	another sage, Sayha of peerless effort.	Sayha is the name of a mountain district in which the Godāvarī arises (Trimbakeshwar Range). It is south of Ujjeni, so perhaps both of these are places.
mn116:6.23	There are twelve Ānandas, Nandas, and Upanandas,	The commentary says there were four of each, making twelve in total. All are common names meaning “joy”.
mn116:6.24	and Bhāradvāja, bearing his final body.	Bhāradvāja, one of the seven great Vedic sages, founded a storied lineage ([dn32:10.3](), [mn95:11.2]()).
mn116:6.25	Bodhi, Mahānāma, and also Uttara,	“Awakening”, “great name”, and “north/supreme” are all common names.
mn116:6.26	Kesī, Sikhī, Sundara, and Bhāradvāja,	In Jainism, Keśi is a noted ascetic disciple of Pārśva (Uttarādhyayanasūtra 23.2). | Sikhī was a former Buddha ([sn6.14]()), whose name is solar in connotation ([dn14:1.12.4]()): the streaming radiance of the sun. The sun is also said to be _kesi_ (“hairy”) for the same reason (eg. Rig Veda 10.136.1), so these two names go together. | Sundara (“beautiful”) is a common name. | The presence of a second Bhāradvāja creates tension, since duplicates are mostly avoided. The Mahāsaṅgīti resolves it by reading _dvārabhāja_ here, which is otherwise unattested. In her translation, Horner took _athopi uttaro_ in the previous line as “also another” Bhāradvāja, with the other items as attributes. However, I leave the tension unresolved, as there were many Bhāradvājas.
mn116:6.27	Tissa and Upatissa, <j>who’ve both cut the bonds to rebirth,	Tissa is a common name, meaning “born under the star Sirius”. Notably, Tissa follows Bhāradvāja; both were names of the chief disciples of Kassapa Buddha, and were associated with Mount Vepulla of Rājagaha in a former age ([sn15.20:4.6]()).
mn116:6.28	Upasīdarī and Sīdarī, who’ve both cut off craving.	Sīdarī perhaps means “dweller by the _Sīdā_”, which in Pali tradition is a river in the Himalayas beside which ascetics flourish ([ja541:16.1]()). It is probably a variant spelling of _sītā_ (“cold”), a common name for rivers. The tenth Jain _tīrthaṅkara_ has the similar name Śītala.
mn116:6.29	Maṅgala was awakened, free of greed,	Maṅgala (“(good) omen”) is a common name.
mn116:6.30	Usabha cut the net, the root of suffering,	Usabha (“bull”) is _ṛṣabha_ in Sanskrit. It was the name of several Brahmanical sages, as well as the first Jain _tīrthaṅkara_.
mn116:6.31	Upanīta who attained the state of peace,	Upanīta means “one who has been initiated” in the _upanayana_ ritual, by which a boy undertakes Vedic studies.
mn116:6.32	Uposatha, Sundara, and Saccanāma.	Uposatha (“sabbath”) is the name of King Sudassana’s royal elephant ([dn17:2.5.5]()). | This is the second Sundara; one or both might be an attribute. | Saccanāma (“one whose name is true”) recalls the famous sage Satyakāma Jābāla of Chāndogya Upaniṣad 4.4.
mn116:6.33	Jeta, Jayanta, Paduma, and Uppala;	All these are common names. Jeta and Jayanta both mean “victor”, while Paduma and Uppala both mean “lotus”. In Jainism, Paduma recalls the name of the sixth _tīrthaṅkara_, Padmaprabha (“lotus-shine”), while a sage named Jayanta practiced in the mountains during a previous incarnation of the _tīrthaṅkara_ Śanti (Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra 5.1.9).
mn116:6.34	Padumuttara, Rakkhita, and Pabbata,	Padumuttara (“supreme lotus”) is well known in Theravāda as the name of the thirteenth of the twenty-eight Buddhas. Jains recognize two sages of this name, as incarnations of the _tīrthaṅkaras_ Śītala and Vāsupūjya (Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra 3.8.1, 4.2.1). | Rakkhita (“protected”) is common name. Here it is followed by another place name, Pabbata (“mountain”). A sage Rakkhita of the mountains features in the related Jātaka stories told at Mahāvastu 28a and [ja505](). Parvata is also the name of a Vedic poet, who legend says was a nephew of Nārada.
mn116:6.35	Mānatthaddha, beautiful and free of greed,	Mānatthaddha means “stiff with pride”; a brahmin of that name appears in [sn7.15](). Presumably it was an old nickname that stuck.
mn116:6.36	and the Buddha Kaṇha, his mind well freed.	Kaṇha (“dark”) is better known by his Sanskrit name Krishna. While the god of that name is not prominent in the suttas, it does seem as if elements of his story were known ([dn3:1.23.8]()).
mn116:7.1	These and other mighty ones <j>awakened independently,	I count 103 named _paccekabuddhas_ in total. However, the number is not certain, given the ambiguity between names and attributes.

mn117:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn117:2.1	“Mendicants, I will teach you noble right immersion with its vital conditions and its prerequisites.	The first portion of this sutta is also at [sn45.28:1.2](), to which the current sutta can be seen as a commentary. | “Vital condition” is _upanisa_; this is a condition for something that is both necessary and strongly conducive. | “Prerequiste” is _parikkhāra_, the “equipment” or “requirement”.
mn117:2.2	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn117:2.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
mn117:2.4	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn117:3.1	“And what is noble right immersion with its vital conditions and its prerequisites?	NA
mn117:3.2	They are: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness.	NA
mn117:3.3	Unification of mind with these seven factors as prerequisites	NA
mn117:3.4	is what is called noble right immersion ‘with its vital conditions’ and also ‘with its prerequisites’.	While it is possible to obtain immersion outside the context of the noble eightfold path, without all the factors of the path working together it does not result in liberation and hence is not “right” immersion. | This became known in the Abhidhamma as _lokuttara jhāna_, where it is used in the same sense as the sutta: a meditative absorption which, empowered by all the path factors in concert, leads to the realization of the Dhamma. This is contrasted with the _lokiya jhāna_ that leads only to rebirth in the Brahmā realm; see comment on [mn7:19.6](). Later, the commentarial tradition analyzed it further as a series of mind moments that occur at the occasion of realization.
mn117:4.1	In this context, right view comes first.	In the Gradual Training, it is hearing the Dhamma that sets you on the path ([mn101:31.1]()).
mn117:4.2	And how does right view come first?	NA
mn117:4.3	When you understand wrong view as wrong view and right view as right view, that’s your right view.	It is not just learning by rote, but the ability to make critical distinctions.
mn117:5.1	And what is wrong view?	NA
mn117:5.2	‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’	NA
mn117:5.3	This is wrong view.	NA
mn117:6.1	And what is right view?	NA
mn117:6.2	Right view is twofold, I say.	NA
mn117:6.3	There is right view that is accompanied by defilements, partakes of good deeds, and ripens in attachments.	This unique phrase refers to the kind of right view that results in a good rebirth but not liberation. This kind of right view is not specifically Buddhist. Compare _sāsavaṁ upādāniyaṁ_ (the five grasping aggregates “accompanied by defilements and prone to being grasped”, [sn22.48:2.2]()) and _iddhi sāsavā saupadhikā, ‘no ariyā’ti_ (“psychic powers that are accompanied by defilements and attachments, and are said to be ignoble”, [dn28:18.3]()). | For “partakes of good deeds” (_puññabhāgiyā_), see [an6.63](), where it refers to a rebirth that results from “defilement”.
mn117:6.4	And there is right view that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path.	This is the right view of one on the noble path. The suttas do not elsewhere distinguish these two kinds of path factors, and the “transcendent” analysis is not found in the parallels in Chinese (MA 189 at T i 735b) or Tibetan (Up 6.080 at D 4094 mngon pa, nyu 43b7). A similar distinction, however, is made in the Chinese translation of the Saṁyukta Āgama of the (Mūla)-Sarvāstivāda at SA 785 and SA 789, which contains analyses of the transcendent factors that are similar to those in Pali. | “Transcendent” (_lokuttara_) means “leading beyond the world (of transmigration)”. Elsewhere in early texts it is used of discourses ([sn20.7:1.6](), [sn55.53:2.2](), [an2.47:1.5](), [an5.79:5.2](); see too [mn96:12.12]()), and of certain reflective realizations of a noble one ([mn48:14.7](), [mn122:18.1]()).
mn117:7.1	And what is right view that is accompanied by defilements, partakes of good deeds, and ripens in attachments?	NA
mn117:7.2	‘There is meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There are such things as mother and father, and beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’	NA
mn117:7.3	This is right view that is accompanied by defilements, partakes of good deeds, and ripens in attachments.	NA
mn117:8.1	And what is right view that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path?	NA
mn117:8.2	It’s the wisdom—the faculty of wisdom, the power of wisdom, the awakening factor of investigation of principles, and right view as a factor of the path—in one intent on the noble, intent on the undefiled, who possesses the noble path and develops the noble path.	Whereas elsewhere right view is explained in terms of *what* you understand (the four noble truths [mn141:24.1]()), this analysis shifts focus to *how* you understand: wisdom functions in the context of the path as a whole. Later texts expand on this (eg. [mnd2:82.4](), [ne17:17.3](), [ds2.1.1:28.2]()). | As to the phrase “intent on the noble, intent on the undefiled”, the expressions _ariyacitta_ and  _anāsavacitta_ are unique. It is tempting to translate _anāsavacitta_ as “undefiled mind”, but that would pertain only to the arahant who has completed the path, whereas this is talking about one still in the process of developing the path. Here _citta_ must mean “intention” (eg. [mn120:3.4](); cf. the later term _bodhicitta_). Commentary is silent.
mn117:8.3	This is called right view that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path.	NA
mn117:9.1	They make an effort to give up wrong view and embrace right view: that’s their right effort.	NA
mn117:9.2	Mindfully they give up wrong view and take up right view: that’s their right mindfulness.	NA
mn117:9.3	So these three things keep running and circling around right view, namely: right view, right effort, and right mindfulness.	The path is linear in that each factor depends on the previous ([mn117:34.3](), see too eg. [sn45.1]()). But it is not *just* linear, as the factors are always interacting. Right view understands what to do; right effort does the work; and right mindfulness monitors and checks.
mn117:10.1	In this context, right view comes first.	Right view is the anterior condition for all the path factors.
mn117:10.2	And how does right view come first?	NA

mn117:14.1	And what is right thought that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path?	NA
mn117:14.2	It’s the thinking—the placing of the mind, thought, planting, implanting, embedding of the mind, verbal process—in one intent on the noble, intent on the undefiled, who possesses the noble path and develops the noble path.	This passage shows that the scope of _saṅkappa_ or _vitakka_ is wider than discursive “thought”, especially in deep meditation. This definition is similar to that in the Abhidhamma (eg. [vb3:23.2]()) | _Takka_ (“thinking”) is normally “logic” but here is a synonym of _vitakka_. | _Appanā_ (“planting”) is where a movement enters its goal, as a river the ocean ([sn15.8:2.3]()), or a peg the wood ([mil3.3.13](), for which see also [mn20.3.4]()). | _Byappanā_ is an intensive form that appears only in this definition. | _Abhiniropana_ is likewise a unique term, with the sense of “sinking into” or “embedding”. Compare Sanskrit _āropaṇa_, “placing or fixing in or upon”. | For “verbal process” see [mn44:15.3]() = [sn41.6:2.4]().

mn117:19.1	And what is right speech that is accompanied by defilements, partakes of good deeds, and ripens in attachments?	NA
mn117:19.2	The refraining from lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, and talking nonsense.	Right speech is defined solely as abstinence here, whereas elsewhere it also includes actually speaking in a constructive way (eg. [mn114:6.18]()).

Defined for a monastic in the long section on ethics in the Sāmaññaphalasutta ([dn2:56.1]()) and for a lay person as trade in weapons, living creatures, meat, intoxicants, and poisons ([an5.177:1.3]()).

mn117:33.3	So these three things keep running and circling around right livelihood, namely: right view, right effort, and right mindfulness.	This, the fifth factor of the path, is the last factor described as encompassed by right view, effort, and mindfulness. I think a purpose of this discourse is to make it clear that they *also* apply to the first five factors, the final three being taken as self-evident.
mn117:34.1	In this context, right view comes first.	NA
mn117:34.2	And how does right view come first?	NA
mn117:34.3	Right view gives rise to right thought. Right thought gives rise to right speech. Right speech gives rise to right action. Right action gives rise to right livelihood. Right livelihood gives rise to right effort. Right effort gives rise to right mindfulness. Right mindfulness gives rise to right immersion. Right immersion gives rise to right knowledge. Right knowledge gives rise to right freedom.	This extends the linear arising to two additional factors: right knowledge and right freedom (see also [dn18:27.8](), [an10.103:2.3]()). These are not divided into two kinds, as they apply solely to the perfected ones.
mn117:34.4	So the trainee has eight factors, while the perfected one has ten factors.	Right knowledge is the wisdom perfected by the ending of defilements, while right freedom is the liberation from rebirth.

mn118:0.1	Middle Discourses 118	NA
mn118:0.2	Mindfulness of Breathing	NA
mn118:1.1	So I have heard.	Mindfulness of breathing is taught partially in the Satipaṭṭhānasutta ([mn10:4.3]() = [dn22:2.3]()) and the Kāyagatāsatisutta ([mn119:4.2]()), and fully in the Rāhulovādasutta ([mn62:24.3]()), the Girimānandasutta ([an10.60]()), and throughout the relevant Saṁyutta ([sn54.1]() ff.); it is also in the Vinaya ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.6]()) and in the quasi-Abhidhamma text Paṭisambhidāmagga ([ps1.3:60.3]()). It is regarded in the tradition as the method practiced by the Buddha himself, and has remained the most popular and universal meditation to this day, both in Buddhism and generally.
mn118:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery, together with several well-known senior disciples, such as	NA
mn118:1.3	the venerables Sāriputta, Mahāmoggallāna, Mahākassapa, Mahākaccāna, Mahākoṭṭhita, Mahākappina, Mahācunda, Anuruddha, Revata, Ānanda, and others.	The similar list of great disciples is found at [ud1.5:1.3](), where the Buddha described them as true brahmins.
mn118:2.1	Now at that time the senior mendicants were advising and instructing the junior mendicants.	This reminds us that what is recorded in the suttas is not the totality of what was taught. There are several instances where more personal meditation instructions are given (eg. [an9.3]()), and this must have been ongoing.
mn118:2.2	Some senior mendicants instructed ten mendicants, while some instructed twenty, thirty, or forty.	NA
mn118:2.3	Being instructed by the senior mendicants, the junior mendicants realized a higher distinction than they had before.	NA
mn118:3.1	Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by a Saṅgha of monks for the invitation to admonish.	This was the end of the rains retreat, during which mendicants stayed in one place. To conclude the retreat, the mendicants gather to invite admonition from each other, clearing the air of any conflicts or tensions that might have arisen during the retreat. This is done instead of the regular recitation of the Pātimokkha rules. Discussed in detail at [pli-tv-kd4]().
mn118:3.2	Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of mendicants, who were so very silent. He addressed them:	NA
mn118:4.1	“I am satisfied, mendicants, with this practice.	NA
mn118:4.2	My heart is satisfied with this practice.	NA
mn118:4.3	So you should rouse up even more energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.	NA
mn118:4.4	I will wait here in Sāvatthī for the Komudī full moon of the fourth month.”	The “fourth month” of the rainy season (_vassa_), of which the rains retreat (_vassāvāsa_) is normally the first three. When the retreat is finished, mendicants usually stay in the monastery for a while to complete the _kaṭhina_ ([pli-tv-kd7]()), repair their robes, and otherwise make preparations for wandering. During this time, it was customary for mendicants who had spent the rains elsewhere to visit Sāvatthī to see the Buddha ([pli-tv-kd4:1.8.1](), [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.1](), [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.1]()). This month, which falls between the full moons of October and November, is called Kattikā after the constellation Pleiades. The final day of Kattikā is the full moon of Komudī, named after the white lotuses said to bloom at that time, and after the brilliance of the moon in the clear skies following the rains (see eg. [mn79:17.2]()).
mn118:5.1	Mendicants from around the country heard about this,	NA
mn118:5.2	NA	NA
mn118:5.3	and came down to Sāvatthī to see the Buddha.	NA

mn118:7.1	Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the Komudī full moon on the fifteenth day of the fourth month—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by a Saṅgha of monks.	NA
mn118:7.2	Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of mendicants, who were so very silent. He addressed them:	A similar passage is found at [an4.190]().

mn118:8.9	An assembly such as this is worth traveling many leagues to see, even if you have to carry your own provisions in a knapsack.	“Knapsack” is _puṭosa_, where _puṭa_ is “bag” and _osa_ is “food” (Sanskrit _avasa_). The compound is a dative-dependent _tappurisa_ with reversal of the usual order, yielding the sense “bag for food”.

mn118:15.1	Mendicants, when mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it is very fruitful and beneficial.	The main contents of the discourse are summarized in these four statements, each of which is expanded in the four sections that follow.
mn118:15.2	Mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated, fulfills the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.	NA
mn118:15.3	The four kinds of mindfulness meditation, when developed and cultivated, fulfill the seven awakening factors.	NA
mn118:15.4	And the seven awakening factors, when developed and cultivated, fulfill knowledge and freedom.	NA
mn118:16.1	And how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial?	NA
mn118:17.1	It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in their presence.	The situation here—a mendicant gone to the forest—establishes that this practice takes place in the wider context of the Gradual Training. Indeed, this whole sutta can be understood as an expansion of this phrase, mentioned briefly at [dn2:67.3]().
mn118:17.2	Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.	The most fundamental meditation instruction. Notice how the Buddha phrases it: not “concentrate on the breath” as an object, but rather “breathing” as an activity to which one brings mindfulness. The stages of breath meditation are not meant to be done deliberately, but to be observed and understood as the natural process of deepening meditation.
mn118:18.1	Breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’	In the beginning, the breath is somewhat rough and coarse. The Pali idiom is “long” and “short” breath, but in English we usually say one breathes “heavily” or “lightly”.
mn118:18.2	When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ Breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’	Over time, the breath becomes more subtle and soft.
mn118:18.3	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the whole body.’	The “whole body” (_sabbakāya_) here refers to the breath, marking the fuller and more continuous awareness that arises with tranquility. Some, however, interpret it as the “whole physical body”, broadening awareness to encompass the movement and settling of energies throughout the body.
mn118:18.4	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the physical process.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the physical process.’	The “physical process” (_kāyasaṅkhāra_) is the breath itself ([sn41.6:1.8]()). This can become so soft as to be imperceptible.
mn118:19.1	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing rapture.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing rapture.’	“Rapture” (_pīti_) is a joyous emotional response to pleasure, usually a spiritual sense of elevation or uplift in meditation. Normally rapture is said to arise before tranquility as part of the process leading towards absorption (see below, [mn118:34.1]()). In mindfulness of breathing, however, the body typically becomes quite tranquil before rapture arises.
mn118:19.2	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing bliss.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing bliss.’	The uplifting quality of rapture becomes sublimated to a more subtle, pervasive pleasure or bliss. The meditator refines and stabilizes these positive emotions in their journey towards absorption, which occurs when all necessary factors are fully developed and perfectly balanced in a subtle union.
mn118:19.3	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing mental processes.’	“Mental processes” are said to be “perception and feeling” ([mn44:14.1](), [sn41.6:1.7]()). The “feelings” include rapture and bliss. “Perception” in meditation includes the “light” ([mn128:28.2]()) or “forms” ([mn77:23.14]()) often experienced by meditators at this point. Later texts call this a _nimitta_, a “sign” that the mind is becoming subtle and the hindrances quiet as the meditator nears absorption.
mn118:19.4	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling mental processes.’	A paradox of meditation is that the stronger things are, the more subtle they become. In the initial stages of practice, it is common to have overwhelming experiences of rapture, with tears of joy, or dramatic and striking “visions”. Inexperienced meditators often take this to signify a profound realization. With patient mindfulness, however, the feelings and perceptions settle down and become unified, so they are no longer experienced as separate things. Just as the physical breath virtually disappeared, here too the feelings and perceptions can become so subtle as to feel like the simple, normal state of the mind.
mn118:20.1	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the mind.’	With the stilling of “mental processes”, the mind itself becomes clear, the center of awareness that knows all of this. These four factors focus on the experience of absorption.
mn118:20.2	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in gladdening the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out gladdening the mind.’	This applies especially to the first two absorptions.
mn118:20.3	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in immersing the mind in samādhi.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out immersing the mind in samādhi.’	“Immersion” (_samādhi_) is deep meditative stillness. The word conveys the sense of “gathered”, “collected”, with a secondary sense of “ignited”, “illuminated”. It emphasizes both the stability of the mind as well as the unification of all the mental factors present (see [mn44:12.2]() and note there).
mn118:20.4	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in freeing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out freeing the mind.’	The mind is liberated from hindrances in absorption. This is a state so very refined it is called the “bliss of awakening” ([mn139:9.18]()), albeit temporarily ([an5.149]()).
mn118:21.1	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing impermanence.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing impermanence.’	The first twelve steps focused on serenity (_samatha_), and now the final four steps shift focus to discernment (or “insight”, _vipassanā_). This exemplifies the most common course of practice, where serenity precedes discernment ([an4.170:3.2]()). Here, impermanence is contemplated in the context of mindfulness of breathing itself. The entire course of practice has seen the physical energies of the breath become subtle and fade, then the mental processes, then the mind itself is transformed. The meditator reflects on these changes and sees not simply that change happens, but how changes happen due to causes.
mn118:21.2	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing fading away.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing fading away.’	_Virāga_ means both “dispassion” in the sense of letting go desire, and “fading away” in the sense of its gradual disappearance.
mn118:21.3	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing cessation.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing cessation.’	This refers to the permanent ending of the fetters or underlying tendencies.
mn118:21.4	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’	This is the full renunciation of all worldly desires that occurs with arahantship (“perfection”). These final four stages illustrating the progress of insight can even be mapped on to the four stages of awakening: the stream-enterer sees that “whatever has a beginning also has an end”; for the once-returner, greed and hate are fading away; for the non-returner, greed and hate have ceased; and for the arahant, all defilements are relinquished.
mn118:22.1	Mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated in this way, is very fruitful and beneficial.	NA
mn118:23.1	And how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation?	NA
mn118:24.1	Whenever a mendicant knows that they breathe heavily,	NA
mn118:24.2	or lightly,	NA
mn118:24.3	or experiencing the whole body,	NA
mn118:24.4	or stilling physical processes—	NA
mn118:24.5	at that time they’re meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
mn118:24.6	For I say that the in-breaths and out-breaths are an aspect of the body.	The Pali here is _kāyesu kāyaññataraṁ_, literally, “a body among the bodies”. What it means is that the breath, as one of the four material elements, is a certain aspect of our physical embodiment which is selected here for contemplation, rather than, say, the parts of the body or the postures as we find in the full presentation of _satipaṭṭhāna_ at [mn10]() or [mn119]().
mn118:24.7	That’s why at that time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
mn118:25.1	Whenever a mendicant practices breathing while experiencing rapture,	NA
mn118:25.2	or experiencing bliss,	NA
mn118:25.3	or experiencing mental processes,	NA
mn118:25.4	or stilling mental processes—	NA
mn118:25.5	at that time they meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
mn118:25.6	For I say that careful application of mind to the in-breaths and out-breaths is an aspect of feelings.	Likewise, the sense here is that the pleasant feelings of breath meditation are part of the full spectrum of feelings contemplated in _satipaṭṭhāna_, which include painful feelings ([mn10:32.1]()). The meditator “carefully” (_sādhukaṁ_) focuses on these feelings as they manifest in the breath. The point is that “breath” is not purely a physical phenomenon. The material property of “air” is its most obvious dimension, but we experience breath as a complex that includes emotional and cognitive dimensions. As the physical process becomes subtle, feeling becomes apparent as an aspect of the breath that has always been there, but not clearly perceived.
mn118:25.7	That’s why at that time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
mn118:26.1	Whenever a mendicant practices breathing while experiencing the mind,	NA
mn118:26.2	or gladdening the mind,	NA
mn118:26.3	or immersing the mind in samādhi,	NA
mn118:26.4	or freeing the mind—	NA
mn118:26.5	at that time they meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
mn118:26.6	There is no development of mindfulness of breathing for someone who is unmindful and lacks awareness, I say.	Here the manner of explanation is changed, but the sense is not dissimilar. At [mn10:34.1]() the contemplation of mind includes states of mind characterized by greed, hate, and delusion, which are experienced by one lacking mindfulness and awareness. Mindfulness of breathing, however, focuses on the purified mind states of deep meditation. It is also perhaps noteworthy that the third absorption is said to be characterized by mindfulness and awareness, while the fourth absorption is characterized by equanimity, which is highlighted in the next step.
mn118:26.7	That’s why at that time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
mn118:27.1	Whenever a mendicant practices breathing while observing impermanence,	NA
mn118:27.2	or observing fading away,	NA
mn118:27.3	or observing cessation,	NA
mn118:27.4	or observing letting go—	NA
mn118:27.5	at that time they meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
mn118:27.6	Having seen with wisdom the giving up of covetousness and displeasure, they watch over closely with equanimity.	“Covetousness and displeasure” are the defilements relinquished in _satipaṭṭhāna_ itself ([mn10:3.2]()). This passage refers to reviewing or reflective knowledge, looking back over the course of meditation, seeing how the defilements are abandoned, and understanding how this happens according to the “principles” (_dhammā_) of cause and effect. With understanding comes equanimity, as one is no longer attached.
mn118:27.7	That’s why at that time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
mn118:28.1	That’s how mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated, fulfills the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.	NA
mn118:29.1	And how are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors?	The seven awakening factors are included in the fourth _satipaṭṭhāna_ under contemplation of principles ([mn10:42.1]()). There, their primary function is to eliminate the five hindrances, the causal contemplation of which is a prominent feature of suttas on this topic ([sn46.2]()). Thus this expands on the details of the “observation of principles”.
mn118:30.1	Whenever a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body, at that time their mindfulness is established and lucid.	NA
mn118:30.2	At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of mindfulness; they develop it and perfect it.	The “awakening factor of mindfulness” may, as here, refer to meditation, or else to the recollection of the teachings ([sn46.3:1.9]()).
mn118:31.1	As they live mindfully in this way they investigate, explore, and inquire into that principle with wisdom.	NA
mn118:31.2	At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of investigation of principles; they develop it and perfect it.	Likewise, _dhamma_ can refer as here to the “principles” of cause and effect, or else the “teachings” that are recollected ([sn46.3:2.4]()).

The final three terms here are almost identical to the final three stages of mindfulness of breathing: fading away, cessation, and letting go. One of the purposes of this sutta has been to show the deep interconnectedness of all these practices.
mn118:43.1	That’s how the seven awakening factors, when developed and cultivated, fulfill knowledge and freedom.”	NA
mn118:43.2	That is what the Buddha said.	NA

mn119:0.1	Middle Discourses 119	NA
mn119:0.2	Mindfulness of the Body	NA
mn119:1.1	So I have heard.	This discourse features the same meditation practices found under the “observation of the body” in the Satipaṭṭhānasutta ([mn10]()).
mn119:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn119:2.1	Then after the meal, on return from almsround, several mendicants sat together in the assembly hall and this discussion came up among them.	NA
mn119:2.2	“It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing,	NA
mn119:2.3	how the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha has said that mindfulness of the body, when developed and cultivated, is very fruitful and beneficial.”	NA
mn119:2.4	But their conversation was left unfinished. Then the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall. He sat on the seat spread out	NA
mn119:2.5	and addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn119:2.6	“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	NA
mn119:2.7	So the mendicants told him what they had been talking about. The Buddha said:	NA
mn119:2.8	NA	NA
mn119:2.9	NA	NA
mn119:2.10	NA	NA
mn119:3.1	“And how, mendicants, is mindfulness of the body developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial?	NA
mn119:4.1	It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in their presence.	NA
mn119:4.2	Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.	NA
mn119:4.3	Breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’	NA
mn119:4.4	When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ Breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’	NA
mn119:4.5	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the whole body.’	NA
mn119:4.6	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the physical process.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the physical process.’	NA
mn119:4.7	As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts tied to domestic life are given up.	For “memories and thoughts tied to lay life” (_gehasitā sarasaṅkappā_) see [mn125:23.5]() and [sn54.8:5.2](). | _Sarasaṅkappā_ may be translated in two ways. Bodhi reads it as a _dvanda_ compound (“memories and thoughts”), which takes _sara_ as “memory” (Sanskrit _smara_ or _smṛti_). The commentary, followed by Ānandajoti, explains it as _dhāvanasaṅkappā_ (“rushing thoughts”), which assumes the sense “flow” (Sanskrit _saras_). Support for the _dvanda_ interpretation comes from Sanskrit texts, where we frequently find _smṛtisaṁkalpa_ as either two words (eg. Aitareya Upaniṣad 3.2) or a compound (Nyāyasūtra 4.2.34).
mn119:4.8	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	Each practice leads directly to immersion, reminding us that mindfulness meditation is “the basis of immersion” (_samādhinimitta_, [mn44:12.3]()).
mn119:4.9	That’s how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.	NA
mn119:5.1	Furthermore, when a mendicant is walking they know ‘I am walking’. When standing they know ‘I am standing’. When sitting they know ‘I am sitting’. And when lying down they know ‘I am lying down’.	NA
mn119:5.2	Whatever posture their body is in, they know it.	NA
mn119:5.3	As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts tied to domestic life are given up.	NA
mn119:5.4	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	NA
mn119:5.5	That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.	NA
mn119:6.1	Furthermore, a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.	Obviously this passage is not suggesting that one enters deep meditation while going to the toilet. As per the Gradual Training, such practices form a foundation that prepares the mind for meditation.
mn119:6.2	As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts tied to domestic life are given up.	NA
mn119:6.3	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	NA
mn119:6.4	That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.	NA
mn119:7.1	Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth.	NA
mn119:7.2	‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’	NA
mn119:7.3	It’s as if there were a bag with openings at both ends, filled with various kinds of grains, such as	NA
mn119:7.4	fine rice, wheat, mung beans, peas, sesame, and ordinary rice.	NA
mn119:7.5	And someone with clear eyes were to open it and examine the contents:	NA
mn119:7.6	‘These grains are fine rice, these are wheat, these are mung beans, these are peas, these are sesame, and these are ordinary rice.’	NA
mn119:7.7	In the same way, a mendicant examines their own body, up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth. …	Such meditations, as also the contemplation on death that follow, lead to immersion by ridding the mind of desire. While the subject of meditation is perceived as unpleasant, when the mind is free of desire it gives rise to a pleasure imbued with lightness and freedom, and it is that pleasure that leads to immersion.

mn119:18.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	In the Satipaṭṭhānasutta, the practice of absorption is implicit in the contemplation of feelings (as spiritual pleasure), mind (as immersed mind, etc.), and principles (as the awakening factor of immersion), while the four absorptions are mentioned explicitly in the expanded version ([dn22:21.32]()). Here they take an even more central role.
mn119:18.2	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.

The kneading is the “placing the mind and keeping it connected”, the water is bliss, while the lack of leaking speaks to the contained interiority of the experience.

The phrase _sati sati āyatane_ is tricky. Syntactically, it is a locative absolute construction, which Bodhi treats as conditional: “there being a suitable basis”. However this does not readily account for the repeated _sati_, which he takes as the locative present participle from the verb _atthi_ (“being”). Ānandajoti, by contrast, takes the first _sati_ as “being” and the second as “mindfulness”, and treats the absolute construction as temporal: “while there is a basis for mindfulness”. Further, both accept the commentary’s gloss of _āyatana_ as _kāraṇa_ (“reason, basis”), although this sense of _āyatana_ is rare in the suttas (but see [sn12.25:14.3]() = [an4.171:5.3]()). These readings of the absolute construction give it a limiting sense; the benefits apply only insofar as there is a “suitable basis” or a “basis for mindfulness”. But the expression is used by the Buddha of himself ([an5.68:1.9]()), so it seems odd that it would be limiting. Indeed, the tenor of the whole sentence is not limiting but expansive, as emphasized by the repeated reduplications: _yassa yassa … tatra tatreva … sati sati_, which have a distributive sense. I therefore take _sati_ as “being” in both cases; the reduplication of _sati_ as aligned with the preceding pronouns, emphasizing universality; the locative absolute as causal; and _āyatana_  in its normal sense of “scope, range”.

mn120:1.1	So I have heard.	This sutta describes a practice by which a mendicant may choose their place of rebirth. This stands in contrast with the normal approach, where a mendicant aims to be free of all rebirth. At [mn16:12.1](), a mendicant who practices out of desire for rebirth is said to be bound by an “emotional shackle” (_cetasovinibandha_). At [an3.18](), the mendicants are said to be horrified by the suggestion that they practice for rebirth as a god, while [an7.50:9.1]() suggests that such aspirations stem from unresolved sexual desire. The present sutta takes a more conciliatory stance, moving from desire for progressively more refined kinds of rebirth to ultimately letting go of rebirth altogether.

Often this works unconsciously, as the effects of our choices and deeds manifest with or without our comprehension. Here, someone who understands _kamma_ turns it to their advantage by consciously developing an aspiration for a particular desired result. | _Upapatti_ is one of several terms in Pali that regularly mean “rebirth”, such as _jāti_, _(abhi)-nibbatti_, _okkanti_, and _punabbhava_.

mn120:12.12	Those choices and meditations of theirs, developed and cultivated like this, lead to rebirth there.	This passage raises the question as to how such a reflection leads to rebirth in the Brahmā realms, which requires the development of absorption (eg. [an4.123]()). Similar passages take care to specify that in order to be reborn in the Brahmā realm, one must not only be ethical, but “free of desire”, by which they imply the practice of absorption ([dn33:3.1.136]() = [an8.35:4.11]()). Related passages in Chinese translation relate the development of different levels of absorption to rebirth in the various realms (MA 168 at T i 700c7; Dharmaskandha, T 1537 at T xxvi 506b14), as does the commentary to this sutta. Now, while the current sutta does not mention absorption, it may be considered in light of the meditation practice of the six recollections. One of these is the recollection that the deities, including Brahmās, were reborn due to their faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom—exactly the same qualities mentioned in the present sutta ([an6.25:6.3]()). Thus when the present sutta says to “settle on that thought, concentrate on it, and develop it”, the phrase _cittaṁ bhāveti_ implies more than simply “developing the thought” of the aspiration, but means “developing the mind”. In the suttas this implies deep meditation, as for example the case of a teacher of the past, Sunetta, who was “free of desire”; after “developing the mind of love” (_mettaṁ cittaṁ bhāvetvā_) he was reborn in the Brahmā realm ([an7.66:13.1]()). Thus we can interpret the present passage as a way of practicing recollection of the deities, recalling that one’s virtuous qualities are shared with the deities, and developing deep meditation based on the joy that brings.

mn121:0.1	Middle Discourses 121	NA
mn121:0.2	The Shorter Discourse on Emptiness	NA
mn121:1.1	So I have heard.	This sutta gives a unique approach to meditation on emptiness, using the perception of relative emptiness as a foundation for absorption. | The topic of emptiness does not play the central role in Pali texts that it did in later Buddhism. This is perhaps at least partly due to different doctrinal developments in the early Buddhist schools. Passages that in the Pali mention impermanence, suffering, and not-self, in parallels of the (Mūla)-Sarvāstivāda often include emptiness as well. This does not indicate any doctrinal contradiction, as emptiness is explained as meaning not-self. But it does suggest that the presentation in terms of emptiness was more popular in that group of schools.
mn121:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.	NA
mn121:2.1	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Ānanda came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	NA
mn121:3.1	“Sir, this one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans where they have a town named Townsville.	NA
mn121:3.2	There I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:	“I heard and learned this in the presence” (_sammukhā sutaṁ, sammukhā paṭiggahitaṁ_) is the phrase used in the suttas when reporting a teaching heard directly from the Buddha, eg. [sn55.52:5.1](), [sn22.90:9.1](), [mn47:10.7](), etc.
mn121:3.3	‘Ānanda, these days I usually practice the meditation on emptiness.’	The same thing is said by Sāriputta at [mn151:2.3](), upon which the Buddha encourages him to reflect on the purity of his almsfood. Before the Second Council, the elder monk Sabbakāmī revealed that emptiness was his main practice too ([pli-tv-kd22:2.5.9]()), while at [thig3.3:2.1](), the bhikkhunī Uttamā also claims to practice emptiness meditation. The release through emptiness is classified along with absorption as a superhuman attainment ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:4.1.6]()). At [mn43:33.1]() = [sn41.7:4.1](), the “release of the heart through emptiness” is a reflection on not-self (see too [sn35.85:1.4](), [an9.36:2.4](), [snp5.16:4.1](), [thag19.1:27.2]()).
mn121:3.4	I trust I properly heard, learned, applied the mind, and remembered that from the Buddha?”	Notice the process of learning teachings through active engagement. Simply “hearing” it is just the beginning.
mn121:3.5	“Indeed, Ānanda, you properly heard, learned, applied the mind, and remembered that.	NA
mn121:3.6	Now, as before, I usually practice the meditation on emptiness.	NA
mn121:4.1	Consider this stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. It’s empty of elephants, cows, horses, and mares; of gold and silver; and of gatherings of men and women.	Emptiness is not a metaphysical property, but a relative state: something is empty of something.
mn121:4.2	There is only this that is not emptiness, namely, the oneness dependent on the mendicant Saṅgha.	Oneness, like emptiness, is a relative concept. Those things that are more distracting and tempting are absent, leaving only that which is more peaceful.
mn121:4.3	In the same way, a mendicant—ignoring the perception of the village and the perception of people—focuses on the oneness dependent on the perception of wilderness.	NA
mn121:4.4	Their mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes decided in that perception of wilderness.	NA
mn121:4.5	They understand:	NA
mn121:4.6	‘Here there is no stress due to the perception of village or the perception of people.	“Stress” is _darathā_.
mn121:4.7	There is only this modicum of stress, namely the oneness dependent on the perception of wilderness.’	NA
mn121:4.8	They understand: ‘This field of perception is empty of the perception of the village. It is empty of the perception of people.	NA
mn121:4.9	There is only this that is not emptiness, namely the oneness dependent on the perception of wilderness.’	NA
mn121:4.10	And so they regard it as empty of what is not there, but as to what remains they understand that it is present.	That is to say, the “purity” of the emptiness is not because everything is empty, but because what is empty is accurately recognized as empty.
mn121:4.11	That’s how emptiness manifests in them—genuine, undistorted, and pure.	NA
mn121:5.1	Furthermore, a mendicant—ignoring the perception of people and the perception of wilderness—focuses on the oneness dependent on the perception of earth.	NA
mn121:5.2	Their mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes decided in that perception of earth.	NA
mn121:5.3	As a bull’s hide is rid of folds when fully stretched out by a hundred pegs,	NA
mn121:5.4	so too, ignoring the hilly terrain, inaccessible riverlands, stumps and thorns, and rugged mountains, they focus on the oneness dependent on the perception of earth.	The perception of earth is an idealized inner conceptual image. This is the “form” (_rūpa_) that is the basis for “absorption on luminous form” (_rūpajjhāna_). The commentaries call this the _nimitta_ (“sign”).
mn121:5.5	Their mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes decided in that perception of earth.	NA
mn121:5.6	They understand:	NA

mn121:6.1	Furthermore, a mendicant—ignoring the perception of wilderness and the perception of earth—focuses on the oneness dependent on the perception of the dimension of infinite space.

mn121:10.1	Furthermore, a mendicant—ignoring the perception of the dimension of nothingness and the perception of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception—focuses on the oneness dependent on the signless immersion of the heart.	The defining characteristic of the “signless immersion of the heart” is that consciousness does not “follow after signs” (_nimittānusāri viññāṇaṁ_, eg. [an6.13:5.3]()). This is explained in [mn138:10.2]() as not being distracted or affected by the features of sense impressions, as the “signs” are created by greed, hate, and delusion ([mn43:37.1]()). By itself, however, it does not necessarily indicate that one is awakened ([an6.60:8.2]()), as good conduct is still required for progress ([an7.56:13.1]()). It was practiced by Moggallāna before awakening, who had to be urged to “not follow any signs” ([sn40.9]()). It may also be used to describe the meditation of an arahant ([sn41.7:6.12]()).
mn121:10.2	Their mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes decided in that signless immersion of the heart.	NA
mn121:10.3	They understand:	NA
mn121:10.4	‘Here there is no stress due to the perception of the dimension of nothingness or the perception of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	NA
mn121:10.5	There is only this modicum of stress, namely that related to the six sense fields dependent on this body and conditioned by life.’	Unlike with deep absorption, where there is no experience of the physical body, the signless meditation is a state of advanced discernment or insight where the six senses are seen as they truly are. This explains why it was a way for the Buddha to ease the pains of old age ([dn16:2.25.13]()). It seems that in such a state, the Buddha was able to function normally while seeing through the pain in his body.
mn121:10.6	They understand: ‘This field of perception is empty of the perception of the dimension of nothingness. It is empty of the perception of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	NA
mn121:10.7	There is only this that is not emptiness, namely that related to the six sense fields dependent on this body and conditioned by life.’	NA
mn121:10.8	And so they regard it as empty of what is not there, but as to what remains they understand that it is present.	NA
mn121:10.9	That’s how emptiness manifests in them—genuine, undistorted, and pure.	NA
mn121:11.1	Furthermore, a mendicant—ignoring the perception of the dimension of nothingness and the perception of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception—focuses on the oneness dependent on the signless immersion of the heart.	NA
mn121:11.2	Their mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes decided in that signless immersion of the heart.	NA
mn121:11.3	They understand:	NA
mn121:11.4	‘Even this signless immersion of the heart is produced by choices and intentions.’	Liberating insight comes from insight into the state of signless meditation, that is to say, it is the insight into insight itself.
mn121:11.5	They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’	NA
mn121:11.6	Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	NA
mn121:11.7	When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.	NA

mn121:13.1	Whatever ascetics and brahmins enter and remain in the pure, ultimate, supreme emptiness—whether in the past, future, or present—all of them enter and remain in this same pure, ultimate, supreme emptiness.	Here the emptiness is distinguished as “supreme” (_anuttara_). In early Pali, Nibbāna is not described as either empty or as not-self, as these are properties of the path. This passage is probably the closest we get to that, but even this is relative, since the body and life persist.
mn121:13.2	NA	NA

mn122:0.1	Middle Discourses 122	NA
mn122:0.2	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness	NA
mn122:1.1	So I have heard.	In the discourse, as with the previous, emptiness is associated with physical seclusion and the development of serenity meditation leading to insight.
mn122:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.	NA
mn122:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kapilavatthu for alms.	NA
mn122:2.2	He wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the lodge of the Sakyan Khemaka the Dark for the day’s meditation.	The Sakyans Khemaka, known for his dark skin, and Ghaṭā are otherwise unknown. Their “lodges” (_vihāra_) were, according to the commentary, buildings offered by them for the use of the Saṅgha inside the Banyan Tree Monastery, rather than being their personal homes.
mn122:2.3	Now at that time many resting places had been spread out at the lodge of Khemaka the Dark.	The fact that they were readily noticeable suggests that the beds were in the open, a detail confirmed by Tibetan parallel. Bedding and furniture were typically property of the Saṅgha, rather than individuals, so it is an offence to leave them exposed to the elements ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc14](), [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc15]()).
mn122:2.4	The Buddha saw this,	NA
mn122:2.5	and wondered,	NA
mn122:2.6	“Many resting places have been spread out;	NA
mn122:2.7	are there many mendicants living here?”	NA
mn122:2.8	Now at that time Venerable Ānanda, together with many other mendicants, was making robes at the lodge of the Sakyan Ghaṭā.	Some translators (Chalmers, Horner, Siam Rath), as well as the Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, take this name as the masculine form _ghaṭāya_, assuming it is compounded with _sakkassa_; but names are not usually compounded in this way (cf. _kāḷakhemakassa sakkassa_ above), and _ghaṭāya_ does not seem to be attested elsewhere. In his hand-written manuscript, Ñāṇamoḷī had _ghāṭā_, which was followed by Bodhi and Thanissaro. This reads the masculine agent noun “slayer”; but the genitive form would be _ghātassa_, while PTS, BJT, MS, and commentary all have _ghaṭāya_ with no variants. Rather, read per text as the feminine genitive of _ghaṭā_, suggesting that it was a woman who donated the building. She was perhaps born under the astrological sign known in India as _kumbha_ or _ghaṭa_ (“water-pot”), and in the west as Aquarius (“water-bearer”).
mn122:2.9	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to Ghaṭā’s lodge, where he sat on the seat spread out	NA
mn122:2.10	and said to Venerable Ānanda,	NA
mn122:2.11	“Many resting places have been spread out at the lodge of Khemaka the Dark;	NA
mn122:2.12	are many mendicants living there?”	NA
mn122:2.13	NA	NA
mn122:2.14	“Indeed there are, sir.	NA
mn122:2.15	It’s currently the time for making robes.”	This the period after the Rains Retreat, when cloth is offered by the lay community at the _kaṭhiṇa_ ceremony, and monastics busy themselves with sewing and repairs before setting out wandering. To this day, it is a time when the pent-up energies of the retreat are relaxed and the Saṅgha gathers for socializing in large numbers.
mn122:3.1	“Ānanda, a mendicant doesn’t shine who enjoys company and groups, who loves them and likes to enjoy them.	NA
mn122:3.2	It is quite impossible that such a mendicant will get the pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty.	This is defined at [mn139:9.18]() as the four absorptions.
mn122:3.3	But you should expect that a mendicant who lives alone, withdrawn from the group, will get the pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty. That is possible.	NA
mn122:4.1	Indeed, Ānanda, it is quite impossible that a mendicant who enjoys company will enter and remain in the freedom of heart—either that which is temporary and pleasant, or that which is irreversible and unshakable.	The “temporary and pleasant” liberation is the absorptions, while the “irreversible and unshakable” liberation is arahantship.
mn122:4.2	But it is possible that a mendicant who lives alone, withdrawn from the group will enter and remain in the freedom of heart—either that which is temporary and pleasant, or that which is irreversible and unshakable.	NA
mn122:5.1	Ānanda, I do not see even a single sight which, with its decay and perishing, would not give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in someone who has desire and lust for it.	Taken in isolation, _rūpa_ here might be “physical form” (i.e. “body”), but in passages with similar phrasing it is “visible form” (i.e. “sight”; [an1.1:2.1](), [an5.55:3.3]()).
mn122:6.1	But this meditation has been understood by the Realized One, namely	NA
mn122:6.2	to enter and remain in emptiness internally by not focusing on any signs.	Normally the meditations on emptiness and on signlessness are presented as separate  meditation practices ([sn41.7:4.1]()). But in the previous sutta, the meditation on signlessness was presented as one of the stages in the manifestation of emptiness ([mn121:10.1]()). The outcome of the signless meditation is a heart that is “empty” of greed, hate, and delusion ([mn43:37.1]()).
mn122:6.3	Now, suppose that while the Realized One is practicing this meditation, monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, rulers and their chief ministers, monastics of other religions and their disciples go to visit him.	_Tittha_, literally “ford”, is a path to salvation, used as a term for a non-Buddhist “religion”. _Titthakara_ is a “religious founder” (literally “ford-maker”); _titthiya_ is a “monastic of (another) religion” (for example at [pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.2.5]()); _titthiyasāvaka_ is a “disciple of a monastic of (another) religion”.
mn122:6.4	In that case, with a mind slanting, sloping, and inclining to seclusion, withdrawn, and loving renunciation, having totally eliminated defiling influences, he invariably gives each of them a talk emphasizing the topic of dismissal.	_Uyyojanika_ only occurs in this context (also at [an8.30:16.3]()). But see Sanskrit _udyuyuje_ at Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 4.1.5.7, which likewise concerns withdrawing from a hermit to avoid annoyance. _Uyyojanika_ is the causative form, literally “make-go-away-ish”, i.e. “dismissal”.
mn122:7.1	Therefore, if a mendicant should wish,	NA
mn122:7.2	‘May I enter and remain in emptiness internally!’ then they should still, settle, unify, and immerse their mind in samādhi internally.	NA
mn122:7.3	And how does a mendicant still, settle, unify, and immerse their mind in samādhi internally?	NA
mn122:8.1	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption …	NA
mn122:8.2	second absorption …	NA
mn122:8.3	third absorption …	NA
mn122:8.4	fourth absorption.	NA
mn122:8.5	That’s how a mendicant stills, settles, unifies, and immerses their mind in samādhi internally.	NA
mn122:9.1	They focus on emptiness internally,	NA
mn122:9.2	but their mind does not leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided.	NA
mn122:9.3	In that case, they understand:	NA
mn122:9.4	‘I am focusing on emptiness internally, but my mind does not leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided.’	NA
mn122:9.5	In this way they are aware of the situation.	This phrase indicates that they have “situational awareness” (_sampajañña_), namely a contextual overview of how their meditation is progressing, understood in terms of cause and effect. The phrase also occurs in the same sense at [an7.49:3.3]().
mn122:9.6	They focus on emptiness externally …	NA
mn122:9.7	They focus on emptiness internally and externally …	NA
mn122:9.8	They focus on the imperturbable,	For imperturbable, see [mn105:12.3](). In this mode of practice, they wanted to develop emptiness before the formless attainments. Contrast with [mn121:10.1](), where they develop the signless meditation only after the formless attainments.
mn122:9.9	but their mind does not leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided.	NA
mn122:9.10	In that case, they understand:	NA
mn122:9.11	‘I am focusing on the imperturbable internally, but my mind does not leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided.’	NA
mn122:9.12	In this way they are aware of the situation.	NA
mn122:10.1	Then that mendicant should still, settle, unify, and immerse their mind in samādhi internally using the same meditation subject as a basis of immersion that they used before.	Even though they had previously attained up to the fourth absorption, their practice is not yet fully stabilized. | For this phrase, see [mn36:45.6]() and [an6.28:4.3]().
mn122:10.2	They focus on emptiness internally,	In this context, it seems that “emptiness” is a way of deepening absorption.
mn122:10.3	and their mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes decided.	NA

mn122:13.5	In this way they are aware of the situation.	NA
mn122:14.1	There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.	NA
mn122:14.2	What five?	NA
mn122:14.3	Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	NA

mn122:14.8	These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	NA
mn122:15.1	So a mendicant should regularly check their own mind:	NA
mn122:15.2	‘Does my mind take an interest in any of these five kinds of sensual stimulation?’	NA
mn122:15.3	Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows this:	NA

mn122:16.6	Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’	NA
mn122:17.1	As they do so, they give up the conceit ‘I am’ regarding the five grasping aggregates.	Finally the meditator undertakes discernment (_vipassanā_).
mn122:17.2	In that case, they understand:	NA
mn122:17.3	‘I have given up the conceit “I am” regarding the five grasping aggregates.’	NA
mn122:17.4	In this way they are aware of the situation.	NA
mn122:18.1	These principles are entirely skillful, with skillful outcomes; they are noble, transcendent, and inaccessible to the Wicked One.	NA
mn122:19.1	What do you think, Ānanda?	NA
mn122:19.2	For what reason would a disciple deem it worthwhile to follow the Teacher, even if sent away?”	NA
mn122:19.3	“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	NA
mn122:20.1	“A disciple would not deem it worthwhile to follow the Teacher for the sake of this, namely statements, mixed prose & verse, or discussions.	Here we find mentioned only the first three of the normal nine categories (_aṅga_) of the teaching ([mn22:10.2]()). This may be an earlier list or perhaps simply an abbreviation. Note that the PTS edition reads _yadidaṁ suttaṁ geyyaṁ veyyākaraṇassa hetu_, which would imply only two categories: “for the sake of explanations, namely statements and mixed prose & verse”. A passage at [an5.194:3.3]() mentions four categories, with the addition of “amazing stories”, but this too might be simply an artifact of abbreviation.
mn122:20.2	Why is that?	NA
mn122:20.3	Because for a long time you have learned the teachings, remembering them, rehearsing them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.	The Buddha shifts to address Ānanda directly. This is in reference to the fact that Ānanda was renowned as the greatest master of scriptural memorization.
mn122:20.4	But a disciple would deem it worthwhile to follow the Teacher, even if sent away, for the sake of talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart and leads solely to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. That is, talk about fewness of wishes, contentment, seclusion, aloofness, arousing energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom.	That is, rather than simply memorizing more texts, one such as Ānanda should seek encouragement that supports practice.
mn122:21.1	This being so, Ānanda, there is a peril for the tutor, a peril for the pupil, and a peril for a spiritual practitioner.	NA
mn122:22.1	And how is there a peril for the tutor?	As is made clear by the example of the spiritual practitioner below, who is said to follow the Buddha, the “tutor” (_ācariya_, or _satthā_ “teacher” in the next line) and the “pupil” (_antevāsī_) here are outside of  Buddhism.
mn122:22.2	It’s when some teacher frequents a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.	NA
mn122:22.3	While meditating withdrawn, they’re visited by a stream of brahmins and householders, and people of town and country.	The more a monastic has a reputation for seclusion, the more people seek them out.
mn122:22.4	When this happens, they enjoy infatuation, fall into greed, and return to indulgence.	NA
mn122:22.5	This is said to be the tutor’s peril.	Compare the similar phrase at [sn16.8:7.7]().
mn122:22.6	They’re ruined by bad, unskillful qualities that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.	NA

mn122:27.1	I shall not mollycoddle you like a potter with their damp, unfired pots.	This passage seems to mean, “I shall not work you …”, which is the exact opposite of the sense required by the next sentence. A Sanskrit parallel yields the required sense with the verb _dhanayiṣye_, “to treasure, to mollycoddle” ([Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya, Kd 17:493](https://suttacentral.net/san-mu-kd17/san/gbm?lang=en&reference=main&highlight=false#sc493)). Perhaps an initial negatory _a-_ has been elided in the Pali _parakkamissāmi_, which would yield a similar sense, “I shall not stop working you …”. | The same Sanskrit passage has _bhājanānā_ (“pots”) where the Pali has _āmake āmakamatte_, literally “uncooked, a bit damp”.
mn122:27.2	I shall speak, correcting you again and again,	NA
mn122:27.3	pressing you again and again.	NA
mn122:27.4	The core will stand the test.”	NA
mn122:27.5	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn122:27.6	Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn123:0.1	Middle Discourses 123	NA
mn123:0.2	Incredible and Amazing	NA
mn123:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn123:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn123:2.1	Then after the meal, on return from almsround, several mendicants sat together in the assembly hall and this discussion came up among them:	NA
mn123:2.2	“It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing! The Realized One has such psychic power and might!	NA
mn123:2.3	For he is able to know the Buddhas of the past who have become completely quenched, cut off proliferation, cut off the track, finished off the cycle, and transcended all suffering.	NA
mn123:2.4	He knows their birth, names, clans, conduct, teaching, wisdom, meditation, and freedom.”	This is in reference to the Mahāpadānasutta, which is where we learn the Buddha’s mother was named Māyā ([dn14]()). But whereas that sutta emphasizes the “normalcy” (_dhammatā_) of Buddhahood as a recurring cycle down through the eons, this sutta is devotional, emphasizing Gotama’s personal qualities.
mn123:2.5	When they said this, Venerable Ānanda said,	NA
mn123:2.6	“The Realized Ones are incredible, reverends, and they have incredible qualities.	NA
mn123:2.7	They’re amazing, and they have amazing qualities.”	This a key example of the genre of “amazing stories” (_abbhutadhamma_), one of the nine categories (eg. [mn22:10.2]()), linking this sutta with the previous ([mn122:20.1]()). This genre is closely connected to Ānanda, so much so that he may be regarded as its originator (eg. [dn1:3.74.2](), [dn15:1.4](), [dn16:3.11.2](), [sn51.22:2.2](), [an4.76:5.5](), etc.). When Ānanda was at a low point, the Buddha turned it around to speak of Ānanda’s amazing qualities ([dn16:5.16.15]() = [an4.129]()).
mn123:2.8	But this conversation among those mendicants was left unfinished.	NA
mn123:2.9	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat, went to the assembly hall, sat down on the seat spread out,	NA
mn123:2.10	and addressed the mendicants:	NA
mn123:2.11	“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	NA
mn123:2.12	So the mendicants told him what they had been talking about. The Buddha said,	NA

mn123:3.2	‘Mindful and aware, the being intent on awakening was reborn in the host of joyful gods.’	The first three items are unique to this sutta. | Normally in early Pali, the word _bodhisatta_ is reserved for the Buddha-to-be once he has left home and is practicing “intent on awakening” (eg. [mn26:13.1]()). [dn14:1.17.1]() and [an4.127:1.3]() extend the usage back as far as the end of the immediate past life. Here, he is called _bodhisatta_ from the beginning of the immediate past life. The Chinese parallel at MA 32 goes back even further, depicting the _bodhisatta_ making his initial vow to become a Buddha in the time of the Buddha Kassapa. Compare [mn81]() and its parallel MA 63, where no such vow is mentioned. Only then does he take rebirth in the Joyful heaven. These differences indicate a development of the _bodhisatta_ doctrine even in early texts.

mn123:7.4	Even in the boundless void of interstellar space—so utterly dark that even the light of the moon and the sun, so mighty and powerful, makes no impression—an immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the gods.	The commentary identifies this realm of “utter darkness” (_andhakāratimisā_) with a cold hell realm. There is a corresponding Purāṇic hell called _andhatāmisra_. | _Agha_ (“void”) is a synonym of _ākāsa_ (“space”, [mn62:12.5]()). | _Asaṁvuta_ was translated by Ñāṇamoḷī as “abysmal”, but this relies on a commentarial cosmology that is not found in the suttas. The sense, rather, is “boundless”. The root harks back to the Vedic serpent Vṛtra who wraps the world in darkness. | _Nānubhonti_ (“makes no impression”) is glossed in the commentary to [an4.127]() as _nappahonti_ “ineffective”.
mn123:7.5	And even the sentient beings reborn there recognize each other by that light: “So, it seems other sentient beings have been reborn here!”	The light is a physical one, not just a metaphor. From this, it appears that sentient beings may be spontaneously reborn in interstellar space. Compare the problem of the “Boltzmann brain” in physics.

In the Rig Veda it is typically “in the tenth month” (5.78.7, 10.84.3).

I am the first in the world! This is my last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.”’	This passage implies that Buddhahood was destined from the time of birth, which stands in contrast to the rest of the suttas, where Buddhahood was hard-won by the Bodhisatta’s efforts while striving for awakening. | “Stands firm on his own feet” signifies that he will be awakened by his own efforts. | “North” is _uttara_, which is also “the beyond”; this predicts his attaining Nibbana. | “Seven strides” signifies crossing over the vast cycles of birth and death, especially by developing the seven awakening factors. | The “white parasol” signifies purity and royalty. | “Surveying all quarters” signifies his universal knowledge. | The “dramatic proclamation” is _āsabhiṁ vācaṁ_, literally the “voice of a bull”. Other contexts show that this is is an expression emphasizing speech that is dramatic and imposing ([sn52.9:3.2](), [dn28:1.5]() = [sn47.12:5.2]()). | At Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.1.1 and Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.1.1 the “vital breath” (_prāṇa_) is said to be “eldest and first” (_jyeṣṭhaśca śreṣṭhaśca_).

mn123:22.1	“Well then, Ānanda, you should also remember this as an incredible and amazing quality of the Realized One.	NA
mn123:22.2	It’s that the Realized One knows feelings as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away.	This practice is said to be the “awareness” part of “mindfulness and awareness” (_satisampajañña_) at [sn47.35:3.1](), while at [dn33:1.11.37]() = [an4.41:4.1]() it is a further development of immersion leading to awareness. | The Buddha is gently reframing Ānanda’s devotionalism, pointing back to the practice of meditation, a quality that he shares with disciples (eg. Sāriputta at [an7.39:1.6]() and Nanda at [an8.9:5.1]()). Subtly, he is also completing the circle of the sutta, as the first items speak of how the _bodhisatta_ was “mindful and aware” when reborn ([mn123:3.2]()). Thus while Ānanda spoke of results, the Buddha pointed to the cause of awakening, a rhetorical twist he also employed at [mn32:17.5]().

mn123:23.7	Satisfied, those mendicants approved what Venerable Ānanda said.	NA
mn124:0.1	Middle Discourses 124	NA
mn124:0.2	With Bakkula	NA
mn124:1.1	So I have heard.	Bakkula is depicted as an exponent of austerity who goes significantly beyond the norm in the early texts. According to the commentary, this sutta was added by the Elders at the Second Council, a century after the Buddha’s passing. This is supported by the lack of mention of where the Buddha is staying; by the advanced age of Bakkula; and by multiple textual indications. Bakkula apparently represents an ideal among a certain wing of the Saṅgha at that time. His verses in the Theragāthā, however, are simple and free from this severity ([thag3.3]()).
mn124:1.2	At one time Venerable Bakkula was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
mn124:2.1	Then the naked ascetic Kassapa, an old friend of Bakkula in the lay life, approached him, and exchanged greetings with him.	The phrase _purāṇagihisahāya_ (“old friend from the lay life”) appears only here and at [sn41.9:1.1](). There it is also said of a naked ascetic (_acela_) called Kassapa, which cannot be a coincidence. In that case he, as the former friend of the householder Citta, is the one interrogated, in a discourse set while the Buddha was still alive. The events of the present discourse happened many decades after the Buddha’s death, so it seems likely Kassapa was introduced as a conventional foil for Bakkula. Several such individuals named Kassapa are found in Pali, and their stories are conflated ([dn8](), [sn12.17](), [sn41.9]()).
mn124:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Venerable Bakkula,	NA
mn124:3.1	“Reverend Bakkula, how long has it been since you went forth?”	NA
mn124:3.2	“It has been eighty years, reverend.”	One may “go forth” at fifteen or “when old enough to scare crows” ([pli-tv-kd1:51.1.14]()), so he is probably over ninety here.
mn124:3.3	“But in these eighty years, how many times have you had sex?”	NA
mn124:3.4	“You shouldn’t ask me such a question.	NA
mn124:3.5	NA	NA
mn124:3.6	Rather, you should ask me this:	NA
mn124:3.7	‘But in these eighty years, how many times have sensual perceptions ever arisen in you?’”	NA
mn124:3.8	“But in these eighty years, how many times have sensual perceptions ever arisen in you?”	This repetition is found in the PTS and BJT editions, but missing from MS and King of Siam editions.
mn124:3.9	“In these eighty years, I don’t recall that any sensual perception has ever arisen in me.”	NA
mn124:3.10	This we remember as an incredible and amazing quality of Venerable Bakkula.	According to the commentary, these responses were added by the Elders, representing praise of Bakkula’s austerities by the successful rigorist party at the Second Council. This is supported by several considerations. First, the commentators would rather claim something is early, so when they say it was added later it likely comes from a genuine tradition. Second, the refrains are in plural. Third, the refrains, and the statements of Bakkula that they answer, lack the close _-ti_ indicating a direct quote. Fourthly, they continue after the conversation with Kassapa has concluded. The refrains are also found in the Chinese parallel. This shows how comparing different versions of a sutta can take us back only to the point where the texts diverge, which was some time after the Second Council. Thus a shared feature might have been added a century or more after the Buddha.
mn124:4-5.1	“In these eighty years, I don’t recall that any perception of ill will …	NA
mn124:4-5.2	or cruelty has ever arisen in me.”	NA
mn124:4-5.3	This too we remember as an incredible and amazing quality of Venerable Bakkula.	NA
mn124:6.1	“In these eighty years, I don’t recall that any thought of sensuality …	NA
mn124:6.2	NA	NA
mn124:7-8.1	ill will …	NA
mn124:7-8.2	or cruelty has ever arisen in me.”	NA
mn124:7-8.3	This too we remember as an incredible and amazing quality of Venerable Bakkula.	NA
mn124:9.1	“In these eighty years, I don’t recall accepting a robe from a householder …	From a discussion of mental purity, Bakkula proceeds to list a series of details of conduct, which are not morally reprehensible, but which illustrate his extreme commitment to austerity. | Accepting a robe from a householder implies enjoying the spoils of wealthy donors. Austere monks wore robes made of cast-off rags. Compare the story of Ānanda at [mn52:16.2]() = [an11.16:11.2](), or at [pli-tv-kd21:1.13.1](), where he explained that after accepting quality robes, they were shared and reused. | This sutta can be seen as representing one of the disputing factions at the Second Council ([pli-tv-kd22]()). The Saṅgha was divided between “rigorists” who advocated a more austere monastic life, and “laxists” who wanted to take a more relaxed attitude to discipline. The Second Council decided ten points of Vinaya in the rigorists’ favor, the most important of which was whether monastics could use money. Bakkula represents a rigorist position so extreme that if it were followed generally it would undermine the very existence of the Saṅgha. His severity, which even exceeds that of Mahākassapa, is implicitly contrasted with the gentle and accommodating spirit of Ānanda.
mn124:9.2	NA	NA
mn124:10.1	cutting a robe with a knife …	The following items echo the Buddha’s concern at [mn122:2.8](), where many monastics, including Ānanda, had gathered for making robes. | Note that most of these items are missing from the Chinese parallel at MA 34.

It is normally forbidden to visit other families on the way to a meal invitation, but a special exemption is granted for the times of giving and making robes.
mn124:16-19.1	accepting an invitation …	Bakkula would eat only food collected on alms-round, refusing to eat a meal by invitation in a lay person’s home.

mn124:20-25.3	going to the nuns’ quarters …	This is stricter than [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23](), which forbids going to the nuns’s quarters for the purpose of giving the fortnightly instruction, with several exceptions noted.
mn124:20-25.4	teaching the nuns …	At [mn146:3.3](), the Buddha encourages Nandaka to teach the nuns; indeed the Vinaya says that a monk should agree to teach the nuns ([pli-tv-kd20:9.5.3]()), and in addition should go to the assistance of nuns ([pli-tv-kd3:6.12.1]()). Compare [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc24](), which forbids teaching nuns for the sake of material profits.

mn124:20-25.6	teaching the novice nuns …	NA

mn124:30-36.3	looking for a massage from my companions in the spiritual life …	Massaging was done for health and by respect ([pli-tv-kd12:1.1.27]()), but was often problematic, as it could be sexually arousing ([pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:5.8.17]()) or even dangerous ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.16.2]()). At one point the Buddha forbade massages for monks ([pli-tv-kd15:1.4.1]()) and nuns ([pli-tv-bi-vb-pc90]()), although he allowed monks a “broad-handed” massage ([pli-tv-kd15:1.5.6]()).
mn124:30-36.4	being ill, even for as long as it takes to pull a cow’s udder …	Bakkula was said to be the foremost monk in good health ([an1.226:1.1]()), an accolade that must have been added after his passing away. In later texts, he is often remembered for this ([tha-ap398](), [mil5.5.3](); Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra 8.2.3.3, Divyāvadāna 253.020). It would seem he mentions it here because many of the other items are allowed for the sake of health. It may happen that something such as a massage, which has a genuine health purpose, can become an indulgence.
mn124:30-36.5	being presented with medicine, even as much as a bit of yellow myrobalan …	Allowed as medicine at [pli-tv-kd6:6.1.4]().
mn124:30-36.6	leaning on a leaning-board …	Allowed at [pli-tv-kd16:20.2.15](). This was a wooden plank that was leaned against the wall as a simple backrest.

mn125:0.2	The Level of the Tamed	NA
mn125:1.1	So I have heard.	This discourse uses the training of an elephant as an allegory for the Gradual Training. The Buddha contrasts the sensual lifestyle of Prince Jayasena, which clouds his vision of the truth, with the path of renunciation. Throughout, he lends support to the young novice Aciravata.
mn125:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
mn125:2.1	Now at that time the novice Aciravata was staying in a wilderness hut.	NA
mn125:2.2	Then as Prince Jayasena was going for a walk he approached Aciravata, and exchanged greetings with him.	Jayasena features in this discourse and the next. The commentary says he was Bimbisāra’s son. | Aciravata is otherwise unknown.
mn125:2.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Aciravata,	NA
mn125:2.4	“Worthy Aggivessana, I have heard that	Saccaka is also called Aggivessana ([mn35:4.2]()).
mn125:2.5	a mendicant who meditates diligently, keenly, and resolutely can experience unification of mind.”	NA
mn125:2.6	“That’s so true, Prince! That’s so true!	NA
mn125:2.7	A mendicant who meditates diligently, keenly, and resolutely can experience unification of mind.”	NA
mn125:3.1	“Worthy Aggivessana, please teach me the Dhamma as you have learned and memorized it.”	NA
mn125:3.2	“I’m not competent to do so, Prince.	Aciravati’s lack of confidence is understandable. Novices were under twenty, so here we have a rather intimidating situation where a Prince is questioning a teenager.
mn125:3.3	For if I were to teach you the Dhamma as I have learned and memorized it, you might not understand the meaning, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.”	NA
mn125:4.1	“Worthy Aggivessana, please teach me the Dhamma as you have learned and memorized it.	NA
mn125:4.2	Hopefully I will understand the meaning of what you say.”	NA
mn125:4.3	“I shall teach you.	NA
mn125:4.4	If you understand the meaning of what I say, that’s good.	NA
mn125:4.5	If not, then leave each to his own, and do not question me about it further.”	NA
mn125:4.6	“Worthy Aggivessana, please teach me the Dhamma as you have learned and memorized it.	NA
mn125:4.7	If I understand the meaning of what you say, that’s good.	NA
mn125:4.8	If not, then I will leave each to his own, and not question you about it further.”	NA
mn125:5.1	Then the novice Aciravata taught Prince Jayasena the Dhamma as he had learned and memorized it.	NA
mn125:5.2	When he had spoken, Jayasena said to him,	NA
mn125:5.3	“It is impossible, worthy Aggivessana, it cannot happen that a mendicant who meditates diligently, keenly, and resolutely can experience unification of mind.”	NA
mn125:5.4	Having declared that this was impossible, Jayasena got up from his seat and left.	NA
mn125:6.1	Not long after he had left, Aciravata went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,	NA
mn125:6.2	and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed.	NA
mn125:7.1	When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,	NA
mn125:7.2	“How could it possibly be otherwise, Aggivessana?	Knowing his student lacks confidence, the Buddha has encouraging words for him, not letting him blame himself for Jayasena’s rejection.
mn125:7.3	Prince Jayasena dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying them, consumed by thoughts of them, burning with fever for them, and eagerly seeking more. It’s simply impossible for him to know or see or realize what can only be known, seen, and realized by renunciation.	A parallel passage occurs at [mn125:7.3](), where the phrases “dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying them” are reversed. The sequence there makes better sense: it starts with where they are, then what they enjoy, and gradually moves up to being consumed and seeking more. I take this as the correct sense and translate both passages accordingly.
mn125:8.1	Suppose there was a pair of elephants or horse or oxen in training who were well tamed and well trained. And there was a pair who were not tamed or trained.	NA
mn125:8.2	What do you think, Aggivessana?	NA
mn125:8.3	Wouldn’t the pair that was well tamed and well trained perform the tasks of the tamed and reach the level of the tamed?”	NA
mn125:8.4	“Yes, sir.”	NA
mn125:8.5	“But would the pair that was not tamed and trained perform the tasks of the tamed and reach the level of the tamed, just like the tamed pair?”	NA
mn125:8.6	“No, sir.”	NA
mn125:8.7	“In the same way, Prince Jayasena dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying them, consumed by thoughts of them, burning with fever for them, and eagerly seeking more. It’s simply impossible for him to know or see or realize what can only be known, seen, and realized by renunciation.	NA
mn125:9.1	Suppose there was a big mountain not far from a town or village.	This simile is contextual, as Rājagaha is indeed surrounded by mountains.
mn125:9.2	And two friends set out from that village or town, lending each other a hand up to the mountain. Once there, one friend would remain at the foot of the mountain, while the other would climb to the peak.	For _hatthavilaṅghaka_ (“lending a hand up”) see [mn31:9.7]() = [mn128:14.7]().
mn125:9.3	The one standing at the foot would say to the one at the peak,	NA
mn125:9.4	‘My friend, what do you see, standing there at the peak?’	NA
mn125:9.5	They’d reply,	NA
mn125:9.6	‘Standing at the peak, I see delightful parks, woods, meadows, and lotus ponds!’	NA
mn125:9.7	But the other would say,	NA
mn125:9.8	‘It’s impossible, it cannot happen that, standing at the peak, you can see delightful parks, woods, meadows, and lotus ponds.’	NA
mn125:9.9	So their friend would come down from the peak, take their friend by the arm, and make them climb to the peak. After giving them a while to catch their breath, they’d say,	NA
mn125:9.10	‘My friend, what do you see, standing here at the peak?’	NA
mn125:9.11	They’d reply,	NA
mn125:9.12	‘Standing at the peak, I see delightful parks, woods, meadows, and lotus ponds!’	NA
mn125:9.13	They’d say,	NA
mn125:9.14	‘Just now I understood you to say:	NA
mn125:9.15	“It’s impossible, it cannot happen that, standing at the peak, you can see delightful parks, woods, meadows, and lotus ponds.”	NA
mn125:9.16	But now you say:	NA
mn125:9.17	“Standing at the peak, I see delightful parks, woods, meadows, and lotus ponds!”’	NA
mn125:9.18	They’d say,	NA
mn125:9.19	‘But my friend, it was because I was obstructed by this big mountain that I didn’t see what could be seen.’	NA
mn125:10.1	But bigger than that is the mass of ignorance by which Prince Jayasena is veiled, shrouded, covered, and engulfed.	NA
mn125:10.2	Prince Jayasena dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying them, consumed by thoughts of them, burning with fever for them, and eagerly seeking more. It is quite impossible for him to know or see or realize what can only be known, seen, and realized by renunciation.	NA
mn125:11.1	It would be no wonder if, had these two similes occurred to you, Prince Jayasena would have gained confidence in you and shown his confidence.”	NA
mn125:11.2	“But sir, how could these two similes have occurred to me as they did to the Buddha, since they were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past?”	NA
mn125:12.1	“Suppose, Aggivessana, an anointed aristocratic king was to address his elephant tracker,	NA
mn125:12.2	‘Please, my good elephant tracker, mount the royal bull elephant and enter the elephant wood. When you see a wild bull elephant, tether it by the neck to the royal elephant.’	NA
mn125:12.3	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the elephant tracker, and did as he was asked.	NA
mn125:12.4	The royal elephant leads the wild elephant out into the open;	NA
mn125:12.5	and it’s only then that it comes out into the open,	NA
mn125:12.6	for a wild bull elephant clings to the elephant wood.	NA
mn125:12.7	The elephant tracker informs the king,	NA
mn125:12.8	‘Sire, the wild elephant has come out into the open.’	NA
mn125:12.9	Then the king addresses his elephant trainer,	NA
mn125:12.10	‘Please, my good elephant trainer, tame the wild bull elephant. Subdue its wild behaviors, its wild memories and thoughts, and its wild stress, weariness, and fever. Make it happy to be within a village, and instill behaviors congenial to humans.’	NA
mn125:12.11	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the elephant trainer. He dug a large post into the earth and tethered the elephant to it by the neck, so as to subdue its wild behaviors, its wild memories and thoughts, and its wild stress, weariness, and fever, and to make it happy to be within a village, and instill behaviors congenial to humans.	NA
mn125:12.12	He spoke in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people.	NA
mn125:12.13	Spoken to in such a way by the elephant trainer, the wild elephant wanted to listen. It actively listened and tried to understand.	NA
mn125:12.14	So the elephant trainer rewards it with grass, fodder, and water.	NA
mn125:12.15	When the wild elephant accepts the grass, fodder, and water, the trainer knows,	NA
mn125:12.16	‘Now the wild elephant will survive!’	NA
mn125:12.17	He sets it a further task:	NA
mn125:12.18	‘Pick it up, worthy sir! Put it down, worthy sir!’	NA
mn125:12.19	When the wild elephant picks up and puts down when the trainer says, following instructions, the trainer sets it a further task:	NA
mn125:12.20	‘Forward, worthy sir! Back, worthy sir!’	NA
mn125:12.21	When the wild elephant goes forward and back when the trainer says, following instructions, the trainer sets it a further task:	NA
mn125:12.22	‘Stand, worthy sir! Sit, worthy sir!’	NA
mn125:12.23	When the wild elephant stands and sits when the trainer says, following instructions, the trainer sets the task called imperturbability. He fastens a large plank to its trunk; a lancer sits on its neck; other lancers surround it on all sides; and the trainer himself stands in front with a long lance.	NA
mn125:12.24	While practicing this task, it doesn’t budge its fore-feet or hind-feet, its fore-quarters or hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, tail, or trunk.	NA
mn125:12.25	The wild bull elephant endures being struck by spears, swords, arrows, and axes; it endures the thunder of the drums, kettledrums, horns, and tom-toms. Rid of all crooks and flaws, and purged of defects, it is worthy of a king, fit to serve a king, and considered a factor of kingship.	NA
mn125:13.1	In the same way, Aggivessana, a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.	The parallel at MA 198 is more straightforward, mentioning only purity of body, speech, and mind; undertaking mindfulness meditation; and entering the four absorptions.
mn125:13.2	He realizes with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	NA
mn125:13.3	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
mn125:14.1	A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in a good family.	NA
mn125:14.2	They gain faith in the Realized One	NA
mn125:14.3	and reflect,	NA
mn125:14.4	‘Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide open.	NA
mn125:14.5	It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	NA
mn125:14.6	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	NA
mn125:14.7	After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
mn125:14.8	And it’s only then that a noble disciple comes out into the open,	NA
mn125:14.9	for gods and humans cling to the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	NA
mn125:15.1	The Realized One guides them further:	NA
mn125:15.2	‘Come, mendicant, be ethical and restrained in the monastic code, conducting yourself well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, keep the rules you’ve undertaken.’	NA
mn125:16.1	When they have ethical conduct, the Realized One guides them further:	NA
mn125:16.2	‘Come, mendicant, guard your sense doors. When you see a sight with your eyes, don’t get caught up in the features and details. …	NA
mn125:17-21.1	(Tell in full as in MN 107, the Discourse with Moggallāna the Accountant.)	NA
mn125:22.1	They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.	NA
mn125:22.2	Then they meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
mn125:23.1	They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …	NA
mn125:23.2	mind …	NA
mn125:23.3	principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
mn125:23.4	It’s like when the elephant trainer dug a large post into the earth and tethered the elephant to it by the neck, so as to subdue its wild behaviors, its wild memories and thoughts, and its wild stress, weariness, and fever, and to make it happy to be within a village, and instill behaviors congenial to humans.	NA
mn125:23.5	In the same way, a noble disciple has these four kinds of mindfulness meditation as tethers for the mind so as to subdue behaviors tied to domestic life, memories and thoughts tied to domestic life, stress, weariness, and fever tied to domestic life, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment.	NA
mn125:24.1	The Realized One guides them further:	NA
mn125:24.2	‘Come, mendicant, meditate observing an aspect of the body, but don’t think thoughts connected with sensual pleasures.	Editions vary and it is not easy to decide between them. MS and BJT editions have _kāmūpasaṁhita_ (“connected with sensual pleasures”), while PTS has _kāyūpasaṁhita_ (“connected with the body”), followed by “connected with feelings, mind, and principles” respectively. The Chinese parallel has “sensuality” in first place, abbreviates the next two, then “against the dhamma” for the final _satipaṭṭhāna_ (MA 198 at T i 758b15). Sanskrit texts Pañcaviṁśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā and Pratyutpannabuddhasaṁmukhāvasthitasamādhi-sūtra have _kāya_. So the balance of the non-Pali texts supports the reading _kāyūpasaṁhita_. On the other hand, _kāmūpasaṁhita_ is a common term, while _kāyūpasaṁhita_ (etc.) appear only here; but the passage is passed over in the commentary and subcommentary, which suggests that they thought it was self-evident, making it unlikely that unique terms were used. Finally, the overall topic of the discourse is overcoming sensuality through meditation, and it would seem odd for the Buddha to be teaching specialized meditation instructions, found nowhere else, to a novice. Overall, then, I accept the reading _kāmūpasaṁhita_; see too the next note.
mn125:24.3	Meditate observing an aspect of feelings …	NA
mn125:24.4	mind …	NA
mn125:24.5	principles, but don’t think thoughts connected with sensual pleasures.’	NA
mn125:25.1	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption …	The Pali version, in a unique presentation, has the four _satipaṭṭhānas_ in place of the first absorption, which offers further light on the problem discussed in the previous note. The first absorption is characterized by seclusion from sensual pleasures, while _vitakka_ is still present. Clearly one is not “thinking of sensual pleasures” at this point, so the reading _kāmūpasaṁhita_ is unproblematic. But it is not clear that one is not having _vitakka_ for the body (and feeling, mind, and principles). For example, in mindfulness of breathing one is applying the mind or “thinking of” the breath, in other words “thinking of the body”. Thus the reading _kāyūpasaṁhita_ would be difficult to fully explain. Any conclusions on this passage, however, are tenuous, and it seems likely there has been some textual corruption. Indeed, the Chinese parallel here has all four absorptions as usual.
mn125:25.2	third absorption …	NA
mn125:25.3	fourth absorption.	NA

mn125:27-28.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	NA
mn125:27-28.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	NA
mn125:29.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	NA

mn126:2.1	Then Venerable Bhūmija robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Prince Jayasena, where he sat on the seat spread out.	We know Bhūmija from [sn12.25](), where he asks Sāriputta about the efficacy of deeds. | This is the second discourse featuring Jayasena (after [mn125]()), but despite his evident interest in the Dhamma, and his support for mendicants expressed by offering the meal here, we do not hear of his conversion or spiritual development.

mn126:3.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Bhūmija:	NA

mn126:4.3	‘If you lead the spiritual life irrationally, you can’t win the fruit, regardless of whether you make a wish,	“Irrationally” (_ayoniso_) here means, as the sutta will make clear, that the practices one does are not “rationally”(_yoniso_)  or causally connected to the results one expects.

mn127:2.1	And then the chamberlain Pañcakaṅga addressed a man,	For Pañcakaṅga and his role as chamberlain, see note on [mn59:1.3]().
mn127:2.2	“Please, worthy man, go to Venerable Anuruddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him,	NA
mn127:2.3	‘Sir, the chamberlain Pañcakaṅga bows with his head to your feet.’	NA
mn127:2.4	And then ask him whether he	NA
mn127:2.5	might please accept tomorrow’s meal from Pañcakaṅga together with the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
mn127:2.6	And ask whether he might please come earlier than usual,	NA
mn127:2.7	for Pañcakaṅga has many duties, and much work to do for the king.”	NA
mn127:2.8	“Yes, sir,” that man replied. He did as Pañcakaṅga asked, and	NA

mn127:2.10	NA	NA
mn127:2.11	NA	NA
mn127:2.12	NA	NA
mn127:2.13	Venerable Anuruddha consented with silence.	NA
mn127:3.1	Then when the night had passed, Anuruddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Pañcakaṅga’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out.	NA
mn127:3.2	Then Pañcakaṅga served and satisfied Anuruddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	NA
mn127:3.3	When Anuruddha had eaten and washed his hands and bowl, Pañcakaṅga took a low seat, sat to one side,	NA
mn127:3.4	and said to him:	NA
mn127:4.1	“Sir, some senior mendicants have come to me and said,	NA
mn127:4.2	‘Householder, develop the limitless release of heart.’	NA
mn127:4.3	Others have said,	NA
mn127:4.4	‘Householder, develop the expansive release of heart.’	NA
mn127:4.5	Now, the limitless release of the heart and the expansive release of the heart:	NA
mn127:4.6	do these things differ in both meaning and phrasing? Or do they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing?”	At [mn43:29.5](), Mahākoṭṭhita asks Sāriputta a similar question about different meditative liberations.
mn127:5.1	“Well then, householder, let me know what you think about this. Afterwards you’ll get it without fail.”	“Without fail” renders _apaṇṇaka_, for which see note on [mn60:4.3](). It’s an unusual response. As _apaṇṇaka_ means a “set without a fifth”, Anuruddha might be punning on Pañcakaṅga’s name, which means, “a set of five items”.
mn127:5.2	“Sir, this is what I think.	NA
mn127:5.3	The limitless release of the heart and the expansive release of the heart mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing.”	NA
mn127:6.1	“The limitless release of the heart and the expansive release of the heart differ in both meaning and phrasing.	NA
mn127:6.2	This is a way to understand how these things differ in both meaning and phrasing.	NA
mn127:7.1	And what is the limitless release of the heart?	“Limitless” is _appamāṇa_. This set of four meditations is known in later traditions as either the “divine meditations” (_brahmavihārā_) or the “immeasurables” (_appamaññā_).
mn127:7.2	It’s when a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	NA
mn127:7.3	They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion …	NA
mn127:7.4	They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing …	NA
mn127:7.5	They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	NA
mn127:7.6	This is called the limitless release of the heart.	NA
mn127:8.1	And what is the expansive release of the heart?	“Expansive” renders _mahaggata_, literally “grown great”. This features as a state of mind that is developed in _satipaṭṭhāna_ ([mn10:34.10]()), and which is known with psychic powers ([mn6:16.10]()). It also appears just above next to “limitless” in the description of the divine meditations, a detail that perhaps prompted Pañcakaṅga’s question.
mn127:8.2	It’s when a mendicant meditates focused on pervading the extent of a single tree root as expansive.	This meditation practice is unique to this passage. It might be compared with the practice of emptiness at [mn121:4.1](), which likewise moves from a perception of one’s limited surroundings towards something more universal. The meaning of “pervading” (_pharitvā_) might be understood in the same sense as it is found in the divine meditations, where I have translated it as “spread”. The sutta below, however, treats it as the spreading of light. In this interpretation, the “expansive” practice is a method of spreading love (etc.) by gradually expanding the perception of the field of love. The final extent is the land bordered by ocean, beyond which the mind become “limitless like the great ocean” ([mn72:20.2]()). In other words, the “expansive” liberation leads to the “limitless” liberation.
mn127:8.3	This is called the expansive release of the heart.	NA
mn127:8.4	Also, a mendicant meditates focused on pervading the extent of two or three tree roots …	NA
mn127:8.5	NA	NA
mn127:8.6	a single village district …	NA
mn127:8.7	NA	NA
mn127:8.8	two or three village districts …	NA
mn127:8.9	NA	NA
mn127:8.10	a single kingdom …	NA
mn127:8.11	NA	NA
mn127:8.12	two or three kingdoms …	NA
mn127:8.13	NA	NA
mn127:8.14	this land surrounded by ocean.	NA
mn127:8.15	This too is called the expansive release of the heart.	NA
mn127:8.16	This is a way to understand how these things differ in both meaning and phrasing.	NA
mn127:9.1	Householder, there are these four kinds of rebirth in a future life.	“Rebirth in a future life” renders _bhavūpapatti_. This section explains how the meditation one develops can shape one’s rebirth.
mn127:9.2	What four?	NA
mn127:9.3	Take someone who meditates focused on pervading ‘limited radiance’.	NA
mn127:9.4	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of the gods of limited radiance.	The gods of limited radiance are mentioned at [mn41:18-42.22](), where they are reborn due to a limited practice of the second absorption.
mn127:9.5	Next, take someone who meditates focused on pervading ‘limitless radiance’.	NA
mn127:9.6	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of the gods of limitless radiance.	NA
mn127:9.7	Next, take someone who meditates focused on pervading ‘corrupted radiance’.	Normally the suttas maintain a clear distinction between the “corrupted” (_saṅkiliṭṭha_) mind that is purified before attaining the radiance of absorption. This passage, however, suggests that things might not always be so clear-cut.
mn127:9.8	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of the gods of corrupted radiance.	NA
mn127:9.9	Next, take someone who meditates focused on pervading ‘pure radiance’.	NA
mn127:9.10	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of the gods of pure radiance.	NA
mn127:9.11	These are the four kinds of rebirth in a future life.	NA
mn127:10.1	There comes a time, householder, when the deities gather together as one. When they do so, a difference in their color is evident, but not in their radiance.	NA
mn127:10.2	It’s like when a person brings several oil lamps into one house.	NA
mn127:10.3	You can detect a difference in their flames, but not in their radiance.	NA
mn127:10.4	In the same way, when the deities gather together as one, a difference in their color is evident, but not in their radiance.	NA
mn127:11.1	There comes a time when those deities go their separate ways. When they do so, a difference both in their color and also in their radiance is evident.	NA
mn127:11.2	It’s like when a person takes those several oil lamps out of that house.	NA
mn127:11.3	You can detect a difference both in their flames and also in their radiance.	NA
mn127:11.4	In the same way, when the deities go their separate ways, a difference both in their color and also in their radiance is evident.	NA
mn127:12.1	It’s not that those deities think,	NA
mn127:12.2	‘What we have is permanent, lasting, and eternal.’ Rather, wherever those deities cling, that’s where they take pleasure.	NA
mn127:12.3	It’s like when flies are being carried along on a carrying-pole or basket. It’s not that they think,	NA
mn127:12.4	‘What we have is permanent, lasting, and eternal.’ Rather, wherever those flies cling, that’s where they take pleasure.	NA
mn127:12.5	In the same way, it’s not that those deities think,	NA
mn127:12.6	‘What we have is permanent, lasting, and eternal.’ Rather, wherever those deities cling, that’s where they take pleasure.”	This example shows that “craving for rebirth” need not be conscious.
mn127:13.1	When he had spoken, Venerable Sabhiya Kaccāna said to Venerable Anuruddha:	We meet Sabhiya Kaccāna also at [sn44.1](), where he is questioned by Vacchagotta. His verses are at [thag4.3](). The conversion of a wanderer named Sabhiya is recorded in [snp3.6](); this might be the same person.

mn127:17.2	“Good, Honorable Anuruddha!	NA
mn127:17.3	Venerable Anuruddha, you don’t say,	NA
mn127:17.4	‘So I have heard’ or ‘It ought to be like this.’	The phrase cited by Sabhiya here, “so I have heard” (_evaṁ me sutaṁ_), is the standard opening for Buddhist suttas. This passage illustrates that this tag was used in order to indicate that the speaker was not present at the events, but “heard” about them. This is in contrast with the phrase “I heard and learned this in the presence” (_sammukhā sutaṁ, sammukhā paṭiggahitaṁ_), which is used when reporting a teaching heard directly from the Buddha, eg. [sn55.52:5.1](), [sn22.90:9.1](), [mn47:10.7](), etc.
mn127:17.5	Rather, you say: ‘These deities are like this, those deities are like that.’	NA
mn127:17.6	Sir, it occurs to me,	NA
mn127:17.7	‘Clearly, Venerable Anuruddha has previously lived together with those deities, conversed, and engaged in discussion.’”	NA
mn127:17.8	“Your words are clearly invasive and intrusive, Reverend Kaccāna.	Sabhiya is bluntly asking about Anuruddha’s personal meditation attainments. It is a minor offence to declare these to lay people, but they may be discussed among monastics ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8]()). In this case, Anuruddha is speaking to a monastic while at least one lay person can overhear, a situation not addressed in the Vinaya.
mn127:17.9	Nevertheless, I will answer you.	NA
mn127:17.10	For a long time I have previously lived together with those deities, conversed, and engaged in discussion.”	NA

The “corruptions” of the title are the subtle mental flaws that undermine meditation when it is on the brink of absorption. | This discourse and [mn31]() appear to be influenced by Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3, a famous dialogue where an unusually reluctant Yājñavalkya is repeatedly pressed by King Janaka to reveal the true nature of a person’s light.
mn128:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery.	NA
mn128:2.1	Now at that time the mendicants of Kosambī were arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words.	This is in reference to the notorious quarrel at Kosambī, also referred to at [mn48:2.1](). The events are detailed in the Vinaya at [pli-tv-kd10]().
mn128:3.1	Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and told him what was happening, adding:	NA
mn128:3.2	NA	NA
mn128:3.3	“Please, sir go to those mendicants out of sympathy.”	NA
mn128:3.4	The Buddha consented with silence.	While both here and at [mn48]() we see the Buddha intervening to settle the conflict, here he goes to them, while there he summons them to him; and the ensuing course of the sutta is quite different.
mn128:4.1	Then the Buddha went up to those mendicants and said,	NA
mn128:4.2	“Enough, mendicants! Stop arguing, quarreling, and disputing.”	NA
mn128:4.3	When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha,	NA
mn128:4.4	“Wait, sir!	NA
mn128:4.5	Let the Buddha, the Lord of the Dhamma,	NA
mn128:4.6	remain passive, dwelling in blissful meditation in this life.	NA

mn128:5.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kosambī for alms.	NA
mn128:5.2	After the meal, on his return from almsround, he set his lodgings in order. Taking his bowl and robe, he recited these verses while standing right there:	NA
mn128:6.1	“Many voices shout at once,	These verses are also found in the Vinaya account at [pli-tv-kd10:3.1.3]() and the Kosambiya Jātaka at [ja428:1.1]().

mn128:7.1	After speaking these verses while standing, the Buddha went to the village of the child salt-miners,	“Child salt-miners” is _bālakaloṇakāra_ (cf. _loṇakāradārako_ at [an4.188:5.3]()). Children are used to mine salt in India to this day.
mn128:7.2	where Venerable Bhagu was staying at the time.	Bhagu was a leading Sakyan who went forth along with Bhaddiya, Anuruddha, Ānanda, Kimbila, Devadatta, and Upāli ([pli-tv-kd17:1.4.1]()). He is known from his ardent striving described in his verses at [thag4.2](), and is listed with other renowned mendicants at [mn68:2.2](). | After the conflict at Kosambī, the Buddha sought the company of his fellow Sakyans; first Bhagu, then the three Sakyans below. | Another Bhagu was one of the ancient Vedic seers, while yet another was a contemporary of Sāṇavāsī around the time of the Second Council ([pli-tv-kd8:24.6.6]()).
mn128:7.3	Bhagu saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,	NA
mn128:7.4	so he spread out a seat and placed water for washing the feet.	NA
mn128:7.5	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,	NA
mn128:7.6	and washed his feet.	NA
mn128:7.7	Bhagu bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.	NA
mn128:7.8	The Buddha said to him,	NA
mn128:7.9	“I hope you’re keeping well, mendicant; I hope you’re all right. And I hope you’re having no trouble getting almsfood.”	NA
mn128:7.10	“I’m keeping well, Blessed One; I’m all right. And I’m having no trouble getting almsfood.”	NA
mn128:7.11	Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Bhagu with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and set out for the Eastern Bamboo Park.	NA
mn128:8.1	Now at that time the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila were staying in the Eastern Bamboo Park.	The Eastern Bamboo Park was in Ceti, not far from Kosambī. | Apart from the setting, the following passage is identical with [mn31:2.1]()ff., down as far as the discussion on meditation; see that sutta for notes. The current sutta is the original narrative context (see note on [mn31:6.1]()).
mn128:8.2	The park keeper saw the Buddha coming off in the distance	NA
mn128:8.3	and said to the Buddha,	NA
mn128:8.4	“Don’t come into this park, ascetic.	MS and BJT read _mahāsamaṇa_ here, whereas PTS and parallel passages at [mn31:3.4]() and [pli-tv-kd10:4.2.3]() have simply _samaṇa_. _Mahāsamaṇa_ (“great ascetic”) is a rare epithet of the Buddha found mainly in the Vinaya. It is unlikely the park keeper would have kept him out knowing who he really was.
mn128:8.5	There are three gentlemen staying here whose nature is to desire only the self.	NA
mn128:8.6	Don’t disturb them.”	NA
mn128:9.1	Anuruddha heard the park keeper conversing with the Buddha,	NA
mn128:9.2	and said to him,	NA
mn128:9.3	“Don’t keep the Buddha out, good park keeper!	NA
mn128:9.4	Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has arrived.”	NA
mn128:10.1	Then Anuruddha went to Nandiya and Kimbila, and said to them,	NA
mn128:10.2	“Come forth, venerables, come forth! Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has arrived!”	NA
mn128:10.3	Then Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila came out to greet the Buddha.	NA
mn128:10.4	One received his bowl and robe, one spread out a seat, and one set out water for washing his feet.	NA
mn128:10.5	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out	NA
mn128:10.6	and washed his feet.	NA
mn128:10.7	Those venerables bowed and sat down to one side.	NA
mn128:10.8	The Buddha said to Anuruddha,	NA
mn128:10.9	“I hope you’re keeping well, Anuruddha and friends; I hope you’re all right. And I hope you’re having no trouble getting almsfood.”	NA
mn128:10.10	“We’re keeping well, Blessed One; we’re all right. And we’re having no trouble getting almsfood.”	NA
mn128:11.1	“I hope you’re living in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes?”	NA
mn128:11.2	“Indeed, sir, we live in harmony as you say.”	NA
mn128:11.3	“But how do you live this way?”	NA
mn128:12.1	“In this case, sir, I think:	NA
mn128:12.2	‘I’m fortunate, so very fortunate,	NA
mn128:12.3	to live together with spiritual companions such as these.’	NA
mn128:12.4	I consistently treat these venerables with kindness by way of body, speech, and mind, both in public and in private.	NA
mn128:12.5	NA	NA
mn128:12.6	NA	NA
mn128:12.7	I think:	NA

mn128:12.9	And that’s what I do.	NA
mn128:12.10	Though we’re different in body, sir, we’re one in mind, it seems to me.”	NA

mn128:13.2	But I hope you’re living diligently, keen, and resolute?”	NA
mn128:14.1	“Indeed, sir, we live diligently.”	NA
mn128:14.2	“But how do you live this way?”	NA
mn128:14.3	“In this case, sir, whoever returns first from almsround prepares the seats, and puts out the drinking water and the rubbish bin.	NA
mn128:14.4	If there’s anything left over, whoever returns last eats it if they like. Otherwise they throw it out where there is little that grows, or drop it into water that has no living creatures.	NA
mn128:14.5	Then they put away the seats, drinking water, and rubbish bin, and sweep the refectory.	NA
mn128:14.6	If someone sees that the pot of water for washing, drinking, or the toilet is empty they set it up.	NA
mn128:14.7	If he can’t do it, he summons another with a wave of the hand, and they set it up by lending each other a hand to lift. But we don’t break into speech for that reason.	For _hatthavilaṅghaka_ (“lending a hand up”) see [mn125:9.2]().
mn128:14.8	And every five days we sit together for the whole night and discuss the teachings.	NA
mn128:14.9	That’s how we live diligently, keen, and resolute.”	NA
mn128:15.1	“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!	NA
mn128:15.2	But as you live diligently like this, have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a comfortable meditation?”	As at [mn31:10.3]()ff., Anuruddha must be prodded to reveal the full extent of his meditation prowess. The form of both suttas parallels Yājñavalkya’s reticence to answer Janaka. In addition, the theme also echoes the Upaniṣad, for Janaka asks what is a person’s light (_kiṁjyotirayaṁ puruṣa_, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.2). Yājñavalkya answers that it is simply the sun. When pressed further, he admits it might be the moon, then fire, or even speech, for you can make it home in the dark when someone is calling. All these things—sun, moon, fire, speech—are worshipped in the Vedic tradition as external manifestations of divinity. He only reluctantly admits that a person’s true light is their Self, made of consciousness, the light in the heart. This is the same Self referred to above in the phrase, “whose nature is to desire only the self”. | The Vedantic commentator Śaṅkara, on a verse of the same chapter (4.3.7), discusses at length Buddhist objections to his doctrine. Thus the Buddhist text looks back to the Upaniṣad, while the commentary to that same Upaniṣad looks to Buddhism.
mn128:15.3	“Well, sir, while meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, we perceive both light and vision of forms.	The key terms here are “perceive” (_sañjānāma_), “light” (_obhāsa_), and “vision of forms” (_dassanañca rūpānaṁ_). Variations of these are common terms for the visions seen in meditation (eg. [dn9:14.2](), [mn77:22.2](), [mn121:5.4]()). The “light” is the radiance that indicates freedom from defilements, while the “forms” may be the various phenomena that one in such a meditation might see. In particular this refers to the power of clairvoyance (_dibbacakkhu_), in which Anuruddha was later declared foremost ([an1.192:1.1]()). See the discussion in the previous sutta ([mn127:10.1]()) and also eg. [mn32:6.6](), [sn9.6:1.2]() [an3.130:1.3](), and [an8.46:1.3]().
mn128:15.4	But before long the light and the vision of forms vanish.	NA
mn128:15.5	We haven’t worked out the basis of that.”	Below, the Buddha investigates by way of “cause and reason” ([mn128:16.5]()), hence the commentary explains _nimitta_ here as “basis” (_kāraṇa_; for similar senses see [mn12:23.1](), [sn48.40:1.6](), [an3.102:1.2]()). | Confusingly, in the previous sentence we have “light and vision of forms”, but this is not _nimitta_, which does not have this meaning in early texts. For related contexts, see [dn11:80.12](), [dn33:1.9.27](), [mn5:6.1](), [mn20:2.1](), [mn36:45.6](), [mn44:12.3](), [an3.19:2.3](), [an4.14:4.2](), [an6.27:7.1](), and [an9.35:1.11](). | Anuruddha learned his lesson, for at [mn68:6.2]() he explains how hindrances prevent absorption.
mn128:16.1	“Well, you should work out the basis of that.	NA
mn128:16.2	Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too perceived light and vision of forms.	NA
mn128:16.3	But before long my light and vision of forms vanished.	This refers to a stage in the development of meditation when immersion is not properly consolidated. It is a delicate phase, where familiar hindrances appear in subtle ways, which can nonetheless be an obstacle for absorption. Below I give my understanding of these meditation issues and how to deal with them.

Doubt can also arise regarding whether the visions seen in meditation are real. This can be counteracted by determining one’s meditation at the beginning. | These three sentences use grammatical tense very precisely: an event is recalled (in past tense); a timeless principle is inferred (in present tense); and a resolution is made (in future tense).

While “terror” might feel like an overly-strong rendering for _chambhitatta_ in this context, this example shows what it means. At this point the mind is amplified, so that even small reactions can quickly get out of hand. The Buddha explains more about this point in his meditation at [mn4:20.1]().

mn128:31.1	I thought:	NA
mn128:31.2	‘I’ve given up my mental corruptions.	NA
mn128:31.3	Now let me develop immersion in three ways.’	NA
mn128:31.4	I developed immersion while placing the mind and keeping it connected; without placing the mind, merely keeping it connected; without placing the mind or keeping it connected; with rapture; without rapture; with pleasure; with equanimity.	This threefold presentation of the process of absorption focuses on _vitakka_ (“placing the mind”) and _vicāra_ (“keeping it connected”), looking closely at how they cease (see also [dn33:1.10.121](), [dn34:1.4.7](), [sn43.3:1.2](), and [an8.63:3.1]()). The standard _jhāna_ formula focuses more on the refinement of feelings, from which perspective the first two stages of immersion here fall under the “rapture and bliss born of seclusion”, while only the third qualifies as “rapture and bliss born of immersion”. Thus Analayo describes the two descriptions as “complementary perspectives on the same process of deepening concentration” (*Comparative Study*, vol. ii, pg. 739, note 263).
mn128:32.1	When I had developed immersion in these ways,	NA
mn128:32.2	the knowledge and vision arose in me:	NA
mn128:32.3	‘My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.’”	NA

mn129:1.1	So I have heard.	This discourse is a fundamental statement on the role of kamma. It identifies a fool with one who acts badly, and describes the suffering that awaits them in this life and the next. An astute person who acts well, by contrast, will experience countless joys.
mn129:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn129:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn129:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn129:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn129:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA

mn129:2.5	‘This worthy one is a fool, an untrue person’?	NA
mn129:2.6	But since a fool does think poorly, speak poorly, and act poorly, then the astute do know of them,	NA
mn129:2.7	‘This worthy one is a fool, an untrue person’.	NA
mn129:3.1	A fool experiences three kinds of suffering and sadness in this very life.	NA
mn129:3.2	Suppose a fool is sitting in a council hall, a street, or a crossroad,	NA
mn129:3.3	where people are discussing what is proper and fitting.	NA
mn129:3.4	And suppose that fool is someone who kills living creatures, steals, commits sexual misconduct, lies, and consumes beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.	NA
mn129:3.5	Then that fool thinks,	NA
mn129:3.6	‘These people are discussing what is proper and fitting.	NA
mn129:3.7	But those bad things are found in me and I exhibit them!’	NA
mn129:3.8	This is the first kind of suffering and sadness that a fool experiences in this very life.	NA
mn129:4.1	Furthermore, a fool sees that the kings have arrested a bandit, a criminal, and subjected them to various punishments—	NA
mn129:4.2	whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘Rāhu’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘bulrush twist’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded.

mn129:4.9	This is the second kind of suffering and sadness that a fool experiences in this very life.	NA
mn129:5.1	Furthermore, when a fool is resting on a chair or a bed or on the ground, their past bad deeds—misconduct of body, speech, and mind—settle down upon them, rest down upon them, and lay down upon them.	NA
mn129:5.2	It is like the shadow of a great mountain peak in the evening as it settles down, rests down, and lays down upon the earth.	NA

mn129:5.4	Then that fool thinks,	NA

mn129:5.7	When I depart, I’ll go to the place where people who’ve done such things go.’	NA
mn129:5.8	They sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breasts and falling into confusion.	NA

mn129:6.1	Having done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	NA
mn129:7.1	And if there’s anything of which it may be rightly said that	NA

mn129:7.5	When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha,	NA

mn129:8.1	“It’s possible,” said the Buddha.	NA

mn129:8.21	“Sir, that man would experience pain and distress from being struck with one spear, let alone three hundred spears!”	NA
mn129:9.1	Then the Buddha, picking up a stone the size of his palm, addressed the mendicants,	Related similes are collected in [sn13.1]()ff. and [sn56.49]()ff., but this particular one is unique.

mn129:10.1	The wardens of hell punish them with the five-fold crucifixion.	The Buddhist traditions were uncomfortable with the idea that the “wardens of hell” (_nirayapāla_) are sentient beings, since this would imply that they are not merely working off the results of their own bad deeds, but actively creating new bad kamma by tormenting others. The commentary cites “certain elders” who argue that there are no wardens of hell because kamma works “like a machine” (_yantarūpaṁ viya_). These elders are probably the Mahāsaṅghikas of Andhra who, according to the commentary on [kv20.3](), say the torments are inflicted by the deeds themselves in the form of wardens of hell. The Theravadin commentator responds by analogy, since there are those who inflict punishment in the human realm. The situation was comparable in northern Indian Buddhism, for Vasubandhu at Abhidharmakośabhāṣya 3.59a–c cites a number of opinions on both sides. In his Viṁśikā vv. 4–7 and commentary he makes his own position clear, arguing that the wardens are mental projections, not sentient beings.

mn129:35.1	Then the anointed aristocratic king, taking a ceremonial vase in his left hand, besprinkled the wheel-treasure with his right hand, saying,	Many of the details in this myth echo the Brahmanical horse sacrifice. Since the horse was the primary source of Indo-European dominion, its sacrifice served to authorize the power of a king. It was a costly and dangerous rite that was attempted only by the greatest of sovereigns. | _Bhiṅkāra_ (“ceremonial vase”) and _abbhukkirati_ (“besprinkled”) are elevated terms.

These have sometimes been rendered “eat”, “enjoy”, or “govern”. But compare the archaic English “use” meaning “the benefit or profit of lands”. Thus _yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha_ means “use as has been used”, i.e. “maintain the current level of taxation”.
mn129:35.8	And so the opposing rulers of the eastern quarter become his vassals.	NA
mn129:35.9	Then the wheel-treasure, having plunged into the eastern ocean and emerged again, rolls towards the south. …	The Wheel plunges into the seas, while the sacrificial horse is born in the western and eastern seas.

mn129:36.2	It was an all-white sky-walker with psychic power, touching the ground in seven places, a king of elephants named Sabbath.	The white elephant is a symbol of royalty to this day. The description recalls Indra’s elephant Airāvata. | For _sattappatiṭṭho_, the commentary has _susaṇṭhitaaṅgapaccaṅga_ (“well-grounded on each and every limb”), a sense confirmed by the Mūlasarvāstivāda Bhaiṣajyavastu which has _saptāṅgaḥ supratiṣṭhito_ (“well-established on seven limbs”).

The sacrificial horse is likewise white with black head or forequarters. It is identified with the sun, thus being a “sky-walker”. “Thundercloud” (_valāhaka_; Sanskrit _balāhaka_) is the name of one of the four horses of Kṛṣṇa’s chariot in the Mahābharata.

mn130:0.1	Middle Discourses 130	NA
mn130:0.2	Messengers of the Gods	NA
mn130:1.1	So I have heard.	Framed with the parable of the “messengers of the gods”, which are portents of mortality, this discourse expands the description of the power of clairvoyance or “divine eye” (_dibbacakkhu_), with a special emphasis on the descriptions of the torments of hell (_niraya_). This was a very popular discourse, with no fewer than six Chinese parallels and multiple references in Sanskrit literature. The Sinhala chronicle says it was taught as a primary text in Mahisamaṇḍala by Mahādeva, and in Sri Lanka by Mahinda, each time resulting in mass conversions (Mahāvaṁsa 12:29, 14:63).
mn130:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn130:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn130:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn130:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn130:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn130:2.1	“Mendicants, suppose there were two houses with doors. A person with clear eyes standing in between them would see humans entering and leaving a house and wandering to and fro.	NA
mn130:2.2	In the same way, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, or among humans. These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the ghost realm, the animal realm, or in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’	NA
mn130:3.1	The wardens of hell take them by the arms and present them to King Yama, saying,	There is a set of beliefs about hell that is common to Buddhists, Hindus, and Jains. This “hell complex” includes such beliefs as: hell is long-lasting but impermanent; there are many named hells; punishments are terrible and varied; the punishment is determined by kamma; and tortures are inflicted by hell wardens. This sutta appears to be the earliest full account of this hell complex in Indian literature. Below I briefly outline the development of the hell complex in Brahmanical literature ([mn130:10.1]()).
mn130:3.2	‘Your Majesty, this person did not pay due respect to their mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, or honor the elders in the family.	NA
mn130:3.3	May Your Majesty punish them!’	NA
mn130:3.4	King Yama pursues, presses, and grills them about the first messenger of the gods.	NA
mn130:3.5	‘Worthy man, did you not see the first messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’	Such “messengers of the gods” appear as reminders for the dangers of mortality. Five appear here—birth, old age, sickness, punishment, and death—while [an3.36]() has three, namely old age, sickness, and death. At [mn83:4.6]() we meet just one, the grey hairs of old age. In non-Buddhist texts, such messengers can also be celestial interlocutors in a more literal sense (eg. Mahābhārata 1.2.232b, 1.9.005d). | Compare the four signs that prompted Vipassī’s going forth ([dn14:2.1.1]()).

The history of hell in India begins with the Rig Veda, which speaks of evil-doers facing the “erasure of the wolf”, the “downfall” (2.29.6c), the “bottomless darkness” (7.104.3) “beneath all three earths” (7.104.11), the “endless abyss” (7.104.17), the “darkness below” (10.152.4). Atharva Veda similarly speaks of the “house below” (2.14.3a), the “deepest dark” (8.2.24). It also consigns a man stingy with cattle to the _nārakaṁ lokaṁ_, which seems to mean “the world of the hell beings” (12.4.36c); there is an equally vague reference to a “hell being” at Śukla Yajur Veda 30.5. These seem to be the earliest uses of the word _naraka_ in the sense of “hell”; this sense is not found in early Pali (see note on [dn12:78.2]()). Jaiminīya Brāhmaņa 1.42 describes the “other world” in both hellish and heavenly terms (see too Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.6.1). It depicts the hellish torments taking place in regions of the “other world” rather than as a distinct hell realm; and it does not share many details in common with later accounts. Thus far the texts are pre-Buddhist. It is not until the much later Purāṇic literature that lurid descriptions of hells, usually numbered 21 or 28, become a standard feature, along with the rest of the hell complex. Several of the places mentioned here correspond with the Purāṇic hells.
mn130:10.2	They drive red-hot stakes through the hands and feet, and another in the middle of the chest.	NA
mn130:10.3	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	I give a few examples of similar descriptions in the Purāṇas and the Jain Sūtrakṛtāṅga, without any attempt to be comprehensive. | The notion that one does not die despite the suffering is also found at Bhāgavata Purāṇa 5.26.28 and Sūtrakṛtāṅga 1.5.1.16. | The lifespan of one in hell is illustrated in the story of Kokālika ([sn6.10]() = [an10.89]()), which is repeated at [snp3.10]() with an expanded description of the hells that bears much in common with the present discourse.
mn130:11.1	The wardens of hell throw them down and hack them with axes. …	Brahma Purāṇa 106.40–41.
mn130:12.1	They hang them upside-down and hack them with hatchets. …	Śiva Purāṇa 5.9.26; Devī Bhāgavata Purāṇa 8.23. There is a special “Upside-down hell” in Viṣṇu Purāṇa 2.63.
mn130:13.1	They harness them to a chariot, and drive them back and forth across burning ground, blazing and glowing. …	NA
mn130:14.1	They make them climb up and down a huge mountain of burning coals, blazing and glowing. …	NA
mn130:15.1	The wardens of hell turn them upside down and throw them in a red-hot copper pot, burning, blazing, and glowing.	Agni Purāṇa 307.25; Śiva Purāṇa 5.9.9, 34, 44.
mn130:15.2	NA	NA
mn130:15.3	There they’re seared in boiling scum, and they’re swept up and down and round and round.	NA
mn130:15.4	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	NA
mn130:16.1	The wardens of hell toss them into the Great Hell.	NA
mn130:16.2	Now, about that Great Hell:	NA
mn130:16.3	‘Four are its corners, four its doors,	NA
mn130:16.4	neatly divided in equal parts.	NA
mn130:16.5	Surrounded by an iron wall,	NA
mn130:16.6	of iron is its roof.	NA
mn130:16.7	The ground is even made of iron,	NA
mn130:16.8	it burns with fierce fire.	The Kālasūtra hell is made of burning copper (Bhāgavata Purāṇa 5.26.14).
mn130:16.9	The heat forever radiates	NA
mn130:16.10	a hundred leagues around.’	NA
mn130:17.1	Now in the Great Hell, flames surge out of the walls and crash into the opposite wall: from east to west, from west to east, from north to south, from south to north, from bottom to top, from top to bottom.	NA
mn130:17.2	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	NA
mn130:18.1	There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, the eastern gate of the Great Hell is opened.	NA
mn130:18.2	So they run there as fast as they can.	Bhāgavata Purāṇa 5.26.15 describes how the sinner runs about in pain trying to escape.
mn130:18.3	And as they run, their outer skin, inner skin, flesh, and sinews burn and even their bones smoke. Such is their escape;	Śiva Purāṇa 5.9.37.
mn130:18.4	but when they’ve managed to make it most of the way, the gate is slammed shut.	NA
mn130:18.5	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	NA
mn130:18.6	There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, the western gate …	NA
mn130:18.7	northern gate …	NA
mn130:18.8	southern gate of the Great Hell is opened.	NA
mn130:18.9	So they run there as fast as they can.	NA
mn130:18.10	And as they run, their outer skin, inner skin, flesh, and sinews burn and even their bones smoke. Such is their escape;	NA
mn130:18.11	but when they’ve managed to make it most of the way, the gate is slammed shut.	NA
mn130:18.12	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	NA
mn130:19.1	There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, the eastern gate of the Great Hell is opened.	NA
mn130:19.2	So they run there as fast as they can.	NA
mn130:19.3	And as they run, their outer skin, inner skin, flesh, and sinews burn and even their bones smoke. Such is their escape;	NA
mn130:19.4	and they make it out that door.	NA
mn130:20.1	Immediately adjacent to the Great Hell is the vast Dung Hell.	NA
mn130:20.2	And that’s where they fall.	NA
mn130:20.3	In that Dung Hell there are needle-mouthed creatures that bore through the outer skin, the inner skin, the flesh, sinews, and bones, until they reach the marrow and devour it.	“Needle-mouth” (_sūcimukha_) is one of the 28 Purāṇic hells, the destiny of scrooges, where one is stitched as cloth by a tailor (Bhāgavata Purāṇa 526.36; Devī Bhāgavata Purāṇa 8.23). Śiva Purāṇa 5.9.42–3 describes how sinners are devoured by sharp-toothed worms while rotting in mounds of flesh; Bhāgavata Purāṇa 5.26.17 says one is devoured by the same creatures one killed while alive.
mn130:20.4	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	NA
mn130:21.1	Immediately adjacent to the Dung Hell is the vast Hell of Burning Chaff.	Śiva Purāṇa 5.9.18.
mn130:21.2	And that’s where they fall.	NA
mn130:21.3	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	NA
mn130:22.1	Immediately adjacent to the Hell of Burning Chaff is the vast Red Silk-Cotton Forest. It’s a league high, full of sixteen-inch thorns, burning, blazing, and glowing.	The “Red Silk-Cotton Forest” (_simbalivana_) is one of the 28 hells (Bhāgavata Purāṇa 5.26.7; Devī Bhāgavatapurāṇa 10.21.11–28; Śiva Purāṇa 5.9.20). The red silk cotton tree (_simbali_, Sanskrit _śālmalī_, _bombax ceiba_) has a spiky trunk. Treading on the spikes could cause infections (Rig Veda 7.50.3). | This hell and the next reflect the miseries of struggling through thick, prickly jungles.
mn130:22.2	And there they make them climb up and down.	NA
mn130:22.3	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	NA
mn130:23.1	Immediately adjacent to the Red Silk-Cotton Forest is the vast Sword-Leaf Forest.	The “Sword-Leaf Forest” (_asipattavana_; also at [snp3.10:25.1]()) is another of the 28 hells. This befalls those who destroy forests (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa 4.2.173; Viṣṇu Purāṇa 6.2), while Agni Purāṇa 203.10 says it is for one who killed their mother, and Bhāgavata Purāṇa 5.26.15 says it is for one who strays from the Vedas.
mn130:23.2	They enter that.	NA
mn130:23.3	There the fallen leaves blown by the wind cut their hands, feet, both hands and feet; they cut their ears, nose, both ears and nose.	NA
mn130:23.4	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	NA
mn130:24.1	Immediately adjacent to the Sword-Leaf Forest is the vast Acid River.	The “Acid River” (_khārodakā nadī_) is yet another of the 28 hells (_kṣārakardama_, Śiva Purāṇa 5.9.8; Bhāgavata Purāṇa 5.26.30; Devī Bhāgavata Purāṇa 8.21; Skanda Purāṇa 6.1.226.54).
mn130:24.2	And that’s where they fall.	NA
mn130:24.3	There they are swept upstream, swept downstream, and swept both up and down stream.	NA
mn130:24.4	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	NA
mn130:25.1	The wardens of hell pull them out with a hook and place them on dry land, and say,	NA
mn130:25.2	‘Worthy man, what do you want?’	Brahma Purāṇa 106.25–32.
mn130:25.3	They say,	NA
mn130:25.4	‘I’m hungry, sir.’	NA
mn130:25.5	The wardens of hell force open their mouth with a hot iron spike—burning, blazing, glowing—and shove in a red-hot copper ball, burning, blazing, and glowing.	Śiva Purāṇa 5.9.45.
mn130:25.6	It burns their lips, mouth, tongue, throat, and stomach before coming out below dragging their entrails.	NA
mn130:25.7	And there they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	NA
mn130:26.1	The wardens of hell say,	NA
mn130:26.2	‘Worthy man, what do you want?’	NA
mn130:26.3	They say,	NA
mn130:26.4	‘I’m thirsty, sir.’	NA
mn130:26.5	The wardens of hell force open their mouth with a hot iron spike—burning, blazing, glowing—and pour in molten copper, burning, blazing, and glowing.	The “iron drink” (_ayaḥpāna_) is another Purāṇic hell (Agni Purāṇa 307.25–28; Bhāgavata Purāṇa 5.26.29; Devī Bhāgavata Purāṇa 8.23).
mn130:26.6	It burns their lips, mouth, tongue, throat, and stomach before coming out below dragging their entrails.	NA
mn130:26.7	And there they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	NA
mn130:27.1	The wardens of hell toss them back in the Great Hell.	NA
mn130:28.1	Once upon a time, King Yama thought:	NA
mn130:28.2	‘Those who do such bad deeds in the world receive these many different punishments.	NA
mn130:28.3	Oh, I hope I may be reborn as a human being! And that a Realized One—a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha—arises in the world! And that I may pay homage to the Buddha!	NA
mn130:28.4	Then the Buddha can teach me Dhamma, so that I may understand his teaching.’	NA
mn130:29.1	Now, I don’t say this because I’ve heard it from some other ascetic or brahmin. I only say it because I’ve known, seen, and realized it for myself.”	This statement is found only in the Pali text, although Chinese texts are effectively similar, in that they all speak of the Buddha’s clairvoyance.
mn130:30.1	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn130:30.2	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	NA
mn130:30.3	“When warned by the gods’ messengers,	NA
mn130:30.4	those sons of Manu who are negligent	NA
mn130:30.5	sorrow for a long time	NA
mn130:30.6	when they go to that wretched place.	NA
mn130:30.7	When warned by the gods’ messengers,	NA
mn130:30.8	the good and true persons here	NA
mn130:30.9	never neglect	NA
mn130:30.10	the teaching of the Noble One.	NA
mn130:30.11	Seeing the danger in grasping,	NA
mn130:30.12	the origin of birth and death,	NA
mn130:30.13	the unattached are freed	NA
mn130:30.14	with the ending of birth and death.	NA
mn130:30.15	Happy, they’ve come to a safe place,	NA
mn130:30.16	quenched in this very life.	NA
mn130:30.17	They’ve gone beyond all threats and perils,	NA

mn131:0.1	Middle Discourses 131	NA
mn131:0.2	One Fine Night	NA
mn131:1.1	So I have heard.	A favorite of meditators, this discourse takes a distinctive set of verses as a template for explaining the aspect of meditation called  _vipassanā_, commonly rendered “insight”; for why I use  “discernment” see [dn14:1.37.5]() and note. The next three discourses explain the same verses on different occasions, with [mn133]() offering a complementary explanation.
mn131:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn131:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn131:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn131:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn131:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn131:2.1	“I shall teach you the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night.	NA
mn131:2.2	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn131:2.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
mn131:2.4	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn131:3.1	“Don’t run back to the past,	NA
mn131:3.2	don’t anticipate the future.	To “anticipate” (_paṭikaṅkhe_) is not always bad. A mendicant ought to “anticipate” dangers (_pāṭikaṅkhitabba_, [an4.122:1.1]() = [mn67:14.2]()); Nālaka “anticipates” the arrival of the Buddha (_patikkhaṁ_, [snp3.11:19.4]()); and an arahant “awaits their time” (_kālaṁ kaṅkhati_, [sn2.29:15.4]()). The verse here has a specific application in meditation, which is explained below.
mn131:3.3	What’s past is left behind,	NA
mn131:3.4	the future has not arrived;	NA
mn131:3.5	and any present phenomenon	Here “phenomenon” (_dhamma_) means anything that is directly knowable (see [mn133:17.9]()). | The two verses run on here, as indicated by the _ca_ linking this line with the previous.
mn131:3.6	you clearly discern in every case.	For _tattha tattha_ as “in every case” see eg. [dn30:2.1.3](), and compare _tato tattha vipassati_ at [snp5.15:4.4]().
mn131:3.7	The unfaltering, the unshakable:	At [thag14.1:5.1](), this phrase refers to the mind developed in meditation on love and compassion, while at [snp5.19:19.1]() it refers to Nibbana. In both cases, as here, it is the object of the verb, not an adverb.
mn131:3.8	having known that, foster it.	NA
mn131:3.9	Today’s the day to keenly work—	NA
mn131:3.10	who knows, tomorrow may bring death!	NA
mn131:3.11	For there is no bargain to be struck	NA
mn131:3.12	with Death and his mighty horde.	NA
mn131:3.13	One who keenly meditates like this,	NA
mn131:3.14	tireless all night and day:	NA
mn131:3.15	that’s who has one fine night—	NA
mn131:3.16	so declares the peaceful sage.	The “peaceful sage” is the Buddha.
mn131:4.1	And how do you run back to the past?	NA
mn131:4.2	You muster delight there, thinking: ‘I had such form in the past.’ … ‘I had such feeling … perception … choice … consciousness in the past.’	_Samanvāneti_ is unique in early Pali, but the similar _samānayi_ is found at [dn30:1.33.4]() and [thig12.1:10.2]() in the sense of “reunite, bring together”. “Muster” means both to bring together and to arouse.
mn131:4.3	That’s how you run back to the past.	NA
mn131:5.1	And how do you not run back to the past?	NA
mn131:5.2	You don’t muster delight there, thinking: ‘I had such form in the past.’ … ‘I had such feeling … perception … choice … consciousness in the past.’	NA
mn131:5.3	That’s how you don’t run back to the past.	NA
mn131:6.1	And how do you anticipate the future?	NA
mn131:6.2	You muster delight there, thinking: ‘May I have such form in the future.’ … ‘May I have such feeling … perception … choice … consciousness in the future.’	NA
mn131:6.3	That’s how you anticipate the future.	NA
mn131:7.1	And how do you not anticipate the future?	NA
mn131:7.2	You don’t muster delight there, thinking: ‘May I have such form in the future.’ … ‘May I have such feeling … perception … choice … consciousness in the future.’	NA
mn131:7.3	That’s how you don’t anticipate the future.	NA
mn131:8.1	And how do you falter amid presently arisen phenomena?	_Dhammesu_ (“phenomena”) is plural here, whereas in the verse it is singular. Sanskrit fragments, however, have plural in the verse as well.
mn131:8.2	It’s when an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.	NA
mn131:8.3	They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.	NA
mn131:8.4	They regard feeling …	NA
mn131:8.5	perception …	NA
mn131:8.6	choices …	NA
mn131:8.7	consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.	NA
mn131:8.8	That’s how you falter amid presently arisen phenomena.	NA
mn131:9.1	And how do you not falter amid presently arisen phenomena?	NA
mn131:9.2	It’s when a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen true persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true persons.	NA
mn131:9.3	They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.	NA
mn131:9.4	They don’t regard feeling …	NA
mn131:9.5	perception …	NA
mn131:9.6	choices …	NA

mn132:0.2	Ānanda and One Fine Night	NA
mn132:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn132:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn132:2.1	Now at that time Venerable Ānanda was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk on the topic of the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night.	NA
mn132:2.2	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat, went to the assembly hall, where he sat on the seat spread out,	NA
mn132:2.3	and addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn132:2.4	“Who was inspiring the mendicants with a talk on the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night?”	NA
mn132:2.5	“It was Venerable Ānanda, sir.”	NA
mn132:2.6	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	NA

mn133:0.1	Middle Discourses 133	NA
mn133:0.2	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night	NA
mn133:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn133:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monastery.	The hot springs near Rājagaha were a popular place for monks to bathe, so much so that they prompted a rule ensuring that the monks did not monopolize the springs ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57]()). They are still in use and just as popular as ever.
mn133:1.3	Then Venerable Samiddhi rose at the crack of dawn and went to the hot springs to bathe.	Soon after he went forth, a deity in the same location tempted Samiddhi to enjoy sensual delights ([sn1.20]()). Had he succumbed, that would have been a case of “faltering amid presently arisen phenomena”. Samiddhi further appears in discourses at [mn136](), where he had gone forth only three years, and [an9.14 ](), where he seems more mature. In [sn4.22](), Māra threatens to shake his faith, prompting him to ask the Buddha about Māra’s true nature ([sn35.65]()). This event is recalled in his verse at [thag1.46]().
mn133:1.4	When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying his limbs.	NA
mn133:1.5	Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire hot springs, went up to Samiddhi, stood to one side, and said to Samiddhi:	NA
mn133:2.1	“Mendicant, do you remember the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night?”	NA
mn133:2.2	“No, reverend, I do not.	NA
mn133:2.3	Do you?”	NA
mn133:2.4	“I also do not.	NA
mn133:2.5	But do you remember just the verses on the one who has one fine night?”	The “verses” are, in fact, the same thing as the “recitation passage” mentioned above. The Tibetan and Chinese parallels lack the doubled question.
mn133:2.6	“I do not.	NA
mn133:2.7	Do you?”	NA
mn133:2.8	“I also do not.	NA
mn133:2.9	Learn the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night, mendicant,	NA
mn133:2.10	memorize it,	NA
mn133:2.11	and remember it.	NA
mn133:2.12	It is beneficial and relates to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.”	NA
mn133:2.13	That’s what that deity said,	NA
mn133:2.14	before vanishing right there.	NA
mn133:3.1	Then, when the night had passed, Samiddhi went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then he added:	NA

mn133:4.16	“Well then, mendicant, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn133:4.17	“Yes, sir,” Samiddhi replied.	NA
mn133:4.18	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn133:5.1	“Don’t run back to the past,	NA
mn133:5.2	don’t anticipate the future.	NA
mn133:5.3	What’s past is left behind,	NA
mn133:5.4	the future has not arrived;	NA
mn133:5.5	and any present phenomenon	NA
mn133:5.6	you clearly discern in every case.	NA
mn133:5.7	The unfaltering, the unshakable:	NA
mn133:5.8	having known that, foster it.	NA
mn133:5.9	Today’s the day to keenly work—	NA
mn133:5.10	who knows, tomorrow may bring death!	NA
mn133:5.11	For there is no bargain to be struck	NA
mn133:5.12	with Death and his mighty horde.	NA
mn133:5.13	One who keenly meditates like this,	NA
mn133:5.14	tireless all night and day:	NA
mn133:5.15	that’s who has one fine night—	NA
mn133:5.16	so declares the peaceful sage.”	NA
mn133:6.1	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn133:6.2	When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.	Though he set to teach the “recitation passage and analysis”, the Buddha omits the analysis, so the monks ask Mahākaccāna for the analysis. The same situation obtains in [mn138:4.2](). In both cases the Chinese and Tibetan parallels avoid the problem, since the Buddha only says he will teach the verses. Contrast the situation at [mn137:2.1]() and [mn139:2.1]().
mn133:7.1	Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants considered,	NA
mn133:7.2	“The Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail. …	NA
mn133:7.3	NA	NA

mn133:7.19	Who can explain in detail the meaning of this brief summary given by the Buddha?”	NA
mn133:7.20	Then those mendicants thought:	NA
mn133:7.21	“This Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.	See note at [mn18:10.9]().
mn133:7.22	He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha.	NA
mn133:7.23	Let’s go to him, and ask him about this matter.”	NA
mn133:7.24	Then those mendicants went to Mahākaccāna, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn133:7.25	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. They told him what had happened, and said:	NA
mn133:7.26	NA	NA

mn133:9.2	Such is the consequence for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the Buddha, you overlooked him, imagining that you should ask me about this matter.	NA
mn133:9.3	For he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the manifestation of divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of freedom from death, the lord of truth, the Realized One.	NA
mn133:9.4	That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter. You should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”	NA
mn133:10.1	“Certainly he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the manifestation of divinity.

mn133:10.3	We should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.	NA
mn133:10.4	Still, Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.	NA
mn133:10.5	He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha.	NA
mn133:10.6	Please explain this, if it’s no trouble.”	NA
mn133:11.1	“Well then, reverends, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn133:11.2	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.	NA
mn133:11.3	Venerable Mahākaccāna said this:	NA
mn133:12.1	“Reverends, the Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail:	NA
mn133:12.2	‘Don’t run back to the past …	NA
mn133:12.3	NA	NA
mn133:12.4	that’s who has one fine night—	NA
mn133:12.5	so declares the peaceful sage.’	NA
mn133:12.6	And this is how I understand the detailed meaning of this summary recital.	NA
mn133:13.1	And how do you run back to the past?	NA
mn133:13.2	Consciousness gets tied up there with desire and lust, thinking: ‘In the past I had such eyes and such sights.’	As in [mn18:16.1]() and [mn138:10.2](), Kaccāna’s favored mode of analysis is through the six senses.
mn133:13.3	So you take pleasure in that, and that’s when you run back to the past.	NA
mn133:13.4	Consciousness gets tied up there with desire and lust, thinking: ‘In the past I had such ears and such sounds …	NA

mn133:13.9	So you take pleasure in that, and that’s when you run back to the past.	NA
mn133:13.10	That’s how you run back to the past.	NA
mn133:14.1	And how do you not run back to the past?	NA
mn133:14.2	Consciousness doesn’t get tied up there with desire and lust, thinking: ‘In the past I had such eyes and such sights.’	NA
mn133:14.3	So you don’t take pleasure in that, and that’s when you no longer run back to the past.	NA
mn133:14.4	Consciousness doesn’t get tied up there with desire and lust, thinking: ‘In the past I had such ears and such sounds …	NA

mn133:15.2	The heart is set on getting what it does not have, thinking: ‘May I have such eyes and such sights in the future.’	NA

mn133:16.10	That’s how you don’t anticipate the future.	NA
mn133:17.1	And how do you falter amid presently arisen phenomena?	NA
mn133:17.2	Both the eye and sights	NA

mn133:21.4	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn133:21.5	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn134:0.1	Middle Discourses 134	NA
mn134:0.2	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night	NA
mn134:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn134:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn134:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya was staying in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.	Lomasakaṅgiya’s verse speaks of his determination to forge his way through the dense jungle in search of seclusion ([thag1.27]()). He is probably also the same monk who appears in [sn54.12](). His name means “hairy-limbs”.
mn134:2.1	Then, late at night, the glorious godling Candana, lighting up the entire Banyan Tree Monastery, went up to the Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya, and stood to one side. Standing to one side, he said to Lomasakaṅgiya:	The god Candana, whose name means “sandalwood”, also appears at [dn20:10.5](), [dn32:10.4](), and [sn2:2.15]().
mn134:2.2	“Mendicant, do you remember the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night?”	NA
mn134:2.3	“No, reverend, I do not.	NA
mn134:2.4	Do you?”	NA
mn134:2.5	“I also do not.	NA
mn134:2.6	But do you remember just the verses on the one who has one fine night?”	NA
mn134:2.7	“I do not.	NA
mn134:2.8	Do you?”	NA
mn134:2.9	“I do.”	NA
mn134:2.10	“How do you remember the verses on the one who has one fine night?”	NA
mn134:2.11	“This one time, the Buddha was staying among the gods of the thirty-three at the root of the Shady Orchid Tree on the stone spread with a cream rug.	This suggests that Candana was one of the Thirty-three. In the Chinese parallels, however, he heard this at Rājagaha. | _Paṇḍukambala_ is a kind of luxury upholstery.
mn134:2.12	There he taught the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night to the gods of the thirty-three:	NA
mn134:3.1	‘Don’t run back to the past,	NA
mn134:3.2	don’t anticipate the future.	NA
mn134:3.3	What’s past is left behind,	NA
mn134:3.4	the future has not arrived;	NA
mn134:3.5	and any present phenomenon	NA
mn134:3.6	you clearly discern in every case.	NA
mn134:3.7	The unfaltering, the unshakable:	NA
mn134:3.8	having known that, foster it.	NA
mn134:3.9	Today’s the day to keenly work—	NA
mn134:3.10	who knows, tomorrow may bring death!	NA
mn134:3.11	For there is no bargain to be struck	NA
mn134:3.12	with Death and his mighty horde.	NA
mn134:3.13	One who keenly meditates like this,	NA
mn134:3.14	tireless all night and day:	NA
mn134:3.15	that’s who has one fine night—	NA
mn134:3.16	so declares the peaceful sage.’	NA
mn134:4.1	That’s how I remember the verses of the one who has one fine night.	NA
mn134:4.2	Learn the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night, mendicant,	NA
mn134:4.3	memorize it,	NA
mn134:4.4	and remember it.	NA
mn134:4.5	It is beneficial and relates to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.”	NA
mn134:4.6	That’s what the godling Candana said	NA
mn134:4.7	before vanishing right there.	NA
mn134:5.1	Then Lomasakaṅgiya set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Sāvatthī.	NA
mn134:5.2	Eventually he came to Sāvatthī and Jeta’s Grove. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then he added:	NA
mn134:5.28	“Sir, please teach me the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night.”	NA
mn134:6.1	“But mendicant, do you know that god?”	NA
mn134:6.2	“I do not, sir.”	NA
mn134:6.3	“That godling was named Candana.	NA
mn134:6.4	Candana pays attention, applies the mind, concentrates wholeheartedly, and actively listens to the teaching.	Candana is here praised for his skill in learning, yet earlier he says that although he was present when the Buddha taught the “recitation passage and analysis”, he only remembered the verses ([mn134:2.12]()). As at [mn133:6.2](), the parallels are more coherent, as they only mention him hearing the verses.
mn134:6.5	Well then, mendicant, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn134:6.6	“Yes, sir,” Lomasakaṅgiya replied.	NA
mn134:6.7	The Buddha said this:	NA

The phrase “some woman or man” is used only here and in a few suttas that also deal with kamma ([an3.70](), [an8.42](), [an8.43](), [an8.45]()). The mention of “woman or man” undercuts assumptions that women lack agency, or that their rebirth is lesser.
mn135:5.2	Because of undertaking such deeds, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	NA
mn135:5.3	If they’re not reborn in a place of loss, but return to the human realm, then wherever they’re reborn they’re short-lived.

mn136:0.2	The Longer Analysis of Deeds	NA
mn136:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn136:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
mn136:2.1	Now at that time Venerable Samiddhi was staying in a wilderness hut.	NA
mn136:2.2	Then as the wanderer Potaliputta was going for a walk he came up to Venerable Samiddhi and exchanged greetings with him.	This is the only time we meet Potaliputta. His name suggests he hails from the capital of Assaka, variously spelled Potali or Potana ([dn19:36.4]()). | As for Samiddhi, see note on [mn133:1.3]().
mn136:2.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him:	NA
mn136:2.4	“Reverend Samiddhi, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the ascetic Gotama:	NA
mn136:2.5	‘Deeds by way of body and speech are done in vain. Only mental deeds are real.’	NA
mn136:2.6	And: ‘There is such an attainment where the one who enters it does not feel anything at all.’”	NA
mn136:2.7	“Don’t say that, Reverend Potaliputta, don’t say that! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say this:	NA
mn136:2.8	‘Deeds by way of body and speech are done in vain. Only mental deeds are real.’	There is indeed no such statement in the suttas.
mn136:2.9	But, reverend, there is such an attainment where the one who enters it does not feel anything at all.”	This is the cessation of perception and feelings.
mn136:2.10	“Reverend Samiddhi, how long has it been since you went forth?”	NA
mn136:2.11	“Not long, reverend: three years.”	NA
mn136:2.12	“Well now, what are we to say to the senior mendicants, when even such a junior mendicant imagines their Teacher needs defending?	NA
mn136:2.13	After doing an intentional deed by way of body, speech, or mind, reverend, what does one feel?”	NA
mn136:2.14	“After doing an intentional deed by way of body, speech, or mind, reverend, one feels suffering.”	It is this answer of Samiddhi’s that is criticized below.
mn136:2.15	Then, neither approving nor dismissing Samiddhi’s statement, Potaliputta	NA
mn136:2.16	got up from his seat and left.	NA
mn136:3.1	Soon after he had left, Venerable Samiddhi went to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn136:3.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,	NA
mn136:3.3	and informed Ānanda of all they had discussed.	NA
mn136:3.4	When he had spoken, Ānanda said to him,	NA
mn136:3.5	“Reverend Samiddhi, we should see the Buddha about this matter.	NA
mn136:3.6	Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this.	NA
mn136:3.7	As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”	NA
mn136:3.8	“Yes, reverend,” Samiddhi replied.	NA
mn136:4.1	Then Ānanda and Samiddhi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,	NA
mn136:4.2	and told him what had happened.	NA
mn136:5.1	When they had spoken, the Buddha said to Ānanda,	NA
mn136:5.2	“I don’t recall even seeing the wanderer Potaliputta, Ānanda, so how could we have had such a discussion?	NA
mn136:5.3	The wanderer Potaliputta’s question should have been answered after analyzing it, but this futile man answered categorically.”	NA
mn136:6.1	When he said this, Venerable Udāyī said to him,	NA
mn136:6.2	“But perhaps, sir, Venerable Samiddhi spoke in reference to the statement:	NA
mn136:6.3	‘Suffering includes whatever is felt.’”	NA
mn136:6.4	But the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	NA
mn136:6.5	“See what this futile man Udāyī comes up with?	There are several monks named Udāyī and it is not easy to distinguish them. Of of then was known for his stupidity ([an6.29:3.3]()). | _Ummagga_ is from _ummujjati_, just below, “uprising, emergence”.
mn136:6.6	I knew that	NA
mn136:6.7	he was coming up with something irrational.	NA
mn136:6.8	Right from the start Potaliputta asked about the three feelings.	NA
mn136:6.9	Suppose the futile man Samiddhi had answered the wanderer Potaliputta’s question like this:	NA
mn136:6.10	‘After doing an intentional deed to be experienced as pleasant by way of body, speech, or mind, one feels pleasure.	NA
mn136:6.11	After doing an intentional deed to be experienced as painful by way of body, speech, or mind, one feels pain.	NA
mn136:6.12	After doing an intentional deed to be experienced as neutral by way of body, speech, or mind, one feels neutral.’	NA
mn136:6.13	Answering in this way, Samiddhi would have rightly answered Potaliputta.	NA
mn136:6.14	Still, who are those foolish and incompetent wanderers of other religions to understand the Realized One’s great analysis of deeds?	NA
mn136:6.15	If you would all listen, Ānanda, I will explain the Realized One’s great analysis of deeds.”	Text here reads _vibhajantassa_, which appears ungrammatical. This phrase is shared with [an6.62:5.8](), which is also a case where a junior monk has made a silly statement. There the Pali has _vibhajissāmi_ (“I will explain”). The commentary does not explicitly comment on this phrase, but it does say that the Buddha thought, “I will make it clear for the mendicant Saṅgha” (_bhikkhusaṅghassa pākaṭaṁ karissāmīti_), which implies that it was reading the future tense. Compare the use of future tense in the stock phrase, “Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak” ([mn138:2.2]()).
mn136:7.1	“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!	NA
mn136:7.2	Let the Buddha explain the great analysis of deeds. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	NA
mn136:7.3	“Well then, Ānanda, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn136:7.4	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
mn136:7.5	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn136:8.1	“Ānanda, these four people are found in the world.	NA
mn136:8.2	What four?	NA
mn136:8.3	It’s when a person here kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, and have wrong view.	NA
mn136:8.4	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	NA
mn136:8.5	But some other person here kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, and have wrong view.	NA
mn136:8.6	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	NA
mn136:8.7	But some other person here refrains from killing living creatures, stealing, committing sexual misconduct, or using speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re contented, kind-hearted, and have right view.	NA
mn136:8.8	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	NA

mn136:8.10	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	NA
mn136:9.1	Now, some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that it gives rise to clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman. With that clairvoyance they see that person	Meditation is described in the same way at [dn1:1.31.1](), which is also concerned with those who draw inaccurate inferences from deep meditation.
mn136:9.2	here who killed living creatures, stole, and committed sexual misconduct; who used speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and who was covetous, malicious, and had wrong view. And they see that, when their body breaks up, after death, that person is reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	NA
mn136:9.3	They say:	NA
mn136:9.4	‘It seems that there is such a thing as bad deeds, and the result of bad conduct.	The use of _kira_ (“seems”) conveys an appropriate degree of caution when framing a hypothesis. But as we shall see, the theorist does not maintain this.
mn136:9.5	For I saw a person here who killed living creatures … and had wrong view. And when their body broke up, after death, they were reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’	Having framed their hypothesis, the theorist presents their supporting observations.
mn136:9.6	They say:	NA
mn136:9.7	‘It seems that everyone who kills living creatures … and has wrong view is reborn in hell.	Now the theorist draws their inference, committing two logical fallacies. One is the fallacy of hasty generalization: the fact that *some people* who do bad deeds go to hell does not imply that *all people* who do bad deeds go to hell. The second is the post hoc fallacy: the fact that the bad deed *preceded* rebirth in hell does not imply that the bad deed *caused* rebirth in hell. The Buddha avoids the fallacy of hasty generalization by surveying a much larger, statistically significant scope, said to be ninety-one eons ([mn71:14.2]()). And he avoids the post hoc fallacy by flipping the causal arrow: if the *presence* of kamma leads to rebirth, then the *absence* of kamma should lead to the ending of rebirth. By practicing to realize the ending of kamma he confirmed this for himself.
mn136:9.8	Those whose notion is this have the right notion. Those whose notion is otherwise have a wrong notion.’	Leaving behind caution and going beyond observation, the theorist now asserts that the results of their reasoning are the truth. | Here words from the root _√ñā_ are used for both right and wrong ideas. Normally I translate _√ñā_ as “knowledge”, but in English one cannot “know” something false. One might *believe* that it is nighttime when it is in fact the day, but one cannot *know* this. Usually _√ñā_ does have the positive sense of “true knowledge”, but when dealing with errant theorizers we also find it used for “false knowledge”, in which case I use “notion” (eg. [snp4.13:17.2]()).
mn136:9.9	And so they obstinately stick to what they have known, seen, and understood for themselves, insisting that: ‘This is the only truth, anything else is futile.’	Contemplatives sometimes deprecate logic as inferior to meditative insight. By not exercising the critical skills to evaluate and improve their reasoning, they become especially prone to using poor logic. The brilliance of meditative experiences can be overwhelming and it is easy to be convinced of the truth of one’s inferences, without even recognizing them as inferences. sutta passages such as this show that the interpretation of meditative experiences must be tempered with clear logic.

mn136:11.9	And so they obstinately stick to what they have known, seen, and understood for themselves, insisting that: ‘This is the only truth, anything else is futile.’	NA
mn136:12.1	Take some ascetic or brahmin who with clairvoyance sees a person here who refrained from killing living creatures … and had right view. And they see that that person is reborn in hell.	NA

mn136:17.1	Now, Ānanda, take the case of the person here who killed living creatures … and had wrong view, and who, when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	NA
mn136:17.2	That bad deed of theirs that is to be experienced as painful was either done previously, or later, or else at the time of death they undertook wrong view.	The logic of this passage seems to be: “When a good result follows a bad deed, or bad follows good, then they must have done some other fitting deed at another time; and even if a bad result follows a bad deed, or good follows good, it is still possible that the result was caused by some other fitting deed.” But the phrasing of the Pali does not quite say this. I suspect that some nuance has been lost, perhaps due to over-zealous standardization. | For deathbed kamma see [mn97:38.7]() and note.
mn136:17.3	And that’s why, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	NA
mn136:17.4	But anyone here who kills living creatures … and has wrong view experiences the result of that in this very life, or in the next life, or in some subsequent period.	NA
mn136:18.1	Now, Ānanda, take the case of the person here who killed living creatures … and had wrong view, and who is reborn in a heavenly realm.	NA
mn136:18.2	That good deed of theirs that is to be experienced as pleasurable was either done previously, or later, or else at the time of death they undertook right view.	NA

mn137:0.2	The Analysis of the Six Sense Fields	NA
mn137:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn137:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn137:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn137:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn137:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn137:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn137:2.1	“Mendicants, I shall teach you the analysis of the six sense fields.	Here and at [mn139:2.1]() the Buddha only announces that he will teach the analysis, but proceeds to give the recitation passage as well. Contrast with [mn133:6.2]() and [mn138:4.2]().
mn137:2.2	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn137:2.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
mn137:2.4	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn137:3.1	“‘The six interior sense fields should be understood. The six exterior sense fields should be understood. The six classes of consciousness should be understood. The six classes of contact should be understood. The eighteen mental preoccupations should be understood. The thirty-six positions of sentient beings should be understood. Therein, relying on this, give up that. The Noble One cultivates the establishment of mindfulness in three cases, by virtue of which they are a Teacher worthy to instruct a group. Of all meditation tutors, it is he that is called the supreme guide for those who wish to train.’	NA
mn137:3.2	This is the summary recital for the analysis of the six sense fields.	NA
mn137:4.1	‘The six interior sense fields should be understood.’	NA
mn137:4.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
mn137:4.3	There are the sense fields of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.	NA
mn137:4.4	‘The six interior sense fields should be understood.’	NA
mn137:4.5	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA
mn137:5.1	‘The six exterior sense fields should be understood.’	NA
mn137:5.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
mn137:5.3	There are the sense fields of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and ideas.	NA
mn137:5.4	‘The six exterior sense fields should be understood.’	NA
mn137:5.5	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA
mn137:6.1	‘The six classes of consciousness should be understood.’	NA
mn137:6.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
mn137:6.3	There are eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind consciousness.	NA
mn137:6.4	‘The six classes of consciousness should be understood.’	NA
mn137:6.5	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA
mn137:7.1	‘The six classes of contact should be understood.’	NA
mn137:7.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
mn137:7.3	There is contact through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.	NA
mn137:7.4	‘The six classes of contact should be understood.’	NA
mn137:7.5	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA
mn137:8.1	‘The eighteen mental preoccupations should be understood.’	Also at [mn140:10.1]() and [an3.61:12.1](). Outside of this context, _upavicāra_ is only found in [an6.52](), where women are “preoccupied” with adornments and thieves are “preoccupied” with a hiding place.
mn137:8.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
mn137:8.3	Seeing a sight with the eye, one is preoccupied with a sight that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity.	NA
mn137:8.4	Hearing a sound with the ear …	NA
mn137:8.5	Smelling an odor with the nose …	NA
mn137:8.6	Tasting a flavor with the tongue …	NA
mn137:8.7	Feeling a touch with the body …	NA
mn137:8.8	Becoming conscious of an idea with the mind, one is preoccupied with an idea that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity.	NA
mn137:8.9	So there are six preoccupations with happiness, six preoccupations with sadness, and six preoccupations with equanimity. ‘The eighteen mental preoccupations should be understood.’	NA
mn137:8.10	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA
mn137:9.1	‘The thirty-six positions of sentient beings should be understood.’	NA
mn137:9.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
mn137:9.3	There are six kinds of domestic happiness and six kinds of renunciate happiness. There are six kinds of domestic sadness and six kinds of renunciate sadness. There are six kinds of domestic equanimity and six kinds of renunciate equanimity.	NA
mn137:10.1	And in this context what are the six kinds of domestic happiness?	NA
mn137:10.2	There are sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with the worldly pleasures of the flesh. Happiness arises when you regard it as a gain to obtain such sights, or when you recollect sights you formerly obtained that have passed, ceased, and perished.	NA
mn137:10.3	Such happiness is called domestic happiness.	NA
mn137:10.4	There are sounds known by the ear …	NA

mn137:10.10	These are the six kinds of domestic happiness.	NA
mn137:11.1	And in this context what are the six kinds of renunciate happiness?	NA
mn137:11.2	When you’ve understood the impermanence of sights—their perishing, fading away, and cessation—happiness arises as you truly understand through right understanding that both formerly and now all those sights are impermanent, suffering, and perishable.	NA

mn137:11.9	Such happiness is called renunciate happiness.	NA
mn137:11.10	These are the six kinds of renunciate happiness.	NA
mn137:12.1	And in this context what are the six kinds of domestic sadness?	NA
mn137:12.2	There are sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with the worldly pleasures of the flesh. Sadness arises when you regard it as a loss to lose such sights, or when you recollect sights you formerly lost that have passed, ceased, and perished.	NA
mn137:12.3	Such sadness is called domestic sadness.	NA
mn137:12.4	There are sounds known by the ear …	NA

mn137:12.6	There are tastes known by the tongue …	NA
mn137:12.7	There are touches known by the body …	NA
mn137:12.8	There are ideas known by the mind, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with the worldly pleasures of the flesh.

mn137:12.9	Such sadness is called domestic sadness.	NA
mn137:12.10	These are the six kinds of domestic sadness.	NA
mn137:13.1	And in this context what are the six kinds of renunciate sadness?	NA
mn137:13.2	When you’ve understood the impermanence of sights—their perishing, fading away, and cessation—you truly understand through right understanding that both formerly and now all those sights are impermanent, suffering, and perishable. Upon seeing this, you give rise to yearning for the supreme liberations:	NA
mn137:13.3	‘Oh, when will I enter and remain in the same dimension that the noble ones enter and remain in today?’ When you give rise to yearning for the supreme liberations like this, sadness arises because of the yearning.	Also at [mn44:28.6](). That “dimension” (_āyatana_) is Nibbana ([ud8.1:3.1](), [sn35.117:8.2]()).
mn137:13.4	Such sadness is called renunciate sadness.	NA

mn137:14.1	And in this context what are the six kinds of domestic equanimity?	NA
mn137:14.2	When seeing a sight with the eye, equanimity arises for the unlearned ordinary person—a foolish ordinary person who has not overcome their limitations and the results of deeds, and is blind to the drawbacks.	NA
mn137:14.3	Such equanimity does not transcend the sight.	NA
mn137:14.4	That’s why it’s called domestic equanimity.	NA
mn137:14.5	When hearing a sound with the ear …	NA
mn137:14.6	When smelling an odor with the nose …	NA
mn137:14.7	When tasting a flavor with the tongue …	NA

mn137:17.1	There is equanimity that is diversified, based on diversity, and equanimity that is unified, based on unity.	NA
mn137:18.1	And what is equanimity based on diversity?	NA
mn137:18.2	There is equanimity towards sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches.	NA
mn137:18.3	This is equanimity based on diversity.	NA
mn137:19.1	And what is equanimity based on unity?	NA
mn137:19.2	There is equanimity based on the dimensions of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, and neither perception nor non-perception.	NA

mn137:20.5	‘Therein, relying on this, give up that.’	NA
mn137:20.6	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA
mn137:21.1	‘The Noble One cultivates the establishment of mindfulness in three cases, by virtue of which they are a Teacher worthy to instruct a group.’	The text has a unique teaching of three _satipaṭṭhānas_ (“establishments of mindfulness”).
mn137:21.2	That’s what I said,	NA
mn137:21.3	but why did I say it?	NA
mn137:22.1	The first case is when the Teacher teaches Dhamma to his disciples out of kindness and sympathy:	NA
mn137:22.2	‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’	NA
mn137:22.3	But their disciples don’t want to listen. They don’t actively listen or try to understand. They proceed having turned away from the Teacher’s instruction.	NA
mn137:22.4	In this case the Realized One is not unhappy, he does not feel unhappiness. He remains unfestering, mindful and aware.	In the Pali manuscripts and commentary, the Burmese manuscripts appear to be alone in having the negative form _anattamana_ (“unhappy”). The Chinese parallel, however, supports the negative form (MA 163 at T i 693c29). | The commentarial derivation of _attamana_ as “self-mind” (= _sakamana_, “own-mind”) is unsatisfactory. Read with Sanskrit _āttamanas_ or _ādattamanas_ (“uplifted mind”, “smiling mind”).
mn137:22.5	This is the first case in which the Noble One cultivates the establishment of mindfulness.	NA
mn137:23.1	The next case is when the Teacher teaches Dhamma to his disciples out of kindness and sympathy:	NA
mn137:23.2	‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’	NA
mn137:23.3	And some of their disciples don’t want to listen. They don’t actively listen or try to understand. They proceed having turned away from the Teacher’s instruction.	NA
mn137:23.4	But some of their disciples do want to listen. They actively listen and try to understand. They don’t proceed having turned away from the Teacher’s instruction.	NA
mn137:23.5	In this case the Realized One is not unhappy,	NA
mn137:23.6	nor is he happy.	NA
mn137:23.7	NA	NA
mn137:23.8	Rejecting both unhappiness and happiness, he remains equanimous, mindful and aware.	NA
mn137:23.9	This is the second case in which the Noble One cultivates the establishment of mindfulness.	NA
mn137:24.1	The next case is when the Teacher teaches Dhamma to his disciples out of kindness and sympathy:	NA
mn137:24.2	‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’	NA
mn137:24.3	And their disciples want to listen. They actively listen and try to understand. They don’t proceed having turned away from the Teacher’s instruction.	NA
mn137:24.4	In this case the Realized One is happy, he does feel happiness. He remains unfestering, mindful and aware.	NA
mn137:24.5	This is the third case in which the Noble One cultivates the establishment of mindfulness.	NA
mn137:24.6	‘The Noble One cultivates the establishment of mindfulness in three cases, by virtue of which they are a Teacher worthy to instruct a group.’	NA
mn137:24.7	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA

mn137:25.3	Driven by an elephant trainer, an elephant in training proceeds in just one direction:	It seems that the text is punning _sārita_ (“driving”) with _sārathi_ (“charioteer”).

mn137:26.5	But driven by the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, a person in training proceeds in eight directions:	Here follow the eight liberations, which show the course of practice for realizing the highest form of “equanimity based on unity”.
mn137:27.1	Having physical form, they see forms.	NA
mn137:27.2	This is the first direction.	NA
mn137:27.3	Not perceiving physical form internally, they see forms externally.	NA
mn137:27.4	This is the second direction.	NA
mn137:27.5	They’re focused only on beauty.	NA
mn137:27.6	This is the third direction.	NA
mn137:27.7	Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space.	NA
mn137:27.8	This is the fourth direction.	NA
mn137:27.9	Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness.	NA
mn137:27.10	This is the fifth direction.	NA
mn137:27.11	Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness.	NA
mn137:27.12	This is the sixth direction.	NA
mn137:27.13	Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	NA
mn137:27.14	This is the seventh direction.	NA
mn137:27.15	Going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling.	NA
mn137:27.16	This is the eighth direction.	NA
mn137:27.17	Driven by the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, a person in training proceeds in these eight directions.	NA
mn137:28.1	‘Of all meditation tutors, it is he that is called the supreme guide for those who wish to train.’	NA
mn137:28.2	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.”	NA
mn137:28.3	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn137:28.4	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA

mn138:0.2	A Summary Recital and its Analysis	NA
mn138:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn138:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn138:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn138:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn138:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn138:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn138:2.1	“Mendicants, I shall teach you a summary recital and its analysis.	NA
mn138:2.2	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn138:2.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
mn138:2.4	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn138:3.1	“A mendicant should thoroughly examine such that for the examiner, if consciousness were not scattered and diffused externally, nor stuck internally, it would not be anxious because of grasping.	Also at [iti94:2.1](). | For _vikkhittaṁ visataṁ_, see [an5.51:3.4](), where a river is “dispersed and displaced”; [an4.246:3.4](), where a lion ensures that his limbs are not “disordered or displaced”;  [sn51.20:6.2](). At [sn51.20]() the four bases of psychic power are “scattered and diffused” due to sensual pleasures. | _Asaṇṭhita_ in the sense “not stuck” is also found in the phrase “not stuck in the formless” at [snp3.12:49.2]() = [iti51:3.2]() = [iti73:4.2](). See also [sn22.70:1.4](), and the phrase “when I stood still, I went under” at [sn1.1:1.7]().
mn138:3.2	When this is the case, there is no coming to be of the origin of suffering—of rebirth, old age, and death in the future.”	NA
mn138:4.1	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn138:4.2	When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.	See note at [mn133:6.2]().
mn138:5.1	Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants considered,	NA
mn138:5.2	“The Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail.	NA
mn138:5.3	NA	NA
mn138:5.4	NA	NA
mn138:5.5	Who can explain in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha?”	NA
mn138:5.6	Then those mendicants thought,	NA
mn138:5.7	“This Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.	See note at [mn18:10.9]().
mn138:5.8	He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha.	NA
mn138:5.9	Let’s go to him, and ask him about this matter.”	NA
mn138:6.1	Then those mendicants went to Mahākaccāna, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn138:6.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. They told him what had happened, and said,	NA
mn138:6.3	NA	NA

mn138:6.15	“May Venerable Mahākaccāna please explain this.”	NA
mn138:7.1	“Reverends, suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But he’d pass over the roots and trunk, imagining that the heartwood should be sought in the branches and leaves.	NA
mn138:7.2	Such is the consequence for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the Buddha, you overlooked him, imagining that you should ask me about this matter.	NA
mn138:7.3	For he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the manifestation of divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of freedom from death, the lord of truth, the Realized One.	NA
mn138:7.4	That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.	NA
mn138:7.5	You should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”	NA
mn138:8.1	“Certainly he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the manifestation of divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of freedom from death, the lord of truth, the Realized One.	NA
mn138:8.2	That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.	NA
mn138:8.3	We should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.	NA
mn138:8.4	Still, Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.	NA
mn138:8.5	He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha.	NA
mn138:8.6	Please explain this, if it’s no trouble.”	NA
mn138:9.1	“Well then, reverends, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn138:9.2	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.	NA
mn138:9.3	Venerable Mahākaccāna said this:	NA
mn138:9.4	“Reverends, the Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail:	NA
mn138:9.5	‘A mendicant should thoroughly examine such that for the examiner, if consciousness were not scattered and diffused externally, nor stuck internally, it would not be anxious because of grasping. When this is the case, there is no coming to be of the origin of suffering—of rebirth, old age, and death in the future.’	NA
mn138:9.6	This is how I understand the detailed meaning of this summary recital.	NA
mn138:10.1	How is consciousness said to be scattered and diffused externally?	NA
mn138:10.2	In this case, when a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, and consciousness follows after the features of that sight—tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in its features—consciousness is said to be scattered and diffused externally.	“Features” (_nimitta_) are the aspects of sense experience that provoke a response. Compare the standard passage on sense restraint (eg. [mn27:15.1]()), and [mn137:8.3](), where one is “preoccupied” with a sight giving rise to pleasure, etc.
mn138:10.3	When they hear a sound with their ears …	NA
mn138:10.4	When they smell an odor with their nose …	NA
mn138:10.5	When they taste a flavor with their tongue …	NA
mn138:10.6	When they feel a touch with their body …	NA
mn138:10.7	When they know an idea with their mind, and consciousness follows after the features of that idea—tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in its features—consciousness is said to be scattered and diffused externally.	NA
mn138:10.8	That’s how consciousness is said to be scattered and diffused externally.	NA
mn138:11.1	And how is consciousness said to be not scattered and diffused externally?	NA
mn138:11.2	In this case, when a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, but consciousness does not follow after the features of that sight—not tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in its features—consciousness is said to be not scattered and diffused externally.	NA
mn138:11.3	When they hear a sound with their ears …	NA
mn138:11.4	When they smell an odor with their nose …	NA
mn138:11.5	When they taste a flavor with their tongue …	NA
mn138:11.6	When they feel a touch with their body …	NA
mn138:11.7	When they know an idea with their mind, but consciousness does not follow after the features of that idea—not tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in its features—consciousness is said to be not scattered and diffused externally.	NA
mn138:11.8	That’s how consciousness is said to be not scattered and diffused externally.	NA
mn138:12.1	And how is it said to be stuck internally?	In the main summary, consciousness is the subject of each of the three clauses. When the clauses are separated out, the subject is left implicit.
mn138:12.2	Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn138:12.3	When consciousness follows after that rapture and bliss born of seclusion—tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in that rapture and bliss born of seclusion—the mind is said to be stuck internally.	_Samādhi_ is the outcome of letting go ([sn48.9:4.2]()). This passage reminds us that letting go also applies to _samādhi_ itself, so one should not be content to rest on one’s laurels. | Note that in this section, with its focus on states of absorption, Mahākaccāna shifts from “consciousness” (_viññāṇa_) to “mind” (_citta_).
mn138:13.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn138:13.2	When consciousness follows after that rapture and bliss born of immersion—tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in that rapture and bliss born of immersion—the mind is said to be stuck internally.	NA
mn138:14.1	Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA
mn138:14.2	When consciousness follows after that equanimity—tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in that bliss with equanimity—the mind is said to be stuck internally.	Text has “equanimity” in the first case, “bliss with equanimity” subsequently.
mn138:15.1	Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
mn138:15.2	When consciousness follows after that neutral feeling—tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in that neutral feeling—the mind is said to be stuck internally.	NA
mn138:15.3	That’s how it is said to be stuck internally.	NA
mn138:16.1	And how is it said to be not stuck internally?	NA
mn138:16.2	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
mn138:16.3	When consciousness does not follow after that rapture and bliss born of seclusion—not tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in that rapture and bliss born of seclusion—the mind is said to be not stuck internally.	The solution to being “stuck internally” is to continually deepen _samādhi_ by deepening letting go, not, as taught by some 20th century meditation teachers, to avoid it out of fear of becoming attached.
mn138:17.1	Furthermore, they enter the second absorption …	NA
mn138:17.2	When consciousness does not follow after that rapture and bliss born of immersion—not tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in that rapture and bliss born of immersion—the mind is said to be not stuck internally.	NA
mn138:18.1	Furthermore, they enter and remain in the third absorption …	NA
mn138:18.2	When consciousness does not follow after that equanimity—not tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in that bliss with equanimity—the mind is said to be not stuck internally.	NA
mn138:19.1	Furthermore, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption …	NA
mn138:19.2	When consciousness does not follow after that neutral feeling—not tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in that neutral feeling—the mind is said to be not stuck internally.	NA
mn138:19.3	That’s how it is said to be not stuck internally.	NA
mn138:20.1	And how is it anxious because of grasping?	All Pali editions read “anxious because of not grasping”. Implausible though it is, this is accepted by the commentary, which offers an explanation. The Saṁyuttanikāya, however, has several similar passages that consistently have the expected “anxious because of grasping” ([sn22.7](), [sn22.8](), [22.90:3.13]()). It seems the Majjhima preserves an ancient error and the Saṁyutta reading should be preferred.
mn138:20.2	It’s when an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.	NA
mn138:20.3	They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.	NA
mn138:20.4	But that form decays and perishes,	NA
mn138:20.5	and consciousness latches on to the perishing of form.	NA
mn138:20.6	Anxieties occupy the mind, born of latching on to the perishing of form, and originating in accordance with natural principles.	NA
mn138:20.7	So it becomes frightened, worried, concerned, and anxious because of grasping.	NA
mn138:20.8	They regard feeling …	NA
mn138:20.9	perception …	NA

mn138:21.2	It’s when a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen true persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true persons.	NA
mn138:21.3	They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.	NA
mn138:21.4	When that form decays and perishes,	NA
mn138:21.5	consciousness doesn’t latch on to the perishing of form.	NA

mn138:21.15	So it does not become frightened, worried, concerned, or anxious because of grasping.	NA
mn138:21.16	That’s how it is not anxious because of grasping.	NA
mn138:22.1	The Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail:	NA
mn138:22.2	‘A mendicant should thoroughly examine such that for the examiner, if consciousness were not scattered and diffused externally, nor stuck internally, it would not be anxious because of grasping.	NA
mn138:22.3	When this is the case, there is no coming to be of the origin of suffering—of rebirth, old age, and death in the future.’	NA

mn138:22.5	If you wish, you may go to the Buddha and ask him about this.	NA
mn138:22.6	You should remember it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”	NA
mn138:23.1	Then those mendicants, approving and agreeing with what Mahākaccāna said, rose from their seats and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding:	NA

mn139:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn139:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn139:2.1	“Mendicants, I shall teach you the analysis of no strife.	Rig Vedic _raṇa_ usually means “joy, delight” (eg. 8.96.16, 10.104.7) or occasionally “war, strife” (6.15.5, 10.112.10, 10.113.4). | See note on [mn137:2.1]().
mn139:2.2	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn139:2.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
mn139:2.4	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn139:3.1	“Don’t indulge in sensual pleasure, which is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And don’t indulge in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless.	This is adapted from the first sermon; text has _kāmasukhamanuyuñjeyya_ which is a briefer expression that the original _kāmesu kāmasukhallikānuyogo_ at [sn56.11:2.3]().
mn139:3.2	Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One understood the middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment.	NA

mn139:4.1	‘Don’t indulge in sensual pleasure, which is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And don’t indulge in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless.’	NA
mn139:4.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
mn139:4.3	Indulging in the happiness of the pleasure linked to sensuality is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. It is a principle beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the wrong way.	NA

mn139:11.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA

mn139:12.1	‘Don’t insist on popular terms and don’t overstep normal labels.’	NA
mn139:12.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
mn139:12.3	And how do you insist on popular terms and overstep normal labels?	None of the terms below are regional or dialectical, so _janapadanirutti_ means “expressions current among the people”, “popular terms”, “common vernacular” rather than “regional dialects”. | A Sanskrit fragment paralleling this passage lists various words for “person”, which likewise are not regional or dialectical terms (SHT ii 163aA3: _(jīvo) vā jantur-vā (poṣo) vā pudgalo vā manujo_).
mn139:12.4	It’s when among different populations they label the same thing as a ‘cup’, a ‘bowl’, a ‘jar’, a ‘scoop’, a ‘vessel’, a ‘dish’, or a ‘plate’.	All these terms are either attested in Pali and/or Sanskrit or are readily explicable from Pali roots. This is not about “translating” the Dhamma wholesale, but about using different popular terms, as in the U.S. they refer to the same thing as “soda” or “pop”. | _Pātī_ (“cup”) is from the root _√pā_, “to drink”, used in Pali for cups of bronze, gold, or silver. | _Patta_ (“bowl”), the masculine form of the same root, is the standard word for a mendicant’s alms bowl. | For _vittha_ (“jar”; variants _vitta_, _piṭṭha_) see _vitthaka_, a small jar for sewing gear ([pli-tv-kd15:11.5.15]()). | _Sarāva_ (“scoop”) is a common word for a scoop for water (eg. [an3.57:3.2](), [pli-tv-kd15:14.3.30](), [kv1.1:356.6](); Sanskrit _śarāva_, eg. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.1.4.12; Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.8.1; Manu 6.56; also in Jain texts). | For _dhāropa_ (“vessel”) accept variant _harosa_ by analogy with _puṭosa_ ([mn118:8.9]()), yielding the sense “carrier for food”, “vessel”. | _Poṇa_ (“dish”) is probably a concave dish with “sloped” sides (cp. English “hollowware”). | _Pisīlava_ (“plate”) was used for the butter placed on the altar (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.5.3.6: _piśīle vā pātryau vā_).
mn139:12.5	And however it is known among those various populations, you speak accordingly, obstinately sticking to that and insisting:	NA
mn139:12.6	‘This is the only truth, anything else is futile.’	NA
mn139:12.7	That’s how you insist on popular terms and overstep normal labels.	NA

mn139:12.9	It’s when among different populations they label the same thing as a ‘cup’, a ‘bowl’, a ‘jar’, a ‘scoop’, a ‘vessel’, a ‘dish’, or a ‘plate’.	NA

mn139:12.11	That’s how you don’t insist on popular terms and don’t overstep normal labels.	NA
mn139:12.12	‘Don’t insist on popular terms and don’t overstep normal labels.’	This passage should be read with [pli-tv-kd15:33.1.5](). There, the Pali depicts the Buddha allowing individual glosses to terms (_sakāya niruttiya_). However, this appears to be an old mistake, as  the consensus of Chinese Vinayas (Dharmaguptaka, Mahīśāsaka, Mūlasarvāstivāda, Vinayamātṛka) have the Buddha recommending _janapadanirutti_, bringing that passage in line with this one.

mn140:0.1	Middle Discourses 140	NA
mn140:0.2	The Analysis of the Elements	NA
mn140:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn140:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the Magadhan lands when he arrived at Rājagaha.	NA
mn140:1.3	He went to see Bhaggava the potter, and said,	The Bhaggava clan was descended from the ancient sage Bhagu (Sanskrit Bhṛgu). They received the gift of fire conveyed by Mātariśvan the wind from the god Agni (eg. Rig Veda 1.60.1). In Pali they appear as potters ([mn81:19.3](), [sn1.50:11.2](), [sn2.24:12.2]()), unless they have gone forth ([dn24:1.1.6]()). Archaeologists refer to the strata around the Buddha’s time as the Northern Black Polished Ware culture on account of the distinctive highly glazed polish that was achieved on the pottery of the time. This, together with the production of iron, marked a significant advance in the mastery of fire. Thus potters were no mere humble craftsmen, but leading technological innovators.
mn140:2.1	“Bhaggava, if it is no trouble, I’d like to spend a single night in your workshop.”	NA
mn140:2.2	“It’s no trouble, sir.	NA
mn140:2.3	But there’s a renunciate already staying there.	NA
mn140:2.4	If he allows it, sir, you may stay as long as you please.”	NA
mn140:3.1	Now at that time a gentleman named Pukkusāti had gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness in the Buddha’s name.	Buddhist texts of the middle period—starting a few centuries after the Buddha—share the story that Pukkusāti had been the king of Taxila in Gandhāra, who went forth out of faith upon reading texts of the Dhamma sent by his friend and ally, Bimbisāra. This story is found in detail in the Pali commentary to this sutta, and more briefly in several canonical texts of the northern traditions (T 211 at T iv 580c19; T 511 at T xiv 779a; Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya 3.2.26, which spells his name _puṣkarasāri_, the same name as the brahmin known in Pali as Pokkharasāti). Texts of this period also know of a script called _puṣkarasāri_ (Lalitavistara 10, Vaidya 87; Mahāvastu 14, Senart 1.135). This would presumably have been the writing system in the city of Puṣkarāvati, another city in Gandhāra, the region where the oldest surviving Buddhist manuscripts have been found. The details of the Pukkusāti legend are improbable and it is mostly likely an origin myth suggested by the similarity of his name with Puṣkarāvati, authorizing the establishment of the Dhamma in Gandhāra in the post-Ashokan period, as well as offering a precedent for the writing down of the Dhamma.
mn140:3.2	And it was he who had first taken up residence in the workshop.	NA
mn140:3.3	Then the Buddha approached Venerable Pukkusāti and said,	NA
mn140:3.4	“Mendicant, if it is no trouble, I’d like to spend a single night in the workshop.”	The Buddha addresses Pukkusāti as “mendicant” (_bhikkhu_), implicitly recognizing him as a Buddhist monk (compare [mn26:24.5]() = [mn85:48.5]()), while Pukkusāti uses the respectful familiar form “reverend” (_āvuso_).
mn140:3.5	“The potter’s workshop is spacious, reverend.	NA
mn140:3.6	Stay as long as you please.”	NA
mn140:4.1	Then the Buddha entered the workshop and spread out a grass mat to one side. He sat down cross-legged, set his body straight, and established mindfulness in his presence.	NA
mn140:4.2	He spent much of the night sitting in meditation,	NA
mn140:4.3	and so did Pukkusāti.	NA
mn140:4.4	Then it occurred to the Buddha,	NA
mn140:4.5	“This gentleman’s behavior is impressive.	He had been sitting most of the night in meditation, indicating that he had already mastered immersion to a substantial degree. The commentary says that he had in fact attained the fourth absorption based on mindfulness of breathing.
mn140:4.6	Why don’t I question him?”	NA
mn140:4.7	So the Buddha said to Pukkusāti,	NA
mn140:5.1	“In whose name have you gone forth, mendicant? Who is your Teacher? Whose teaching do you believe in?”	NA
mn140:5.2	“Reverend, there is the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family.	NA
mn140:5.3	He has this good reputation:	NA
mn140:5.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
mn140:5.5	I’ve gone forth in his name.	NA
mn140:5.6	That Blessed One is my Teacher,	NA
mn140:5.7	and I believe in his teaching.”	NA
mn140:5.8	“But mendicant, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”	NA
mn140:5.9	“In the northern lands there is a city called Sāvatthī.	Compare [an2.37:4.2](), where Sāvatthī is said to be in the east (probably from Madhurā).
mn140:5.10	There the Blessed One is now staying, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.”	NA
mn140:5.11	“But have you ever seen that Buddha?	NA
mn140:5.12	Would you recognize him if you saw him?”	NA
mn140:5.13	“No, I’ve never seen him,	NA
mn140:5.14	and I wouldn’t recognize him if I did.”	Despite his wisdom, Pukkusāti fails to recognize the Buddha. In other cases such failure is a narrative indication of spiritual blindness (Ajātasattu at [dn2:11.2]() and the park keeper at [mn31:3.4]() = [mn128:0.2]() = [pli-tv-kd10:4.2.3]()).
mn140:6.1	Then it occurred to the Buddha,	NA
mn140:6.2	“This gentleman has gone forth in my name.	NA
mn140:6.3	Why don’t I teach him the Dhamma?”	The Buddha leads by persuading with the Dhamma, rather than by revealing his identity.
mn140:6.4	So the Buddha said to Pukkusāti,	NA
mn140:6.5	“Mendicant, I shall teach you the Dhamma.	NA
mn140:6.6	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn140:6.7	“Yes, reverend,” replied Pukkusāti.	NA
mn140:6.8	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn140:7.1	“‘This person has six elements, six fields of contact, eighteen mental preoccupations, and four foundations.	The six elements, six fields of contact, eighteen mental preoccupations are taught at [an3.61:9.3]()ff., where they are followed by the four noble truths.
mn140:7.2	Where they stand, the streams of conceiving do not flow. And where the streams of conceiving do not flow, they are called a sage at peace.	NA
mn140:7.3	Do not neglect wisdom; preserve truth; foster generosity; and train only for peace.’	NA
mn140:7.4	This is the summary recital for the analysis of the elements.	NA
mn140:8.1	‘This person has six elements.’	NA
mn140:8.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
mn140:8.3	There are these six elements:	NA
mn140:8.4	the elements of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness.	First the Buddha establishes the fundamental scope of his teaching. The elements describe the world as it is, and on them the course of meditation is based. The extension of the four elements to six hints at the practice of formless attainments.
mn140:8.5	‘This person has six elements.’	NA
mn140:8.6	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA
mn140:9.1	‘This person has six fields of contact.’	NA
mn140:9.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
mn140:9.3	The fields of contact of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.	NA
mn140:9.4	‘This person has six fields of contact.’	NA
mn140:9.5	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA
mn140:10.1	‘This person has eighteen mental preoccupations.’	The “fields of contact” are the scope within which experience occurs, in response to which one becomes “preoccupied” due to the power of feeling. See note on [mn137:8.1]().
mn140:10.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
mn140:10.3	Seeing a sight with the eye, one is preoccupied with a sight that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity.	NA
mn140:10.4	Hearing a sound with the ear …	NA
mn140:10.5	Smelling an odor with the nose …	NA
mn140:10.6	Tasting a flavor with the tongue …	NA
mn140:10.7	Feeling a touch with the body …	NA
mn140:10.8	Becoming conscious of an idea with the mind, one is preoccupied with an idea that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity.	NA
mn140:10.9	So there are six preoccupations with happiness, six preoccupations with sadness, and six preoccupations with equanimity.	NA
mn140:10.10	‘This person has eighteen mental preoccupations.’	NA
mn140:10.11	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA
mn140:11.1	‘This person has four foundations.’	Thus far we have dealt with what is in the world (the elements), how we experience the world (contact), and how we react to that experience (preoccupation with feeling). Now the Buddha turns to the path; instead of uncritical reaction to feeling, we develop a reflective response.
mn140:11.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
mn140:11.3	The foundations of wisdom, truth, generosity, and peace.	“Foundation” is _adhiṭṭhāna_, one meaning of which is the “plinth” or “base” on which a building rests; the commentary glosses with _patiṭṭhā_. Also at [dn33:1.11.150]().
mn140:11.4	‘This person has four foundations.’	NA
mn140:11.5	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA
mn140:12.1	‘Do not neglect wisdom; preserve truth; foster generosity; and train only for peace.’	Here the Buddha echoes the pattern of his first discourse, where he first identified what the four noble truths are, then identified the duty or task to be undertaken in relation to each of them ([sn56.11](); see also [sn56.12](), [sn56.29]()).
mn140:12.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
mn140:13.1	And how does one not neglect wisdom?	Thus begins the longest section of the discourse, continuing up to [mn140:25.3]().
mn140:13.2	There are these six elements:	The Buddha returns to the six elements, for which we have already been prepared in brief. The discussion of the “elements” (_dhātu_) now continues in similar fashion to the five elements at [mn62:8.1](). [mn28:5.1]() teaches the four “principal states” (_mahābhūta_) in even more detail.
mn140:13.3	the elements of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness.	NA
mn140:14.1	And what is the earth element?	NA
mn140:14.2	The earth element may be interior or exterior.	NA

mn140:16.3	And what is the interior fire element?	NA
mn140:16.4	Anything internal, pertaining to an individual, that’s fire, fiery, and appropriated. This includes:	NA
mn140:16.5	that which warms, that which ages, that which heats you up when feverish, that which properly digests food and drink; or anything else internal, pertaining to an individual, that’s fire, fiery, and appropriated.	NA

mn140:18.9	When you truly see with right understanding, you grow disillusioned with the space element, detaching the mind from the space element.	From here, [mn62:12.9]() proceeds in a different direction, outlining a series of meditations based on the elements and other things.
mn140:19.1	What remains is sheer consciousness, pure and bright.	The phrase “sheer consciousness” (_viññāṇaṁyeva_) echoes Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12, where the ultimate manifestation of the Self, the “principle reality”, is said to be “a sheer mass of consciousness” (_vijñānaghana eva_). Here it refers to the mind following absorption that develops insight into feelings.
mn140:19.2	And what does that consciousness know?	NA
mn140:19.3	It cognizes ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ and ‘neutral’.	NA
mn140:19.4	Pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant.	Such as the pleasant feelings of the first three absorptions.
mn140:19.5	When they feel a pleasant feeling, they know: ‘I feel a pleasant feeling.’	NA
mn140:19.6	They know: ‘With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant, the corresponding pleasant feeling ceases and stops.’	NA
mn140:19.7	Painful feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as painful.	Such as the painful feelings that arise in the body after emergence from absorption.
mn140:19.8	When they feel a painful feeling, they know: ‘I feel a painful feeling.’	NA
mn140:19.9	They know: ‘With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as painful, the corresponding painful feeling ceases and stops.’	NA
mn140:19.10	Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutral.	Such as the neutral feeling of the fourth absorption.
mn140:19.11	When they feel a neutral feeling, they know: ‘I feel a neutral feeling.’	NA
mn140:19.12	They know: ‘With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neutral, the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stops.’	NA
mn140:19.13	When you rub two sticks together, heat is generated and fire is produced. But when you part the sticks and lay them aside, any corresponding heat ceases and stops.	Experience depends on the collision of disparate elements, whose friction or “resistance” (_paṭigha_, [dn15:20.4]()) sparks the light of consciousness. Hence consciousness, like fire, is beautiful but also burning ([sn35.235]()).
mn140:19.14	In the same way, pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant. …	NA

mn140:19.21	NA	NA
mn140:19.22	They know: ‘With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neutral, the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stops.’	NA
mn140:20.1	There remains only equanimity, pure, bright, pliable, workable, and radiant.	This is the purified equanimity of the fourth absorption. Although the teaching is framed in terms of the development of discernment (_vipassanā_), nonetheless it follows the pattern of the absorptions, leading through the first four “form” absorptions to the radiant consciousness that can experience the formless.
mn140:20.2	It’s like when a deft goldsmith or a goldsmith’s apprentice prepares a forge, fires the crucible, picks up some native gold with tongs and puts it in the crucible. From time to time they fan it, from time to time they sprinkle water on it, and from time to time they just watch over it. That native gold becomes pliable, workable, and radiant, not brittle, and is ready to be worked. Then the goldsmith can successfully create any kind of ornament they want, whether a bracelet, earrings, a necklace, or a golden garland.	This simile is developed further at [an3.102:2.1]().
mn140:20.3	In the same way, there remains only equanimity, pure, bright, pliable, workable, and radiant.	NA
mn140:21.1	They understand:	NA
mn140:21.2	‘If I were to apply this equanimity, so pure and bright, to the dimension of infinite space, and develop my mind accordingly,	NA
mn140:21.3	this equanimity of mine, relying on that and grasping it, would remain for a very long time.	The lifespans of rebirth in the first three formless realms is given in [an3.116](). For the gods of infinite space, it is twenty thousand eons.
mn140:21.4	If I were to apply this equanimity, so pure and bright, to the dimension of infinite consciousness, and develop my mind accordingly,	NA
mn140:21.5	this equanimity of mine, relying on that and grasping it, would remain for a very long time.	Forty thousand eons.
mn140:21.6	If I were to apply this equanimity, so pure and bright, to the dimension of nothingness, and develop my mind accordingly,	NA
mn140:21.7	this equanimity of mine, relying on that and grasping it, would remain for a very long time.	Sixty thousand eons.
mn140:21.8	If I were to apply this equanimity, so pure and bright, to the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, and develop my mind accordingly,	NA
mn140:21.9	this equanimity of mine, relying on that and grasping it, would remain for a very long time.’	NA
mn140:22.1	They understand:	NA
mn140:22.2	‘If I were to apply this equanimity, so pure and bright, to the dimension of infinite space, my mind would develop accordingly.	NA
mn140:22.3	But that is conditioned.	“Conditioned” is _saṅkhata_, the past participle whose active verbal form is translated below as “choice”. To be “conditioned”, is to be “created” by an act of will or “choice”.
mn140:22.4	If I were to apply this equanimity, so pure and bright, to the dimension of infinite consciousness …	NA
mn140:22.5	NA	NA
mn140:22.6	nothingness …	NA

mn140:22.8	neither perception nor non-perception, my mind would develop accordingly.	NA
mn140:22.9	But that is conditioned.’	NA
mn140:22.10	They neither make a choice nor form an intention to continue existence or to end existence.	For the idiom “make a choice nor form an intention”, compare [mn52:4.2]()ff. and [mn121:11.4](). | The craving to “end existence” (_vibhava_; see [snp4.10:9.3]()) is the urge to annihilation, for which see [mn102:12.7]().
mn140:22.11	Because of this, they don’t grasp at anything in the world.	NA
mn140:22.12	Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.	NA
mn140:22.13	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’	NA
mn140:23.1	If they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it.	This describes the reflective experience of the arahant.
mn140:23.2	If they feel a painful feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it.	NA
mn140:23.3	If they feel a neutral feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it.	NA
mn140:24.1	If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it detached.	NA
mn140:24.2	If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it detached.	NA
mn140:24.3	If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached.	NA
mn140:24.4	Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’	NA
mn140:24.5	They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here.’	To “become cool” is, as the simile makes clear, to realize extinguishment (_nibbāna_).
mn140:24.6	Suppose an oil lamp depended on oil and a wick to burn.	NA
mn140:24.7	As the oil and the wick are used up, it would be extinguished due to not being fed.	NA
mn140:24.8	In the same way, feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’	NA
mn140:24.9	They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here.’	NA
mn140:25.1	Therefore a mendicant thus endowed is endowed with the ultimate foundation of wisdom.	NA
mn140:25.2	For this is the ultimate noble wisdom, namely,	NA
mn140:25.3	the knowledge of the ending of all suffering.	Here ends the discussion of the first “foundation”, wisdom, which is perfected by an arahant. The remaining foundations, while each having a mundane meaning, are explained from this highest of perspectives.
mn140:26.1	Their freedom, being founded on truth, is unshakable.	NA
mn140:26.2	For that which is false has a deceptive nature, while that which is true has an undeceptive nature—extinguishment.	NA
mn140:26.3	Therefore a mendicant thus endowed is endowed with the ultimate foundation of truth.	NA
mn140:26.4	For this is the ultimate noble truth, namely,	NA
mn140:26.5	that which has an undeceptive nature—extinguishment.	NA
mn140:27.1	In their ignorance, they used to acquire attachments.	NA
mn140:27.2	Those have been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so they are unable to arise in the future.	NA
mn140:27.3	Therefore a mendicant thus endowed is endowed with the ultimate foundation of generosity.	NA
mn140:27.4	For this is the ultimate noble generosity, namely,	NA
mn140:27.5	letting go of all attachments.	NA
mn140:28.1	In their ignorance, they used to be covetous, full of desire and lust.	NA
mn140:28.2	That has been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so it’s unable to arise in the future.	NA
mn140:28.3	In their ignorance, they used to be contemptuous, full of ill will and malevolence.	NA
mn140:28.4	That has been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so it’s unable to arise in the future.	NA
mn140:28.5	In their ignorance, they used to be ignorant, full of delusion.	NA
mn140:28.6	That has been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so it’s unable to arise in the future.	NA
mn140:28.7	Therefore a mendicant thus endowed is endowed with the ultimate foundation of peace.	NA
mn140:28.8	For this is the ultimate noble peace, namely,	NA
mn140:28.9	the pacification of greed, hate, and delusion.	NA
mn140:29.1	‘Do not neglect wisdom; preserve truth; foster generosity; and train only for peace.’	NA
mn140:29.2	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	This concludes the discussion of the four foundations.
mn140:30.1	‘Where they stand, the streams of conceiving do not flow. And where the streams of conceiving do not flow, they are called a sage at peace.’	“Streams of conceiving” (_maññassavā_) is a unique image, allied to the notion that defilements may “stream on to” a person (_āsavā assaveyyuṁ_, [an4.195:2.2]()).
mn140:30.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	NA
mn140:31.1	These are all forms of conceiving: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’	NA
mn140:31.2	Conceiving is a disease, a boil, a dart.	NA
mn140:31.3	Having gone beyond all conceiving, one is called a sage at peace.	NA
mn140:31.4	The sage at peace is not reborn, does not grow old, and does not die. They are not shaken, and do not yearn.	NA
mn140:31.5	For they have nothing which would cause them to be reborn. Not being reborn, how could they grow old? Not growing old, how could they die? Not dying, how could they be shaken? Not shaking, for what could they yearn?	NA
mn140:32.1	‘Where they stand, the streams of conceiving do not flow. And where the streams of conceiving do not flow, they are called a sage at peace.’	NA
mn140:32.2	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	NA
mn140:32.3	Mendicant, you should remember this brief analysis of the six elements.”	The “brief analysis” here is the summary teaching around which the sutta is developed ([mn140:7.4]()).
mn140:33.1	Then Venerable Pukkusāti thought,	NA
mn140:33.2	“It seems the Teacher has come to me! The Holy One has come to me! The fully awakened Buddha has come to me!” He got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said,	NA
mn140:33.3	“I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to presume to address the Buddha as ‘reverend’.	NA
mn140:33.4	Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.”	NA
mn140:33.5	“Indeed, mendicant, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to act in that way.	NA
mn140:33.6	But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it.	NA
mn140:33.7	For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.”	NA
mn140:34.1	“Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”	NA
mn140:34.2	“But mendicant, do you have a full set of bowl and robes?”	This is one of the questions asked of an ordination candidate ([pli-tv-kd1:76.1.14]()). A mendicant is expected to have a bowl—made of metal or clay, not too big or too small—and three robes—the lower robe or sabong (_antaravāsaka_), the upper robe (_uttarasaṅga_), and the double-layered outer cloak (_saṅghāṭi_). In the suttas, the Buddha does not usually ask this question, so he must have observed that Pukkusāti, who had renounced of his own volition, lacked the proper requisites.
mn140:34.3	“No, sir, I do not.”	NA
mn140:34.4	“The Realized Ones do not ordain those without a full set of bowl and robes.”	NA
mn140:35.1	And then Venerable Pukkusāti approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	NA
mn140:35.2	But while he was wandering in search of a bowl and robes, a stray cow took his life.	Cows were normally regarded as gentle creatures ([snp2.7:27.1]()). They sometimes become violent, however, especially when protecting young calves, resulting in the tragic fates of Bāhiya ([ud1.10:10.2]()) and Suppabuddha ([ud5.3:7.2]()). Attacks by cows still occur today in India and wherever cows are raised.
mn140:36.1	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
mn140:36.2	“Sir, the gentleman named Pukkusāti, who was advised in brief by the Buddha, has passed away.	NA
mn140:36.3	Where has he been reborn in his next life?”	NA
mn140:36.4	“Mendicants, Pukkusāti was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings.	NA
mn140:36.5	With the ending of the five lower fetters, he’s been reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.”	Pukkusāti is one of a group of seven who attained arahantship in the Pure Abode of Aviha ([sn1.50:3.2](), [sn2.24:4.2]()).
mn140:36.6	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn140:36.7	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn141:0.1	Middle Discourses 141	NA
mn141:0.2	The Analysis of the Truths	NA
mn141:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn141:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana.	NA
mn141:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
mn141:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
mn141:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
mn141:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn141:2.1	“Near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world.	This is in reference to the Dhammacakkappavattanasutta, the so-called First Sermon ([sn56.11]()), for which the current discourse serves as a canonical commentary.
mn141:2.2	It is the teaching, advocating, establishing, clarifying, analyzing, and revealing of the four noble truths.	NA
mn141:2.3	What four?	NA
mn141:3.1	The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.	The four noble truths are sometimes said to be like a doctor who identifies the illness, discerns its cause, understands the recovery, and administers the cure until the patient is restored to health (SA 389 at T ii 105a25; SA-2 254 at T ii 462c10). This analogy is not found in the Pali canon.
mn141:4.1	Near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world.	NA
mn141:4.2	It is the teaching, advocating, establishing, clarifying, analyzing, and revealing of the four noble truths.	NA
mn141:5.1	Mendicants, you should cultivate friendship with Sāriputta and Moggallāna.	NA
mn141:5.2	You should associate with Sāriputta and Moggallāna.	NA
mn141:5.3	They’re astute, and they support their spiritual companions.	NA
mn141:5.4	Sāriputta is like one who gives birth,	To extol his leading students, the Buddha recalls his own upbringing, born of Māyā and raised by Mahāpajāpatī (who appears in the next discourse). Nonetheless, _janetā_ is a masculine noun and it would be misleading to translate it as “mother”. Both mother and father “give birth” (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.14; the creator is male at 1.4.4).
mn141:5.5	while Moggallāna is like one who raises the child.	_Āpādetā_ is a causative agent noun from _ā_ + _√pad_ in the sense “one who raises”. Again, both mother and father are “raisers” (_āpādakā_) of the child ([an4.63:2.6]()).
mn141:5.6	Sāriputta guides people to the fruit of stream-entry, Moggallāna to the highest goal.	NA
mn141:5.7	Sāriputta is able to explain, teach, assert, establish, clarify, analyze, and reveal the four noble truths in detail.”	NA
mn141:6.1	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn141:6.2	When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.	NA
mn141:7.1	Then soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Sāriputta said to the mendicants,	NA
mn141:7.2	“Reverends, mendicants!”	NA
mn141:7.3	“Reverend,” they replied.	NA
mn141:7.4	Sāriputta said this:	NA

mn141:9.1	The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.	NA
mn141:10.1	And what is the noble truth of suffering?	NA

mn142:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn142:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.	NA
mn142:2.1	Then Mahāpajāpati Gotamī approached the Buddha bringing a new pair of garments. She bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha,	Mahāpajāpati was the Buddha’s foster-mother, sister of his birth mother Māyā. She is honored in the tradition as the first nun, the founder of the bhikkhunī order ([an8.51:20.1]()). She was honored as the most senior of the nuns ([an1.235:1.1]()). Though mostly remembered as the Buddha’s mother, her own verses deconstruct her motherhood, relating how she has previously been a “mother, a son, a father, a brother, and a grandmother” but now has transcended all such states ([thig6.6:3.1]()).
mn142:2.2	“Sir, I have spun and woven this new pair of garments specially for the Buddha.	Mahāpajāpati offers on behalf of her son alone, whereas elsewhere offerings are said to be “specially for the Buddha and the mendicant Saṅgha” [an5.30:2.4](), [an6.42:2.4](), [an8.86:2.5]().
mn142:2.3	May the Buddha please accept this from me out of sympathy.”	NA
mn142:2.4	When she said this, the Buddha said to her,	NA
mn142:2.5	“Give it to the Saṅgha, Gotamī.	NA
mn142:2.6	When you give to the Saṅgha, both the Saṅgha and I will be honored.”	The Buddha gently tries to deflect Mahāpajāpati’s familial attachment.

mn142:5.1	Ānanda, there are these fourteen religious donations to individuals.	“Religious donation” (or “honorarium”, _dakkhiṇā_, Sanskrit _dakṣiṇā_) is a Vedic term for the payment owed a brahmin priest for performing ritual services. In the Rig Veda this gift was of cattle offered at the dawn service; it yields benefits as the cow yields milk, and as Dawn sheds her bounteous light. Later it was found that gold or other precious things served just as well. The _dakṣiṇā_ was said to absolve the sacrificer from the guilt of killing (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.2.3.4). This is an overriding concern of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, which emphasizes how the dead of the sacrifice—a slain animal or pressed soma—is “enlivened” through the _dakṣiṇā_ (2.2.2.2). In the Pali tradition, _dakkhiṇa_ is etymologically linked with a gift given by the “right” or “capable” hand. In [snp3.4](), a brahmin gives the rice-cake left over from a fire oblation as a _dakkhiṇā_.
mn142:5.2	What fourteen?	NA
mn142:5.3	One gives a gift to the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
mn142:5.4	This is the first religious donation to an individual.	NA
mn142:5.5	One gives a gift to an independent Buddha.	NA
mn142:5.6	This is the second religious donation to an individual.	NA
mn142:5.7	One gives a gift to a perfected one.	NA
mn142:5.8	This is the third religious donation to an individual.	NA
mn142:5.9	One gives a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of perfection.	NA
mn142:5.10	This is the fourth religious donation to an individual.	NA
mn142:5.11	One gives a gift to a non-returner.	NA
mn142:5.12	This is the fifth religious donation to an individual.	NA
mn142:5.13	One gives a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of non-return.	NA
mn142:5.14	This is the sixth religious donation to an individual.	NA
mn142:5.15	One gives a gift to a once-returner.	NA
mn142:5.16	This is the seventh religious donation to an individual.	NA
mn142:5.17	One gives a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of once-return.	NA
mn142:5.18	This is the eighth religious donation to an individual.	NA
mn142:5.19	One gives a gift to a stream-enterer.	NA
mn142:5.20	This is the ninth religious donation to an individual.	NA
mn142:5.21	One gives a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of stream-entry.	NA
mn142:5.22	This is the tenth religious donation to an individual.	NA
mn142:5.23	One gives a gift to an outsider who is free of desire for sensual pleasures.	NA
mn142:5.24	This is the eleventh religious donation to an individual.	NA
mn142:5.25	One gives a gift to an ordinary person who has good ethical conduct.	NA
mn142:5.26	This is the twelfth religious donation to an individual.	NA
mn142:5.27	One gives a gift to an ordinary person who has bad ethical conduct.	NA
mn142:5.28	This is the thirteenth religious donation to an individual.	NA
mn142:5.29	One gives a gift to an animal.	NA
mn142:5.30	This is the fourteenth religious donation to an individual.	Jamison and Brereton translate _dakṣiṇā_ as “priestly gift”, which is correct for the Rig Veda. But whereas the Vedic tradition means the _dakkhiṇā_ for brahmins alone, the Buddha redefines it to include all humans, including those of bad conduct, and even animals as well. All creatures are deserving of kindness, and such kindness is always a sacred act.
mn142:6.1	Now, Ānanda, gifts to the following persons may be expected to yield the following returns. To an animal, a hundred times. To an unethical ordinary person, a thousand. To an ethical ordinary person, a hundred thousand. To an outsider free of desire for sensual pleasures, 10,000,000,000. But a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of stream-entry may be expected to yield incalculable, immeasurable returns. How much more so a gift to a stream-enterer, someone practicing to realize the fruit of once-return, a once-returner, someone practicing to realize the fruit of non-return, a non-returner, someone practicing to realize the fruit of perfection, a perfected one, or an independent Buddha? How much more so a Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha?	The idea of such a multiplying scale is anticipated in Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.33, which speaks of the multiplying joy in human and divine realms.
mn142:7.1	But there are, Ānanda, seven religious donations bestowed on a Saṅgha.	NA
mn142:7.2	What seven?	NA
mn142:7.3	One gives a gift to the communities of both monks and nuns headed by the Buddha.	NA
mn142:7.4	This is the first religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha.	NA
mn142:7.5	One gives a gift to the communities of both monks and nuns after the Buddha has finally become quenched.	Following the passing of the Buddha, a complete dispensation has both _bhikkhus_ and _bhikkhunīs_.
mn142:7.6	This is the second religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha.	NA
mn142:7.7	One gives a gift to the Saṅgha of monks.	NA
mn142:7.8	This is the third religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha.	NA
mn142:7.9	One gives a gift to the Saṅgha of nuns.	If Mahāpajāpati was still a lay person at this point, this mention of the _bhikkhunī_ order could be read in one of two ways. One possibility is that she was not, in fact, the first _bhikkhunī_, an argument that I have made previously. In brief, the passages that assert she was the first _bhikkhunī_, while widely shared in the tradition, are full of textual problems that indicate they were added at a somewhat late date, which I think was around the time of the Second Council (see [an8.51]()). Further,  the Therīgāthā is the most important early account of _bhikkhunīs_ in their own voices, yet no nun mentions Mahāpajāpati as teacher or founder of the order, while the verses of Bhaddā Kuṇḍalakesā appear to predate the formal ordination procedure ascribed to Mahāpajāpati ([thig5.9]()). On the other hand, if this argument is incorrect, it might be the case that the order of nuns is mentioned here since the Buddha knew from the start of his dispensation that he would establish it ([dn16:3.8.4]()). Under this reading, the Buddha is perhaps dropping a hint for Mahāpajāpati to ordain. Regardless of her ordination status at this point, the praise of the order of nuns acts as an encouragement, balancing out the mild rebuke with which the discourse started (compare the Buddha’s words to Ānanda at [dn16:5.14.2]()).
mn142:7.10	This is the fourth religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha.	NA
mn142:7.11	One gives a gift, thinking: ‘Appoint this many monks and nuns for me from the Saṅgha.’	NA
mn142:7.12	This is the fifth religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha.	NA
mn142:7.13	One gives a gift, thinking: ‘Appoint this many monks for me from the Saṅgha.’	NA
mn142:7.14	This is the sixth religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha.	NA
mn142:7.15	One gives a gift, thinking: ‘Appoint this many nuns for me from the Saṅgha.’	NA
mn142:7.16	This is the seventh religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha.	NA
mn142:8.1	In times to come there will be lambs of the flock wearing a scrap of ocher cloth, unethical and of bad character.	In early Pali, _gotrabhū_ is always used for the very least of those who are worthy of gifts ([an9.10:1.3](), [an10.16:1.3]()). It has a positive sense, this negative use being quite isolated. Later Buddhist traditions take _gotrabhū_ as “one who is joining the clan”, the first entry on the path to awakening, but I doubt this is what it means in early texts. The Buddha recognized clan as a convention ([mn98:12.1]()), but it was abandoned by those gone forth ([an8.19:14.2]()), and he considered questions as to his own clan inappropriate ([snp3.4:4.3]()) as it has nothing to do with purification ([sn2.20:3.4]()). Further, “clan” is always spelled _gotta_ in Pali. The older Vedic  spelling _gotra_ points to the Vedic meaning of _gotra_ as “cow-pen”, a safe place to gather the herd of cattle, and by extension a name for the herd itself. And while the Saṅgha is never called a “clan” it is compared to a herd of cattle; [mn34]() develops an extended simile where the different kinds of cattle in the herd are compared with different members of the Saṅgha. Now, in that discourse the last to cross over are the “followers of teachings, followers by faith”. Like a newborn calf, they can only cross the ford with the assistance of their mother ([mn34:10.1]()); in [an10.16:1.3]() the _gotrabhū_ follows even them. If we are on the right track, the suffix _-bhū_ may be derived from _bhūna_ (Sanskrit _bhrūṇa_) in the sense “baby”, or perhaps “embryo” ([mn75:5.3]()). In English we use “flock” for a religious group under the protection of a leader, so we can render _gotrabhū_ as “babies of the flock” or “lambs of the flock”. | For _kāsāvakaṇṭha_ as “scrap of ochre cloth”, see note on [iti48:4.1]().
mn142:8.2	People will give gifts to those unethical people in the name of the Saṅgha.	NA
mn142:8.3	Even then, I say, a religious donation bestowed on the Saṅgha is incalculable and immeasurable.	This rests uneasily with the statement below that a donation is purified by the recipient. This statement is not found in most parallels, so it is perhaps a later addition. But as it stands one argument might be that, since these offerings are made to the community as a whole, the merit that accrues from the community is not despoiled by the fact that the specific recipients are of bad character.
mn142:8.4	But I say that there is no way a personal offering can be more fruitful than one bestowed on a Saṅgha.	NA
mn142:9.1	Ānanda, there are these four ways of purifying a religious donation.	This passage is at [an4.78]() and included at [dn33:1.11.185]().

mn143:0.2	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika	NA
mn143:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn143:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn143:2.1	Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was sick, suffering, gravely ill.	Renowned as the foremost of benefactors, Anāthapiṇḍika appears in over twenty discourses in the Saṁyutta and Aṅguttara Nikāyas, discussing matters such as generosity, guarding the mind, and the development of meditation; the story of his conversion is recorded in the Vinaya ([pli-tv-kd16:4.1.1]()). He is well known for his offering of the monastery at which the Buddha most often stayed, but this discourse marks his only personal appearance in the Majjhima.
mn143:2.2	Then he addressed a man,	NA
mn143:2.3	“Please, worthy man, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:	NA
mn143:2.4	‘Sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is sick, suffering, gravely ill.	NA
mn143:2.5	He bows with his head to your feet.’	NA
mn143:2.6	Then go to Venerable Sāriputta, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:	NA
mn143:2.7	‘Sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is sick, suffering, gravely ill.	NA
mn143:2.8	He bows with his head to your feet.’	NA
mn143:2.9	And then say:	NA
mn143:2.10	‘Sir, please visit him at his home out of sympathy.’”	NA
mn143:2.11	“Yes, sir,” that man replied. He did as Anāthapiṇḍika asked.	NA
mn143:2.12	NA	NA
mn143:2.13	NA	NA
mn143:2.14	NA	NA
mn143:2.15	NA	NA
mn143:2.16	NA	NA
mn143:2.17	NA	NA
mn143:2.18	NA	NA
mn143:2.19	Sāriputta consented with silence.	NA
mn143:3.1	Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went with Venerable Ānanda as his second monk to Anāthapiṇḍika’s home. He sat down on the seat spread out, and said to Anāthapiṇḍika,	NA
mn143:3.2	“I hope you’re keeping well, householder; I hope you’re all right. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”	The sick Anāthapiṇḍika was consoled by Ānanda at [sn55.27:3.2]() and by Sāriputta at [sn55.26:4.2](). in other cases, we find the Buddha making such visits to sick monks ([sn22.87:2.7](), [sn22.88:2.8](), [sn46.14:2.1](), [sn46.15:2.1](), [an6.56:2.1]()), but for some reason visits to householders are only attested for Sāriputta ([mn97:28.2]()) or Ānanda ([sn47.29:2.2]()).
mn143:4.1	“I’m not keeping well, Honorable Sāriputta, I’m not getting by. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading, its growing, not its fading, is evident.	NA
mn143:4.2	The winds piercing my head are so severe, it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp point.	NA
mn143:4.3	NA	NA
mn143:4.4	The pain in my head is so severe, it feels like a strong man tightening a tough leather strap around my head.	NA
mn143:4.5	NA	NA
mn143:4.6	The winds slicing my belly are so severe, like a deft butcher or their apprentice were slicing open a cows’s belly with a sharp meat cleaver.	NA
mn143:4.7	NA	NA
mn143:4.8	The burning in my body is so severe, it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals. That’s how severe the burning is in my body.	NA
mn143:4.9	I’m not keeping well, Honorable Sāriputta, I’m not getting by. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading, its growing, not its fading, is evident.”	NA
mn143:5.1	“That’s why, householder, you should train like this:	NA
mn143:5.2	‘I shall not grasp the eye, and there shall be no consciousness of mine dependent on the eye.’	The teaching on the six senses typically begins by establishing awareness on the reality of the eye (etc.) as something that is grasped at (eg. [mn145:3.1]()). Here Sāriputta skips over this straight to letting go, signfying that his teaching starts with an advanced level of insight.
mn143:5.3	That’s how you should train.	NA

mn143:12.8	That’s how you should train.	NA
mn143:13.1	You should train like this:	NA

mn143:13.3	That’s how you should train.	NA
mn143:14.1	You should train like this:	NA
mn143:14.2	‘I shall not grasp the other world, and there shall be no consciousness of mine dependent on the other world.’	NA
mn143:14.3	That’s how you should train.	NA
mn143:14.4	You should train like this:	NA
mn143:14.5	‘I shall not grasp whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, and explored by my mind, and my consciousness will not have that as support.’	NA
mn143:14.6	That’s how you should train.”	NA
mn143:15.1	When he said this, Anāthapiṇḍika cried and burst out in tears.	NA
mn143:15.2	Venerable Ānanda said to him,	NA
mn143:15.3	“Are you failing, householder? Are you fading, householder?”	NA
mn143:15.4	“No, Honorable Ānanda.	NA
mn143:15.5	But for a long time I have paid homage to the Buddha and the esteemed mendicants.	NA
mn143:15.6	Yet I have never before heard such a Dhamma talk.”	NA
mn143:15.7	“Householder, such Dhamma talk does not strike when teaching white-clothed laypeople.	The verb here is _paṭibhāti_, the spontaneous striking of inspiration. Sāriputta is not saying such talks are never given, but that such topics are not what comes to mind when teaching laypeople.
mn143:15.8	Rather, it strikes when teaching those gone forth.”	NA
mn143:15.9	“Well then, Honorable Sāriputta, let such Dhamma talk strike when teaching white-clothed laypeople as well!	NA
mn143:15.10	There are gentlemen with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching.	NA
mn143:15.11	There will be those who understand the teaching!”	NA
mn143:16.1	And when the venerables Sāriputta and Ānanda had given the householder Anāthapiṇḍika this advice they got up from their seat and left.	NA
mn143:16.2	Not long after they had left, Anāthapiṇḍika passed away and was reborn in the host of joyful gods.	NA
mn143:17.1	Then, late at night, the glorious godling Anāthapiṇḍika, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side,	NA
mn143:17.2	and addressed the Buddha in verse:	NA
mn143:17.3	“This is indeed that Jeta’s Grove,	NA
mn143:17.4	frequented by the Saṅgha of seers,	NA
mn143:17.5	where the King of Dhamma stayed:	NA
mn143:17.6	it brings me joy!	NA
mn143:17.7	Deeds, knowledge, and principle;	NA
mn143:17.8	ethical conduct, an excellent livelihood;	NA
mn143:17.9	by these are mortals purified,	NA
mn143:17.10	not by clan or wealth.	NA
mn143:17.11	That’s why an astute person,	NA
mn143:17.12	seeing what’s good for themselves,	NA
mn143:17.13	would examine the teaching rationally,	NA
mn143:17.14	and thus be purified in it.	NA
mn143:17.15	Sāriputta is full of wisdom,	NA
mn143:17.16	ethics, and peace.	NA
mn143:17.17	Even a mendicant who has crossed over	NA
mn143:17.18	might at best equal him.”	NA
mn143:18.1	This is what the godling Anāthapiṇḍika said,	NA
mn143:18.2	and the teacher approved.	NA
mn143:18.3	Then the godling Anāthapiṇḍika,	NA
mn143:18.4	knowing that the teacher approved, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.	NA
mn143:19.1	Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened.	NA

mn143:20.1	When he had spoken, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha:	NA
mn143:20.2	“Sir, that godling must surely have been Anāthapiṇḍika.	NA
mn143:20.3	For the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was devoted to Venerable Sāriputta.”	NA
mn143:20.4	“Good, good, Ānanda.	NA
mn143:20.5	You’ve reached the logical conclusion, as far as logic goes.	NA
mn143:20.6	For that was indeed the godling Anāthapiṇḍika.”	NA
mn143:20.7	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn143:20.8	Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn144:0.1	Middle Discourses 144	NA
mn144:0.2	Advice to Channa	NA
mn144:1.1	So I have heard.	This discourse recurs at [sn35.87](). In the Saṁyutta Nikāya, as here in the Majjhima, it is immediately followed by the Puṇṇovādasutta ([mn145](), [sn35.88]()).
mn144:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
mn144:2.1	Now at that time the venerables Sāriputta, Mahācunda, and Channa were staying on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.	For Mahācunda, see note on [mn8:2.1](). | This Channa only appears only in this discourse. He is evidently not the same person as the Budddha’s former charioteer who was famously admonished on the Buddha’s deathbed ([dn16:6.4.1]()).
mn144:3.1	Now at that time Venerable Channa was sick, suffering, gravely ill.	NA
mn144:3.2	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Mahācunda and said to him,	NA
mn144:3.3	“Come, Reverend Cunda, let’s go to see Venerable Channa and ask about his illness.”	NA
mn144:3.4	“Yes, reverend,” replied Mahācunda.	NA
mn144:4.1	And then Sāriputta and Mahācunda went to see Channa and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
mn144:4.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. Then Sāriputta said to Channa,	NA
mn144:4.3	“I hope you’re keeping well, Reverend Channa; I hope you’re all right. I hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”	NA
mn144:5.1	“Reverend Sāriputta, I’m not keeping well, I’m not getting by. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.	NA

mn144:7.3	or a capable carer.	NA
mn144:7.4	Moreover, for a long time now I have served the Teacher with love, not without love.	NA

mn144:10.11	NA	NA
mn144:10.12	NA	NA
mn144:11.1	When he said this, Venerable Mahācunda said to Venerable Channa:	NA
mn144:11.2	“So, Reverend Channa, you should regularly apply your mind to this instruction of the Buddha:	Mahācunda is about to quote a phrase that appears at [ud8.4]().
mn144:11.3	‘For the dependent there is agitation. For the independent there’s no agitation.	The “dependent” is the world of conditions. The “independent” is Nibbana. | “Agitation” is _calita_, otherwise “shaking, trembling”.
mn144:11.4	When there’s no agitation there is tranquility.	NA
mn144:11.5	When there is tranquility there’s no inclination.	“Inclination” is _nati_, from a root meaning “to bend”. Sometimes used in the sense of a “inclination of mind” ([mn19:6.1]()), here, as the following lines make clear, it refers to the mind inclining to rebirth; explained by the commentary as “craving”. Compare the English idiom, “one is bent on destruction”.
mn144:11.6	When there’s no inclination there’s no coming and going.	NA
mn144:11.7	When there’s no coming and going there’s no passing away and reappearing.	NA
mn144:11.8	When there’s no passing away and reappearing there’s no this world or world beyond or between the two.	Vedic cosmology speaks of a tripartite world: the earth, the heavens, and the “midspace” (_antarikṣa_), namely the atmosphere. The gods journey through the midspace to earth for the sacrifice, bringing bounty for mortals (eg. Rig Veda 7.45). Later, the process of rebirth was conceived of as a path of cosmological ascent returning to the world of the gods or the fathers (eg. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.10.1). For the suttas, rebirth is likewise seen as a process of moving between states, like a person leaving a house, walking down the street, and entering another house ([dn2:96.1]()).
mn144:11.9	Just this is the end of suffering.’”	NA
mn144:11.10	And when the venerables Sāriputta and Mahācunda had given Venerable Channa this advice they got up from their seat and left.	NA
mn144:12.1	Not long after those venerables had left, Venerable Channa committed suicide.	NA
mn144:13.1	Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
mn144:13.2	“Sir, Venerable Channa has committed suicide.	NA
mn144:13.3	Where has he been reborn in his next life?”	NA
mn144:13.4	“Sāriputta, didn’t the mendicant Channa declare his blamelessness to you personally?”	NA
mn144:13.5	“Sir, there is a Vajjian village named Pubbajira.	There are several variant spellings of this name, which does not seem to appear elsewhere.
mn144:13.6	There Channa had families who were friendly, intimate, and hospitable.”	The text plays with homonyms of _upavajja_ as “blameworthy” (Sanskrit _upavadya_) and as “hospitable” (commentary: _upasaṅkamitabba_, Sanskrit _upavrajya_).
mn144:13.7	“The mendicant Channa did indeed have such families.	NA
mn144:13.8	But this is not enough for me to call someone ‘blameworthy’.	NA
mn144:13.9	When someone lays down this body and takes up another body, I call them ‘blameworthy’.	NA
mn144:13.10	But the mendicant Channa did no such thing.	The Buddha confirms that Channa was an arahant.
mn144:13.11	You should remember this: ‘The mendicant Channa committed suicide blamelessly.’”	Suicide generally is condemned in Buddhism as the taking of a human life. But from this and similar incidents ([sn4.23](), [sn22.87]()) it is widely accepted that suicide in the final throes of a terminal illness is allowable for arahants, as they are incapable of committing a blameworthy act. The suttas, however, can also be read to support the reverse reading: the reason it is allowable for arahants is because it is not blameworthy. The underlying logic would be that ending life is normally bad because life is valuable, but at such a point life no longer has any value. Obviously this is a complex issue that cannot be resolved by a few short scriptural passages, but a Buddhist would be motivated by compassion and understanding for those going through such terrible suffering.
mn144:13.12	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn144:13.13	Satisfied, Venerable Sāriputta approved what the Buddha said.	NA

mn145:1.1	So I have heard.	This sutta recurs at [sn35.88](), with slight differences in the opening and closing. In addition to two discourse parallels in Chinese, the popularity of this narrative is attested by its appearance in later texts such as the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya and the Divyāvadāna, as well as in artworks (see Anālayo, *Comparative Study*, vol. ii, p. 828).
mn145:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn145:1.3	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Puṇṇa came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha,	This Puṇṇa is to be distinguished from the Koliyan ascetic of [mn57]() and the son of Mantāṇī of [mn23](). His only other appearance is his Theragāthā verse at [thag1.70]().

mn145:5.1	Puṇṇa, now that I’ve given you this brief advice, what country will you live in?”	NA
mn145:5.2	“Sir, there’s a country named Sunāparanta. I shall live there.”	The commentary says that Puṇṇa was in fact born in Sunāparanta, specifically the trading port of Suppāraka, which is modern Nallasopara north of Mumbai on India’s west coast. Sunāparanta is otherwise known as Aparanta (“Far West”, [bv29:17.2]()). Puṇṇa’s choice was far-sighted, as from the time of Ashoka, Suppāraka became a major trading center with ports in India and lands west as far as Mesopotamia, Egypt, Eastern Africa, and Rome. A fabulous tale of such trading voyages is told in [ja463]().

mn145:5.32	‘There are disciples of the Buddha who looked for a suicide weapon because they were horrified, repelled, and disgusted with the body and with life. And I have found this without looking!’	This is in reference to the notorious story of Migalaṇḍika in [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3](), told more briefly in [sn54.9](). Several monks, meditating improperly on the unattractiveness of the body, sought suicide as the way out. In response, the Buddha taught mindfulness of breathing, which is “peaceful and sublime, a deliciously pleasant meditation”. | The idiomatic phrase _satthahāraka_ is difficult. The obvious reading is to take _sattha_ as “knife”, the meaning it has in the preceding sentence. However, that yields the sense “knife-bringer”, “assassin”, whereas the use of _idaṁ_ in [mn145:5.32]() shows it must be neuter, i.e. it is a thing not a person. Richard Gombrich suggests we read _sattha_ here as equivalent to Sanskrit _śvasita_, “breathing, life” (see Brahmali’s note on [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.49.1]()), yielding the sense “life-taker”, “breath-stealer”, “deadly weapon”. This agrees with the Vinaya commentary, which explains, “What does it take? Life.” (_Kiṃ harati? Jīvitaṁ_). Since this idiom is only used in the context of suicide, I call it “suicide weapon”, and the verbal form “commit suicide”.
mn145:5.33	That’s what I’ll think, Blessed One.	NA
mn145:5.34	That’s what I’ll think, Holy One.”	NA
mn145:6.1	“Good, good Puṇṇa!	NA
mn145:6.2	Having such self-control and peacefulness, you will be quite capable of living in Sunāparanta.	NA
mn145:6.3	Now, Puṇṇa, go at your convenience.”	NA
mn145:7.1	And then Puṇṇa welcomed and agreed with the Buddha’s words. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Sunāparanta.	NA
mn145:7.2	Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sunāparanta,	NA
mn145:7.3	and stayed there.	NA
mn145:7.4	Within that rainy season he confirmed around five hundred male and five hundred female lay followers. And within that same rainy season he realized the three knowledges.	NA
mn145:7.5	Some time later he became fully extinguished.	The parallel passage at [sn35.88:18.7](), says rather that he passed away in that same rainy season.
mn145:8.1	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
mn145:8.2	“Sir, the gentleman named Puṇṇa, who was advised in brief by the Buddha, has passed away.	NA
mn145:8.3	Where has he been reborn in his next life?”	NA
mn145:8.4	“Mendicants, Puṇṇa was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings.	NA
mn145:8.5	Puṇṇa has become fully quenched.”	NA
mn145:8.6	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn145:8.7	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn146:0.1	Middle Discourses 146	NA
mn146:0.2	Advice from Nandaka	NA
mn146:1.1	So I have heard.	This discourse deals with the fortnightly teaching of the nuns, a practice ostensibly set up at Mahāpajāpati’s ordination ([an8.51:13.1](), [pli-tv-kd20:1.4.7]()) and mandated in the Vinaya ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21](), [pli-tv-bi-vb-pc59]()). This is the only mention of such a teaching in the discourses. However it does not follow the pattern laid out in the Vinaya, where the teaching consists of the eight _garudhammas_ ([pli-tv-bi-vb-pc58]()), and the monks cannot go to the nuns’ monastery to advise them ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23]()).
mn146:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn146:2.1	Then Mahāpajāpati Gotamī together with around five hundred nuns approached the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	Here we see Mahāpajāpati in the leadership role that would be expected were she the founder of the nuns. However, this is the only case where this occurs.
mn146:2.2	“Sir, may the Buddha please advise	NA
mn146:2.3	and instruct the nuns.	NA
mn146:2.4	Please give the nuns a Dhamma talk.”	NA
mn146:3.1	Now at that time the senior monks were taking turns to advise the nuns.	Monks must be appointed by the Saṅgha to take on this role, and they must fulfill eight factors: they must be virtuous and learned, have memorized both Monastic Codes, be well-spoken, liked by the nuns, and capable, never having committed a heavy offense against a nun; and they must have been ordained at least twenty years ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21]()).
mn146:3.2	But Venerable Nandaka didn’t want to take his turn.	Nandaka was praised for his teaching of monks ([an9.4]()). At [an3.66]() he taught the layman Sāḷha how to discern the true teaching, using the method of questioning as he does in the present discourse. On the strength of this teaching, Nandaka was declared the foremost in advising nuns ([an1.229:1.1]()). His four Theragāthā verses are at [thag4.4]() according to the commentary. A second Nandaka at [thag2.27]() was the brother of Bharata ([thag2.28]()). | While the text does not explain why he was reluctant to teach, the commentary says that those nuns were his wives in past lives and he wanted to avoid the potential for gossip.
mn146:3.3	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	NA
mn146:3.4	“Ānanda, whose turn is it to advise the nuns today?”	NA
mn146:3.5	“It’s Nandaka’s turn, sir,	NA
mn146:3.6	but he doesn’t want to do it.”	NA
mn146:4.1	Then the Buddha said to Nandaka,	NA
mn146:4.2	“Nandaka, please advise	NA
mn146:4.3	and instruct the nuns.	NA
mn146:4.4	Please, brahmin, give the nuns a Dhamma talk.”	NA
mn146:4.5	“Yes, sir,” replied Nandaka. Then, in the morning, he robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	NA
mn146:4.6	He wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Royal Monastery with a companion.	The Royal Monastery (_rājakārāma_) was a residence for nuns near Sāvatthī, also featured in [sn55.11]().
mn146:4.7	Those nuns saw him coming off in the distance,	NA
mn146:4.8	so they spread out a seat and placed water for washing the feet.	NA
mn146:4.9	Nandaka sat down on the seat spread out,	NA
mn146:4.10	and washed his feet.	NA
mn146:4.11	Those nuns bowed, and sat down to one side.	NA
mn146:4.12	Nandaka said to them,	NA
mn146:5.1	“Sisters, this talk shall be in the form of questions.	NA
mn146:5.2	When you understand, say so. When you don’t understand, say so.	NA
mn146:5.3	If anyone has a doubt or uncertainty, ask me about it:	NA
mn146:5.4	‘Why, sir, does it say this? What does that mean?’”	Nandaka does not lecture the nuns, but engages with them. He makes it clear that, against patriarchal expectations, the nuns should ask for clarifications.
mn146:5.5	“We’re already delighted and satisfied with Master Nandaka, since he invites us like this.”	Thus fulfilling one of the factors required for a teacher of nuns.
mn146:6.1	“What do you think, sisters?	NA
mn146:6.2	Is the eye permanent or impermanent?”	The discussion begins with the most obvious factors, the internal sense organs, and proceeds to analyze each in terms of the three characteristics: impermanence, suffering, and not-self. Nandaka ensures that the nuns are with him each step.
mn146:6.3	“Impermanent, sir.”	NA

mn146:6.5	“Suffering, sir.”	NA

mn146:9.1	Suppose there was an oil lamp burning. The oil, wick, flame, and light were all impermanent and perishable.	While the imagery of the dependence of the flame on its fuel is common in the suttas, this exact metaphor is not found elsewhere. Normally the Buddha employs metaphors in an ABA structure: he explains the doctrine, illustrates it, and repeats the explanation. Here, however, the metaphor acts as a springboard for the next stage of the argument, the impermanence of feelings.
mn146:9.2	Now, suppose someone was to say:	NA
mn146:9.3	‘While this oil lamp is burning, the oil, the wick, and the flame are all impermanent and perishable.	NA
mn146:9.4	But the light is permanent, lasting, eternal, and imperishable.’	NA
mn146:9.5	Would they be speaking rightly?”	NA
mn146:9.6	“No, sir.	NA
mn146:9.7	Why is that?	NA

mn146:9.10	“In the same way, suppose someone was to say:	NA
mn146:9.11	‘These six interior sense fields are impermanent.	NA

mn146:10.1	Suppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood. The roots, trunk, branches and leaves, and shadow were all impermanent and perishable.	This is another unique application of a familiar image, although a similar metaphor for the six senses as the shadow of a post is found at [an4.195:11.1]().
mn146:10.2	Now, suppose someone was to say:	NA
mn146:10.3	‘There’s a large tree standing with heartwood. The roots, trunk, and branches and leaves are all impermanent and perishable. But the shadow is permanent, lasting, eternal, and imperishable.’	NA

mn146:10.7	Because that large tree’s roots, trunk, and branches and leaves are all impermanent and perishable,	NA
mn146:10.8	let alone the shadow.”	Divinity is identified, albeit inadequately, with a shadow at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.1.12. From Vedic times the shadow was both the place of relief from the hot sun (Rig Veda 6.16.38, 2.33.6) and the shadow of death (10.121.2).
mn146:10.9	“In the same way, suppose someone was to say:	NA
mn146:10.10	‘These six exterior sense fields are impermanent.	The metaphor of shadow for the exterior sense fields is the inverse of that for the interior sense fields, light. This speaks to the high degree of care with which Nandaka structured his teaching. Further, the movement from light to shadow subconsciously prepares the audience for the darker metaphor to come.

mn146:11.3	and then peel off the outer hide. Then they’d wrap that cow up in that very same hide and say:	NA
mn146:11.4	‘This cow is joined to its hide just like before.’	NA
mn146:11.5	Would they be speaking rightly?”	NA
mn146:11.6	“No, sir.	NA
mn146:11.7	Why is that?	NA
mn146:11.8	NA	NA
mn146:11.9	NA	NA
mn146:11.10	Because even if they wrap that cow up in that very same hide and say:	NA
mn146:11.11	‘This cow is joined to its hide just like before,’	NA
mn146:11.12	still that cow is not joined to that hide.”	NA
mn146:12.1	“I’ve made up this simile to make a point.	NA
mn146:12.2	And this is the point.	NA
mn146:12.3	‘The inner flesh’ is a term for the six interior sense fields.	NA
mn146:12.4	‘The outer hide’ is a term for the six exterior sense fields.	NA
mn146:12.5	‘The connecting tendons, sinews, and ligaments’ is a term for greed and relishing.	NA
mn146:12.6	‘A sharp meat cleaver’ is a term for noble wisdom.	NA
mn146:12.7	And it is that noble wisdom which cuts, carves, severs, and slices the connecting corruption, fetter, and bond.	NA
mn146:13.1	Sisters, by developing and cultivating these seven awakening factors, a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.	Knowing that the nuns have good insight, Nandaka encourages them to continue deepening their meditation practice.
mn146:13.2	What seven?	NA
mn146:13.3	It’s when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness,	NA
mn146:13.4	investigation of principles,	NA
mn146:13.5	energy,	NA
mn146:13.6	rapture,	NA
mn146:13.7	tranquility,	NA
mn146:13.8	immersion,	NA
mn146:13.9	and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.	NA
mn146:13.10	It is by developing and cultivating these seven awakening factors that a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.”	NA
mn146:14.1	Then after giving this advice to the nuns, Nandaka dismissed them, saying,	NA
mn146:14.2	“Go, sisters, it is time.”	This seems at odds with the detail that Nandaka had gone to the nuns’ monastery to teach. Parallels in Chinese and Tibetan say instead that Nandaka left ( SA 276 at T ii 75c2; T 1442 at T xxiii 793c12, and D (3) ’dul ba, ja 57b7).
mn146:14.3	And then those nuns approved and agreed with what Nandaka had said. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled him, keeping him on their right. Then they went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. The Buddha said to them,	NA
mn146:14.4	“Go, nuns, it is time.”	NA
mn146:14.5	Then those nuns bowed to the Buddha respectfully circled him, keeping him on their right, before departing.	NA
mn146:15.1	Soon after those nuns had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:	NA
mn146:15.2	“Suppose, mendicants, it was the sabbath of the fourteenth day. You wouldn’t get lots of people	NA
mn146:15.3	wondering whether the moon is full or not, since it is obviously not full.	NA
mn146:15.4	In the same way, those nuns were uplifted by Nandaka’s Dhamma teaching, but they still haven’t got all they wished for.”	NA
mn146:16.1	Then the Buddha said to Nandaka,	NA
mn146:16.2	“Well then, Nandaka, tomorrow you should give those nuns the same advice again.”	NA
mn146:16.3	“Yes, sir,” Nandaka replied.	NA
mn146:16.4	And the next day he went to those nuns, and all unfolded just like the previous day.	NA

mn146:27.1	Soon after those nuns had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:	NA
mn146:27.2	“Suppose, mendicants, it was the sabbath of the fifteenth day. You wouldn’t get lots of people	NA
mn146:27.3	wondering whether the moon is full or not, since it is obviously full.	NA
mn146:27.4	In the same way, those nuns were uplifted by Nandaka’s Dhamma teaching, and they got all they wished for.	NA
mn146:27.5	Even the last of these five hundred nuns is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.”	As noted above, the nuns’ statements indicate that they had attained stream-entry even before being taught by Nandaka. Elsewhere, to have fulfilled one’s wishes like the moon on the fifteenth day unequivocally means arahantship ([thag10.2:10.1]()). Indeed, parallels indicate that at this point they have all attained arahantship (SA 276 at T ii 75c16; T 1442 at T xxiii 794a14; D (3) ’dul ba, ja 59a1). Remarkably, this detail is also confirmed in the commentaries to the Aṅguttara Nikāya, Theragāthā, and Therīgāthā, which say they became arahants when listening to Nandaka’s second teaching.
mn146:27.6	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
mn146:27.7	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn147:0.1	Middle Discourses 147	NA
mn147:0.2	The Shorter Advice to Rāhula	NA
mn147:1.1	So I have heard.	This discourse recurs at [sn35.121]().
mn147:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
mn147:1.3	Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	NA
mn147:1.4	“The qualities that ripen in freedom have ripened in Rāhula.	Five perceptions that ripen in freedom are taught at [dn33:2.1.139](), but apart from that we do not encounter this idea in the discourses. | In [sn18.1]()–5, Rāhula requests a teaching so he can go on retreat. The teachings given there can be compared with the parallel, which says the Buddha first told Rāhula to teach the five aggregates, the six sense-spheres, and conditionality, and then to go on retreat and meditate on the same teachings (SA 200 at T ii 51a23). Only then did the Buddha consider him ready.
mn147:1.5	Why don’t I lead him further to the ending of defilements?”	NA
mn147:1.6	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	NA
mn147:1.7	Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Rāhula,	NA
mn147:1.8	“Rāhula, get your sitting cloth.	The sitting cloth was a regular requisite of monastics ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89]()). Regularly featured in the texts of the Sarvāstivāda schools, it is rarely mentioned in the Pali suttas (but see [dn16:3.1.3]()).
mn147:1.9	Let’s go to the Dark Forest for the day’s meditation.”	NA
mn147:1.10	“Yes, sir,” replied Rāhula. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha.	NA
mn147:2.1	Now at that time many thousands of deities followed the Buddha, thinking,	The presence of a thousand deities, which is unique to this discourse, is not mentioned in the parallel at all, and is obviously a later addition.
mn147:2.2	“Today the Buddha will lead Rāhula further to the ending of defilements!”	NA
mn147:2.3	Then the Buddha plunged deep into the Dark Forest and sat at the root of a tree on the seat spread out.	NA
mn147:2.4	Rāhula bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.	NA
mn147:2.5	The Buddha said to him:	NA

mn149:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn149:2.1	“Mendicants, I shall teach you the great discourse on what relates to the six sense fields.	For _āyatanika_ see [mn121:10.5](), where it refers to the life faculty of the body that is “related to the six sense fields”; there are also heavens and hells “related to the six fields of contact” ([mn50:22.2](), [sb35:35.135]()). In each case it refers to something that is connected to or related to the six sense fields, as indicated by the suffix _ika_. Here this refers to the fact that this discourse treats multiple distinct teaching frameworks in relation to the six sense fields. These include the majority of the _saṁyutta-mātikā_, the list of topics making up the Saṁyutta Nikāya. And this inclusive and integrative nature in turn explains why the teaching is “great”.
mn149:2.2	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn149:2.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
mn149:2.4	The Buddha said this:	NA

mn149:3.2	Someone who lives aroused like this—fettered, confused, concentrating on gratification—accumulates the five grasping aggregates for themselves in the future.

mn149:9.3	And their craving—which leads to future lives, mixed up with relishing and greed, taking pleasure wherever it lands—is given up.	NA
mn149:9.4	Their physical and mental stress,	NA

mn150:0.1	Middle Discourses 150	NA
mn150:0.2	With the People of Nagaravinda	NA
mn150:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn150:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Nagaravinda.	We travel with the Buddha to several “villages of the Kosalan brahmins”, but this is the only recorded visit to Nagaravinda. The name seems to mean “mountain-lotus” (_naga_ = “mountain”, _aravinda_ = “lotus”). Sāvatthī lies only fifty kilometres south of the Himalayan foothills.
mn150:2.1	The brahmins and householders of Nagaravinda heard,	NA
mn150:2.2	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—while wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Nagaravinda, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	NA
mn150:2.3	He has this good reputation:	NA
mn150:2.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
mn150:2.5	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	NA
mn150:2.6	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
mn150:2.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	NA
mn150:3.1	Then the brahmins and householders of Nagaravinda went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. The Buddha said to them:	NA
mn150:4.1	“Householders, if wanderers who follow another religion were to ask you:	This is an unusual framing, as usually the Buddha refers to wanderers of another religion when speaking with mendicants. The parallel simply says “other people” (SA 280 at T ii 76c8). Again, the fact that the villagers have diverse responses to the Buddha shows that they are not all Buddhists, and hence it would be out of character for the Buddha to assume otherwise, as the teaching here implies. Further, the Buddha’s statement here reads as if it were an answer to a question on how to discern which of the many different ascetics were worthy of respect. It seems to me likely that the narrative has become a little confused.
mn150:4.2	‘What kind of ascetic or brahmin doesn’t deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration?’	NA
mn150:4.3	You should answer them:	NA
mn150:4.4	‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are not free of greed, hate, and delusion for sights known by the eye, who are not peaceful inside, and who conduct themselves badly among the good by way of body, speech, and mind. They don’t deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration.	The idiom _samavisamaṁ caranti_ means “walk roughly in the smooth”, in other words, “conduct themselves badly among the good”, in contrast with those who “walk smoothly in the rough” (_caranti visame samaṁ_, [sn1.7:3.4](), [sn2.6:8.6]()).
mn150:4.5	Why is that?	NA
mn150:4.6	Because we ourselves are not free of these things, so we do not see that they have any higher good conduct than us.	NA
mn150:4.7	That’s why they don’t deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration.	NA
mn150:4.8	There are ascetics and brahmins who are not free of greed, hate, and delusion for sounds known by the ear …	NA

mn150:4.15	That’s why they don’t deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration.’	This is a much higher standard than that implied at [mn142:8.1](). However, the context is different: there, it is whether offerings will be fruitful, here it is whether they are truly deserving of respect.

mn150:6.4	You should answer them:	NA
mn150:6.5	‘It’s because those venerables frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.	NA
mn150:6.6	In such places there are no sights known by the eye to see and enjoy, there are no sounds known by the ear to hear and enjoy, no odors known by the nose to smell and enjoy, no flavors known by the tongue to taste and enjoy, and no touches known by the body to feel and enjoy.	NA

mn151:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
mn151:1.3	Then in the late afternoon, Sāriputta came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	NA
mn151:2.1	“Sāriputta, your faculties are so very clear, and your complexion is pure and bright.	NA
mn151:2.2	What kind of meditation are you usually practicing these days?”	NA
mn151:2.3	“Sir, these days I usually practice the meditation on emptiness.”	See [mn121:3.3]() and note. This discourse offers a different perspective on this meditation.
mn151:2.4	“Good, good, Sāriputta!	NA
mn151:2.5	It seems you usually practice the meditation of a great man.	While the concept of a “great man” is familiar, the “meditation of a great man” (_mahāpurisavihāra_) appears only here and at [pli-tv-kd22:2.5.10](), which seems to borrow from this passage.
mn151:2.6	For emptiness is the meditation of a great man.	NA

mn151:3.4	Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that	NA
mn151:3.5	there was such desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion in their heart, they should make an effort to give up those unskillful qualities.	NA

mn151:21.7	Satisfied, Venerable Sāriputta approved what the Buddha said.	NA
mn152:0.1	Middle Discourses 152	NA
mn152:0.2	The Development of the Faculties	NA
mn152:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
mn152:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kajaṅgalā in a bamboo grove.	The names here are spelled _gajaṅgalā_ and _suveḷuvana_, but I keep consistency with [an10.28](), where a nun residing at this town gives a penetrative discourse to the townsfolk. In the Vinaya it is mentioned as the easternmost point of the “middle country”, just beyond which lay Mahāsāla ([pli-tv-kd5:13.12.2]()). The Milindapañha says it was a brahmin village on the slopes of the Himalayas where its main protagonist, the monk Nāgasena, was born ([mil2:22.3]()). Assuming both these are the same place, we might look somewhere near Darjeeling for this town. In any case, it represents the furthest east that the Buddha taught. It is sometimes identified with <span lang='lzh'>羯蠅揭羅</span> mentioned by Xuang Zang, but that has been located near Agra south of Sāvatthī.
mn152:2.1	Then the student Uttara, a pupil of the brahmin Pārāsariya, approached the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	A brahmin teacher named Pārāsariya (also spelled Pārāpariya or Pārāsiviya) features in [ja222]() and [ja353]() as one who warns that doing evil will lead to regret. The three similarly-named monks in the Theragāthā ([thag1.116](), [thag16.2](), [thag16.10]()) share the same clan name (Sanskrit Pārāśarya). These are descendants of the great sage Parāśara Śāktya, who is mentioned in Rig Veda 7.1.18 alongside Śatayātu, Vasiṣṭha; his prayers to Agni are recorded at Rig Veda 1.65–73, and to Soma at 9.97.31–44.
mn152:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	NA
mn152:2.3	“Uttara, does Pārāsariya teach his disciples the development of the faculties?”	NA
mn152:2.4	“He does, worthy Gotama.”	NA
mn152:2.5	“But how does he teach it?”	NA
mn152:2.6	“Worthy Gotama, it’s when the eye sees no sight and the ear hears no sound.	This is perhaps a distorted reference to certain Upaniṣadic teachings that speak of the undifferentiated state of divinity that contains the potential for the faculties of seeing, etc. See [dn29:16.13]() and note there. Perhaps, too, it refers to the notion that in deep sleep the senses are withdrawn into the “space of the heart” (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.1.17).
mn152:2.7	That’s how Pārāsariya teaches his disciples the development of the faculties.”	NA
mn152:2.8	“In that case, Uttara, a blind person and a deaf person will have developed faculties	NA
mn152:2.9	according to what Pārāsariya says.	NA
mn152:2.10	For a blind person sees no sight with the eye and a deaf person hears no sound with the ear.”	This teaching is not about deep meditation, where the senses can be in a state of abeyance, but about how we relate to the experience of the senses.
mn152:2.11	When he said this, Uttara sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.	NA
mn152:3.1	Knowing this, the Buddha addressed Venerable Ānanda,	NA
mn152:3.2	“Ānanda, the development of the faculties taught by Pārāsariya is quite different from the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble One.”	NA
mn152:3.3	“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One.	NA
mn152:3.4	Let the Buddha teach the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble One. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	NA
mn152:3.5	“Well then, Ānanda, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
mn152:3.6	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
mn152:3.7	The Buddha said this:	NA
mn152:4.1	“And how, Ānanda, is there the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble One?	NA
mn152:4.2	When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, in them arises what is agreeable, what is disagreeable, and what is both agreeable and disagreeable.	NA
mn152:4.3	They understand:	NA
mn152:4.4	‘What is agreeable, what is disagreeable, and what is both agreeable and disagreeable have arisen in me.	NA
mn152:4.5	That’s conditioned, crude, and dependently originated.	NA
mn152:4.6	But this is peaceful and sublime, namely	NA
mn152:4.7	equanimity.’	NA
mn152:4.8	Then the agreeable, the disagreeable, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose in them cease,	NA
mn152:4.9	and equanimity becomes stabilized.	NA
mn152:4.10	It’s like how a person with clear eyes might open their eyes then shut them; or might shut their eyes then open them.	The Buddha gives a series of similes, each one appropriate to the specific sense.
mn152:4.11	Such is the speed, the swiftness, the ease with which anything agreeable, disagreeable, and both agreeable and disagreeable that arose in them cease, and equanimity becomes stabilized.	NA
mn152:4.12	In the training of the Noble One this is called the supreme development of the faculties regarding sights known by the eye.	Bearing in mind that the word for “faculty”, _indriya_, has the sense of “potential”, this phrase emphasizes that the “restraint” of the senses is also the way to “develop” them to their fullest.
mn152:5.1	Furthermore, when a mendicant hears a sound with their ears, the agreeable, the disagreeable, and the both agreeable and disagreeable arise in them.	NA
mn152:5.2	They understand:	NA
mn152:5.3	‘What is agreeable, what is disagreeable, and what is both agreeable and disagreeable have arisen in me.	NA
mn152:5.4	That’s conditioned, crude, and dependently originated.	NA
mn152:5.5	But this is peaceful and sublime, namely	NA
mn152:5.6	equanimity.’	NA
mn152:5.7	Then the agreeable, the disagreeable, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose in them cease,	NA
mn152:5.8	and equanimity becomes stabilized.	NA
mn152:5.9	It’s like how a strong person can effortlessly snap their fingers.	NA
mn152:5.10	Such is the speed, the swiftness, the ease with which anything agreeable, disagreeable, and both agreeable and disagreeable that arose in them cease, and equanimity becomes stabilized.	NA
mn152:5.11	In the training of the Noble One this is called the supreme development of the faculties regarding sounds known by the ear.	NA
mn152:6.1	Furthermore, when a mendicant smells an odor with their nose, the agreeable, the disagreeable, and the both agreeable and disagreeable arise in them.	NA
mn152:6.2	They understand:	NA
mn152:6.3	‘What is agreeable, what is disagreeable, and what is both agreeable and disagreeable have arisen in me.	NA

mn152:6.7	Then the agreeable, the disagreeable, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose in them cease,	NA

mn152:6.9	It’s like how a drop of water would roll off a gently sloping lotus leaf, and would not stay there.	NA
mn152:6.10	Such is the speed, the swiftness, the ease with which anything agreeable, disagreeable, and both agreeable and disagreeable that arose in them cease, and equanimity becomes stabilized.	NA
mn152:6.11	In the training of the Noble One this is called the supreme development of the faculties regarding smells known by the nose.	NA
mn152:7.1	Furthermore, when a mendicant tastes a flavor with their tongue, the agreeable, the disagreeable, and the both agreeable and disagreeable arise in them.	NA
mn152:7.2	They understand:	NA
mn152:7.3	‘What is agreeable, what is disagreeable, and what is both agreeable and disagreeable have arisen in me.	NA
mn152:7.4	That’s conditioned, crude, and dependently originated.	NA
