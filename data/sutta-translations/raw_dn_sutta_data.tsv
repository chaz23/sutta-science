dn1:1.0	1. Talk on Wanderers	NA
dn1:1.1.1	So I have heard.	Tradition holds that these were the words spoken by Ānanda when reciting the Suttapiṭaka at the First Council following the Buddha’s death. In fact it is a tag signifying that the text has been passed down through oral tradition and the speaker was not present at the events ([dn5:21.10](), [mn127:17.4]()). | This sutta with its commentary was translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi in his *The All-Embracing Net of Views*.
dn1:1.1.2	At one time the Buddha was traveling along the road between Rājagaha and Nāḷandā together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants.	By convention, suttas do not specify the date, so we have scant internal chronology. | Walk about fifteen kilometers north from Rājagaha (modern Rajgir) to reach Nāḷandā. | “Mendicant” is a literal translation of _bhikkhu_, one who goes for alms.
dn1:1.1.3	The wanderer Suppiya was also traveling along the same road, together with his resident pupil, the student Brahmadatta.	A “wanderer” (_paribbājaka_) was a homeless religious renunciate—male or female—who wandered seeking alms. Kauṭilya describes their lifestyle as “mastery of the senses, abstaining from ritual activities, living without possessions, abandoning attachments, practicing mendicancy, residing in the wilderness but not in a single place, and purifying himself internally and externally” (Arthaśāstra 1.3.12, Olivelle’s translation). | “Resident pupil” (or elsewhere just “pupil”) is _antevāsi_, a live-in apprentice of a master. | “Student” (_māṇava_) is a young man who was learning the Vedas from a master.
dn1:1.1.4	Meanwhile, Suppiya criticized the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways,	Today these are called the Triple Gem that makes up the Buddhist religion; however they are not known by that term in the early texts.
dn1:1.1.5	but his pupil Brahmadatta praised them in many ways.	While the disagreement of student and teacher signifies their confusion, it also represents the diversity of views within the brahmanical caste and the openness with which a student could disagree with their teacher.
dn1:1.1.6	And so both tutor and pupil followed behind the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants directly contradicting each other.	NA
dn1:1.2.1	Then the Buddha took up residence for the night in the royal rest-house in Ambalaṭṭhikā together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.	Ambalaṭṭhikā means “place of mango saplings”. It was a rest-house set up by the king of Rājagaha about a day’s journey from the capital. It must have been sizable.
dn1:1.2.2	And Suppiya and Brahmadatta did likewise.	NA
dn1:1.2.3	There too, Suppiya criticized the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways,	NA
dn1:1.2.4	but his pupil Brahmadatta praised them in many ways.	NA
dn1:1.2.5	And so both tutor and pupil kept on directly contradicting each other.	NA
dn1:1.3.1	Then several mendicants rose at the crack of dawn and sat together in the pavilion, where the topic of judgmentalism came up:	_Saṅkhiyadhamma_ is a unique term. The commentary glosses it as _kathādhamma_, following which it has been translated as “conversation” or “trend of conversation”. But _saṅkhā_ means “appraisal, assessment, evaluation, measuring, calculating”, and here the subject of discussion is the different ways the two parties assess or judge the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha. Compare the “appraisal” of the Buddha at [dn19:19.2]().
dn1:1.3.2	“It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing how the diverse convictions of sentient beings have been well deciphered by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	_Adhimutti_ is something that has been decided, a conviction or belief.
dn1:1.3.3	For this Suppiya criticizes the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways,	NA
dn1:1.3.4	while his pupil Brahmadatta praises them in many ways.	NA
dn1:1.3.5	And so both tutor and pupil followed behind the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants directly contradicting each other.”	NA
dn1:1.4.1	When the Buddha found out about this discussion on judgmentalism among the mendicants, he went to the pavilion, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants,	This would have been an open air pavilion in the rest-house. By convention, when a teacher or other respected person is to sit, a sitting mat is spread out or made ready for them.
dn1:1.4.2	“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	The very first words of the Buddha in the Suttapiṭaka: he asks to hear what others are saying.
dn1:1.4.3	The mendicants told him what had happened, adding,	Here and in similar passages the Pali repeats all and I abbreviate.

dn1:1.5.1	“Mendicants, if others criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, don’t make yourselves resentful, bitter, and exasperated.	The phrasing here is somewhat unusual and specific. They “should not do” what creates bitterness (i.e. judging others). Compare [mn22](), where the same phrases are used. In the Buddha’s case, it has the neutral _hoti_, while for the mendicants it uses _karaṇīya_, as here.
dn1:1.5.2	You’ll get angry and upset, which would be an obstacle for you alone.	Complaining about others does not hurt them, only the one who gets upset.
dn1:1.5.3	If others were to criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, and you got angry and upset, would you be able to understand whether they spoke well or poorly?”	Equanimity is a prerequisite for evaluating facts.

dn1:1.7.0.1	2. Ethics	NA
dn1:1.7.0.2	2.1. The Shorter Section on Ethics	NA
dn1:1.7.1	When an ordinary person speaks praise of the Realized One, they speak only of trivial, insignificant details of mere ethics.	Ethics (or morality or virtue, _sīla_) is important, but it pales in comparison with the higher dimensions of the Buddha’s path. For an example of this kind of praise see [mn77:8.1](). | The Buddha often referred to himself as “the Realized One” (_tathāgata_).
dn1:1.7.2	And what are the trivial, insignificant details of mere ethics that an ordinary person speaks of?	Here the Buddha lays out in detail the ethical conduct for mendicant followers.
dn1:1.8.1	‘The ascetic Gotama has given up killing living creatures. He has renounced the rod and the sword. He’s scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings.’	The first and most important precept. It is not just the negative injunction to avoid killing, but also the positive injunction to have compassion for all creatures. | The Buddha is called “the ascetic Gotama” by non-Buddhists.
dn1:1.8.2	Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One.	An “ordinary person” (_puthujjana_) is anyone who has not, at minimum, entered the path to stream-entry.
dn1:1.8.3	‘The ascetic Gotama has given up stealing. He takes only what’s given, and expects only what’s given. He keeps himself clean by not thieving.’	NA
dn1:1.8.4	Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One.	NA
dn1:1.8.5	‘The ascetic Gotama has given up unchastity. He is chaste, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex.’	“Chastity” is _brahmacariya_, literally “divine conduct”. Here it is used in the narrow sense of refraining from sex, but more commonly it has a broader sense of “spiritual life”.
dn1:1.8.6	Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One.	NA
dn1:1.9.1	‘The ascetic Gotama has given up lying. He speaks the truth and sticks to the truth. He’s honest and dependable, and doesn’t trick the world with his words.’	This is the first of the four kinds of right speech. Just as the precept of not killing implies the positive injunction to live with compassion, the precepts on speech enjoin a positive and constructive use of speech.
dn1:1.9.2	Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One.	NA
dn1:1.9.3	‘The ascetic Gotama has given up divisive speech. He doesn’t repeat in one place what he heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, he reconciles those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.’	“Harmony” (or “unanimity”, _samagga_) does not excuse untrue, bigoted, or otherwise harmful speech. True harmony is only achieved in the presence of the Dhamma.
dn1:1.9.4	Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One.	NA
dn1:1.9.5	‘The ascetic Gotama has given up harsh speech. He speaks in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people.’	NA
dn1:1.9.6	Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One.	NA
dn1:1.9.7	‘The ascetic Gotama has given up talking nonsense. His words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. He says things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.’	_Attha_ is a polyvalent term, here taking the senses  “meaningful” and “beneficial”. Elsewhere it means “goal”, “need”, “purpose”, “lawsuit”, or “ending”, and the senses are not always easy to untangle.
dn1:1.9.8	Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One.	NA
dn1:1.10.1	‘The ascetic Gotama refrains from injuring plants and seeds.’	Buddhists generally do not regard plants as sentient, but value them as part of the ecosystem that supports all life.
dn1:1.10.2	NA	NA
dn1:1.10.3	‘He eats in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time.’	From [mn66:6.4]() and [mn70:4.8]() we can see that “at night” means after dark, while “at the wrong time” means in the afternoon. More explicitly, these are the “wrong time at night” and the “wrong time in the day”, in which case they are both the “wrong time”.
dn1:1.10.4	‘He refrains from seeing shows of dancing, singing, and music .’	Such sensual entertainments distract and excite the mind. This and the next three precepts encourage peace of mind for meditation.
dn1:1.10.5	‘He refrains from beautifying and adorning himself with garlands, fragrance, and makeup.’	This was ignored by the Buddha’s cousin, Nanda ([sn21.8:1.2]()).
dn1:1.10.6	‘He refrains from high and luxurious beds.’	To avoid sleeping too much.
dn1:1.10.7	‘He refrains from receiving gold and currency,	Literally “gold and silver” (_jātarūparajata_), but _rajata_ is explained in [pli-tv-bu-vb-np18:2.8]() as currency of any kind.

dn1:1.10.9	raw meat,	NA
dn1:1.10.10	women and girls,	NA
dn1:1.10.11	male and female bondservants,	According to ancient Indian law (Arthaśāstra 3.13), a person in a time of trouble may bind themselves in service for a fee. Such bondservants were protected against cruelty, sexual abuse, and unfair work. After earning back the fee of their indenture they were freed, retaining their original inheritance and status.

dn1:1.10.16	‘He refrains from running errands and messages;	These items are discussed in detail below. | Acting as a go-between for lay business was tempting due to the mendicants’ wandering lifestyle. However, it exposes them to risk if the message is not delivered or if it is bad news.

dn1:1.11.1	‘There are some ascetics and brahmins who, while enjoying food given in faith, still engage in injuring plants and seeds.	This section expands some of the former section in further detail. | The “middle” and “large” sections on ethics are not found in briefer presentations such as [mn27:14.1]().
dn1:1.11.2	These include plants propagated from roots, stems, cuttings, or joints; and those from regular seeds as the fifth.	That these are not five “kinds of seeds” but five kinds of “plants grown from seeds” is clear from the Vinaya and its commentary ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc11]():  _Bhūtagāmo nāma pañca bījajātāni_).
dn1:1.11.3	The ascetic Gotama refrains from such injury to plants and seeds.’	NA

dn1:1.12.2	This includes such things as food, drink, clothes, vehicles, bedding, fragrance, and things of the flesh.	NA
dn1:1.12.3	The ascetic Gotama refrains from storing up such goods.’	NA
dn1:1.12.4	Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One.	NA
dn1:1.13.1	‘There are some ascetics and brahmins who, while enjoying food given in faith, still engage in seeing shows.	NA
dn1:1.13.2	This includes such things as dancing, singing, music, performances, and storytelling; clapping, gongs, and kettledrums; beauty pageants; pole-acrobatics and bone-washing displays of the corpse-workers; battles of elephants, horses, buffaloes, bulls, goats, rams, chickens, and quails; staff-fights, boxing, and wrestling; combat, roll calls of the armed forces, battle-formations, and regimental reviews.	_Sobhanaka_ (“beauty pageant”) is explained by the commentary as the movement (or “sprinkling”) of dancers, or their beautification and painting. The PTS reading _sobha-nagarakaṁ_, supported by an unrelated reference to a _gandhabba_ city of that name, is spurious. | _Caṇḍālaṁ vaṁsaṁ dhovanaṁ_ should be a compound, as shown by the prose to [ja498](), where it is a performance by corpse-workers (_caṇḍāla_) in Ujjenī. _Vaṁsa_ is the bamboo used by _caṇḍāla_ acrobats ([sn47.19]()). _Dhovana_ is referred by the commentary to [an10.107](), where it is a southern ceremony accompanied by drink and dance. The commentaries to AN and DN say it was the ritual washing of the bones of the buried dead after the decomposition of the flesh. Such “second funeral” rites have been observed world-wide. From the Jātaka it appears that the tradition had declined to a mere display for passers-by, perhaps featuring naked tribal girls. | _Uyodhika_ is sometimes said to be “sham fights”, but at [an10.30]() it is not a sham. And the definition at [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc50]() says “where strife is seen”.

dn1:1.14.1	‘There are some ascetics and brahmins who, while enjoying food given in faith, still engage in gambling that causes negligence.	See too [dn31:11.1]().
dn1:1.14.2	This includes such things as checkers with eight or ten rows, checkers in the air, hopscotch, spillikins, board-games, tip-cat, drawing straws, dice, leaf-flutes, toy plows, somersaults, pinwheels, toy measures, toy carts, toy bows, guessing words from syllables, guessing another’s thoughts, and imitating musical instruments.	“Checkers” (_aṭṭhapada_) was presumably the ancestor of the Gupta period _caturaṅga_ and hence modern chess. | _Yathāvajja_ is explained in the commentary as “mimicking deformities”, but I cannot find support elsewhere in Pali or Sanskrit for _vajja_ in this sense. More likely it refers to musical instruments (Sanskrit _vādya_).

dn1:1.17.2	talk about kings, bandits, and ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that place.	_Bhavābhava_ does not mean “existence and non-existence” but is a distributive compound, “this or that state of existence”. Indian religious texts are full of discussions about different heavens and hells.

What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine!

This section focuses on practices that are wrong livelihood for a mendicant, though not for lay people. The Vinaya explains “low lore” as whatever is non-Buddhist or useless ([pli-tv-bi-vb-pc49]()), while the commentary says it leads not to emancipation but to heaven.
dn1:1.21.2	This includes such fields as limb-reading, omenology, divining celestial portents, interpreting dreams, divining bodily marks, divining holes in cloth gnawed by mice, fire offerings, ladle offerings, offerings of husks, rice powder, rice, ghee, or oil; offerings from the mouth, blood sacrifices, palmistry; geomancy for building sites, fields, and cemeteries; exorcisms, earth magic, snake charming, poisons; the lore of the scorpion, the rat, the bird, and the crow; prophesying lifespan, chanting for protection, and divining omens from wild animals.	Reading _khattavijjā_ (“political science”) per variant as _khettavijjā_ (“geomancy”). | _Sara_ in _saraparitta_ means “sound” not “arrow”; compare with _sarabhañña_ “chanting”. | _Migacakka_ is explained in the commentary, supported by the astrological text Bṛhatsaṁhitā, as interpretation of the cries and behaviors of wild animals. Here the suffix _-cakka_ refers to the field of study. See also [mil5.3.7:6.1]() _sācakkaṁ migacakkaṁ antaracakkaṁ_ (“divining omens from dogs, wild animals, and the directions around”), terms which are also found at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 2.

And it also includes making predictions about the results of all such phenomena.	Despite this, astrology is commonly practiced today among Buddhist mendicants. | _(Up)pathagamana_ can hardly mean that the sun, moon, and stars will “go astray”. Rather, _patha_ here has the sense of “range”, so it means “come within range”, which describes an astrological conjunction. | For “fiery sky” (_disāḍāha_) as an ill omen, see _diśāṁ dāhe_ at Manusmṛti 4.115.

dn1:1.25.2	This includes predicting whether there will be plenty of rain or drought; plenty to eat or famine; an abundant harvest or a bad harvest; security or peril; sickness or health. It also includes such occupations as arithmetic, accounting, calculating, poetry, and cosmology.	“Cosmology” (_lokāyata_) in early Buddhist texts is not, as it later became known, the heterodox school of materialism. Rather, it was a branch of worldly knowledge within regular Vedic studies concerned with the nature and extent of the world and how this may be known ([an9.38](), [sn12.48]()).

dn1:1.26.2	This includes making arrangements for giving and taking in marriage; for engagement and divorce; and for scattering rice inwards or outwards at the wedding ceremony. It also includes casting spells for good or bad luck, treating impacted fetuses, binding the tongue, or locking the jaws; charms for the hands and ears; questioning a mirror, a girl, or a god as an oracle; worshiping the sun, worshiping the Great One, breathing fire, and invoking Siri, the goddess of luck.	The commentary has _saṅkiraṇa_/_vikiraṇa_ as “saving and spending” (cp. [snp1.6:23.1]()), but it seems unlikely. _Vikiraṇa_ means “scattering” food or sand, while Sanskrit  _vikira_ is the ritual scattering of rice. Given the context, I think it refers to the custom of scattering rice at a wedding. | For _viruddhagabbhakaraṇa_, _viruddha_ means “obstructed”. The commentary here, in general agreement with the Niddesa on _gabbhakaraṇa_ at [snp4.14](), explains as giving treatments for the survival of the fetus. | I omit _hanujappana_ as it is absent from the commentary and seems to have just arisen by confusion.

dn1:1.27.2	This includes rites for propitiation, for granting wishes, for ghosts, for the earth, for rain, for property settlement, and for preparing and consecrating house sites, and rites involving rinsing and bathing, and oblations. It also includes administering emetics, purgatives, expectorants, and phlegmagogues; administering ear-oils, eye restoratives, nasal medicine, ointments, and counter-ointments; surgery with needle and scalpel, treating children, prescribing root medicines, and binding on herbs.	Medicine is right livelihood, but a mendicant should not make a living from it. They may treat fellow mendicants, family members, or those close to the monastery. | _Santikamma_ is the Sanskrit _śāntikakarman_, a rite for averting evil. | For _vassakamma_ and _vossakamma_, the commentary has “fertile and infertile men” (_vassoti puriso, vossoti paṇḍako_), taking “rain” as a metaphor for semen. Such usages do have precedent elsewhere.

dn1:1.28.0.1	3. Views	NA
dn1:1.28.0.2	3.1. Theories About the Past	NA
dn1:1.28.1	There are other principles—deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute—which the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight. Those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things.	One meaning of _dhamma_ is “principle” in the sense of a natural law as well as a moral value. | Here begins the famous exposition of the sixty-two views. The subtlety of the analysis lies in how, rather than refuting the details of the views, the Buddha traces them all back to their fundamental psychology.
dn1:1.28.2	And what are these principles?	NA
dn1:1.29.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past, and assert various hypotheses concerning the past on eighteen grounds.	NA
dn1:1.29.2	And what are the eighteen grounds on which they rely?	NA
dn1:1.30.0	3.1.1. Eternalism	NA
dn1:1.30.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who are eternalists, who assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal on four grounds.	In such contexts, the “self” (_attā_) is a postulated metaphysical entity rather than a simple psychological sense of personal identity. The nature of this “self” or “soul” was endlessly debated. The Buddha rejected all theories of a “self”, and elsewhere it is said that “identity view” underlies all sixty-two views of the Brahmajāla ([sn41.3:4.13]()). | The “cosmos” is the _loka_, otherwise translated as “world”. This sometimes refers to the simple physical realm, sometimes to the world of experience, or else, as here, the vast universe as conceived in ancient Indian thought.
dn1:1.30.2	And what are the four grounds on which they rely?	NA
dn1:1.31.1	It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect their many kinds of past lives.	“Immersion” (_samādhi_) is deep meditative stillness. The word conveys the sense of “gathered”, “collected”, with a secondary sense of “ignited”, “illuminated”. The practice of _samādhi_ (or _jhāna_, “absorption”) has never been regarded as uniquely Buddhist. However, right meditation begins with right view. Since these meditators begin with wrong view, their _samādhi_ is “wrong” because it merely reinforces their error.
dn1:1.31.2	That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	The recollection of past lives is specific, detailed, and confident as it is based on the clear mind of deep immersion.
dn1:1.31.3	They say:	NA
dn1:1.31.4	‘The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar.	This is the Upaniṣadic view of the eternal _ātman_ that is the immanent soul of the world or cosmos, _loka_. Elsewhere in the suttas such theorists assert that the self and the cosmos are identical ([sn24.3:1.3](): _so attā so loko_).
dn1:1.31.5	They remain the same for all eternity, while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and rearise.	The eternal “self” is contrasted with the ephemeral lives of beings. | The famous word _saṁsara_ is often understood as a “cycle” of rebirths, but the meaning is, rather, to “wander on” or “transmigrate”. | For the phrase _sassatisamaṁ_ (“lasting forever and ever”), compare Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.10.1: “He reaches that world free of sorrow and snow, where he lives forever and ever” (_sa lokam āgacchaty aśokam ahimam | tasmin vasati śāśvatīḥ samāḥ_).
dn1:1.31.6	Why is that?	NA

dn1:1.31.8	with features and details.	NA
dn1:1.31.9	Because of this I know:	Their meditative experience revealed a process of transient and changing lives, yet from that they infer that there must be an eternal self.

dn1:1.32.3	That is: one eon of the cosmos contracting and expanding; two, three, four, five, or ten eons of the cosmos contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	This differs only in the length of time, which is now up to ten eons. A single eon (_kappa_) lasts longer than it would take to wear away a huge mountain by stroking it with a cloth once a century [sn15.5](), while the number of eons is greater than the sands in the Ganges river [sn15.8](). The vast time periods envisaged in early Buddhist texts are comparable with those of modern cosmology in physics.

dn1:1.34.2	It’s when some ascetic or brahmin relies on logic and inquiry. They speak of what they have worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing their own perspective:	These theorists used a process of logic to arrive at the same conclusion as the meditators. Different groups of ascetic philosophers emphasized contemplation or rational inquiry as the means to the truth. The Buddha acknowledged that both are useful but limited because, as here, they can sometimes lead to mistaken conclusions.
dn1:1.34.3	‘The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar.	NA

dn1:1.35.2	Any ascetics and brahmins who assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal do so on one or other of these four grounds. Outside of this there is none.	I have my doubts about this phrase. Everywhere else, _ito bahiddhā_ means “outside of the Buddhist community”, not “outside of the cases just considered”. Still, the commentary and the Chinese parallel at T 21 agree on this sense.
dn1:1.36.1	The Realized One understands this:	NA
dn1:1.36.2	‘If you hold on to and attach to these grounds for views it leads to such and such a destiny in the next life.’	A “view” (_diṭṭhi_) is a relatively fixed framework for understanding the world; a “theory”. The “grounds for views” (_diṭṭhiṭṭhānāni_) are the bases from which the views are derived. In this case these are the meditative experiences or the logical reasoning.
dn1:1.36.3	He understands this, and what goes beyond this. And since he does not misapprehend that understanding, he has realized quenching within himself.	The word _parāmasati_ means “to take hold” and is often used in the sense “to misapprehend”.
dn1:1.36.4	Having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape from feelings, the Realized One is freed through not grasping.	_Yathābhūtaṁ_ is often translated as “as it really is”, while I usually render it simply as “truly”. It often has a technical sense of seeing “how things came to be (_bhuta_)” as a process of conditionality ([sn12.31:7.1]()). Such direct vision of the truth is an attribute of the stream-enterer, who has realized the first of the four stages of awakening, in contrast with those on the path who still rely on faith or inference ([sn25.1]()). Here it refers to the understanding of feelings from a fivefold perspective. Feelings underlie intellectual theories and arguments, which serve to sate cravings and fears.
dn1:1.37.1	These are the principles—deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute—which the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight. And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things.	NA
dn1:1.37.2	The first recitation section.	Long texts are sometimes marked by their “recitation sections” (_bhāṇavāra_), which was the length that would be recited in one session.
dn1:2.1.0	3.1.2. Partial Eternalism	NA
dn1:2.1.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who are partial eternalists, who assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal and partially not eternal on four grounds.	Despite being views of the “self and the cosmos”, the main focus in the next four views is the self.
dn1:2.1.2	And what are the four grounds on which they rely?	NA
dn1:2.2.1	There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos contracts.	This is the end of an eon. It might be compared with what the physicists call the “big crunch”.
dn1:2.2.2	As the cosmos contracts, sentient beings are mostly headed for the realm of streaming radiance.	The human and similar realms are destroyed in the conflagration at the end of the universe, but sentient beings are sustained by the power of their past kamma. | The “realm of streaming radiance” is a Brahmā heaven corresponding to the second _jhāna_.
dn1:2.2.3	There they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, wandering in midair, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time.	“Mind-made” (_manomaya_) beings are spontaneously born due to past kamma, not by sex. | “Rapture” (_pīti_) is a joyous emotional response to pleasure, usually a spiritual sense of elevation or uplift in meditation.
dn1:2.3.1	There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos expands.	This might be compared with the “big bang” of a cyclic universe.
dn1:2.3.2	As it expands an empty mansion of divinity appears.	The realms into which beings are reborn exist interdependently with the beings themselves. The different dimensions correspond with different kinds of kamma.
dn1:2.3.3	Then a certain sentient being—due to the running out of their lifespan or merit—passes away from that host of radiant deities and is reborn in that empty mansion of divinity.	That is, they pass from a world corresponding to the second _jhāna_ to one corresponding to the first _jhāna_.
dn1:2.3.4	There they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, wandering in midair, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time.	NA
dn1:2.4.1	But after staying there all alone for a long time, they become dissatisfied and anxious:	This passage echoes the creation myth in Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.4. At 1.4.2, the self-created Divinity feels fearful and alone, and at 1.4.3 and 1.4.17 wishes for a partner. From a Buddhist point of view, this simply shows how even God is trapped by emotional attachments in the cycle of transmigration.
dn1:2.4.2	‘Oh, if only other beings would come to this place.’	NA
dn1:2.4.3	Then other sentient beings—due to the running out of their lifespan or merit—pass away from that host of radiant deities and are reborn in that mansion of divinity in company with that being.	These beings are reborn according to their own kamma, and it is just a coincidence that they appear after the first being made their wish.
dn1:2.4.4	There they too are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, wandering in midair, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time.	NA
dn1:2.5.1	Now, the being who was reborn there first thinks:	NA
dn1:2.5.2	‘I am the Divinity, the Great Divinity, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born.	His first words _ahamasmi brahmā_ (“I am Brahmā”) are equivalent to _aham brahmāsmīti_ at 1.4.10. See too _so’hamasmīti_ (“I am that”) at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.4.1, which parallels the Pali _eso’hamasmi_ at [mn28:6.8]() etc.
dn1:2.5.3	These beings were created by me!	At Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.4.5 the Divinity thinks, “I created all this”.
dn1:2.5.4	Why is that?	NA
dn1:2.5.5	Because first I thought:	NA
dn1:2.5.6	“Oh, if only other beings would come to this place.”	NA
dn1:2.5.7	Such was my heart’s wish, and then these creatures came to this place.’	The other creatures appeared after his wish, not because of it. God confuses correlation with causation, a mistake perpetuated by no small number of his followers.
dn1:2.5.8	And the beings who were reborn there later also think:	NA
dn1:2.5.9	‘This must be the Divinity, the Great Divinity, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born.	NA
dn1:2.5.10	And we were created by him.	NA
dn1:2.5.11	Why is that?	NA
dn1:2.5.12	Because we see that he was reborn here first, and we arrived later.’	At Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.4.9–10 the created humans also think first about the Divinity who preceded them, from whose knowledge of self all was created.
dn1:2.6.1	And the being who was reborn first is more long-lived, beautiful, and illustrious than those who arrived later.	NA
dn1:2.6.2	NA	NA
dn1:2.6.3	It’s possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this place.	NA
dn1:2.6.4	Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
dn1:2.6.5	By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind, they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life, but no further.	Again, their meditation experience is genuine, but what they infer from it goes beyond the facts.
dn1:2.6.6	They say:	NA
dn1:2.6.7	‘He who is the Divinity—the Great Divinity, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born—by he we were created. He is permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity.	NA
dn1:2.6.8	We who were created by that Divinity are impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, liable to pass away, and have come to this place.’	The surviving forms of Indic religion (Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism) typically hold that all creatures ultimately share the same nature and hence can find liberation. Here we see this was not always the case, for these theorists believed that there are inherently different orders of beings in the cosmos. This is not due to their conduct but to the circumstances of their creation.
dn1:2.6.9	This is the first ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal.	NA
dn1:2.7.1	And what is the second ground on which they rely?	NA
dn1:2.7.2	There are gods named ‘depraved by play.’ They spend too much time laughing, playing, and making merry. And in doing so, they lose their mindfulness, and they pass away from that host of gods.	Delightful as the life of the gods is, even they are supposed to retain a sense of moderation ([mn37:11.2]()), a lesson forgotten by those “depraved by play” (_khiḍḍāpadosikā_). | Note that mindfulness (_sati_) is not held to be a specifically Buddhist virtue. Here it refers to a sense of moral compass and self-awareness, rather than a meditation practice.
dn1:2.8.1	It’s possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this place.	NA
dn1:2.8.2	Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
dn1:2.8.3	By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind, they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life, but no further.	NA
dn1:2.9.1	They say:	NA
dn1:2.9.2	‘The gods not depraved by play don’t spend too much time laughing, playing, and making merry. So they don’t lose their mindfulness, and don’t pass away from that host of gods.	NA
dn1:2.9.3	They are permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity.	NA
dn1:2.9.4	But we who were depraved by play spent too much time laughing, playing, and making merry. In doing so, we lost our mindfulness, and passed away from that host of gods.	NA
dn1:2.9.5	We are impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, liable to pass away, and have come to this place.’	Here the difference in beings is attributed not to the circumstances of their creation but to their behavior.
dn1:2.9.6	This is the second ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal.	NA
dn1:2.10.1	And what is the third ground on which they rely?	NA
dn1:2.10.2	There are gods named ‘malevolent’. They spend too much time gazing at each other, so they grow angry with each other, and their bodies and minds get tired. They pass away from that host of gods.	The parallel between _manopadosika_ (“malevolent”) and _khiddapadosika_ (“depraved by play”) suggests a rendering “depraved in mind” for _manopadosika_. However, elsewhere in the suttas _manopadosa_ consistently means “malicious intent” ([mn56:13.15](), [mn93:18.30](), [dn26:20.3](). Also see _mano padūseyya_ at [mn21:20.1]() and [mn28:9.6](). Thus the contrast is between greed and hate. | Here, as usual, _mano_ and _citta_ are synonyms for “mind”.

dn1:2.11.2	Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA

dn1:2.13.1	And what is the fourth ground on which they rely?	NA
dn1:2.13.2	It’s when some ascetic or brahmin relies on logic and inquiry. They speak of what they have worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing their own perspective:	NA
dn1:2.13.3	‘That which is called “the eye”, “the ear”, “the nose”, “the tongue”, and also “the body”: that self is impermanent, not lasting, transient, perishable.	NA
dn1:2.13.4	That which is called “mind” or “sentience” or “consciousness”: that self is permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity.’	This is mind-body dualism, the idea that the mind is made of a fundamentally different stuff than the body.
dn1:2.13.5	This is the fourth ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal.	NA
dn1:2.14.1	These are the four grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal and partially not eternal.	NA

dn1:2.16.0	3.1.3. The Cosmos is Finite or Infinite	NA
dn1:2.16.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about size, and assert that the cosmos is finite or infinite on four grounds.	Here we move from views that conceive of both the self and the cosmos together to those that focus only on the physical extent of the cosmos. It is not  clear why these are classified as “views of the past”.
dn1:2.16.2	And what are the four grounds on which they rely?	NA
dn1:2.17.1	It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they meditate perceiving the cosmos as finite.	Once again the view is inferred from meditation, showing that meditative experience was regarded by some as revealing genuine truths about the physical realm.

In each of the two previous sets of four views, the views themselves were the same, only the means of knowing them differed. Here the views themselves differ. The differences take the form of a tetralemma: A, not-A, both A and not-A, neither A nor not-A. This pattern is commonly found in early Buddhism, as well as Indian thought more generally. The final two items are not meant to be obscure or mysterious, but to express genuine possibilities that cannot be captured by a simple duality.

dn1:2.23.0	3.1.4. Endless Flip-floppers	NA
dn1:2.23.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who are endless flip-floppers. Whenever they’re asked a question, they resort to verbal flip-flops and endless flip-flops on four grounds.	_Vikkhepa_ is “ﬂip-flopping”. | _Amarā_ is explained in the commentary as either “undying” or “eel-like”. However, _amarā_ in the sense of “eel” is found only in the commentary to this term so is probably spurious. The feminine form _amarā_ is attested in Sanskrit (eg. Manu 2.148). See also note to [sn4.1:5.2]().
dn1:2.23.2	And what are the four grounds on which they rely?	NA
dn1:2.24.1	It’s when some ascetic or brahmin doesn’t truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful.	This is a basic requirement for any spiritual teacher.

dn1:2.27.4	‘Suppose you were to ask me whether there is another world. If I believed that to be the case, I would say so.	Here begins a series of four tetrads that are commonly encountered in the suttas. The first is the belief in an afterlife.

dn1:2.27.7	whether there both is and is not another world …	This could include a belief that eternal life is offered only to adherents of a certain religion.
dn1:2.27.8	whether there neither is nor is not another world …	This could include the idea that our intrinsic nature is one with the cosmos, and our separation from that infinitude in this life is only a veil of delusion. Thus there is no other world, because all worlds are this world, but it is also not the case that there is nothing after death.
dn1:2.27.9	whether there are beings who are reborn spontaneously …	This is beings such as the gods or various ghosts and spirits, which are not born organically.
dn1:2.27.10	whether there are not beings who are reborn spontaneously …	This denies the existence of such beings. Not everyone in ancient India believed in the various orders of beings.
dn1:2.27.11	whether there both are and are not beings who are reborn spontaneously …	The belief that beings are both spontaneously born and organically born. Perhaps this denies that such a distinction can be made clearly, because both kinds of birth take place within the same order of beings.
dn1:2.27.12	whether there neither are nor are not beings who are reborn spontaneously …	Beings are reborn in other ways.
dn1:2.27.13	whether there is fruit and result of good and bad deeds …	This is the standard Buddhist view of kamma, shared with some, but not all, of the other Indian religions of the time.
dn1:2.27.14	whether there is no fruit and result of good and bad deeds …	Doing good or bad has no result; moral nihilism.
dn1:2.27.15	whether there both is and is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds …	Sometimes good and bad deeds have results, other times not.
dn1:2.27.16	whether there neither is nor is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds …	The results of actions are too subtle to be described as good or bad.

dn1:2.27.18	whether a realized one no longer exists after death …	A sage ceases to exist at the time of death. From a Buddhist point of view, this is incoherent since it assumes the underlying attachment to a “self”, which the Realized One has done away with.

However, _aroga_ is always used in the sense “free of disease, well, healthy” (eg. [mn97:2.4]()), and this applies to the Brahmanical tradition as well as the Buddhist. Chandogya Upaniṣad 7.26.2 says that one who sees (the self) does not see death, they have no disease or pain. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.12 similarly says that one who sees the self will not suffer in the wake of the body, which Śaṅkāra explains, “Struggling with desires for himself, for his son, for his wife, and so on, he is born and dies again and again, and is diseased when his body is diseased.”

dn1:3.9.0	3.2.4. Annihilationism	NA
dn1:3.9.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who are annihilationists. They assert the annihilation, eradication, and obliteration of an existing being on seven grounds.	These theorists assert the true existence of a being, thus falling into the fallacy of identity view. For the Buddha, the words “being” or a “self” describe an ongoing process that is conditioned and impermanent, and do not correspond to a genuine metaphysical reality. The distinction between contingent, empirical reality and metaphysical, absolute existence is essential to understanding early Buddhism.
dn1:3.9.2	And what are the seven grounds on which they rely?	NA
dn1:3.10.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	NA
dn1:3.10.2	‘This self is formed, made up of the four principal states, and produced by mother and father. Since it’s annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death, that’s how this self becomes rightly annihilated.’	This is the materialist view, which accepts only the coarse physical realm. This view is common today, but was also well known in the Buddha’s time. | The “four principal states” are earth, water, fire, and air, i.e. the states of matter: solid, liquid, plasma, and gas.
dn1:3.10.3	That is how some assert the annihilation of an existing being.	NA
dn1:3.11.1	But someone else says to them:	NA
dn1:3.11.2	‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it.	The theorist accepts multiple selves. As self theories evolve, they typically move from more coarse materialist theories towards more subtle conceptions. Sometimes the former view is rejected as being false. Sometimes, as here, the former view is seen not as false, but as incomplete and shallow.
dn1:3.11.3	But that’s not how *this* self becomes rightly annihilated.	NA
dn1:3.11.4	There is another self that is heavenly, formed, sensual, consuming solid food.	“Form” (_rūpa_) includes not just the physical realm of the elements, but various kinds of subtle form (_sukhumarūpa_). These include the energetic or mind-made bodies of beings in various dimensions. _Rūpa_  ultimately refers to the appearance or manifestation of physical properties, and can even include the perception of colors, lights, and shapes in the mind. Here the bodies of the divine beings are not very distant from our own, as they still consume solid food. This probably refers to various nature deities or entities that were believed to consume the food offered to them by humans.
dn1:3.11.5	You don’t know or see that.	NA
dn1:3.11.6	But I know it and see it.	NA
dn1:3.11.7	Since this self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death, that’s how this self becomes rightly annihilated.’	Whereas the eternalists believe that their heavenly rebirth will last forever, annihilationists believe that even heaven is limited, and it ends in final annihilation.
dn1:3.11.8	That is how some assert the annihilation of an existing being.	NA

dn1:3.12.4	There is another self that is heavenly, formed, mind-made, whole in its major and minor limbs, not deficient in any faculty.	This is a more subtle kind of divine rebirth, no longer dependent on physical food. The subtle body still takes on a humanoid form, however, appearing complete in all its limbs. It includes realms produced through the practice of the four _jhānas_. | _Sabbaṅga_ has the sense “whole and healthy of limb” (Rig Veda 10.161.5c, Atharva Veda 8.2.8c, 11.3.32 ff.). One is reborn with “whole body” (_sarvatanu_, Atharva Veda 5.6.11c, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.1.8.60, 12.8.3.31). | _Paccaṅga_ means “minor limb”, for example the fingers or internal organs.

dn1:3.13.4	There is another self which has gone totally beyond perceptions of form.

Such a rebirth has left even the subtle body behind, becoming sheer consciousness. | The word _āyatana_ is from a root meaning “expanse”. It is prominently used in this context, where it refers to a realm or “dimension” of rebirth, and in the analysis of sense experience, where it refers to a “field” of sense experience.

dn1:3.19.0	3.2.5. Extinguishment of Suffering in This Life	NA
dn1:3.19.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who speak of extinguishment in this life. They assert ultimate extinguishment for an existing being in this life on five grounds.	These five theories argue for the extinguishment of suffering through the experience of pleasure in the present life. The Buddha taught extinguishment (_nibbāna_) in this very life, but not “of an existing being” (_sato sattassa_) or “self” (_attā_). The Buddha denied that there is such a thing, pointing out that we are a stream of ever-changing conditions, fueled by desire and attachment, and liable to suffering. With the end of craving there is no fuel to sustain the stream, so suffering comes to an end. | It is unclear why these views of the “present life” (_diṭṭhadhamma_) are classified under views of the future; see [mn102:2.8]().
dn1:3.19.2	And what are the five grounds on which they rely?	NA
dn1:3.20.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	NA
dn1:3.20.2	‘When this self amuses itself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, that’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in this life.’	The hedonist.
dn1:3.20.3	That is how some assert ultimate extinguishment for an existing being in this life.	NA
dn1:3.21.1	But someone else says to them:	NA
dn1:3.21.2	‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it.	NA
dn1:3.21.3	But that’s not how *this* self attains ultimate extinguishment in this life.	NA
dn1:3.21.4	Why is that?	NA
dn1:3.21.5	Because sensual pleasures are impermanent, suffering, and perishable. Their decay and perishing give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.	Here we see the philosophical reasoning that prompts the evolution of more refined conceptions of self.
dn1:3.21.6	Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, this self enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. That’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in this life.’	The “absorptions” (_jhāna_) are central to Buddhist meditation. The Buddha did say that they can be considered “extinguishment in the present life” in a qualified sense ([an9.51]()). As we have seen above, however, if they are undertaken with wrong view, the experience itself will tend to reinforce the attachment to a self.
dn1:3.21.7	That is how some assert ultimate extinguishment for an existing being in this life.	NA
dn1:3.22.1	But someone else says to them:	NA
dn1:3.22.2	‘*That* self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it.	NA
dn1:3.22.3	But that’s not how *this* self attains ultimate extinguishment in this life.	The theorist has an experience of a deeper state of meditation, so they know that the first _jhāna_ cannot be the ultimate.
dn1:3.22.4	Why is that?	NA
dn1:3.22.5	Because the placing of the mind and the keeping it connected there are coarse.	_Jhānas_ are subtle states of refined consciousness in which nothing is coarse when compared to ordinary consciousness. Within each state, however, certain mental factors are coarse relative to others. A meditator proceeds through the _jhānas_ with the successive stilling of the relatively coarser factors in each state.
dn1:3.22.6	But when the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, this self enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. That’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in this life.’	NA

dn1:3.23.4	Why is that?	NA
dn1:3.23.5	Because the rapture and emotional elation there are coarse.	NA
dn1:3.23.6	But with the fading away of rapture, this self enters and remains in the third absorption, where it meditates with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, “Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss”.

dn1:3.24.4	Why is that?	NA
dn1:3.24.5	Because the mental partaking of that as ‘blissful’ is said to be coarse.	_Ābhoga_ (“partaking”) is unique in the early texts in this sense. The commentary says that after emerging from _jhāna_, one repeatedly partakes and attends to that bliss (for _ābhoga_ with _manasikāra_, see [mil5.1.1:8.3]()). Compare Patañjalī’s commentary on Yogasūtra 1.17: “_vitarka_ is the gross (_sthula_) partaking in the mental object, _vicāra_ is subtle”.
dn1:3.24.6	But giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, this self enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. That’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in this life.’	NA

More subtly, they also help deepen understanding and contemplation.

Their feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be.	Finally the process of dependent origination, which has been foreshadowed little by little, is brought to its ultimate conclusion.

Wherever they emerge they are caught and trapped in this very net.’	The title is explained with a vivid simile. The Buddha was a master of observation, and constantly drew from everyday experience to illustrate his teachings. The metaphor works on a surface level to illustrate how theorists are trapped.

dn2:0.2	The Fruits of the Ascetic Life	NA
dn2:1.0	1. A Discussion With the King’s Ministers	NA
dn2:1.1	So I have heard.	This sutta with its commentary was translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi in his *The Fruits of Recluseship*.
dn2:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Mango Grove of Jīvaka Komārabhacca, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.	This monastery belonged to the Buddha’s doctor, Jīvaka, who appears later in the sutta. His story is told in [pli-tv-kd8](), where we learn that he was raised by Prince Abhaya of Magadha, a Jain ([mn58]()) who was also interested in the teachings of  Pūraṇa Kassapa ([sn46.56]()). [mn55]() on eating meat is addressed to him.
dn2:1.3	Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the Komudī full moon on the fifteenth day of the fourth month—and King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, was sitting upstairs in the royal longhouse surrounded by his ministers.	The Komudī was an especially celebrated full moon on the last month of the rainy season (_kattikā_, October/November), when the skies were clear, the lotuses (_kumudā_) were in bloom, and the moon was in conjunction with the Pleiades, which gave the month its name.
dn2:1.4	Then Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, expressed this heartfelt sentiment,	_Ajātasattu_ (“one against whom no foe is born”) was the son of Bimbisāra and heir to the Haryaṅka dynasty of Magadha. In inscription and Jain tradition he is also called Kūṇika. Jain tradition holds that his mother was Cellaṇā daughter of Ceṭaka, a Licchavī ruler from Vesālī. This begs the question as to why Cellaṇā was said to be “of Videha”; perhaps he married a Videhan princess to forge an alliance with the Licchavī’s northern neighbors. In any case, this is more plausible than the Buddhist tradition that his mother was Kosalan.
dn2:1.5	“Oh, sirs, this moonlit night is so very delightful, so beautiful, so glorious, so lovely, so striking.	_Pāsādikā_ here does not mean “tranquil”; it is part of a stock list of terms meaning “beautiful, attractive” (eg. [dn4:13.7]()). | _Lakkhaññā_ is unique in early Pali. It is probably a synonym in the sense of “possessing remarkable features, striking”, rather than “auspicious”.
dn2:1.6	Now, what ascetic or brahmin might I pay homage to today, paying homage to whom my mind might find peace?”	The king seeks redemption through his own actions; it is not that the ascetic has any special power to bring peace to his mind. | The sutta is deliberately holding back the reason for the king’s distress. Compare [an5.50](), where the reason for King Muṇḍa seeking solace is stated up front.
dn2:2.1	When he had spoken, one of the king’s ministers said to him,	Though the king mentioned “ascetics and brahmins”, his advisers only recommend famous teachers of the ascetics (_samaṇa_). For a shorter survey of their doctrines, see [sn2.30]().
dn2:2.2	“Sire, Pūraṇa Kassapa leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life.	A little-known teacher of the inefficacy of action and consequence, Pūraṇa was poorly regarded even by his own students ([mn77:6.19]()). He is said to have advocated a doctrine of six classes of rebirth ([an6.57](); the same text reverentially mentions Makkhali Gosāla). | _Pūraṇa_ means “filling” (not _purāṇa_, “ancient”).
dn2:2.3	Let Your Majesty pay homage to him.	NA

dn2:2.5	But when he had spoken, the king kept silent.	The reason for the king’s silence is revealed later. The narrative is full of foreshadowing.

Founder of the Ājīvakas, who became the third largest ascetic movement after Buddhism and Jainism. None of their texts survive, but their teachings can be partially reconstructed from Buddhist and Jain sources. He practiced with Mahāvīra for six years before an acrimonious split, following which he developed his doctrine of hard determinism. _Makkhali_ denotes a kind of ascetic bearing a bamboo staff, so (like the similar appellations _nigaṇṭha_ and _samaṇa_) it indicates his affiliation. This being so, and noting that Buddhist Sanskrit texts spell his name as _gośālīputra_ etc., the second name (like _nātaputta_ and _gotama_) might indicate his clan. However, I can find no trace of such a clan, and both Jain and Buddhist tradition, albeit unreliably, say the name arose because he was born in a cowshed.

An agnostic, he is evidently the “wanderer Sañjaya” who was the first teacher of Sāriputta and Moggallāna before they left him to follow the Buddha ([pli-tv-kd1:23.1.1]()). His name is obscure. Sanskrit spells it _vairaṭṭīputra_, with several variations, but always with _ṭi_. The commentary says he was the “son of Belaṭṭha”; a Belaṭṭha Kaccāna is found selling sugar at [pli-tv-kd1:26.1.2](), supporting the idea that Belaṭṭha was a personal rather than clan name.

He is regarded as the 24th supreme leader of the Jains, although only he and his predecessor Pārśvanātha (not mentioned in the Pali) are historical. _Nigaṇṭha_ means “knotless” (i.e. without attachments). As a term for Jain ascetics it is also found in Jain literature. Nātaputta indicates his clan the Ñātikas (Sanskrit _jñātiputra_; Prākrit _nāyaputta_). The Pali tradition has confused _ñāti_  (“family”) with _nāṭa_ (“dancer”). Thus Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta means “the Jain monk of the Ñātika clan”. | Jainism and Buddhism are the only ancient _samaṇa_ movements to survive to the present day. The primary Jain teaching is the practice of non-violence while burning off past kamma by fervent austerities in order to reach omniscient liberation.

dn2:8.0	2. A Discussion With Jīvaka Komārabhacca	NA
dn2:8.1	Now at that time Jīvaka Komārabhacca was sitting silently not far from the king.	His absence of speech signifies his wisdom. The narrative creates a dramatic expectation through his stillness, an exquisitely Buddhist aesthetic choice.
dn2:8.2	Then the king said to him,	NA
dn2:8.3	“But my dear Jīvaka, why are you silent?”	NA
dn2:8.4	“Sire, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is staying in my mango grove together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.	According to the Vinaya, a monastery is normally offered to the “Saṅgha of the four quarters” and becomes their inalienable property. In the suttas this is not so clear, and it seems that Jīvaka still regarded the property as his. In practice there would have been a variety of arrangements, as there are today.
dn2:8.5	He has this good reputation:	NA
dn2:8.6	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	The first appearance of the famous _iti pi so_ formula. It is still recited in praise of the Buddha in Theravada communities.
dn2:8.7	Let Your Majesty pay homage to him.	NA
dn2:8.8	Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.”	NA
dn2:8.9	“Well then, my dear Jīvaka, have the elephants readied.”	NA
dn2:9.1	“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Jīvaka. He had around five hundred female elephants readied, in addition to the king’s bull elephant for riding. Then he informed the king,	NA
dn2:9.2	“The elephants are ready, sire.	NA
dn2:9.3	Please go at your convenience.”	NA
dn2:10.1	Then King Ajātasattu had women mounted on each of the five hundred female elephants, while he mounted his bull elephant. With attendants carrying torches, he set out in full royal pomp from Rājagaha to Jīvaka’s mango grove.	Indian kings were guarded by armed women inside the harem (Kauṭilya’s Arthaśāstra 1.21.1) and also while on hunt (Megasthenes’s Indica, via Strabo XV. i. 53–56). This passage may be the earliest evidence for this long-lasting practice. See also [dn23:15.4]().
dn2:10.2	But as he drew near the mango grove, the king became frightened, scared, his hair standing on end.	NA
dn2:10.3	He said to Jīvaka,	NA
dn2:10.4	“My dear Jīvaka, I hope you’re not deceiving me!	NA
dn2:10.5	I hope you’re not betraying me!	NA
dn2:10.6	I hope you’re not turning me over to my enemies!	NA
dn2:10.7	For how on earth can there be no sound of coughing or clearing throats or any noise in such a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants?”	The silence of the Buddha’s assembly is often contrasted with the rowdy gatherings of other ascetics, for example that of Poṭṭhapāda at [dn9:3.1]().
dn2:10.8	“Do not fear, great king, do not fear!	NA
dn2:10.9	I am not deceiving you,	NA
dn2:10.10	or betraying you,	NA
dn2:10.11	or turning you over to your enemies.	NA
dn2:10.12	Go forward, great king, go forward! Those are lamps shining in the pavilion.”	This is a double pun. _Dīpa_ means “lamp” or “island, refuge”, while _jhāyati_ means “burning” or “meditating”. So it could be rendered, “those are saviors meditating in the pavilion”. _Jhāyati_ is the verb form of _jhāna_ (“absorption”), which is the central practice of meditation described below.
dn2:11.0	3. The Question About the Fruits of the Ascetic Life	NA
dn2:11.1	Then King Ajātasattu rode on the elephant as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the pavilion door on foot, where he asked Jīvaka,	NA
dn2:11.2	“But my dear Jīvaka, where is the Buddha?”	The Buddha looked like any other monk. But this also reveals Ajātasattu’s spiritual blindness.
dn2:11.3	“That is the Buddha, great king, that is the Buddha!	NA
dn2:11.4	He’s sitting against the central column facing east, in front of the Saṅgha of mendicants.”	NA
dn2:12.1	Then the king went up to the Buddha and stood to one side.	He has not yet gained faith, so does not bow.
dn2:12.2	He looked around the Saṅgha of mendicants, who were so very silent, like a still, clear lake, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment,	NA
dn2:12.3	“May my son, Prince Udāyibhadda, be blessed with such peace as the Saṅgha of mendicants now enjoys!”	NA
dn2:12.4	“Has your mind gone to one you love, great king?”	The Buddha, though fully aware of Ajātasattu’s crimes, responds to him with compassion.
dn2:12.5	“I love my son, sir, Prince Udāyibhadda.	NA
dn2:12.6	May he be blessed with such peace as the Saṅgha of mendicants now enjoys!”	NA
dn2:13.1	Then the king bowed to the Buddha, raised his joined palms toward the Saṅgha, and sat down to one side.	NA
dn2:13.2	He said to the Buddha,	NA
dn2:13.3	“Sir, I’d like to ask you about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”	NA
dn2:13.4	NA	NA
dn2:13.5	“Ask what you wish, great king.”	NA
dn2:14.1	“Sir, there are many different professional fields.	Most translators render _sippa_ as “craft”. However, the basic meaning of “craft” is skill in doing or making things. What is meant here is a paid occupation regardless of whether it involves making things, i.e. “profession”.
dn2:14.2	These include elephant riders, cavalry, charioteers, archers, bannermen, adjutants, food servers, warrior-chiefs, princes, chargers, great warriors, heroes, leather-clad soldiers, and sons of bondservants.	These are the professions on Ajātasattu’s mind. The first set of these is defined as branches of the military at [an7.67]().
dn2:14.3	They also include bakers, barbers, bathroom attendants, cooks, garland-makers, dyers, weavers, basket-makers, potters, accountants, finger-talliers, or those following any similar professions. All these live off the fruits of their profession which are apparent in this very life.	The question pertains to right livelihood, the fifth factor of the noble eightfold path.
dn2:14.4	With that they make themselves happy and pleased. They make their parents, their children and partners, and their friends and colleagues happy and pleased. And they establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven.	The purpose of right livelihood is to bring happiness in this life and the next.
dn2:14.5	Sir, can you point out a fruit of the ascetic life that’s likewise apparent in this very life?”	Ajātasattu’s question only pertains to happiness in this life. He would have seen ascetics living hard and austere lives for the sake of future happiness.
dn2:15.1	“Great king, do you recall having asked this question of other ascetics and brahmins?”	The term “Great King” (_mahārāja_) identifies Ajātasattu as the hereditary monarch of a large realm, in contrast with the multiple elected “rulers” of the aristocratic republics such as Vajji and Sakya.
dn2:15.2	“I do, sir.”	NA
dn2:15.3	“If you wouldn’t mind, great king, tell me how they answered.”	As in [dn1:1.4.2](), the Buddha begins by asking to hear what others have said.
dn2:15.4	“It’s no trouble when someone such as the Blessed One is sitting here.”	NA
dn2:15.5	“Well, speak then, great king.”	NA
dn2:16.0	3.1. The Doctrine of Pūraṇa Kassapa	NA
dn2:16.1	“This one time, sir, I approached Pūraṇa Kassapa and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
dn2:16.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question.	As with his meeting with the Buddha, Ajātasattu is respectful but not reverential.
dn2:16.3	NA	NA
dn2:16.4	NA	NA
dn2:16.5	NA	NA
dn2:16.6	NA	NA
dn2:17.1	He said to me:	NA
dn2:17.2	‘Great king, the one who acts does nothing wrong when they punish, mutilate, torture, aggrieve, oppress, intimidate, or when they encourage others to do the same. They do nothing wrong when they kill, steal, break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, commit adultery, and lie. If you were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razor-edged chakram, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil.	This is a denial of the doctrine of kamma. While his doctrine appears to be morally nihilistic, it seems unlikely this was Pūraṇa Kassapa’s full teaching. He may have subscribed to hard determinism, so that we have no choice in what we do. He may also have believed that we should keep moral rules as a social contract, but that this had no effect on the afterlife. | In such contexts, _kar-_ means “punish, inflict” ([mn129:29.2]()).
dn2:17.3	If you were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing, mutilating, and torturing, and encouraging others to do the same, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil.	NA
dn2:17.4	If you were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and sacrificing and encouraging others to do the same, no merit comes of that, and no outcome of merit.	NA
dn2:17.5	In giving, self-control, restraint, and truthfulness there is no merit or outcome of merit.’	NA
dn2:18.1	And so, when I asked Pūraṇa Kassapa about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with the doctrine of inaction.	The unsatisfying nature of the answers given by these teachers is also emphasized at [mn36:48.4]().
dn2:18.2	It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango.	Breadfruit is a starchy, fibrous fruit that is, needless to say, very different from a mango.
dn2:18.3	NA	NA
dn2:18.4	I thought:	NA
dn2:18.5	‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’	Kings had a duty to protect all religions in their realm, even those with such extreme views.
dn2:18.6	So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Pūraṇa Kassapa.	NA
dn2:18.7	I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left.	The commentary takes _uggahita_ and _nikkujjita_ as synonyms. Elsewhere, however, _nikkujjati_ always means “overturns”.
dn2:19.0	3.2. The Doctrine of the Bamboo-staffed Ascetic Gosāla	NA
dn2:19.1	This one time, sir, I approached the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
dn2:19.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question.	NA
dn2:19.3	NA	NA
dn2:19.4	NA	NA
dn2:20.1	He said:	NA
dn2:20.2	‘Great king, there is no cause or reason for the corruption of sentient beings. Sentient beings are corrupted without cause or reason.	This denies the principle of causality and the efficacy of action. The fatalistic teachings of the Ājīvikas led to them becoming popular as prognosticators.
dn2:20.3	There’s no cause or reason for the purification of sentient beings.	NA
dn2:20.4	Sentient beings are purified without cause or reason.	NA
dn2:20.5	One does not act of one’s own volition, one does not act of another’s volition, one does not act from a person’s volition. There is no power, no energy, no human strength or vigor.	The first three phrases, with the Magadhan nominative singular in _-e_, are unique to this passage. In [an6.38:1.4]() we find the regular nominative form in _-o_. They are omitted in the otherwise parallel passage at [mn76:13.6]().
dn2:20.6	All sentient beings, all living creatures, all beings, all souls lack control, power, and energy. Molded by destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of rebirth.	Everything is destined by circumstances beyond our control.
dn2:20.7	There are 1.4 million main wombs, and 6,000, and 600. There are 500 deeds, and five, and three. There are deeds and half-deeds. There are 62 paths, 62 sub-eons, six classes of rebirth, and eight stages in a person’s life. There are 4,900 Ājīvaka ascetics, 4,900 wanderers, and 4,900 naked ascetics. There are 2,000 faculties, 3,000 hells, and 36 realms of dust. There are seven percipient embryos, seven non-percipient embryos, and seven knotless embryos. There are seven gods, seven humans, and seven goblins. There are seven lakes, seven rivers, 700 rivers, seven cliffs, and 700 cliffs. There are seven dreams and 700 dreams. There are 8.4 million great eons through which the foolish and the astute transmigrate before making an end of suffering.	This strange cosmology lays out the course through which souls must proceed before their final liberation. | Since _nāgāvāsa_ (“abode of dragons”) occurs in a list of kinds of ascetics, I think it is a corruption of _naggāvāsa_ (“abode of naked ascetics”) and translate accordingly. Each of these refers to the number of times one will be reborn in each of these states. | _Nigaṇṭhigabbha_ could mean “rebirth as a Jain ascetic” but here we have moved on from listing ascetics, and I think it refers to one who is born free of attachments. Compare the Buddhist idea of “four kinds of conception” ([dn33:1.11.175]()). | _Pavuṭā_ is explained by the commentary as _gaṇṭhikā_ (“knot”). However, Rig Veda 9.54.2 mentions “seven rivers” (_sapta pravata_) that flow from heaven, preceded in the same verse by the mention of _sarā_ (“lakes”). This detail suggests a Vedic influence. The “seven rivers” are normally called _sapta sindhu_ (Rig Veda 1.35.8) in reference to the river systems of north-west India and Pakistan (cf. Punjab, “five rivers”).
dn2:20.8	And here there is no such thing as this: “By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or spiritual life I shall force unripened deeds to bear their fruit, or eliminate old deeds by experiencing their results little by little,” for that cannot be.	To “force unripened deeds to bear their fruit” by means of “fervent austerity” (_tapas_) is a Jain practice, whereas to “eliminate old deeds by experiencing their results little by little” is distinguished from the Jain view at [an3.74]().
dn2:20.9	Pleasure and pain are allotted. Transmigration lasts only for a limited period, so there’s no increase or decrease, no getting better or worse.	NA
dn2:20.10	It’s like how, when you toss a ball of string, it rolls away unraveling.	NA
dn2:20.11	In the same way, after transmigrating the foolish and the astute will make an end of suffering.’	NA
dn2:21.1	And so, when I asked the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with the doctrine of purification through transmigration.	“Purification through transmigration” is _saṁsārasuddhi_.
dn2:21.2	It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango.	NA

dn2:23.1	He said:	NA
dn2:23.2	‘Great king, there is no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.	The denial of “mother and father” is usually interpreted as the denial of moral duty towards one’s parents. However, I think it is a doctrine of conception which denies that a child is created by the mother and father. Rather, the child is produced by the four elements, with parents as mere instigators and incubators.
dn2:23.3	This person is made up of the four principal states. When they die, the earth in their body merges and coalesces with the substance of earth. The water in their body merges and coalesces with the substance of water. The fire in their body merges and coalesces with the substance of fire. The air in their body merges and coalesces with the substance of air. The faculties are transferred to space.	This is a materialist analysis of the person. | The word _kāya_ (“substance”) is central to Jainism. Ācārāṅgasūtra 8.1.11 speaks of the “substances” of earth, water, fire, and air as being imbued with life so one should avoid damaging them. | The Buddha’s use of _mahābhūtā_ (“principal states”) responds to Yājñavalkya’s core teaching at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12, where the several “states” or “real entities” (_bhūtā_)—namely the diverse manifestations of creation—arise from and dissolve into the “principal state” (_mahābhūta_) of the Self, singular and infinite. For the Buddha, the “principal states” are themselves plural, as there is no underlying singular reality. Later Sanskrit literature lists the “five states” (_pañcabhūta_) as earth, water, fire, air, and space.

dn2:26.2	‘Great king, these seven substances are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar.	This is a reductive atomism. It argues that since all things are made of the seven fundamental substances (_kāya_), higher-order entities have no significance.
dn2:26.3	They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain to each other.	NA
dn2:26.4	What seven?	NA
dn2:26.5	The substances of earth, water, fire, air; pleasure, pain, and the soul is the seventh.	Unlike the materialism of Ajita Kesakambala, one of the basic substances is the soul. He uses _jīva_, the same term used by the Jains, rather than _attā_ as preferred by the brahmins. Likewise, the Jains held a similar doctrine of six uncreated and eternal “substances” (_kāya_ or _dravya_): soul, the media for motion and rest, matter, space, and time.
dn2:26.6	These seven substances are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar.	NA
dn2:26.7	They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain to each other.	NA

dn2:29.4	It’s when a Jain ascetic is restrained in all that is to be restrained, is bridled in all that is to be restrained, has shaken off evil in all that is to be restrained, and is curbed in all that is to be restrained.	At Isibhāsiyāiṁ 29.19, Vardhamāna (Mahāvīra) teaches that a sage is _savva-vārīhiṁ vārie_, “restrained in all restraints”, which clearly parallels our current passage. In that passage, “restraint” refers to stopping the influx of defilements through the five senses, neither delighting in the pleasant nor loathing the unpleasant. Similarly we find _vāriya-savva-vāri_ in the commentary to Sūyagaḍa 1.6.28. | Read _vāri_ as future passive participle (cf. Sanskrit _vārya_). | _Dhuta_ in the sense “shaken off (evil by means of ascetic practices)” is a characteristic Jain term. | For _sabbavāriphuṭo_ compare _ophuṭo_ at [mn99:15.5]().

dn2:29.7	they’re called a knotless one who is self-realized, self-controlled, and steadfast.’	NA
dn2:30.1	And so, when I asked the Jain Ñātika about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with the fourfold constraint.	NA
dn2:30.2	It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango.	NA
dn2:30.3	NA	NA
dn2:30.4	I thought:	NA
dn2:30.5	‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’	NA
dn2:30.6	So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the Jain Ñātika.	NA
dn2:30.7	I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left.	NA
dn2:31.0	3.6. The Doctrine of Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta	NA
dn2:31.1	This one time, sir, I approached Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
dn2:31.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question.	NA
dn2:31.3	NA	NA
dn2:31.4	NA	NA
dn2:32.1	He said:	NA
dn2:32.2	‘Suppose you were to ask me whether there is another world. If I believed that to be the case, I would say so.	NA
dn2:32.3	But I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so.	This places him among the “endless flip-floppers” of [dn1:2.23.1](). However, we do not know on which of the four grounds he justified his evasiveness.
dn2:32.4	Suppose you were to ask me whether there is no other world …	NA
dn2:32.5	whether there both is and is not another world …	NA
dn2:32.6	whether there neither is nor is not another world …	NA
dn2:32.7	whether there are beings who are reborn spontaneously …	NA
dn2:32.8	whether there are no beings who are reborn spontaneously …	NA
dn2:32.9	whether there both are and are not beings who are reborn spontaneously …	NA
dn2:32.10	whether there neither are nor are not beings who are reborn spontaneously …	NA
dn2:32.11	whether there is fruit and result of good and bad deeds …	NA
dn2:32.12	whether there is no fruit and result of good and bad deeds …	NA
dn2:32.13	whether there both is and is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds …	NA
dn2:32.14	whether there neither is nor is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds …	NA
dn2:32.15	whether a realized one still exists after death …	NA
dn2:32.16	whether a realized one no longer exists after death …	NA
dn2:32.17	whether a realized one both still exists and no longer exists after death …	NA
dn2:32.18	whether a realized one neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death. If I believed that to be the case, I would say so.	NA
dn2:32.19	But I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so.’	NA
dn2:33.1	And so, when I asked Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with flip-flopping.	NA
dn2:33.2	It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango.	NA
dn2:33.3	NA	NA
dn2:33.4	I thought:	NA
dn2:33.5	‘This is the most foolish and stupid of all these ascetics and brahmins!	NA
dn2:33.6	How on earth can he answer with flip-flopping when asked about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life?’	NA
dn2:33.7	I thought:	NA
dn2:33.8	‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’	NA
dn2:33.9	So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta.	NA
dn2:33.10	I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left.	NA
dn2:34.0.1	4. The Fruits of the Ascetic Life	NA
dn2:34.0.2	4.1. The First Fruit of the Ascetic Life	NA
dn2:34.1	And so I ask the Buddha:	NA
dn2:34.2	Sir, there are many different professional fields.	NA
dn2:34.3	These include elephant riders, cavalry, charioteers, archers, bannermen, adjutants, food servers, warrior-chiefs, princes, chargers, great warriors, heroes, leather-clad soldiers, and sons of bondservants.	NA
dn2:34.4	They also include bakers, barbers, bathroom attendants, cooks, garland-makers, dyers, weavers, basket-makers, potters, accountants, finger-talliers, or those following any similar professions. All these live off the fruits of their profession which are apparent in this very life.	NA
dn2:34.5	With that they make themselves happy and pleased. They make their parents, their children and partners, and their friends and colleagues happy and pleased. And they establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven.	NA
dn2:34.6	Sir, can you point out a fruit of the ascetic life that’s likewise apparent in this very life?”	NA
dn2:34.7	“I can, great king.	The Buddha answers directly, with confidence. This whole passage is a masterclass in effective dialogue.
dn2:34.8	Well then, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.	He engages Ajātasattu rather than lecturing him.
dn2:35.1	What do you think, great king?	NA
dn2:35.2	Suppose you had a person who was a bondservant, a worker. They get up before you and go to bed after you, and are obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely, and gazing up at your face.	See _mukhaṁ ullokentī_ at [mn79]() and [sn56.39]().
dn2:35.3	They’d think:	NA
dn2:35.4	‘The outcome and result of good deeds is just so incredible, so amazing!	Even a servant believed in the doctrine of kamma.
dn2:35.5	For this King Ajātasattu is a human being, and so am I.	There is no question of the divinity of kings.
dn2:35.6	Yet he amuses himself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation as if he were a god.	NA
dn2:35.7	Whereas I’m his bondservant, his worker. I get up before him and go to bed after him, and am obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely, and gazing up at his face.	NA
dn2:35.8	I really should do good deeds.	The doctrine of kamma leads to living a better life, not stewing in resentment.
dn2:35.9	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	[pli-tv-kd1:47.1.1]() penalizes the ordination of bondservants or slaves, despite the fact that Ajātasattu’s father, Bimbisāra, had ordered that no action was to be taken against any bondservant who ordained under the Buddha.
dn2:35.10	After some time, that is what they do.	NA
dn2:35.11	Having gone forth they’d live restrained in body, speech, and mind, living content with nothing more than food and clothes, delighting in seclusion.	Here the Buddha foreshadows the larger themes detailed later.
dn2:35.12	And suppose your men were to report all this to you.	NA
dn2:35.13	NA	NA
dn2:35.14	NA	NA
dn2:35.15	NA	NA
dn2:35.16	Would you say to them:	NA
dn2:35.17	‘Bring that person to me! Let them once more be my bondservant, my worker’?”	NA
dn2:36.1	“No, sir.	NA
dn2:36.2	Rather, I would bow to them, rise in their presence, and offer them a seat. I’d invite them to accept robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And I’d organize their lawful guarding and protection.”	Even under a king so compromised as Ajātasattu,  a runaway slave who has ordained is rewarded not punished.
dn2:36.3	“What do you think, great king?	NA
dn2:36.4	If this is so, is there a fruit of the ascetic life apparent in the present life or not?”	In contrast with the former teachers, the Buddha gives a clear answer in terms that Ajātasattu would understand.
dn2:36.5	“Clearly, sir, there is.”	The Buddha establishes common ground with the king before venturing into deeper waters.
dn2:36.6	“This is the first fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in this very life, which I point out to you.”	NA
dn2:37.0	4.2. The Second Fruit of the Ascetic Life	NA
dn2:37.1	“But sir, can you point out another fruit of the ascetic life that’s likewise apparent in this very life?”	By starting with a very basic and obvious fruit, the Buddha stimulates Ajātasattu to seek a deeper answer.
dn2:37.2	“I can, great king.	NA
dn2:37.3	Well then, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.	NA
dn2:37.4	What do you think, great king?	NA
dn2:37.5	Suppose you had a person who was a farmer, a householder, a hard worker, someone who builds up their capital.	_Karakārako rāsivaḍḍhako_ is a unique phrase. For _karakāraka_, compare [mn57:2.3](), where a naked ascetic “does a hard thing”. _Rāsi_ means “heap” (of grain or wealth according to the commentary).
dn2:37.6	They’d think:	NA
dn2:37.7	‘The outcome and result of good deeds is just so incredible, so amazing!	NA
dn2:37.8	For this King Ajātasattu is a human being, and so am I.	NA
dn2:37.9	Yet he amuses himself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation as if he were a god.	NA
dn2:37.10	Whereas I’m a farmer, a householder, a hard worker, someone who builds up their capital.	NA
dn2:37.11	I really should do good deeds.	NA
dn2:37.12	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	NA
dn2:37.13	After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They’d shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	The bonded servant had no wealth or family to renounce, but the worker does.
dn2:37.14	Having gone forth they’d live restrained in body, speech, and mind, living content with nothing more than food and clothes, delighting in seclusion.	NA
dn2:37.15	And suppose your men were to report all this to you.	NA
dn2:37.16	NA	NA
dn2:37.17	NA	NA
dn2:37.18	NA	NA
dn2:37.19	Would you say to them:	NA
dn2:37.20	‘Bring that person to me! Let them once more be a farmer, a householder, a hard worker, someone who builds up their capital’?”	NA
dn2:38.1	“No, sir.	NA
dn2:38.2	Rather, I would bow to them, rise in their presence, and offer them a seat. I’d invite them to accept robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And I’d organize their lawful guarding and protection.”	NA
dn2:38.3	“What do you think, great king?	NA
dn2:38.4	If this is so, is there a fruit of the ascetic life apparent in the present life or not?”	NA
dn2:38.5	“Clearly, sir, there is.”	NA
dn2:38.6	“This is the second fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in this very life, which I point out to you.”	NA
dn2:39.0	4.3. The Finer Fruits of the Ascetic Life	NA
dn2:39.1	“But sir, can you point out a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in this very life which is better and finer than these?”	NA
dn2:39.2	“I can, great king.	NA
dn2:39.3	Well then, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	Having established the king’s genuine interest and understanding, the Buddha prepares him for the long discourse to follow.
dn2:39.4	“Yes, sir,” replied the king.	NA
dn2:39.5	The Buddha said this:	NA
dn2:40.1	“Consider when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.	This is the start of the teaching on the Gradual Training, encompassing ethics (_sīla_), meditation (_samādhi_), and wisdom (_paññā_). Only the ethics portion appeared in the Brahmajālasutta, while all three are restated in all the remaining suttas of this chapter, although in truncated form. | It is exceedingly rare for a Buddha to appear.
dn2:40.2	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	The Buddha realizes the truth by his own understanding, not through divine intervention or other metaphysical means.
dn2:40.3	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	It is good when first heard, when practicing, and when one has realized the fruits.
dn2:41.1	A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in a good family.	The word “householder” (_gahapati_) informally refers to any lay person, but more specifically indicates someone who owns a house, i.e. a person of standing. The renunciate life is not just for slaves or workers wishing to escape their station.
dn2:41.2	They gain faith in the Realized One	NA
dn2:41.3	and reflect:	NA
dn2:41.4	‘Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide open.	NA
dn2:41.5	It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	NA
dn2:41.6	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	NA
dn2:41.7	After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
dn2:42.1	Once they’ve gone forth, they live restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. They act skillfully by body and speech. They’re purified in livelihood and accomplished in ethical conduct. They guard the sense doors, have mindfulness and situational awareness, and are content.	This serves as a table of contents for the teachings to come. | Nowadays, the “monastic code” (_pātimokkha_) means the list of rules for monks and nuns found in the Vinayapiṭaka. In the early texts, however, it has three main meanings. Sometimes it does refer to the list of rules, as at [an10.36:1.6](). Here it refers to the code of conduct that follows, which is a non-legalistic set of guidelines that preceded the Vinayapiṭaka. At [dn14:3.28.1]() it refers to the verses summarizing monastic conduct known as the “Ovāda Pātimokkha”.

dn2:43.0.2	4.3.1.1. The Shorter Section on Ethics	NA
dn2:43.1	And how, great king, is a mendicant accomplished in ethics?	NA
dn2:43.2	It’s when a mendicant gives up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings.	While the precept includes any living creature, if a monastic murders a human being they are immediately and permanently expelled.
dn2:43.3	This pertains to their ethics.	NA
dn2:43.4	They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving.	To steal anything of substantial value is an expulsion offence.

dn2:44.1	They give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and dependable, and don’t trick the world with their words.	While any form of lying is forbidden, if a monastic falsely claims states of enlightenment or deep meditation they are expelled.
dn2:44.2	This pertains to their ethics.	NA
dn2:44.3	They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.	NA

dn2:63.4	When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves.	This is the first step in the Buddha’s answer to Ajātasattu.

dn2:64.0.2	4.3.2.1. Sense Restraint	NA
dn2:64.1	And how does a mendicant guard the sense doors?	Here begins the series of practices that build on moral fundamentals to lay the groundwork for meditation.
dn2:64.2	When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.	NA
dn2:64.3	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.	It is not that one cannot see things, but that, mindful of its effect, one avoids unnecessary stimulation. | “Covetousness and bitterness” (_abhijjhā domanassā_) are the strong forms of desire and aversion caused by lack of restraint.

dn2:64.9	If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint.	NA
dn2:64.10	When they have this noble sense restraint, they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves.	Their happiness deepens, as they see that not only their actions but also their mind is becoming free of anything unwholesome.
dn2:64.11	That’s how a mendicant guards the sense doors.	NA
dn2:65.0	4.3.2.2. Mindfulness and Situational Awareness	NA
dn2:65.1	And how does a mendicant have mindfulness and situational awareness?	Situational awareness is a psychological term popularized in the 1990s. It has to do with the perception of environmental phenomena and the comprehension of their meaning, which is very close to the sense of the Pali term _sampajañña_.
dn2:65.2	It’s when a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.	These acts describe the daily life of  a mendicant: going into the village for alms, at which time there are many distracting sights. Then they return, eat their meal, and spend their day in meditation.
dn2:65.3	That’s how a mendicant has mindfulness and situational awareness.	NA
dn2:66.0	4.3.2.3. Contentment	NA
dn2:66.1	And how is a mendicant content?	NA
dn2:66.2	It’s when a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.	A Buddhist monk has three robes: a lower robe (sabong or sarong), an upper robe, and an outer cloak.
dn2:66.3	They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden.	NA
dn2:66.4	In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.	NA
dn2:66.5	That’s how a mendicant is content.	NA
dn2:67.0	4.3.2.4. Giving Up the Hindrances	NA
dn2:67.1	When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, this noble sense restraint, this noble mindfulness and situational awareness, and this noble contentment,	These are the prerequisite conditions for embarking on deep meditation.
dn2:67.2	they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.	NA
dn2:67.3	After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in their presence.	For _parimukha_ (“in their presence”) we find _pratimukha_ in Sanskrit, which can mean “presence” or the reflection of the face. Late canonical Pali explains _parimukha_ as “the tip of the nose or the reflection of the face (_mukhanimitta_)”. _Parimukha_ in Sanskrit is rare, but it appears in Pāṇini 4.4.29, which the commentary illustrates with the example of a servant “in the presence” of their master (cp. [sn47.8]()). So it seems the sense is “before the face” or more generally “in the presence”. | To “establish mindfulness” (_satiṁ upaṭṭhapetvā_) is literally to “do satipaṭṭhāna”.
dn2:68.1	Giving up covetousness for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness.	Covetousness (_abhijjha_) has been curbed by sense restraint, and now is fully abandoned.
dn2:68.2	Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of sympathy for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will.	Likewise ill will (_byāpādapadosa_), which was called _domanassa_ in the formula for sense restraint.
dn2:68.3	Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness.	“Mindfulness and situational awareness” has a prominent role in abandoning dullness.
dn2:68.4	Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.	Restlessness hankers for the future and is countered by contentment. Remorse digs up the past and is countered by ethical purity.
dn2:68.5	Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.	The meditator set out on their path after gaining faith in the Buddha.
dn2:69.1	Suppose a man who has gotten into debt were to apply himself to work,	The happiness of meditation is hard to understand without practicing, so the Buddha gives a series of five similes to illustrate in terms Ajātasattu would understand.

dn2:73.4	NA	NA
dn2:73.5	NA	NA
dn2:73.6	they’d be filled with joy and happiness.	NA
dn2:74.1	In the same way, as long as these five hindrances are not given up inside themselves, a mendicant regards them thus as a debt, a disease, a prison, slavery, and a desert crossing.	The five hindrances remain a pillar of meditation teaching. The root sense means to “obstruct” but also to “obscure, darken, veil”.
dn2:74.2	But when these five hindrances are given up inside themselves, a mendicant regards this as freedom from debt, good health, release from prison, emancipation, and a place of sanctuary at last.	Each simile illustrates not the happiness of acquisition, but of letting go.
dn2:74.3	NA	NA
dn2:74.4	Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed.	The Buddha did not emphasize technical details of technique, but the emotional wholeness and joy that leads to deep meditation.
dn2:75.0	4.3.2.5. First Absorption	NA
dn2:75.1	Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	_Jhāna_ is a state of “elevated consciousness” (_adhicitta_), so all the terms have an elevated sense. | The plural form indicates that “sensual pleasures” includes sense experience, which the meditator can turn away from since they no longer have any desire for it. | The “unskillful qualities” are the five hindrances. | The “rapture and bliss born of seclusion” is the happiness of abandoning the hindrances and freedom from sense impingement. | “Placing the mind and keeping it connected” (_vitakka_, _vicāra_) uses terms that mean “thought” in coarse consciousness, but which in “elevated consciousness” refer to the subtle function of applying the mind to the meditation.
dn2:75.2	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.	As a meditator proceeds, their subjective experience of the “body” evolves from tactile sense impressions (_phoṭṭhabba_), to the interior mental experience of bliss and light (_manomayakāya_), to the direct personal realization of highest truth ([mn70:23.2](): _kāyena ceva paramasaccaṁ sacchikaroti_).
dn2:76.1	It’s like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out.	The kneading is the “placing the mind and keeping it connected”, the water is bliss, while the lack of leaking speaks to the contained interiority of the experience. | Here as elsewhere, water is used as a metaphor for the mind in absorption. Compare Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.32: “He becomes like water, one, the seer without duality; this is the world of Brahmā.”
dn2:76.2	In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.	NA
dn2:76.3	This, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones.	The Buddha has answered Ajātasattu’s question. But he is far from finished.
dn2:77.0	4.3.2.6. Second Absorption	NA
dn2:77.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without applying the mind and keeping it connected.	Each _jhāna_ begins as the least refined aspect of the previous _jhāna_ ends. This is not consciously directed, but describes the natural process of settling. The meditator is now fully confident and no longer needs to apply their mind: it is simply still and fully unified.
dn2:77.2	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion.	NA
dn2:78.1	It’s like a deep lake fed by spring water. There’s no inlet to the east, west, north, or south, and the heavens would not properly bestow showers from time to time.	The simile emphasizes the water as bliss, while the lack of inflow expresses containment and unification.
dn2:78.2	But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads throughout the lake. There’s no part of the lake that’s not spread through with cool water.	The water welling up is the rapture, which is the uplifting emotional response to the experience of bliss.
dn2:78.3	In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion.	NA
dn2:78.4	This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones.	NA
dn2:79.0	4.3.2.7. Third Absorption	NA
dn2:79.1	Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	The emotional response to bliss matures from the subtle thrill of rapture to the poise of equanimity. Mindfulness is present in all states of deep meditation, but with equanimity it becomes prominent.
dn2:79.2	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture.	NA
dn2:80.1	It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. From the tip to the root they’re drenched, steeped, filled, and soaked with cool water. There’s no part of them that’s not soaked with cool water.	The meditator is utterly immersed in stillness and bliss.
dn2:80.2	In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture.	NA
dn2:80.3	This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones.	NA
dn2:81.0	4.3.2.8. Fourth Absorption	NA
dn2:81.1	Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	The emotional poise of equanimity leads to the feeling of pleasure settling into the more subtle neutral feeling. Pain and sadness have been abandoned long before, but are emphasized here as they are subtle counterpart of pleasure.
dn2:81.2	They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind.	The equanimity of the fourth _jhāna_ is not dullness and indifference, but a brilliant and radiant awareness.
dn2:82.1	It’s like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread over with white cloth.	The white cloth is the purity and brightness of equanimity. The commentary explains this as a person who has just got out of a bath and sits perfectly dry and content.
dn2:82.2	In the same way, they sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind.	NA
dn2:82.3	This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones.	NA
dn2:83.0.1	4.3.3. The Eight Knowledges	NA
dn2:83.0.2	4.3.3.1. Knowledge and Vision	NA
dn2:83.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they project it and extend it toward knowledge and vision.	Of the eight kinds of knowledge and vision, only the last is considered indispensable. The fourth _jhāna_ is the ideal basis for developing higher knowledges, although elsewhere the canon shows that even the first _jhāna_ can be a basis for liberating insight. Without _jhāna_, however, the eightfold path is incomplete and liberating insight is impossible. | The verb _abhininnāmeti_ (“extend”) indicates that the meditator comes out of full immersion like a tortoise sticking out its limbs ([sn35.240:1.7]()).
dn2:83.2	They understand:	NA
dn2:83.3	‘This body of mine is formed. It’s made up of the four principal states, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction.	This is the “coarse” (_olārika_) body. Note that its generation by mother and father contradicts the doctrine of Ajita Kesakambala. The obvious impermanence of the body invites the tempting but fallacious notion that the mind or soul is permanent, which is dispelled by deeper insight.
dn2:83.4	And this consciousness of mine is attached to it, tied to it.’	This distinction should not be mistaken for mind-body dualism. These are not fundamental substances but experiences of a meditator.
dn2:84.1	Suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed with all good qualities.	NA
dn2:84.2	And it was strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown.	Strung gems were loved in India from the time in the Harappan civilization, millennia before the Buddha.
dn2:84.3	And someone with clear eyes were to take it in their hand and check it:	NA
dn2:84.4	‘This beryl gem is naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed with all good qualities.	NA
dn2:84.5	And it’s strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown.’	NA
dn2:84.6	In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they project it and extend it toward knowledge and vision.	This form of “knowledge and vision” is rarely mentioned, being found only here, at [dn10:2.21.3](), and at [mn77:29.2](). The next realization, the “mind-made body” is also only found in these three suttas. | The Mahāsaṅgīti edition adds the spurious title _vipassanāñāṇa_ (“insight knowledge”) to this section. This term does not appear anywhere in the Pali canon.

dn2:85.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they project it and extend it toward the creation of a mind-made body.	The “mind-made body” is the interior mental representation of the physical body. In ordinary consciousness it is proprioception, which here is enhanced by the power of meditation. The higher powers in Buddhism are regarded as extensions and evolutions of aspects of ordinary experience, not as metaphysical realities separate from the world of mundane experience.
dn2:85.2	From this body they create another body—formed, mind-made, whole in its major and minor limbs, not deficient in any faculty.	This is similar to the experience of the “astral body” described by modern spiritualists. Note that it is still “physical” (_rūpī_) even though it is mind-made. This is the subtle (_sukhuma_) body, which is an energetic experience of physical properties by the mind.

dn2:87.0	4.3.3.3. Psychic Powers	NA
dn2:87.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they project it and extend it toward psychic power.	Here begin the “six direct knowledges” (_chaḷabhiññā_), which are found commonly throughout the early texts. | “Psychic powers” (_iddhi_) were much cultivated in the Buddha’s day, but the means to acquire them varied: devotion to a god, brutal penances, or magic rituals. The Buddha taught that the mind developed in _samādhi_ was capable of things that are normally incomprehensible.
dn2:87.2	They wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the realm of divinity.	Only a few of these are attested as events in the early texts. The most common is the ability to disappear and reappear, exhibited by the Buddha ([an8.30:2.1]()), some disciples ([mn37:6.1]()), and deities ([mn67:8.1]()).
dn2:88.1	Suppose a deft potter or their apprentice had some well-prepared clay. They could produce any kind of pot that they like.	These similes hark back to the descriptions of the purified mind as pliable and workable.
dn2:88.2	Or suppose a deft ivory-carver or their apprentice had some well-prepared ivory. They could produce any kind of ivory item that they like.	NA
dn2:88.3	Or suppose a deft goldsmith or their apprentice had some well-prepared gold. They could produce any kind of gold item that they like.	This simile is extended in detail at [an3.101]().

dn2:89.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they project it and extend it toward clairaudience.	“Clairaudience” is a literal rendition of _dibbasota_. The root sense of _dibba_ is to “shine” like the bright sky or a divine being. The senses of clarity and divinity are both present.
dn2:89.2	With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and heavenly, whether near or far.	The Buddha occasionally used this ability for teaching, as at [mn75:6.1]().
dn2:90.1	Suppose there was a person traveling along the road. They’d hear the sound of drums, clay drums, horns, kettledrums, and tom-toms. They’d think: ‘That’s the sound of drums,’ and ‘that’s the sound of clay drums,’ and ‘that’s the sound of horns, kettledrums, and tom-toms.’	The simile emphasizes the clarity and distinctness of the sounds. Compare [an4.114](): _bheripaṇavasaṅkhatiṇavaninnādasaddānaṁ_.

dn2:91.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they project it and extend it toward comprehending the minds of others.	Note that the Indic idiom is not the “reading” of minds, which suggests hearing the words spoken in inner dialogue. While this is exhibited by the Buddha (eg. [an8.30:2.1]()), the main emphasis is on the comprehension of the overall state of mind.

If they had a spot they’d know ‘I have a spot,’ and if they had no spots they’d know ‘I have no spots.’	Again the simile emphasizes how clear and direct the experience is. Without deep meditation, we have some intuitive sense for the minds of others, but it is far from clear.
dn2:92.2	In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they project it and extend it toward comprehending the minds of others.	NA
dn2:92.3	They understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind.	NA

dn2:93.0	4.3.3.6. Recollection of Past Lives	NA
dn2:93.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they project it and extend it toward recollection of past lives.	Here begins the “three knowledges” (_tevijjā_), a subset of the six direct knowledges. The first two of these play an important role in deepening understanding of the nature of suffering in _saṁsāra_. While they are not necessary for those whose wisdom is keen, they are helpful.
dn2:93.2	They recollect many kinds of past lives, that is, one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	Empowered by the fourth _jhāna_, memory breaks through the veil of birth and death, revealing the vast expanse of time and dispelling the illusion that there is any place of eternal rest or sanctuary in the cycle of transmigration. The knowledge of these events is not hazy or murky, but clear and precise, illuminated by the brilliance of purified consciousness.
dn2:94.1	Suppose a person was to leave their home village and go to another village. From that village they’d go to yet another village. And from that village they’d return to their home village. They’d think: ‘I went from my home village to another village. There I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. From that village I went to yet another village. There too I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. And from that village I returned to my home village.’	The word for “past life” is _pubbanivāsa_, literally “former home”, and the imagery of houses is found in the second of the three knowledges as well. Recollection of past lives is as fresh and clear as the memory of a recent journey.
dn2:94.2	In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they project it and extend it toward recollection of past lives.	NA

dn2:95.0	4.3.3.7. Clairvoyance	NA
dn2:95.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they project it and extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	NA
dn2:95.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	Here knowledge extends to the rebirths of others as well as oneself. Even more significant, it brings in the understanding of cause and effect; *why* rebirth happens the way it does. Such knowledge, however, is not infallible, as the Buddha warns in [dn1:2.5.3]() and [mn136](). The experience is one thing; the inferences drawn from it are another. One should draw conclusions only tentatively, after long experience. | “Clairvoyance” renders _dibbacakkhu_ (“celestial eye”), for which see Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.12.5, “the mind is (the self’s) celestial eye” (_mano’sya daivaṁ cakṣuḥ_).
dn2:96.1	Suppose there was a stilt longhouse at the central square. A person with clear eyes standing there might see humans entering and leaving a house, walking along the streets and paths, and sitting at the central square. They’d think: ‘These are people entering and leaving a house, walking along the streets and paths, and sitting at the central square.’	This simile is also found at [dn10:2.33.1](). The Majjhima employs a slightly different simile ([mn39:20.3](), [mn77:35.2](), [mn130:2.1]()). | _Pāsāda_ is often translated as “palace” or “mansion”, but in early Pali it meant a “stilt longhouse”. As here, it is an elevated place from which one can observe the street below.
dn2:96.2	In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they project it and extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	NA

dn2:97.0	4.3.3.8. Ending of Defilements	NA
dn2:97.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they project it and extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	This is the experience of awakening that is the true goal of the Buddhist path. The defilements—properties of the mind that create suffering—have been curbed by the practice of ethics and suppressed by the power of _jhāna_. Here they are eliminated forever.
dn2:97.2	They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.	These are the four noble truths, which form the main content of the Buddha’s first sermon. They are the overarching principle into which all other teachings fall. The initial realization of the four noble truths indicates the first stage of awakening, stream-entry.
dn2:97.3	They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.	The application of the four noble truths to defilements indicates that this is the final stage of awakening, perfection (or “arahantship”, _arahatta_). | Many translators use “defilement” to render _kilesa_, but since _kilesa_ appears only rarely in the early texts, I use “defilement” for _āsava_. Both terms refer to a stain, corruption, or pollution in the mind.
dn2:97.4	Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	_Bhavāsava_ is the defilement that craves to continue life in a new birth.
dn2:97.5	When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.	This is a reflective awareness of the fact of awakening. The meditator reviews their mind and sees that it is free from all forces that lead to suffering.
dn2:97.6	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’	This is a standard declaration of full awakening in the suttas, said both of the Buddha and of any arahant (“perfected one”). Each of the four phrases illustrates a cardinal principle of awakening. (1) Further transmigration through rebirths has come to an end due to the exhaustion (_khīṇa_) of that which propels rebirth, namely deeds motivated by craving. (2) The eightfold path has been developed fully in all respects. (3) All functions relating to the four noble truths have been completed, namely: understanding suffering, letting go craving, witnessing extinguishment, and developing the path. (4) Extinguishment is final, with no falling back to this or any other state of existence. | For “state of existence” (literally “thusness”, _itthatta_), see [dn15:21.4]().
dn2:98.1	Suppose that in a mountain glen there was a lake that was transparent, clear, and unclouded. A person with clear eyes standing on the bank would see the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel, and schools of fish swimming about or staying still. They’d think: ‘This lake is transparent, clear, and unclouded. And here are the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel, and schools of fish swimming about or staying still.’	Once again the pool of water represents the mind, but now the meditator is not immersed in the experience, but looks back and reviews it objectively.
dn2:98.2	In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they project it and extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	NA

dn2:98.9	And, great king, there is no other fruit of the ascetic life apparent in the present life which is better and finer than this.”	The Buddha roars his lion’s roar. His teaching leads not just to some benefits, but to the highest benefits that are possible.
dn2:99.0	5. Ajātasattu Declares Himself a Lay Follower	NA
dn2:99.1	When the Buddha had spoken, King Ajātasattu said to him,	NA
dn2:99.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent!	The king’s distress has been alleviated by the Buddha’s uplifting words.
dn2:99.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
dn2:99.4	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	This is the standard form in which lay people went for refuge. It is not something that the Buddha required, but a spontaneous act of inspiration. Conventionally, it indicates that someone is a “Buddhist”. Today Theravadins recite the going for refuge thrice, but in the early texts this is found only as the ordination for novices ([pli-tv-kd1:12.4.1]()).
dn2:99.5	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.	NA
dn2:99.6	I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to take the life of my father, a just and principled king, for the sake of authority.	The king, unprompted, makes an astonishing confession. To say it in such a public forum, before a spiritual community and his own retinue, displays courage and integrity.
dn2:99.7	Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.”	The Buddha hears his confession, but it is Ajātasattu’s responsibility to do better.
dn2:100.1	“Indeed, great king, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to take the life of your father, a just and principled king, for the sake of sovereignty.	Even before such a dangerous and emotionally volatile king, the Buddha does not mince words. The Buddha makes a point to acknowledge what the king had done, without dismissing it and thereby discounting the inner work he had achieved to get to this point.
dn2:100.2	But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it.	NA
dn2:100.3	For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.”	Confession does not erase the past, but it does set a better course for the future. This confession is similar to that done by monastics when they have broken Vinaya rules.
dn2:101.1	When the Buddha had spoken, King Ajātasattu said to him,	NA
dn2:101.2	“Well, now, sir, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.”	NA
dn2:101.3	“Please, great king, go at your convenience.”	NA
dn2:101.4	Then the king, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled him, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	NA
dn2:102.1	Soon after the king had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
dn2:102.2	“The king is broken, mendicants,	These terms are commonly used in the context of keeping precepts (eg. [an3.50:4.1]()). The Buddha is supportive when he speaks with Ajātasattu, but does not hide the severity of his crime.
dn2:102.3	he is ruined.	NA
dn2:102.4	If he had not taken the life of his father, a just and principled king, the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma would have arisen in him in that very seat.”	The killing of one’s father is one of five “incurable” acts that doom a person to hell in the next life ([an5.129:1.3]()). If he had not done so, he would have become a stream-enterer.
dn2:102.5	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
dn2:102.6	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA
dn3:0.1	Long Discourses 3	NA
dn3:0.2	With Ambaṭṭha	NA
dn3:1.1.1	So I have heard.	This sutta marks a turning point where the Buddha’s teachings were embraced by the leading brahmin Pokkharasāti. The suttas that follow reverberate with the consequences of this encounter. He was one of the most influential brahmins of his time, although the Buddha elsewhere denied that he had any special knowledge ([mn99:15.5]()). Brahmanical texts confirm that he was a real person, an influential teacher around the time of the Buddha known as Pauṣkarasādi in Sanskrit. He is cited on grammar by Kātyāyana and Patañjali, and in the Taittirīya-prātiśākhya; on allowable food and theft in the Āpastamba Dharmasūtra; and on Vedic ritual in the Śāṅkhāyana-Āraṇyaka. His name identifies him as descended from a man of Puṣkarāvati, capital of Gandhāra. [mn99:10.3]() clarifies that he is of the Upamañña lineage.
dn3:1.1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Icchānaṅgala.	Icchānaṅgala was a center east of Sāvatthī for the innovative brahmins of the Kosala region.
dn3:1.1.3	He stayed in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.	NA
dn3:1.2.0	1. The Section on Pokkharasāti	NA
dn3:1.2.1	Now at that time the brahmin Pokkharasāti was living in Ukkaṭṭhā. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.	Ukkaṭṭhā is mentioned only rarely, and always in the context of extraordinary teachings and events that emphasize the cosmic grandeur of the Buddha against the brahmins ([dn14:3.29.1](), [mn1:1.2](), [mn49:2.1]()). Sanskrit sources call it a _droṇamukha_, a leading market town accessible by land and water (Divyāvadāna 319.010). At [mn99:10.3]() Pokkharasāti is said to be “of the Subhaga Forest”. | “Royal park” is _rājadāya_ (cp. _migadāya_, “deer park”). | A _brahmadeyya_ is a gift of land by a king to a brahmin, which was an outstanding feature of Indian feudalism.
dn3:1.2.2	Pokkharasāti heard:	NA
dn3:1.2.3	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala and is staying in a forest nearby.	NA
dn3:1.2.4	He has this good reputation:	NA
dn3:1.2.5	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
dn3:1.2.6	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	Contrast with his rejection of this possibility at [mn99:10.7]().
dn3:1.2.7	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
dn3:1.2.8	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	Pokkharasāti does not care whether the Buddha identified as a follower of the Vedas. The wise do not concern themselves with religious identity.
dn3:1.3.0	2. The Student Ambaṭṭha	NA
dn3:1.3.1	Now at that time Pokkharasāti had a student named Ambaṭṭha as his resident pupil. He was one who recited and remembered the hymns, and had mastered in the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. He had been authorized as a master in his own tutor’s scriptural heritage of the three Vedas with the words:	“Vocabularies” is _nighaṇḍu_ (Sanskrit _nighaṇṭu_), known from the Nirukta of Yāska. | _Keṭubha_ lacks an obvious Sanskrit form. The commentary explains, “The study of proper and improper actions for the assistance of poets.” This suggests a connection with ritual performance, which is the special area of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. There we often find phrases such as _kṛtam bhavati_, “it is performed”, of which _keṭubha_ is perhaps a contraction. | _Akkhara_ (literally “syllable”) is explained by the commentary as _sikkhā_ (Sanskrit _śikṣā_), which is the study of pronunciation. This can be traced back to Pāṇinī, and is sometimes referred to as _akṣara-samāmnāya_, “collation of syllables”. | _Pabheda_ is found in Buddhist Sanskrit texts as _padaprabheda_, “classification of words”, such as into the different parts of speech. The commentary identifies it with _nirutti_. | _Padaka_ is one skilled in the _padapāṭha_ recitation of Vedas, which separates the individual words. | For “testaments” (_itihāsa_) see _itihāsa-purāṇa_ in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.6.8, explained by the commentator there as legends of creation and olden times. | For “cosmology” (_lokāyata_), see note on [dn1:1.25.2](). | For “authorized as a master” (_anuññātapaṭiññāta_) see [mn98:7.1]() and [snp3.9:6.1](). | For “scriptural heritage of the three Vedas” (_tevijjake pāvacane_) see [mn95:12.2]().
dn3:1.3.2	“What I know, you know.	Almost the same words are spoken to the bodhisatta by his first teachers, Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta ([mn36:14.9]()). This connects Pokkharasāti with Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta, and suggests that the anointing of a talented student in this way was a regular practice of wise brahmins.
dn3:1.3.3	And what you know, I know.”	NA
dn3:1.4.1	Then Pokkharasāti addressed Ambaṭṭha,	NA
dn3:1.4.2	“Dear Ambaṭṭha, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala and is staying in a forest nearby.	NA
dn3:1.4.3	He has this good reputation …	NA
dn3:1.4.4	NA	NA
dn3:1.4.5	NA	NA
dn3:1.4.6	NA	NA
dn3:1.4.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.	NA
dn3:1.4.8	Please, dear Ambaṭṭha, go to the ascetic Gotama and find out whether or not he lives up to his reputation.	NA
dn3:1.4.9	Through you I shall learn about the worthy Gotama.”	Following PTS and BJT editions of the parallel phrase at [mn91:4.9](), which read _tayā_ for _tathā_.
dn3:1.5.1	“But sir, how shall I find out whether or not the ascetic Gotama lives up to his reputation?”	NA
dn3:1.5.2	“Dear Ambaṭṭha, the thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.	The thirty-two marks are detailed in [dn14:1.32.7](), [dn30:1.2.4](), and [mn91:9.1](). In Buddhist texts they are presented as the fulfillment of Brahmanical prophecy, but they are not found in any Brahmanical texts of the Buddha’s time. However, later astrological texts such as the Gārgīyajyotiṣa (1st century BCE?) and Bṛhatsaṁhitā (6th century CE?) contain references to many of these marks, albeit in a different context, so it seems likely the Buddhist texts are drawing on now-lost Brahmanical scriptures. | The notion of a two-fold course for a great hero—worldly success or spiritual—can be traced back as far as the epic of Gilgamesh.
dn3:1.5.3	If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures.	The idea of the wheel-turning monarch draws from the Vedic horse sacrifice, which establishes the authority of a king from sea to sea. The Buddhist telling is divested of all coarse and violent elements. The wheeled chariot gave military supremacy to the ancient Indo-Europeans, allowing them to spread from their ancient homeland north of the Black Sea. In Buddhism, the wheel, which also has solar connotations, symbolizes unstoppable power. For a legendary account of such a king, see the Mahāsudassanasutta ([dn17]()). Rig Veda 8.63.8 speaks of Indra as the “wheel turner”.
dn3:1.5.4	He has the following seven treasures:	NA
dn3:1.5.5	the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure.	NA
dn3:1.5.6	He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.	The sacrificial horse on its journey across the land is protected by a hundred sons.
dn3:1.5.7	After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword.	NA
dn3:1.5.8	But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world.	NA
dn3:1.5.9	But, dear Ambaṭṭha, I am the one who gives the hymns,	The relation between Pokkharasāti and Ambaṭṭha is similar to that between the Buddha and his followers. They share the same understanding, but the Buddha is distinguished as the teacher.
dn3:1.5.10	and you are the one who receives them.”	NA
dn3:1.6.1	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Ambaṭṭha. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Pokkharasāti, keeping him to his right. He mounted a chariot drawn by mares and, together with several young students, set out for the forest near Icchānaṅgala.	In this sutta, _māṇava_ is always applied to Ambaṭṭha and _māṇavaka_ to the rest. It seems that the diminutive _māṇavaka_ means “young student”. | There are said to be _sambahula_ students, a word that is often translated as “many”. But later we see that they all fit inside the Buddha’s hut, so the sense must be “several”.
dn3:1.6.2	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot.	NA
dn3:1.7.1	At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air.	This is the practice of walking meditation. Meditators pace mindfully up and down a smooth path, keeping attention on their body.
dn3:1.7.2	Then the student Ambaṭṭha went up to those mendicants and said,	NA
dn3:1.7.3	“Good fellows, where is the worthy Gotama at present?	_Bho_ is a respectful term of address used by brahmins. The forms of address used in Pali are complex, and it is rarely possible to map them to modern English with any precision.
dn3:1.7.4	For we have come here to see him.”	The parallel passage at [mn35:7.4]() has a different phrase here.
dn3:1.8.1	Then those mendicants thought,	NA
dn3:1.8.2	“This Ambaṭṭha is from a well-known family, and he is the pupil of the well-known brahmin Pokkharasāti.	NA
dn3:1.8.3	The Buddha won’t mind having a discussion together with such gentlemen.”	The term _kulaputta_ (literally, “son of a family”) typically refers to someone from a well-to-do or respected family, a “gentleman”. It is a gendered term which assumes the social status of men.
dn3:1.8.4	They said to Ambaṭṭha,	NA
dn3:1.8.5	“Ambaṭṭha, that’s his dwelling, with the door closed. Approach it quietly, without hurrying; go onto the porch, clear your throat, and knock on the door-panel. The Buddha will open the door.”	The introduction has told us that the Buddha was staying in a forest at this time. Nonetheless, this was not a wilderness, but was developed enough to have huts with latched doors.
dn3:1.9.1	So he approached the Buddha’s dwelling, cleared his throat and knocked on the door-panel, and the Buddha opened the door.	NA
dn3:1.9.2	Ambaṭṭha and the young students entered the dwelling. The young students exchanged greetings with the Buddha, and when the greetings and polite conversation were over, sat down to one side.	NA
dn3:1.9.3	But while the Buddha was sitting, Ambaṭṭha spoke some polite words or other while walking around or standing.	NA
dn3:1.9.4	So the Buddha said to him,	NA
dn3:1.9.5	“Ambaṭṭha, is this how you hold a discussion with elderly and senior brahmins, the tutors of tutors: walking around or standing while I’m sitting, speaking some polite words or other?”	The Buddha draws attention to Ambaṭṭha’s rude behavior. Throughout the suttas, the manner in which people greet the Buddha gives us a hint as to their attitudes and qualities.
dn3:1.10.0	2.1. The First Use of the Word “Primitives”	NA
dn3:1.10.1	“No, worthy Gotama.	NA
dn3:1.10.2	For it is proper for one brahmin to converse with another while both are walking, standing, sitting, or lying down.	NA
dn3:1.10.3	But as to these shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman, I converse with them as I do with the worthy Gotama.”	Note the racial connotations of using _kaṇha_ (“black”) as a slur. The brahmin caste hailed from the (relatively) fair-skinned Indo-Europeans who entered India from the north. Vedic texts indicate that there was Brahmanical prejudice against dark-skinned natives, but also that they were assimilated and raised to positions of honor.
dn3:1.11.1	“But Ambaṭṭha, you must have come here for some purpose. You should focus on that.	NA
dn3:1.11.2	Though this Ambaṭṭha is unqualified, he thinks he’s qualified. What is that but lack of qualifications?”	Ambaṭṭha is “qualified” (_vusita_) in scripture, but far from “qualified” in spiritual development. _Vusita_ is normally an expression of arahantship: _vusitaṁ brahmacariyaṁ_ (“the spiritual journey has been completed”).
dn3:1.12.1	When he said this, Ambaṭṭha became angry and upset with the Buddha because of being described as unqualified. He even attacked and badmouthed the Buddha himself, saying,	NA
dn3:1.12.2	“The ascetic Gotama will be worsted!” He said to the Buddha,	NA
dn3:1.12.3	“Worthy Gotama, the Sakyans are rude,	NA
dn3:1.12.4	harsh,	NA
dn3:1.12.5	touchy,	NA
dn3:1.12.6	and argumentative.	The PTS reading _rabhasa_ means “violent, aggressive”. But the commentary reads _bhassa_, explained as “speaking much”. Moreover, the story below does not demonstrate violence.
dn3:1.12.7	Primitive they are, and primitive they remain! They don’t honor, respect, revere, worship, or venerate brahmins.	Ambaṭṭha despises the Sakyans as “primitives” (_ibbha_) who do not respect Vedic culture. The word _ibbha_ (“primitive”) stems from a non-Aryan word for “elephant” (_ibha_). It originally referred to the native inhabitants who tamed elephants; see eg. Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1.10. At [snp3.1:18.4]() the Buddha describes his own people as “natives” (_niketino_), those who have a long connection with the land.
dn3:1.12.8	It is neither proper nor appropriate that the Sakyans—primitives that they are—don’t honor, respect, revere, worship, or venerate brahmins.”	NA
dn3:1.12.9	And that’s how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the word “primitives” for the first time.	NA
dn3:1.13.0	2.2. The Second Use of the Word “Primitives”	NA
dn3:1.13.1	“But Ambaṭṭha, how have the Sakyans wronged you?”	NA
dn3:1.13.2	“This one time, worthy Gotama, I went to Kapilavatthu on some business for my tutor, the brahmin Pokkharasāti.	NA
dn3:1.13.3	I approached the Sakyans in their town hall.	NA
dn3:1.13.4	Now at that time several Sakyans and Sakyan princes were sitting on high seats, poking each other with their fingers, giggling and playing together. In fact, they even presumed to giggle at me, and didn’t invite me to a seat.	NA
dn3:1.13.5	It is neither proper nor appropriate that the Sakyans—primitives that they are—don’t honor, respect, revere, worship, or venerate brahmins.”	NA
dn3:1.13.6	And that’s how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the word “primitives” for the second time.	NA
dn3:1.14.0	2.3. The Third Use of the Word “Primitives”	NA
dn3:1.14.1	“Even a little quail, Ambaṭṭha, speaks as she likes in her own nest.	NA
dn3:1.14.2	Kapilavatthu is the Sakyans’ own place, Ambaṭṭha. It’s not worthy of the Venerable Ambaṭṭha to lose his temper over such a small thing.”	The Buddha’s use of _āyasmā_ is noteworthy here: he is taking a conciliatory tone.
dn3:1.14.3	“Worthy Gotama, there are these four classes:	NA
dn3:1.14.4	aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials.	NA
dn3:1.14.5	Three of these classes—	NA
dn3:1.14.6	aristocrats, peasants, and menials—	NA
dn3:1.14.7	in fact succeed only when serving the brahmins.	NA
dn3:1.14.8	It is neither proper nor appropriate that the Sakyans—primitives that they are—don’t honor, respect, revere, worship, or venerate brahmins.”	NA
dn3:1.14.9	And that’s how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the word “primitives” for the third time.	NA
dn3:1.15.0	2.4. The Word “Son of a Slavegirl” is Used	NA
dn3:1.15.1	Then it occurred to the Buddha,	NA
dn3:1.15.2	“This Ambaṭṭha puts the Sakyans down way too much by calling them primitives. Why don’t I ask him about his own clan?”	NA
dn3:1.15.3	So the Buddha said to him,	NA
dn3:1.15.4	“What is your clan, Ambaṭṭha?”	The Ambaṭṭhas were a people in the north-west of greater India (eg. Mahābhārata 7.4.5c, 7.132.23a). They were evidently the Abastanians whose rout at the hands of Alexander is recorded by Arrian (*The Anabasis of Alexander*, chapter 15). They were probably located near what is today the northern Sindh province in Pakistan. Later texts such as Manusmṛti 1.8 say that an _ambaṣṭha_ is born of a brahmin father and _vaiśya_ mother.
dn3:1.15.5	“I am a Kaṇhāyana, worthy Gotama.”	_Kaṇhāyana_ means “descendant of the dark one (_kaṇha_)”. Since no clan of that name is attested it is perhaps a confusion with the Kāṇvāyanas of Rig Veda 8.55.4. But the confusion, if it is such, has an old history, for Rig Veda 1.117.8 refers to “Dark Kaṇva” (_Śyāva Kaṇva_).
dn3:1.15.6	“But, recollecting the ancient name and clan of your mother and father, the Sakyans were the children of the masters, while you’re descended from the son of a slavegirl of the Sakyans.	Normally I take _ayyaputta_ as a simple honorific, but here the sense is not that the Sakyans were the masters, but were descended from them.
dn3:1.15.7	But the Sakyans regard King Okkāka as their grandfather.	Okkāka (Sanskrit Ikṣvāku) was the legendary son of the first man, Manu, and the founder of the solar dynasty of Kosala. It is a Munda name, which may be associated with the introduction of cane sugar (_ikṣuḥ_) from eastern Asia, a theory endorsed by the 9th century Jain scholar Jinasena (Natubhai Shah, *Jainism, the World of Conquerors*, 2004, vol. 1, pg. 15).
dn3:1.15.8	Once upon a time, King Okkāka, wishing to divert the royal succession to the son of his most beloved queen, banished the elder princes from the realm—	NA
dn3:1.15.9	Okkāmukha, Karakaṇḍa, Hatthinika, and Sinisūra.	NA
dn3:1.15.10	They made their home beside a lotus pond on the slopes of the Himalayas, where there was a large grove of _sakhua_ trees.	The words for “teak” (_sāka_) and “sal” (_sāla_) have evidently been confused from the Munda root _sarja_ (both appear at [mn93:11.6]()). But teak does not grow so far north, so the sal must be meant here. To maintain the pun I use _sakhua_, which is an alternate Hindi name for the sal tree. This story suggests that when they settled in their northern home in the shadow of the Himalayas, harvesting sal was a primary source of wealth. Compare Gilgamesh, for whom Lebanese cedar was the foundation of his royal capital.
dn3:1.15.11	For fear of breaking their line of birth, they slept with their own (_saka_) sisters.	“Own” is _saka_, the second pun on the Sakyan name. Incest is, of course, common among royal families for exactly the reason stated here. Marriage between cousins persisted even in the Buddha’s day. | For _sambheda_ in the sense of “dissolving, leaking”, see [an2.9:1.5]() = [dn26:20.2](), [an5.103:6.4](), [an10.45:4.1]().
dn3:1.15.12	Then King Okkāka addressed his ministers and councillors,	NA
dn3:1.15.13	‘Where, sirs, have the princes settled now?’	For this sense of _sammati_, see [sn11.9](), [sn11.10]().
dn3:1.15.14	‘Sire, there is a lotus pond on the slopes of the Himalayas, by a large grove of _sakhua_ trees. They’ve settled there.	NA
dn3:1.15.15	For fear of breaking their line of birth, they are sleeping with their own sisters.’	NA
dn3:1.15.16	Then, Ambaṭṭha, King Okkāka expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
dn3:1.15.17	‘The princes are indeed Sakyans! The princes are indeed the best Sakyans!’	This draws on both the puns above. But the commentary also explains _sakya_ here as “capable” (_samatthā_, _paṭibalā_) in reference to their survival against all odds, thus connecting Sakya with _sakka_ (“able”).
dn3:1.15.18	From that day on the Sakyans were recognized and he was their founder.	NA
dn3:1.16.1	Now, King Okkāka had a slavegirl named Disā.	Vedic _dāsa_ (“slave, bondservant”) refers to the “dark-wombed” (_kṛṣṇayoni_, Rig Veda 2.20.7) foes of the Aryan peoples (Rig Veda 10.22.8) who upon defeat were enslaved (Rig Veda 10.62.10). The name _disā_ therefore probably means “foe” (Sanskrit _dviṣa_).
dn3:1.16.2	She gave birth to a boy named “Black”.	The passage wavers between treating _kaṇha_ (Sanskrit _kṛṣṇa_, i.e. Krishna) as a personal name, a description, and a word for a goblin. I try to capture this ambiguity by using variations of “black boy”. | The passage does not say who the father was. According to Arthaśāstra 3.13, a female slave is protected against sexual harassment by the master, but should she have a child by him, both mother and child are to be set free, and if the sex was not consensual, he must pay her a fine.
dn3:1.16.3	When he was born, Black Boy said:	NA
dn3:1.16.4	‘Wash me, mum, bathe me! Get this filth off of me! I will be useful for you!’	Like Siddhattha, he spoke as soon as he was born. The boy was no common child, but had a larger destiny. His words are a dramatic contrast with Siddhattha’s words of confident proclamation, and his birth which was devoid of filth or impurity.
dn3:1.16.5	Whereas these days when people see goblins they recognize them as goblins,	NA
dn3:1.16.6	in those days they recognized goblins as ‘blackboys’.	NA
dn3:1.16.7	They said:	NA
dn3:1.16.8	‘He spoke as soon as he was born—a blackboy is born! A goblin is born!’	NA
dn3:1.16.9	From that day on the Kaṇhāyanas were proclaimed, and he was their founder.	NA
dn3:1.16.10	That’s how, recollecting the ancient name and clan of your mother and father, the Sakyans were the children of the masters, while you’re descended from the son of a slavegirl of the Sakyans.”	NA
dn3:1.17.1	When he said this, those young students said to him,	NA
dn3:1.17.2	“Worthy Gotama, please don’t put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a slavegirl.	Lineage was important to brahmins, but the Brāhmaṇa and Upaniṣad literature shows that, as here, many were more concerned with conduct and wisdom than with birth.
dn3:1.17.3	He’s well-born, a gentleman, learned, who enunciates well, and is astute. He is capable of debating with the worthy Gotama about this.”	NA
dn3:1.18.1	So the Buddha said to them,	NA
dn3:1.18.2	“Well, young students, if you think that	NA
dn3:1.18.3	Ambaṭṭha is ill-born, not a gentleman, unlearned, a poor speaker, witless, and not capable of debating with me about this, then leave him aside and you can debate with me.	NA
dn3:1.18.4	But if you think that	NA
dn3:1.18.5	he’s well-born, a gentleman, learned, who enunciates well, is astute, and is capable of debating with me about this, then you should stand aside and let him debate with me.”	NA
dn3:1.18.6	NA	NA
dn3:1.19.1	“He is capable of debating you. We will be silent, and let Ambaṭṭha debate with the worthy Gotama about this.”	NA
dn3:1.20.1	So the Buddha said to Ambaṭṭha,	NA
dn3:1.20.2	“Well, Ambaṭṭha, there’s a legitimate question that comes up. You won’t like it, but you ought to answer anyway.	NA
dn3:1.20.3	If you fail to answer—by dodging the issue, remaining silent, or leaving—your head will explode into seven pieces right here.	The threat of losing one’s head is found at eg. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.3.24, or at 3.9.26 when it actually did fall off. I cannot trace the detail of heads being split in seven to any early Sanskrit texts, but it is found in later texts such as Rāmāyaṇa 7.26.44c and Mahābhārata 14.7.2c.
dn3:1.20.4	What do you think, Ambaṭṭha?	NA
dn3:1.20.5	According to what you have heard from elderly and senior brahmins, the tutors of tutors, what is the origin of the Kaṇhāyanas, and who is their founder?”	NA
dn3:1.20.6	When he said this, Ambaṭṭha kept silent.	NA
dn3:1.20.7	For a second time, the Buddha put the question,	NA
dn3:1.20.8	NA	NA
dn3:1.20.9	and for a second time Ambaṭṭha kept silent.	NA
dn3:1.20.10	So the Buddha said to him,	NA
dn3:1.20.11	“Answer now, Ambaṭṭha. Now is not the time for silence.	NA
dn3:1.20.12	If someone fails to answer a legitimate question when asked three times by the Buddha, their head explodes into seven pieces there and then.”	NA
dn3:1.21.1	Now at that time the spirit Vajirapāṇī, holding a massive iron spear, burning, blazing, and glowing, stood in the air above Ambaṭṭha, thinking,	Vajirapāṇī (“lightning-bolt in hand”) appears here and in the parallel passage at [mn35:14.1](). The synonymous Vajrahasta (Pali _vajirahattha_, [dn20:12.1]()) is a frequent epithet of Indra in the Vedas (eg. Rig Veda 1.173.10a: _indro vajrahastaḥ_), confirming the commentary’s identification with Sakka. Much later, Mahayana texts adopted the name for a fierce Bodhisattva who was protector of the Dhamma.
dn3:1.21.2	“If this Ambaṭṭha doesn’t answer when asked a third time, I’ll blow his head into seven pieces there and then!”	NA
dn3:1.21.3	And both the Buddha and Ambaṭṭha could see Vajirapāṇī.	NA
dn3:1.21.4	Ambaṭṭha was terrified, shocked, and awestruck. Looking to the Buddha for shelter, protection, and refuge, he sat down close by the Buddha and said,	NA
dn3:1.21.5	“What did you say?	NA
dn3:1.21.6	Please repeat the question.”	NA
dn3:1.21.7	“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha?	NA
dn3:1.21.8	According to what you have heard from elderly and senior brahmins, the tutors of tutors, what is the origin of the Kaṇhāyanas, and who is their founder?”	NA
dn3:1.21.9	“I have heard, worthy Gotama, that it is just as you say.	NA
dn3:1.21.10	That’s the origin of the Kaṇhāyanas,	NA
dn3:1.21.11	and that’s who their founder is.”	NA
dn3:1.22.0	2.5. The Discussion of Ambaṭṭha’s Heritage	NA
dn3:1.22.1	When he said this, those young students made an uproar,	NA
dn3:1.22.2	“It turns out Ambaṭṭha is ill-born, not a gentleman, son of a Sakyan slavegirl, and that the Sakyans are sons of his masters!	NA
dn3:1.22.3	And it seems that the ascetic Gotama spoke only the truth, though we presumed to rebuke him!”	NA
dn3:1.23.1	Then it occurred to the Buddha,	NA
dn3:1.23.2	“These young students put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a slavegirl. Why don’t I get him out of this?”	NA
dn3:1.23.3	So the Buddha said to the young students,	NA
dn3:1.23.4	“Young students, please don’t put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a slavegirl.	NA
dn3:1.23.5	That Black Boy was an eminent sage.	The contemptuous senses of “black boy” represent the conservative brahmanical view, presented not as endorsement, but as a rhetorical means to undermine Ambaṭṭha’s pride. The Buddha now shows how a man of a supposedly low birth rose to great spiritual eminence.
dn3:1.23.6	He went to a southern country and memorized the Divine Spell. Then he approached King Okkāka and asked for the hand of his daughter Maddarūpī.	“Divine Spell” is _brahmamanta_, a term also found in the commentary to the Morajātaka ([ja159]()), where it refers to a verse which, in Vedic style, worships the sun as the “one king”. In modern Hinduism it is used for a verse of praise for Brahmā. | Kaṇha is one of several “dark hermits” who accrued mighty and lineage-busting powers in the south.
dn3:1.23.7	The king said to him,	NA
dn3:1.23.8	‘Who the hell is this son of a slavegirl to ask for the hand of my daughter!’ Angry and upset he fastened a razor-tipped arrow.	The Hindu deity Krishna won the hand of his seventh wife Lakṣmaṇā, also known as Madrī, at an archery contest. This detail is too precise to be a coincidence, and proves there must be some shared basis between the two figures.
dn3:1.23.9	But he wasn’t able to either shoot it or to relax it.	NA
dn3:1.23.10	Then the ministers and councillors approached the sage Black Boy and said:	NA
dn3:1.23.11	‘Spare the king, sir,	NA
dn3:1.23.12	spare him!’	NA
dn3:1.23.13	‘The king will be safe. But if he shoots the arrow downwards, there will be an earthquake across the entire realm.’	This draws on the ancient belief that the king’s acts affect the natural order of things.
dn3:1.23.14	‘Spare the king, sir, and spare the country!’	NA
dn3:1.23.15	‘Both king and country will be safe. But if he shoots the arrow upwards, the heavens will not rain in the entire realm for seven years.’	NA
dn3:1.23.16	‘Spare the king, sir, spare the country, and let the heavens rain!’	This sequence seems to be an etiological myth explaining certain rites of kingship and succession, providing an origin story for this prayer.
dn3:1.23.17	‘Both king and country will be safe, and the heavens rain will rain. And if the king shoots the crown prince with an arrow, he will be safe and unruffled.’	National prosperity is ensured through symbolic regicide. This example was omitted from Frazer’s accounts of such substitute sacrifices. Here there is a double substitution: the prince substitutes for the king, then a threat substitutes for the act of killing. This suggests that, even from the legendary perspective of this story within a story, the rite was an ancient one that had evolved through multiple stages.
dn3:1.23.18	So the ministers said to Okkāka:	The use of the bare personal name for the king is unusual.
dn3:1.23.19	‘Okkāka must shoot the crown prince with an arrow. He will be safe and unruffled.’	NA
dn3:1.23.20	So King Okkāka shot the crown prince with an arrow. And he was safe and unruffled.	NA
dn3:1.23.21	Then the king was terrified, shocked, and awestruck. Scared by the divine punishment, he gave the hand of his daughter Maddarūpī.	“Divine punishment” is _brahmadaṇḍa_, harking back to the Divine Spell (_brahmamantra_). The Buddha had his own version of the _brahmadaṇḍa_, which was to give the silent treatment ([dn16:6.4.1]()).
dn3:1.23.22	Young students, please don’t put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a slavegirl. That Black Boy was an eminent sage.”	NA
dn3:1.24.0	3. The Supremacy of the Aristocrats	NA
dn3:1.24.1	Then the Buddha addressed Ambaṭṭha,	NA
dn3:1.24.2	“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha?	NA
dn3:1.24.3	Suppose an aristocrat boy was to sleep with a brahmin girl, and they had a son.	NA
dn3:1.24.4	Would he receive a seat and water from the brahmins?”	NA
dn3:1.24.5	“He would, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn3:1.24.6	“And would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors, an offering of a dish of milk-rice, a sacrifice, or a feast for guests?”	NA
dn3:1.24.7	“They would.”	NA
dn3:1.24.8	“And would the brahmins teach him the hymns or not?”	NA
dn3:1.24.9	“They would.”	NA
dn3:1.24.10	“And would he be kept from the women or not?”	In [mn56:19.2]() _āvaṭa_/_anāvaṭa_ is used in reference to Upāli “shutting his gate” against the Jains and opening it for the Buddhists. In [dn17:1.23.2]() _anāvaṭa_ means “open to the public”.
dn3:1.24.11	“He would not.”	NA
dn3:1.24.12	“And would the aristocrats anoint him as king?”	NA
dn3:1.24.13	“No, worthy Gotama.	NA
dn3:1.24.14	Why is that?	NA
dn3:1.24.15	Because his maternity is unsuitable.”	NA

dn3:1.27.12	Yet still the aristocrats are superior and the brahmins inferior.	NA
dn3:1.28.1	The divinity Sanaṅkumāra also spoke this verse:	Sanaṅkumāra (“Everyoung”) became a Hindu deity closely associated with the worship of Krishna. He first appears in the seventh chapter of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. There he teaches the learned Nārada what lies beyond the mere surface of words (_nāma_) by giving a progressive meditation that ultimately reveals the highest Self. Thus he is a perfect foil for Ambaṭṭha. The occasion he spoke this verse is recorded at [sn6.11](), and it is repeated several times in the suttas.

dn3:2.1.0	4. Knowledge and Conduct	NA
dn3:2.1.1	“But what, worthy Gotama, is that conduct, and what is that knowledge?”	To his credit, after that thorough humiliation, Ambaṭṭha is ready to learn.
dn3:2.1.2	“Ambaṭṭha, in the supreme knowledge and conduct there is no discussion of genealogy or clan or pride—	Reading _anuttarāya vijjācaraṇasampadāya_ as locative, in agreement with _yattha_ below.

dn3:2.1.7	The realization of supreme knowledge and conduct occurs when you’ve given up such things.”	The Buddha emphasizes that his “knowledge and conduct” rejects the notion of birth that is so essential to Brahmanism.
dn3:2.2.1	“But what, worthy Gotama, is that conduct, and what is that knowledge?”	NA
dn3:2.2.2	“Ambaṭṭha, it’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.	NA

dn3:2.2.9	This pertains to their conduct.	NA
dn3:2.2.10	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption …	NA

dn3:2.2.23	And, Ambaṭṭha, there is no accomplishment in knowledge and conduct that is better or finer than this.	NA
dn3:2.3.0	5. Four Causes of Quitting	NA
dn3:2.3.1	There are these four causes of quitting this supreme knowledge and conduct.	In later Theravada, _apāyamukha_ refers to deeds that cause rebirth in lower realms. However this does not apply in the early texts; the acts described here are not evil. Rather, it means an “opening” (_mukha_) for “departure” (_apāya_).
dn3:2.3.2	What four?	NA
dn3:2.3.3	Firstly, take some ascetic or brahmin who, not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct, plunges into a wilderness region carrying their pack with a shoulder-pole, thinking	NA
dn3:2.3.4	they will get by eating fallen fruit.	A common practice of pre-Buddhist hermits, who avoided the slightest harm to plants. Buddhist mendicants may also not harm plants, but they rely on alms and only eat fallen fruit in case of famine.
dn3:2.3.5	In fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conduct.	The Buddha inverts Ambaṭṭha’s earlier claim that the other three castes only succeed in serving brahmins ([dn3:1.14.7]()).
dn3:2.3.6	This is the first cause of quitting this supreme knowledge and conduct.	NA
dn3:2.3.7	Furthermore, take some ascetic or brahmin who, not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct or to get by eating fallen fruit, plunges into a wilderness region carrying a spade and basket, thinking	NA
dn3:2.3.8	they will get by eating tubers and fruit.	They are less strict than the previous ascetics, for they dig the soil and harm the plants.
dn3:2.3.9	In fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conduct.	NA
dn3:2.3.10	This is the second cause of quitting this supreme knowledge and conduct.	NA
dn3:2.3.11	Furthermore, take some ascetic or brahmin who, not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct, or to get by eating fallen fruit, or to get by eating tubers and fruit, sets up a fire chamber in the neighborhood of a village or town and dwells there serving the sacred flame.	NA
dn3:2.3.12	In fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conduct.	NA
dn3:2.3.13	This is the third cause of quitting this supreme knowledge and conduct.	NA
dn3:2.3.14	Furthermore, take some ascetic or brahmin who, not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct, or to get by eating fallen fruit, or to get by eating tubers and fruit, or to serve the sacred flame, sets up a four-doored fire chamber at the crossroads and dwells there, thinking:	NA
dn3:2.3.15	‘When an ascetic or brahmin comes from the four quarters, I will honor them as best I can.’	NA
dn3:2.3.16	In fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conduct.	NA
dn3:2.3.17	This is the fourth cause of quitting this supreme knowledge and conduct.	NA
dn3:2.3.18	These are the four causes of quitting this supreme knowledge and conduct.	NA
dn3:2.4.1	What do you think, Ambaṭṭha?	NA
dn3:2.4.2	Is this supreme knowledge and conduct seen in your own tradition?”	“Tradition” renders _sācariyaka_, “that which stems from one’s own teacher”.
dn3:2.4.3	“No, worthy Gotama.	NA
dn3:2.4.4	Who am I and my tradition compared with the supreme knowledge and conduct?	NA
dn3:2.4.5	We are far from that.”	NA
dn3:2.4.6	“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha?	NA
dn3:2.4.7	Since you’re not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct, have you with your tradition plunged into a wilderness region carrying your pack with a shoulder-pole, thinking	NA
dn3:2.4.8	you will get by eating fallen fruit?”	NA
dn3:2.4.9	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn3:2.4.10	“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha?	NA
dn3:2.4.11	Have you with your tradition … plunged into a wilderness region carrying a spade and basket, thinking	NA
dn3:2.4.12	you will get by eating tubers and fruit?”	NA
dn3:2.4.13	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn3:2.4.14	“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha?	NA
dn3:2.4.15	Have you with your tradition … set up a fire chamber in the neighborhood of a village or town and dwelt there serving the sacred flame?”	NA
dn3:2.4.16	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn3:2.4.17	“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha?	NA
dn3:2.4.18	Have you with your tradition … set up a four-doored fire chamber at the crossroads and dwelt there, thinking:	NA
dn3:2.4.19	‘When an ascetic or brahmin comes from the four quarters, I will honor them as best I can’?”	NA
dn3:2.4.20	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn3:2.5.1	“So you with your tradition are not only inferior to the supreme knowledge and conduct,	NA
dn3:2.5.2	you are even inferior to the four causes of quitting the supreme knowledge and conduct.	NA
dn3:2.5.3	But you have been told this by your tutor, the brahmin Pokkharasāti:	NA
dn3:2.5.4	‘Who are these shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman compared with conversation with the brahmins of the three knowledges?” Yet he himself has not even fulfilled one of the quittings!	NA
dn3:2.5.5	See, Ambaṭṭha, how your tutor Pokkharasāti has wronged you.	NA
dn3:2.6.0	6. Being Like the Sages of the Past	NA
dn3:2.6.1	Pokkharasāti lives off an endowment provided by King Pasenadi of Kosala.	NA
dn3:2.6.2	But the king won’t even grant him an audience face to face.	NA
dn3:2.6.3	When he consults, he does so behind a curtain.	This practice is not elsewhere attested in early Pali.
dn3:2.6.4	Why wouldn’t the king grant a face to face audience with someone who’d receive his legitimate presentation of food?	NA
dn3:2.6.5	See, Ambaṭṭha, how your tutor Pokkharasāti has wronged you.	NA
dn3:2.7.1	What do you think, Ambaṭṭha?	NA
dn3:2.7.2	Suppose King Pasenadi was holding consultations with warrior-chiefs or chieftains while sitting on an elephant’s neck or on horseback, or while standing on the mat in a chariot.	_Ugga_ is a rare word whose root sense is “mighty”, but here it must be a noun. Given that it is a military man who consults with the king, I translate as “warrior-chief”. | _Rājañña_ is used occasionally in the suttas; it is an archaic synonym for _khattiya_.
dn3:2.7.3	And suppose he’d get down from that place and stand aside.	NA
dn3:2.7.4	Then along would come a worker or their bondservant, who’d stand in the same place and continue the consultation:	NA
dn3:2.7.5	‘This is what King Pasenadi says, and this too is what the king says.’	NA
dn3:2.7.6	Though he spoke the king’s words and gave the king’s advice,	Taking this and the next as one sentence, despite the punctuation of the Mahāsaṅgīti text.
dn3:2.7.7	does that qualify him to be the king or the king’s minister?”	NA
dn3:2.7.8	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn3:2.8.1	“In the same way, Ambaṭṭha, the ancient seers of the brahmins were Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu. They were the authors and propagators of the hymns. Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times; and these days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it, chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taught.	The “hymns” (_mantā_) are the verses of the Rig Veda. The ten names here all correspond with Vedic authors according to the Brahmanical tradition (for details, see note on [dn13:13.1]()). Note that in Sanskrit the names of the rishis are distinguished from the lineage holders, which take the patronymic. For example, Bharadvāja is the rishi, the Bhāradvājas are his descendants; Vasiṣṭha is the rishi, the Vāsiṣṭhas are his descendants. Pali texts do not make this distinction, but use the patronymic, although the two forms are not always readily distinguishable. | “Seer” is _isi_ (Sanskrit _ṛṣi_). It is of uncertain etymology, but was taken to mean that they had “seen” the Vedas (_mantradraṣṭa_) or directly “heard” them from Brahmā through divine inspiration, rather than “composing” them like ordinary authors. Here, however, the Buddha says they were “authors” (_kattāro_). The Buddha adopted _isi_ in the sense “enlightened sage”.
dn3:2.8.2	You might imagine that, since you’ve learned their hymns by heart in your own tradition, that makes you a seer or someone on the path to becoming a seer. But that is not possible.	NA
dn3:2.9.1	What do you think, Ambaṭṭha?	NA
dn3:2.9.2	According to what you have heard from elderly and senior brahmins, the tutors of tutors,	NA
dn3:2.9.3	did those ancient brahmin seers—	NA
dn3:2.9.4	nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed, bedecked with jewels, earrings, and bracelets, dressed in white—amuse themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, like you do today in your tradition?”	NA
dn3:2.9.5	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn3:2.10.1	NA	NA
dn3:2.10.2	“Did they eat boiled fine rice, garnished with clean meat, with the dark grains picked out, served with many soups and sauces, like you do today in your tradition?”	NA
dn3:2.10.3	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn3:2.10.4	NA	NA
dn3:2.10.5	“Did they amuse themselves with girls wearing thongs that show off their curves, like you do today in your tradition?”	_Veṭhakanatapassāhi_ is otherwise unattested. At [mn55:12.4]() _veṭhaka_ evidently means “collar”. In the Lokuttaravāda Bhikṣuṇī Vinaya, the brazen nun Thullānandā gets out of the water and wraps herself in a _veṭhaka_, which here seems synonymous with _paṭṭaka_, a strip of cloth. It is allowable if used to tie a basket ([Lo Bi Pn 3](https://suttacentral.net/san-lo-bi-pn3)). _Nata_ is “curve”, _passa_ is “side, flank”. Walshe has “flounces and furbelows”, Rhys Davids has “fringes and furbelows round their loins”. These are prissy descriptions of what is evidently stripper gear.
dn3:2.10.6	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn3:2.10.7	NA	NA
dn3:2.10.8	“Did they drive about in chariots drawn by mares with plaited manes, whipping and lashing them onward with long goads, like you do today in your tradition?”	The Buddha calls back to earlier in the sutta, where Ambaṭṭha drove a mare-drawn chariot ([dn3:1.6.1]()). | The verbs here (_vitudenti vitacchenti_) are elsewhere applied to the pecking and slashing of vultures, crows, or hawks ([sn19.1:3.2](), [mn54:16.2](), etc.). The Buddha was disgusted with this maltreatment of the mares.
dn3:2.10.9	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn3:2.10.10	NA	NA
dn3:2.10.11	“Did they get men with long swords to guard them in fortresses with moats dug and barriers in place, like you do today in your tradition?”	Remembering that Pokkharasāti lived in a wealthy property that was a royal endowment. Just as today, excessive wealth breeds insecurity.
dn3:2.10.12	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn3:2.10.13	“So, Ambaṭṭha, in your own tradition you are neither seer nor someone on the path to becoming a seer.	NA
dn3:2.10.14	Whoever has any doubt or uncertainty about me, let them ask me and I will clear up their doubts with my answer.”	The Buddha has been hard on Ambaṭṭha, but he is not unfair. He invites the same level of scrutiny for himself.
dn3:2.11.0	7. Seeing the Two Marks	NA
dn3:2.11.1	Then the Buddha came out of his dwelling and proceeded to begin walking mindfully,	This transition occurs nowhere else.
dn3:2.11.2	and Ambaṭṭha did likewise.	NA
dn3:2.11.3	Then while walking beside the Buddha, Ambaṭṭha scrutinized his body for the thirty-two marks of a great man.	Finally he remembers what his teacher Pokkharasāti told him in [dn3:1.5.2](): he will know the Buddha by his marks.
dn3:2.11.4	He saw all of them except for two,	NA
dn3:2.11.5	which he had doubts about:	NA
dn3:2.11.6	whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.	NA
dn3:2.12.1	Then it occurred to the Buddha,	NA
dn3:2.12.2	“This student Ambaṭṭha sees all the marks except for two,	NA
dn3:2.12.3	which he has doubts about:	NA
dn3:2.12.4	whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.”	NA
dn3:2.12.5	Then the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Ambaṭṭha would see his private parts covered in a foreskin.	This exceedingly strange “miracle” is also found at [mn91:7.1](), [mn92:14.1](), and [snp3.7:11.5]().
dn3:2.12.6	And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue.	NA
dn3:2.12.7	Then Ambaṭṭha thought,	NA
dn3:2.12.8	“The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks completely, lacking none.”	NA
dn3:2.12.9	He said to the Buddha,	NA
dn3:2.12.10	“Well, now, sir, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.”	NA
dn3:2.12.11	“Please, Ambaṭṭha, go at your convenience.”	NA
dn3:2.12.12	Then Ambaṭṭha mounted his chariot drawn by mares and left.	NA
dn3:2.13.1	Now at that time the brahmin Pokkharasāti had come out from Ukkaṭṭhā together with a large group of brahmins and was sitting in his own park just waiting for Ambaṭṭha.	NA
dn3:2.13.2	Then Ambaṭṭha entered the park.	NA
dn3:2.14.1	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the brahmin Pokkharasāti on foot. He bowed and sat down to one side, and Pokkharasāti said to him:	NA
dn3:2.14.2	“I hope, dear Ambaṭṭha, you saw the worthy Gotama?”	NA
dn3:2.14.3	“I saw him, sir.”	NA
dn3:2.14.4	“Well, does he live up to his reputation or not?”	NA
dn3:2.14.5	NA	NA
dn3:2.14.6	“He does, sir.	NA
dn3:2.14.7	The worthy Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks completely, lacking none.”	NA
dn3:2.14.8	“And did you have some discussion with him?”	NA
dn3:2.14.9	“I did.”	NA
dn3:2.14.10	“And what kind of discussion did you have with him?”	NA
dn3:2.14.11	Then Ambaṭṭha informed Pokkharasāti of all they had discussed.	NA
dn3:2.15.1	Then Pokkharasāti said to Ambaṭṭha,	NA
dn3:2.15.2	“Oh, our bloody fake scholar, our fake learned man, who pretends to be proficient in the three Vedas! A man who behaves like this ought, when their body breaks up, after death, to be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	The diminutive ending for _paṇḍitaka_ is the same as in _samaṇaka_, which Ambaṭṭha used of the Buddha. | For _re_ (“bloody”), compare _cara pi re_ at [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.35]() and _he je kāḷī_ at [mn21:9.13](). Hard as the Buddha was on Ambaṭṭha, his own teacher was harder.
dn3:2.15.3	It’s only because you repeatedly attacked the worthy Gotama like that that he kept bringing up charges against us!”	Pokkharasāti shows his astuteness, for in many other dialogues the Buddha engaged with brahmins perfectly politely, as he does in the next sutta ([dn4]()).
dn3:2.15.4	Angry and upset, he kicked Ambaṭṭha over,	Illustrating the lack of restraint of even a senior brahmin teacher.
dn3:2.15.5	and wanted to go and see the Buddha right away.	NA
dn3:2.16.0	8. Pokkharasāti Visits the Buddha	NA
dn3:2.16.1	Then those brahmins said to Pokkharasāti,	NA
dn3:2.16.2	“It’s much too late to visit the ascetic Gotama today.	NA
dn3:2.16.3	You can visit him tomorrow.”	Given Pokkharasāti’s mood, this was probably a diplomatic move.
dn3:2.16.4	So Pokkharasāti had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home. Then he mounted a carriage and, with attendants carrying torches, set out from Ukkaṭṭhā for the forest near Icchānaṅgala.	_Khādanīya_ and _bhojanīya_ are food categories commonly mentioned in Pali. Etymologically they stem from “hard and soft”. _Bhojanīya_ is defined in [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc37:2.1.10]() as grain, porridge, flour products, fish, and meat, thus being foods that are typically eaten cooked and “mooshed up” in with the fingers in the bowl. _Khādanīya_ is not so readily defined, being essentially everything not included in other categories. But it would have included such “crunchy” things as fruit and vegetables, which may be eaten uncooked.
dn3:2.17.1	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot. He went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,	NA
dn3:2.17.2	“Master Gotama, has my resident pupil, the student Ambaṭṭha, come here?”	NA
dn3:2.17.3	“Yes he has, brahmin.”	NA
dn3:2.17.4	“And did you have some discussion with him?”	NA
dn3:2.17.5	“I did.”	NA
dn3:2.17.6	“And what kind of discussion did you have with him?”	Pokkharasāti makes sure he hears both sides of the story.
dn3:2.17.7	Then the Buddha informed Pokkharasāti of all they had discussed.	NA
dn3:2.17.8	Then Pokkharasāti said to the Buddha,	NA
dn3:2.17.9	“Ambaṭṭha is a fool, worthy Gotama. Please forgive him.”	So far has Ambaṭṭha fallen from the learned sage we were introduced to at the start of the sutta.
dn3:2.17.10	“May the student Ambaṭṭha be happy, brahmin.”	The Buddha bears no ill will. _Sukhī hotu_ is one of the most recognizable Pali phrases, but in early texts it is spoken only a few times: by the Buddha at [dn21:1.8.8]() and [snp5.1:54.1](); by Punabbasu’s Mother at [sn10.7:10.1](); and by various women at [pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.4.8]().
dn3:2.18.1	Then Pokkharasāti scrutinized the Buddha’s body for the thirty-two marks of a great man.	NA
dn3:2.18.2	He saw all of them except for two,	NA
dn3:2.18.3	which he had doubts about:	NA
dn3:2.18.4	whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.	NA
dn3:2.18.5	Then it occurred to the Buddha,	NA
dn3:2.18.6	“Pokkharasāti sees all the marks except for two,	NA
dn3:2.18.7	which he has doubts about:	NA
dn3:2.18.8	whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.”	NA
dn3:2.18.9	Then the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Pokkharasāti would see his private parts covered in a foreskin.	NA
dn3:2.18.10	And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue.	NA
dn3:2.19.1	Pokkharasāti thought,	NA
dn3:2.19.2	“The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks completely, lacking none.”	NA
dn3:2.19.3	He said to the Buddha,	NA
dn3:2.19.4	“Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept today’s meal from me?”	NA
dn3:2.19.5	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
dn3:2.20.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Pokkharasāti announced the time to him,	NA
dn3:2.20.2	“It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.”	NA
dn3:2.20.3	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Pokkharasāti together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out.	“Robed up” because inside the monastery, monks would normally wear just a lower robe, and would don the upper and (sometimes) outer robes when visiting a layperson’s home.
dn3:2.20.4	Then Pokkharasāti served and satisfied the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods, while his young students served the Saṅgha.	NA
dn3:2.20.5	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Pokkharasāti took a low seat and sat to one side.	NA
dn3:2.21.1	Then the Buddha taught him step by step, with	NA
dn3:2.21.2	a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation.	While all these teachings feature commonly in the suttas, there is no text that depicts this framework in detail.
dn3:2.21.3	And when the Buddha knew that Pokkharasāti’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas:	NA
dn3:2.21.4	suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.	This is the briefest expression of the four noble truths.
dn3:2.21.5	Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye,	NA
dn3:2.21.6	in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the brahmin Pokkharasāti:	This indicates that he became a stream-enterer (_sotāpanna_), the first of four stages of Awakening. Such details of personal attainment are typically found in the narrative rather than the teaching attributed to the Buddha, and hence were added by redactors at some point. They vary considerably in different versions. In this case, the parallel at DA 20 says that he became a stream-enterer and later a non-returner. T 20 said that he understood the teaching and went for refuge, and agrees that he became a non-returner before his death.
dn3:2.21.7	“Everything that has a beginning has an end.”	This is the insight into universal impermanence and dependent origination.
dn3:2.22.0	9. Pokkharasāti Declares Himself a Lay Follower	NA
dn3:2.22.1	Then Pokkharasāti saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha,	NA
dn3:2.22.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	NA
dn3:2.22.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, just so has the worthy Gotama made the Teaching clear in many ways.	NA
dn3:2.22.4	Together with my children, wives, retinue, and ministers, I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
dn3:2.22.5	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.	NA
dn3:2.22.6	Just as the worthy Gotama visits other devoted families in Ukkaṭṭhā, may he visit mine.	When wandering for alms, mendicants would often roam randomly through the village (_sapadānacārī_). However if an invitation such as this were issued, the mendicant may visit that place for a meal. It was considered a special ascetic practice to refuse such invitations. The same invitation was issued by Lohicca to Mahākaccāna at [sn35.132:14.7]().
dn3:2.22.7	The brahmin boys and girls there will bow to you, rise in your presence, give you a seat and water, and gain confidence in their hearts. That will be for their lasting welfare and happiness.”	_Māṇavikā_ is also mentioned at [mn56:27.1]() and [ud2.6:1.3]() of a young married woman; and at [an5.192:8.5]() of a baby being born. Thus it does not seem that it meant “female student of the Vedas”.
dn3:2.22.8	“That’s nice of you to say, householder.”	_Kalyāṇaṁ vuccati_ is a politely ambiguous phrase. It is spoken twice elsewhere in the Pali, and both times the mendicant who said it immediately departed and never returned ([sn41.3:7.13](), [sn41.4:6.7]()).
dn4:0.1	Long Discourses 4	NA
dn4:0.2	With Soṇadaṇḍa	NA
dn4:1.0	1. The Brahmins and Householders of Campā	NA
dn4:1.1	So I have heard.	This sutta shows how the conversion of Pokkharasāti in [dn3]() affected the brahmins as far away as Campā.
dn4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Aṅgas together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at Campā,	Campā is modern Champapuri near Bhagalpur in Bihar state, not far from West Bengal. It is near the eastern-most reach of the Buddha’s journeys. Campā was the capital of Aṅga, one of the sixteen “great nations” (_mahājanapadā_). It was a flourishing trade center at which Northern Black Polished Ware has been found, and became a sacred city for the Jains.
dn4:1.3	where he stayed by the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond.	_Gaggarā_, an onomatopoeic reduplication (“gargle”), is the name of a number of rivers and whirlpools in Sanskrit (cp. the modern Ghaggar River in north-west India).
dn4:1.4	Now at that time the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa was living in Campā. It was a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.	Here we see how the endowment of _brahmadeyya_ helped the king of Magadha establish his influence over the Aṅgas.
dn4:2.1	The brahmins and householders of Campā heard:	“Householders” (_gahapati_) is literal; it means land owners. Thus the “brahmins and householders” (not “brahmin householders”) were the wealthy class.
dn4:2.2	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Campā and is staying on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond.	NA
dn4:2.3	He has this good reputation:	NA
dn4:2.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
dn4:2.5	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	NA
dn4:2.6	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
dn4:2.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	NA
dn4:2.8	Then, having departed Campā, they formed into companies and headed to the Gaggarā Lotus Pond.	NA
dn4:3.1	Now at that time the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap.	NA
dn4:3.2	He saw the brahmins and householders heading for the lotus pond,	NA
dn4:3.3	and addressed his butler,	NA
dn4:3.4	“My butler, why are the brahmins and householders headed for the Gaggarā Lotus Pond?”	NA
dn4:3.5	“The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Campā and is staying on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond.	NA
dn4:3.6	He has this good reputation:	NA
dn4:3.7	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
dn4:3.8	They’re going to see that worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn4:3.9	“Well then, go to the brahmins and householders and say to them:	NA
dn4:3.10	‘Sirs, the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa asks	NA
dn4:3.11	you to wait, as he will also go to see the ascetic Gotama.’”	NA
dn4:3.12	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied the butler, and did as he was asked.	NA
dn4:3.13	NA	NA
dn4:3.14	NA	NA
dn4:4.0	2. The Qualities of Soṇadaṇḍa	NA
dn4:4.1	Now at that time around five hundred brahmins from abroad were residing in Campā on some business.	NA
dn4:4.2	They heard that	NA
dn4:4.3	the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa was going to see the ascetic Gotama.	NA
dn4:4.4	They approached Soṇadaṇḍa and said to him,	NA
dn4:4.5	“Is it really true that you are going to see the ascetic Gotama?”	NA
dn4:4.6	“Yes, gentlemen, it is true.”	NA
dn4:4.7	NA	NA
dn4:5.1	“Please don’t, worthy Soṇadaṇḍa!	NA
dn4:5.2	It’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama.	Both the repetition below and the parallel at [mn95:8.3]() include the phrase “it’s appropriate that he comes to see you”. It may have been omitted here by mistake.
dn4:5.3	For if you do so, your reputation will diminish and his will increase.	NA
dn4:5.4	For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama;	NA
dn4:5.5	it’s appropriate that he comes to see you.	NA
dn4:5.6	You are well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation.	_Jātivāda_ is sometimes translated as “doctrine of birth”, but the context here shows this cannot be the case. It refers to the genealogical records of the family lineage.
dn4:5.7	For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama;	NA

dn4:5.11	You are attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. You are magnificent and splendid as the Divinity, remarkable to behold. …	For Mahāsaṅgīti _vacchasī_ read _vaccasī_ (Sanskrit _varcasin_), “possessing splendor”.
dn4:5.12	You are ethical, mature in ethical conduct. …	NA
dn4:5.13	You’re a good speaker who enunciates well, with a polished, clear, and articulate voice that expresses the meaning. …	NA
dn4:5.14	You tutor the tutors of many, and teach three hundred young students to recite the hymns. Many students come from various districts and countries for the sake of the hymns, wishing to learn the hymns. …	Notice that the royal endowment was not just for a luxury residence, it was the site of a major international college. Kings invested in education.

dn4:6.0	3. The Qualities of the Buddha	NA
dn4:6.1	When they had spoken, Soṇadaṇḍa said to those brahmins:	NA
dn4:6.2	“Well then, gentlemen, listen to why it’s appropriate for me to go to see the ascetic Gotama,	NA
dn4:6.3	and it’s not appropriate for him to come to see me.	NA
dn4:6.4	He is well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation.	NA
dn4:6.5	For this reason it’s not appropriate for the ascetic Gotama to come to see me;	NA

dn4:6.8	When he went forth he abandoned abundant gold, both coined and uncoined, stored above and below ground. …	NA
dn4:6.9	He went forth from the lay life to homelessness while still a youth, young, with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life. …	NA
dn4:6.10	Though his mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces, he shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. …	Later tradition says that the young Siddhattha sneaked out of his home to avoid creating such a scene, but the early texts say he left despite his parents’ weeping.
dn4:6.11	He is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He is magnificent and splendid as the Divinity, remarkable to behold. …	NA
dn4:6.12	He is ethical, possessing ethical conduct that is noble and skillful. …	NA
dn4:6.13	He’s a good speaker who enunciates well, with a polished, clear, and articulate voice that expresses the meaning. …	NA
dn4:6.14	He’s a tutor of tutors. …	NA

dn4:6.17	He went forth from an eminent family of unbroken aristocratic lineage. …	NA
dn4:6.18	He went forth from a rich, affluent, and wealthy family. …	NA
dn4:6.19	People come from distant lands and distant countries to question him. …	NA
dn4:6.20	Many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to him. …	NA
dn4:6.21	He has this good reputation:	NA
dn4:6.22	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ …	NA
dn4:6.23	He has the thirty-two marks of a great man. …	NA
dn4:6.24	He is welcoming, congenial, polite, smiling, open, the first to speak. …	This description is applied to the Buddha at [dn5:7.24](), and to the corrupt but superficially charming monks Assaji and Punabbasuka at [pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.3.4]().
dn4:6.25	He’s honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by the four assemblies. …	This would be the assemblies of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics ([an5.213:3.1]()), rather than the Buddha’s four assemblies of monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen ([an4.129]()).
dn4:6.26	Many gods and humans are devoted to him. …	NA
dn4:6.27	While he is residing in a village or town, non-human entities do not harass them. …	NA
dn4:6.28	He leads an order and a community, and tutors a community, and is said to be the best of the various religious founders. He didn’t come by his fame in the same ways as those other ascetics and brahmins.	_Titthakara_, literally “ford-maker”, is a term restricted to those such as the Buddha who founded a religion, or Mahāvīra who was a major reformer on the same level as a founder.
dn4:6.29	Rather, he came by his fame due to his supreme knowledge and conduct. …	NA
dn4:6.30	King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. …	Bimbisāra’s refuge is at [pli-tv-kd1:22.11.4]().

dn4:6.34	King Pasenadi of Kosala …	NA
dn4:6.35	and the brahmin Pokkharasāti.	NA
dn4:6.36	The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Campā and is staying at the Gaggarā Lotus Pond.	NA
dn4:6.37	Any ascetic or brahmin who comes to stay in our village district is our guest,	NA
dn4:6.38	and should be honored and respected as such.	NA
dn4:6.39	NA	NA
dn4:6.40	NA	NA
dn4:6.41	For this reason, too, it’s not appropriate for the worthy Gotama to come to see me;	NA
dn4:6.42	rather, it’s appropriate for me to go to see him.	NA
dn4:6.43	This is the extent of the worthy Gotama’s praise that I have memorized. But his praises are not confined to this,	NA
dn4:6.44	for the praise of the worthy Gotama is limitless.”	NA
dn4:6.45	When he had spoken, those brahmins said to him,	NA
dn4:6.46	“According to Soṇadaṇḍa’s praises, if the worthy Gotama were staying within a hundred leagues, it’d be worthwhile for a faithful gentleman to go to see him, even if he had to carry his own provisions in a knapsack.”	“Knapsack” is _puṭosa_, where _puṭa_ is “bag” and _osa_ is “food” (Sanskrit _avasa_). The compound is a dative-dependent _tappurisa_ with reversal of the usual order, yielding the sense “bag for food”.
dn4:6.47	“Well then, gentlemen, let’s all go to see the ascetic Gotama.”	NA
dn4:7.0	4. Soṇadaṇḍa Has Second Thoughts	NA
dn4:7.1	Then Soṇadaṇḍa together with a large group of brahmins went to see the Buddha.	NA
dn4:8.1	But as he reached the far side of the forest, this thought came to mind,	NA
dn4:8.2	“Suppose I was to ask the ascetic Gotama a question.	NA
dn4:8.3	He might say to me:	NA
dn4:8.4	‘Brahmin, you shouldn’t ask your question like that. This is how you should ask it.’ And the assembly might disparage me for that:	NA
dn4:8.5	‘Soṇadaṇḍa is foolish and incompetent. He’s not able to ask the ascetic Gotama a rational question.’	Even before he meets him, Soṇadaṇḍa has extensive knowledge of the Buddha and faith in him. It’s also notable how Soṇadaṇḍa gives Pokkharasāti a special status. Perhaps Pokkharasāti told Soṇadaṇḍa of the encounter with Ambaṭṭha in [dn3](), which would explain his hesitation. | Note the use of the term _yoniso_ here, which I render “rational”. The basic meaning of the term is “womb, source”, and it is used to mean “with reason”, which here has the sense “pertinent, relevant”.
dn4:8.6	And when you’re disparaged by the assembly, your reputation diminishes.	NA
dn4:8.7	When your reputation diminishes, your wealth also diminishes.	NA
dn4:8.8	But my wealth relies on my reputation.	NA
dn4:8.9	Or if the ascetic Gotama asks me a question, I might not satisfy him with my answer.	NA
dn4:8.10	He might say to me:	NA
dn4:8.11	‘Brahmin, you shouldn’t answer the question like that. This is how you should answer it.’ And the assembly might disparage me for that:	NA
dn4:8.12	‘Soṇadaṇḍa is foolish and incompetent. He’s not able to satisfy the ascetic Gotama’s mind with his answer.’	NA
dn4:8.13	And when you’re disparaged by the assembly, your reputation diminishes.	NA
dn4:8.14	When your reputation diminishes, your wealth also diminishes.	NA
dn4:8.15	But my wealth relies on my reputation.	NA
dn4:8.16	On the other hand, if I were to turn back after having come so far without having seen the ascetic Gotama, the assembly might disparage me for that:	NA
dn4:8.17	‘Soṇadaṇḍa is foolish and incompetent. He’s stuck-up and scared. He doesn’t dare to go and see the ascetic Gotama. For how on earth can he turn back after having come so far without having seen the ascetic Gotama!’	NA
dn4:8.18	And when you’re disparaged by the assembly, your reputation diminishes.	NA
dn4:8.19	When your reputation diminishes, your wealth also diminishes.	NA
dn4:8.20	But my wealth relies on my reputation.”	NA
dn4:9.1	Then Soṇadaṇḍa went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	For all his previous avowal of faith, Soṇadaṇḍa is merely polite, not reverential. This foreshadows the ending.
dn4:9.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.	NA
dn4:9.3	Before sitting down to one side, some of the brahmins and householders of Campā bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.	This stock passage indicates different attitudes towards the Buddha, and perhaps also different social status. Examples of such behaviors are given in Dharmaśāstras. While they might not exactly apply to this situation, they do indicate that these behaviors were nuanced and deliberate. Here is an example: “One should rise to greet a sacrificial priest, father-in-law, paternal uncle, or maternal uncle who is younger than oneself, but not verbally salute him. Likewise, one should rise to greet, but not verbally salute a different fellow-citizen who is older than oneself—even a Śūdra provided he is at least eighty—if one is equal in age to his son. And a Śūdra should rise to greet, but not verbally salute an Ārya, even if he is younger than himself.”  (Gautama 6.9–11, translation David Brick).
dn4:10.1	But while sitting there, Soṇadaṇḍa continued to be plagued by many second thoughts. He thought,	NA
dn4:10.2	NA	NA
dn4:10.3	NA	NA
dn4:10.4	NA	NA
dn4:10.5	NA	NA
dn4:10.6	NA	NA

dn4:10.13	NA	NA
dn4:10.14	NA	NA
dn4:10.15	NA	NA
dn4:10.16	“If only the ascetic Gotama would ask me about my own tutor’s scriptural heritage of the three Vedas! Then I could definitely satisfy his mind with my answer.”	NA
dn4:11.0	5. What Makes a Brahmin	NA
dn4:11.1	Then the Buddha, knowing Soṇadaṇḍa’s train of thought, thought,	NA
dn4:11.2	“This brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa is troubled by his own thoughts.	NA
dn4:11.3	Why don’t I ask him about his own tutor’s scriptural heritage of the three Vedas?”	The Buddha goes out of his way to make him comfortable. Soṇadaṇḍa is nervous and overly eager to please, but he is not contemptuous and grinding a personal ax like Ambaṭṭha.
dn4:11.4	So he said to Soṇadaṇḍa,	NA
dn4:11.5	“Brahmin, how many factors must a brahmin possess for the brahmins to describe him as a brahmin;	NA
dn4:11.6	and so that when he says ‘I am a brahmin’ he speaks rightly, without falling into falsehood?”	NA
dn4:12.1	Then Soṇadaṇḍa thought,	NA
dn4:12.2	“The ascetic Gotama has asked me about exactly what I wanted, what I wished for, what I desired, what I yearned for; that is, my own scriptural heritage.	NA
dn4:12.3	NA	NA
dn4:12.4	I can definitely satisfy his mind with my answer.”	NA
dn4:13.1	Then Soṇadaṇḍa straightened his back, looked around the assembly, and said to the Buddha,	NA
dn4:13.2	“Worthy Gotama, a brahmin must possess five factors for the brahmins to describe him as a brahmin;	NA
dn4:13.3	and so that when he says ‘I am a brahmin’ he speaks rightly, without falling into falsehood.	NA
dn4:13.4	What five?	NA
dn4:13.5	It’s when a brahmin is well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation.	NA
dn4:13.6	He recites and remembers the hymns, and has mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knows them word-by-word, and their grammar. He is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.	NA
dn4:13.7	He is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He is magnificent and splendid as the Divinity, remarkable to behold.	NA
dn4:13.8	He is ethical, mature in ethical conduct.	NA
dn4:13.9	He’s astute and clever, being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle.	_Suja_ (Sanskrit _sruc_) was a large wooden ladle for pouring ghee on to the sacred flame.
dn4:13.10	These are the five factors which a brahmin must possess for the brahmins to describe him as a brahmin;	NA
dn4:13.11	and so that when he says ‘I am a brahmin’ he speaks rightly, without falling into falsehood.”	NA
dn4:14.1	“But brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these five factors and still rightly describe someone as a brahmin?”	The Buddha uses “Socratic method”. He has the other person articulate a view, then leads them to refine their view, leading to a clearer vision of the truth.
dn4:14.2	NA	NA
dn4:14.3	“It is possible, worthy Gotama.	NA
dn4:14.4	We could leave appearance out of the five factors.	NA
dn4:14.5	For what does appearance matter?	NA

dn4:16.2	NA	NA
dn4:16.3	“It is possible, worthy Gotama.	NA
dn4:16.4	We could leave birth out of the three factors.	NA
dn4:16.5	For what does birth matter?	NA
dn4:16.6	It’s when a brahmin is ethical, mature in ethical conduct;	NA
dn4:16.7	and he’s astute and clever, being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle.	NA
dn4:16.8	A brahmin must possess these two factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a brahmin.”	NA
dn4:16.9	NA	NA
dn4:17.1	When he had spoken, those brahmins said to him,	NA
dn4:17.2	“Please don’t say that, worthy Soṇadaṇḍa, please don’t say that!	NA
dn4:17.3	You’re just condemning appearance, the hymns, and birth! You’re totally going over to the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine!”	NA
dn4:18.1	So the Buddha said to them,	NA
dn4:18.2	“Well, brahmins, if you think that	NA
dn4:18.3	Soṇadaṇḍa is unlearned, a poor speaker, witless, and not capable of debating with me about this, then leave him aside and you can debate with me.	NA
dn4:18.4	But if you think that	NA
dn4:18.5	he’s learned, a good speaker who enunciates well, astute, and capable of debating with me about this, then you should stand aside and let him debate with me.”	NA
dn4:19.1	When he said this, Soṇadaṇḍa said to the Buddha,	NA
dn4:19.2	“Let it be, worthy Gotama, be silent. I myself will respond to them in a legitimate manner.”	NA
dn4:19.3	Then he said to those brahmins,	NA
dn4:19.4	“Don’t say this, good fellows, don’t say this:	NA
dn4:19.5	‘You’re just condemning appearance, the hymns, and birth! You’re totally going over to the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine!’	NA
dn4:19.6	I’m not condemning appearance, hymns, or birth.”	NA
dn4:20.1	Now at that time Soṇadaṇḍa’s nephew, the young student Aṅgaka was sitting in that assembly.	NA
dn4:20.2	Then Soṇadaṇḍa said to those brahmins,	NA
dn4:20.3	“Gentlemen, do you see my nephew, the young student Aṅgaka?”	NA
dn4:20.4	“Yes, sir.”	NA
dn4:20.5	“Aṅgaka is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He is magnificent and splendid as the Divinity, remarkable to behold. There’s no-one in this assembly so good-looking, apart from the ascetic Gotama.	NA
dn4:20.6	Aṅgaka recites and remembers the hymns, and has mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knows them word-by-word, and their grammar. He is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.	NA
dn4:20.7	And I am the one who teaches him the hymns.	NA
dn4:20.8	Aṅgaka is well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation.	NA
dn4:20.9	And I know his mother and father.	NA
dn4:20.10	But if Aṅgaka were to kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie, and drink liquor, then what’s the use of his appearance, his hymns, or his birth?	NA
dn4:20.11	It’s when a brahmin is ethical, mature in ethical conduct;	NA
dn4:20.12	and he’s astute and clever, being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle.	NA
dn4:20.13	A brahmin must possess these two factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a brahmin.”	NA

dn4:21.0	6. The Discussion of Ethics and Wisdom	NA
dn4:21.1	“But brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these two factors and still rightly describe someone as a brahmin?”	NA
dn4:21.2	NA	NA
dn4:21.3	“No, worthy Gotama.	NA
dn4:21.4	For wisdom is cleansed by ethics, and ethics are cleansed by wisdom.	NA
dn4:21.5	Ethics and wisdom always go together.	NA
dn4:21.6	An ethical person is wise, and a wise person ethical.	NA
dn4:21.7	And ethics and wisdom are said to be the best things in the world.	NA
dn4:21.8	It’s just like when you clean one hand with the other, or clean one foot with the other.	NA
dn4:21.9	In the same way, wisdom is cleansed by ethics, and ethics are cleansed by wisdom.	NA
dn4:21.10	Ethics and wisdom always go together.	NA
dn4:21.11	An ethical person is wise, and a wise person ethical.	NA
dn4:21.12	And ethics and wisdom are said to be the best things in the world.”	NA
dn4:22.1	“That’s so true, brahmin, that’s so true! For wisdom is cleansed by ethics, and ethics are cleansed by wisdom.	When the Buddha convinces Soṇadaṇḍa, he does not crow over it or take pleasure in his discomfort, but praises his wisdom and affirms his conclusions.
dn4:22.2	Ethics and wisdom always go together.	NA
dn4:22.3	An ethical person is wise, and a wise person ethical.	NA
dn4:22.4	And ethics and wisdom are said to be the best things in the world.	NA
dn4:22.5	It’s just like when you clean one hand with the other, or clean one foot with the other.	NA

dn4:22.7	Ethics and wisdom always go together.	NA
dn4:22.8	An ethical person is wise, and a wise person ethical.	NA
dn4:22.9	And ethics and wisdom are said to be the best things in the world.	NA
dn4:22.10	But what, brahmin, is that ethical conduct?	The Buddha has taken pains to establish common ground, but Soṇadaṇḍa’s description of wisdom is lacking, so the Buddha prompts a deeper inquiry.
dn4:22.11	And what is that wisdom?”	NA
dn4:22.12	“That’s all I know about this matter, worthy Gotama.	NA
dn4:22.13	May the worthy Gotama himself please clarify the meaning of this.”	NA
dn4:23.1	“Well then, brahmin, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
dn4:23.2	“Yes, worthy sir,” Soṇadaṇḍa replied.	NA
dn4:23.3	The Buddha said this:	NA
dn4:23.4	“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha …	NA
dn4:23.5	That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics.	NA
dn4:23.6	This, brahmin, is that ethical conduct. …	NA
dn4:23.7	They enter and remain in the first absorption …	Normally, the Buddha frames his teaching as ethics, meditation, and wisdom, but here he adapts to Soṇadaṇḍa’s framing and places meditation under wisdom.
dn4:23.8	second absorption …	NA
dn4:23.9	third absorption …	NA
dn4:23.10	fourth absorption …	NA
dn4:23.11	They project and extend the mind toward knowledge and vision …	NA
dn4:23.12	This pertains to their wisdom. …	NA
dn4:23.13	They understand: ‘… there is nothing further for this place.’	NA
dn4:23.14	This pertains to their wisdom.	NA
dn4:23.15	This, brahmin, is that wisdom.”	NA
dn4:24.0	7. Soṇadaṇḍa Declares Himself a Lay Follower	NA
dn4:24.1	When he had spoken, Soṇadaṇḍa said to the Buddha,	NA
dn4:24.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	NA
dn4:24.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways.	NA
dn4:24.4	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
dn4:24.5	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.	NA
dn4:24.6	Would you and the mendicant Saṅgha please accept a meal from me tomorrow?”	NA
dn4:24.7	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
dn4:24.8	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Soṇadaṇḍa got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	NA
dn4:24.9	And when the night had passed Soṇadaṇḍa had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	NA
dn4:24.10	“It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.”	NA
dn4:25.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Soṇadaṇḍa together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out.	NA
dn4:25.2	Then Soṇadaṇḍa served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	NA
dn4:26.1	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Soṇadaṇḍa took a low seat and sat to one side.	NA
dn4:26.2	Seated to one side he said to the Buddha:	NA
dn4:26.3	“Worthy Gotama, if, when I have gone to an assembly, I rise from my seat and bow to the Buddha, that assembly might disparage me for that.	NA
dn4:26.4	And when you’re disparaged by the assembly, your reputation diminishes.	NA
dn4:26.5	When your reputation diminishes, your wealth also diminishes.	NA
dn4:26.6	But my wealth relies on my reputation.	NA
dn4:26.7	If, when I have gone to an assembly, I raise my joined palms, please take it that I have risen from my seat.	NA
dn4:26.8	And if I undo my turban, please take it that I have bowed.	NA
dn4:26.9	And the worthy Gotama, if, when I am in a carriage, I get down from my carriage and bow to the Buddha, that assembly might disparage me for that.	NA
dn4:26.10	NA	NA
dn4:26.11	NA	NA
dn4:26.12	If, when I am in a carriage, I hold up my goad, please take it that I have got down from my carriage.	NA
dn4:26.13	And if I lower my sunshade, please take it that I have bowed.”	Soṇadaṇḍa’s attachment to his reputation betrays his lack of inner confidence and stands in contrast with Pokkharasāti. Perhaps it may also be read as a regional characteristic, since Buddhism  was less well established in the Aṅga region than in central Magadha.
dn4:27.1	Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.	NA
dn5:0.1	Long Discourses 5	NA
dn5:0.2	With Kūṭadanta	NA
dn5:1.0	1. The Brahmins and Householders of Khāṇumata	NA
dn5:1.1	So I have heard.	When asked about sacrifice, the Buddha tells a story of how a king was persuaded to forgo cruelty and institute a constructive social policy of welfare instead.
dn5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Magadhans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Magadhan brahmins named Khāṇumata.	Khāṇumata is only mentioned here. It means “stumpy”, perhaps indicating that it was, or had recently been, a rough out-of-the-way place.
dn5:1.3	There he stayed nearby at Ambalaṭṭhikā.	The commentary says this was similar to the Ambalaṭṭhikā of [dn1:1.2.1]().
dn5:1.4	Now at that time the brahmin Kūṭadanta was living in Khāṇumata. It was a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.	Like the town Khāṇumata, the brahmin Kūṭadanta appears only here. His name means “pointy teeth”, but there is no evidence that he was a vampire.
dn5:1.5	Now at that time Kūṭadanta had prepared a great sacrifice.	NA
dn5:1.6	Bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats and rams—seven hundred of each—had been led to the post for the sacrifice.	At [snp2.7:26.1](), the sacrifice of cows in particular was said to be the nadir of decline for brahmins. When similar sacrifices are described elsewhere in the canon, the number is five hundred rather than seven hundred ([sn3.9:1.2](), [an7.47:1.2]()).
dn5:2.1	The brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata heard:	NA
dn5:2.2	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Khāṇumata and is staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā.	NA
dn5:2.3	He has this good reputation:	NA
dn5:2.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
dn5:2.5	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	NA
dn5:2.6	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
dn5:2.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	NA
dn5:2.8	Then, having departed Khāṇumata, they formed into companies and headed to Ambalaṭṭhikā.	NA
dn5:3.1	Now at that time the brahmin Kūṭadanta had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap.	NA
dn5:3.2	He saw the brahmins and householders heading for Ambalaṭṭhikā,	NA
dn5:3.3	and addressed his butler,	NA
dn5:3.4	“My butler, why are the brahmins and householders headed for Ambalaṭṭhikā?”	NA
dn5:3.5	“The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Khāṇumata and is staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā.	NA
dn5:3.6	He has this good reputation:	NA
dn5:3.7	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
dn5:3.8	They’re going to see that worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn5:4.1	Then Kūṭadanta thought,	NA
dn5:4.2	“I’ve heard that	NA
dn5:4.3	the ascetic Gotama knows how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories.	News of the Buddha had spread in Brahmanical circles. In [dn3]() we saw the Buddha use his rhetorical technique of adapting his teaching to reframe Brahmanical doctrines in order to establish a common ground. Here we see the downside to such techniques, as the details of the reframing have been lost.
dn5:4.4	I don’t know about that,	NA
dn5:4.5	but I wish to perform a great sacrifice.	NA
dn5:4.6	Why don’t I ask him how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories?”	No such sacrifice has been identified in Brahmanical texts.
dn5:4.7	Then Kūṭadanta addressed his butler,	NA
dn5:4.8	“Well then, go to the brahmins and householders and say to them:	NA
dn5:4.9	‘Sirs, the brahmin Kūṭadanta asks	NA
dn5:4.10	you to wait, as he will also go to see the ascetic Gotama.’”	NA
dn5:4.11	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied the butler, and did as he was asked.	NA
dn5:4.12	NA	NA
dn5:4.13	NA	NA
dn5:5.0	2. The Qualities of Kūṭadanta	NA
dn5:5.1	Now at that time several hundred brahmins were residing in Khāṇumata	NA
dn5:5.2	thinking to participate in Kūṭadanta’s sacrifice.	NA
dn5:5.3	They heard that	NA
dn5:5.4	Kūṭadanta was going to see the ascetic Gotama.	NA
dn5:5.5	They approached Kūṭadanta and said to him:	NA
dn5:5.6	“Is it really true that you are going to see the ascetic Gotama?”	NA
dn5:5.7	“Yes, gentlemen, it is true.”	NA
dn5:5.8	NA	NA
dn5:6.1	“Please don’t!	NA
dn5:6.2	It’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama.	NA
dn5:6.3	For if you do so, your reputation will diminish and his will increase.	NA
dn5:6.4	For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama;	NA
dn5:6.5	it’s appropriate that he comes to see you.	NA
dn5:6.6	You are well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation.	NA
dn5:6.7	For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama;	NA
dn5:6.8	it’s appropriate that he comes to see you.	NA
dn5:6.9	You’re rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain …	NA
dn5:6.10	You recite and remember the hymns, and have mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. You know them word-by-word, and their grammar. You are well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. …	NA

dn5:6.13	You’re a good speaker who enunciates well, with a polished, clear, and articulate voice that expresses the meaning. …	NA
dn5:6.14	You teach the tutors of many, and teach three hundred young students to recite the hymns. Many students come from various districts and countries for the sake of the hymns, wishing to learn the hymns. …	NA
dn5:6.15	You’re old, elderly and senior, advanced in years, and have reached the final stage of life.	NA
dn5:6.16	The ascetic Gotama is young, and has newly gone forth. …	NA
dn5:6.17	You’re honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by King Bimbisāra of Magadha …	NA
dn5:6.18	and the brahmin Pokkharasāti. …	NA
dn5:6.19	You live in Khāṇumata, a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.	NA
dn5:6.20	For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama;	NA
dn5:6.21	it’s appropriate that he comes to see you.”	NA
dn5:7.0	3. The Qualities of the Buddha	NA
dn5:7.1	When they had spoken, Kūṭadanta said to those brahmins:	NA
dn5:7.2	“Well then, gentlemen, listen to why it’s appropriate for me to go to see the ascetic Gotama,	NA
dn5:7.3	and it’s not appropriate for him to come to see me.	NA
dn5:7.4	He is well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation.	NA
dn5:7.5	For this reason it’s not appropriate for the ascetic Gotama to come to see me;	NA
dn5:7.6	rather, it’s appropriate for me to go to see him.	NA
dn5:7.7	When he went forth he abandoned a large family circle. …	NA
dn5:7.8	When he went forth he abandoned abundant gold, both coined and uncoined, stored above and below ground. …	NA
dn5:7.9	He went forth from the lay life to homelessness while still a youth, young, with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life. …	NA
dn5:7.10	Though his mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces, he shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. …	NA
dn5:7.11	He is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He is magnificent and splendid as the Divinity, remarkable to behold. …	NA
dn5:7.12	He is ethical, possessing ethical conduct that is noble and skillful. …	NA
dn5:7.13	He’s a good speaker who enunciates well, with a polished, clear, and articulate voice that expresses the meaning. …	NA
dn5:7.14	He’s a tutor of tutors. …	NA
dn5:7.15	He has ended sensual desire, and is rid of caprice. …	NA
dn5:7.16	He teaches the efficacy of deeds and action. He doesn’t wish any harm upon the community of brahmins. …	NA
dn5:7.17	He went forth from an eminent family of unbroken aristocratic lineage. …	NA
dn5:7.18	He went forth from a rich, affluent, and wealthy family. …	NA
dn5:7.19	People come from distant lands and distant countries to question him. …	NA
dn5:7.20	Many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to him. …	NA
dn5:7.21	He has this good reputation:	NA
dn5:7.22	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ …	NA
dn5:7.23	He has the thirty-two marks of a great man. …	NA
dn5:7.24	He is welcoming, congenial, polite, smiling, open, the first to speak. …	NA
dn5:7.25	He’s honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by the four assemblies. …	NA

dn5:7.27	While he is residing in a village or town, non-human entities do not harass them. …	NA
dn5:7.28	He leads an order and a community, and tutors a community, and is said to be the best of the various religious founders. He didn’t come by his fame in the same ways as those other ascetics and brahmins.	NA
dn5:7.29	Rather, he came by his fame due to his supreme knowledge and conduct. …	NA
dn5:7.30	King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. …	NA
dn5:7.31	King Pasenadi of Kosala and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. …	NA
dn5:7.32	The brahmin Pokkharasāti and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. …	NA
dn5:7.33	He’s honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by King Bimbisāra of Magadha …	NA
dn5:7.34	King Pasenadi of Kosala …	NA
dn5:7.35	and the brahmin Pokkharasāti.	NA
dn5:7.36	The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Khāṇumata and is staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā.	NA
dn5:7.37	Any ascetic or brahmin who comes to stay in our village district is our guest,	NA
dn5:7.38	and should be honored and respected as such.	NA
dn5:7.39	NA	NA
dn5:7.40	NA	NA
dn5:7.41	For this reason, too, it’s not appropriate for the worthy Gotama to come to see me,	NA
dn5:7.42	rather, it’s appropriate for me to go to see him.	NA
dn5:7.43	This is the extent of the worthy Gotama’s praise that I have memorized. But his praises are not confined to this,	NA
dn5:7.44	for the praise of the worthy Gotama is limitless.”	NA
dn5:7.45	When he had spoken, those brahmins said to him,	NA
dn5:7.46	“According to Kūṭadanta’s praises, if the worthy Gotama were staying within a hundred leagues, it’d be worthwhile for a faithful gentleman to go to see him, even if he had to carry his own provisions in a knapsack.”	NA
dn5:7.47	“Well then, gentlemen, let’s all go to see the ascetic Gotama.”	NA
dn5:8.0	4. The Story of King Mahāvijita’s Sacrifice	NA
dn5:8.1	Then Kūṭadanta together with a large group of brahmins went to see the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
dn5:8.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.	NA
dn5:8.3	Before sitting down to one side, some of the brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.	NA
dn5:9.1	Kūṭadanta said to the Buddha,	NA
dn5:9.2	“Worthy Gotama, I’ve heard that	NA
dn5:9.3	you know how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories.	NA
dn5:9.4	I don’t know about that,	NA
dn5:9.5	but I wish to perform a great sacrifice.	NA
dn5:9.6	Please teach me how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories.”	NA
dn5:9.7	“Well then, brahmin, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	Kūṭadanta’s proposal that the Buddha advise him on the sacrifice of 700 animals is outrageous. Nonetheless, the Buddha responds politely since Kūṭadanta is being polite. While it is tempting to see the sacrifice of animals by supposedly virtuous priests as sheer hypocrisy, the fact of sacrifice remains one of the most widespread and mysterious of human religious practices. In an empathetic work that addresses this squarely, Roberto Calasso’s *Ardor* sees the vast complex of Vedic ritual and theory as making plain the fact of killing so that the guilt may be contained, in contrast with our modern culture of killing on an industrial scale while hiding it out of sight.
dn5:9.8	“Yes, worthy sir,” Kūṭadanta replied.	NA
dn5:9.9	The Buddha said this:	NA
dn5:10.1	“Once upon a time, brahmin, there was a king named Mahāvijita. He was rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, lots of money and grain, and a full treasury and storehouses.	Mahāvijita means “Great Dominion”. He seems to be only known from this story. The idiom _bhūtapubbaṁ_ (literally “so it was in the past”) introduces legendary narratives of usually dubious historicity, like the English idiom “once upon a time”.
dn5:10.2	Then as King Mahāvijita was in private retreat this thought came to his mind:	In the Pali, meaningful thoughts often occur to people when withdrawn in seclusion. This doesn’t necessary mean they were in formal meditation.
dn5:10.3	‘I have achieved human wealth, and reign after conquering this vast territory. Why don’t I hold a large sacrifice? That will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’	The great sacrifices, especially the horse sacrifice, ensured royal authority. Their very scale and wastefulness showed off the wealth of the king.
dn5:10.4	Then he summoned the brahmin high priest and said to him:	“High priest” is _purohita_. He was a family chaplain advising and consecrating the royal family. The closeness of the relationship is shown by the fact that the royal family would take the lineage name of the _purohita_.
dn5:10.5	‘Just now, brahmin, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind,	NA
dn5:10.6	“I have achieved human wealth, and reign after conquering this vast territory. Why don’t I perform a great sacrifice? That will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”	NA
dn5:10.7	Brahmin, I wish to perform a great sacrifice.	NA
dn5:10.8	Please instruct me. It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’	NA
dn5:11.1	When he had spoken, the brahmin high priest said to him:	NA
dn5:11.2	‘Sir, the king’s realm is harried and oppressed. Raiding of villages, towns, and cities has been seen, and infesting of highways.	Then, as today, government policy was driven by the perception of rising crime rate. This whole passage is one of the Buddha’s most important statements on public policy. It is expressed through storytelling, giving a good example of how myths were invoked—and subverted—as rationales for current policy.
dn5:11.3	But if the king were to extract more taxes while his realm is thus harried and oppressed, he would not be doing his duty.	“Taxes” is _bali_. He would have had to press his people for the extra funds to hold the sacrifice.
dn5:11.4	Now the king might think,	NA
dn5:11.5	“I’ll eradicate this plague of savages by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment!” But that’s not the right way to eradicate this plague of savages.	“Plague of savages” (_dassukhīla_) is the only occurrence of Sanskrit _dasyu_ in early Pali. The _dasyu_ were inveterate foes of the Aryans in the Vedic period. Bereft of civilizing rites, scriptures, and observances, they were no children of Manu (Rig Veda 10.22.8). Their wiles (_māyā_) made them a potent threat (Rig Veda 4.16.9, 8.14.14, 10.73.5). Indra was invoked to ensure their destruction (Rig Veda *passim*; Atharva Veda 2.14.5, 4.32.3, 20.21.4, 20.37.5, 20.42.2). Legend has it that Agni and Soma first supported the _dasyu_ before being won over by Indra (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.6.3.13; see also 6.4.2.4). By the time of the Buddha the _dasyu_ have vanished except as a legendary foe of the past. Where the Brahmanical texts advocate the pitiless destruction of the _dasyu_, the brahmin high priest in the Buddhist text advocates an inclusive policy of social welfare.
dn5:11.6	Those who remain after the killing will return to harass the king’s realm.	The priest knows that the king will respond better to a pragmatic argument than a moral one.
dn5:11.7	Rather, here is a plan, relying on which the plague of savages will be properly uprooted.	Effective social policy requires a forward-thinking plan, not just reacting to grievances.
dn5:11.8	So let the king provide seed and fodder for those in the realm who work in growing crops and raising cattle.	The king should spend his own resources to support his citizens in the various occupations.
dn5:11.9	Let the king provide funding for those who work in trade.	NA
dn5:11.10	Let the king guarantee food and wages for those in government service.	NA
dn5:11.11	Then the people, occupied with their own work, will not harass the realm.	Here the priest identifies a fundamental cause of social unrest and disorder.
dn5:11.12	The king’s revenues will be great.	The king spends out of pocket, but the economy flourishes, so tax revenues increase even though he has not raised taxes. This is the essence of Keynesian economic theory.
dn5:11.13	When the country is secured as a sanctuary, free of being harried and oppressed, the happy people, with joy in their hearts, dancing with children at their breast, will dwell as if their houses were wide open.’	_Khema_ means a place of safety and sanctuary, where both humans and animals have no fear.
dn5:11.14	The king agreed with the high priest’s advice and followed his recommendation.	A good leader listens to advice.
dn5:11.15	NA	NA
dn5:11.16	NA	NA
dn5:11.17	NA	NA
dn5:11.18	NA	NA
dn5:11.19	Then the king summoned the brahmin high priest and said to him:	NA
dn5:11.20	‘I have eradicated the plague of savages. And relying on your plan my revenue is now great.	NA
dn5:11.21	Since the country is secured as a sanctuary, free of being harried and oppressed, the happy people, with joy in their hearts, dancing with children at their breast, dwell as if their houses were wide open.	NA
dn5:11.22	Brahmin, I wish to perform a great sacrifice.	NA
dn5:11.23	Please instruct me. It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’	NA
dn5:12.0	4.1. The Four Accessories	NA
dn5:12.1	‘In that case, let the king announce this throughout the realm to the aristocrat vassals of both town and country; the ministers and councillors of both town and country; the well-to-do brahmins of both town and country; and the well-off householders of both town and country.	Here the phrase “of both town and country” qualifies each group. At [an4.70:1.3](), however, “brahmins and householders” and “people of town and country” are separate groups of people. Elsewhere the context does not always decide between these two possibilities. Generally the idiom aims at inclusivity, as opposed to here where the king is consulting the rich and powerful, so I treat them as two separate groups, thus including the common folk.
dn5:12.2	“I wish to perform a great sacrifice. Please grant your approval, good fellows; it will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”	NA
dn5:12.3	The king agreed with the high priest’s advice and followed his recommendation.	NA
dn5:12.4	And all of the people who were thus informed responded by saying:	NA
dn5:12.5	‘May the king perform a sacrifice! It is time for a sacrifice, great king.’	NA
dn5:12.6	NA	NA
dn5:12.7	NA	NA
dn5:12.8	NA	NA
dn5:12.9	And so these four consenting factions became accessories to the sacrifice.	“Consenting factions” is _anumatipakkhā_. The king governs with the consent of his people, although only the landowning classes are considered.
dn5:13.0	4.2. The Eight Accessories	NA
dn5:13.1	King Mahāvijita possessed eight factors.	Royal authority is not based just on birth, conquest, ritual, or power, but on quality of character.
dn5:13.2	He was well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation.	NA
dn5:13.3	He was attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He was magnificent and splendid as the Divinity, remarkable to behold.	NA
dn5:13.4	He was rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, lots of money and grain, and a full treasury and storehouses.	NA
dn5:13.5	He was powerful, having an army of four divisions that was obedient and carried out instructions. He’d probably prevail over his enemies just with his reputation.	Read _sahati_ (“prevails”) over the several variants.
dn5:13.6	He was faithful, generous, a donor, his door always open. He was a well-spring of support, making merit with ascetics and brahmins, for paupers, vagrants, supplicants, and beggars.	NA
dn5:13.7	He was very learned in diverse fields of learning. He understood the meaning of diverse statements, saying:	Showing the importance of comprehension over blind adherence to tradition.
dn5:13.8	‘This is what that statement means; that is what this statement means.’	NA
dn5:13.9	He was astute, competent, and intelligent, able to think issues through as they bear upon the past, future, and present.	Meditators focus on the present, but that does not mean they cannot think about the past or future; it just means they are not trapped in useless thoughts.
dn5:13.10	These are the eight factors that King Mahāvijita possessed.	NA
dn5:13.11	And so these eight factors also became accessories to the sacrifice.	NA
dn5:14.0	4.3. Four More Accessories	NA
dn5:14.1	And the brahmin high priest had four factors.	These are four of the five qualities that Soṇadaṇḍa identifies as the qualities of a brahmin at [dn4:13.2](). Missing is appearance, which is the first factor that Soṇadaṇḍa admits is unnecessary.
dn5:14.2	He was well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation.	NA
dn5:14.3	He recited and remembered the hymns, and had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.	NA
dn5:14.4	He was ethical, mature in ethical conduct.	NA
dn5:14.5	He was astute and clever, being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle.	NA
dn5:14.6	These are the four factors that the brahmin high priest possessed.	NA
dn5:14.7	And so these four factors also became accessories to the sacrifice.	NA
dn5:15.0	4.4. The Three Modes	NA
dn5:15.1	Next, before the sacrifice, the brahmin high priest taught the three modes to the king.	NA
dn5:15.2	‘Now, though the king wants to perform a great sacrifice, he might have certain regrets, thinking:	NA
dn5:15.3	“I shall lose a great fortune,” or	Compare the three factors of a donor’s mind-state at [an6.37:2.4]().

dn5:15.6	NA	NA
dn5:15.7	“I have lost a great fortune.” But the king should not harbor such regrets.’	NA
dn5:15.8	These are the three modes that the brahmin high priest taught to the king before the sacrifice.	NA
dn5:16.0	4.5. The Ten Respects	NA
dn5:16.1	Next, before the sacrifice, the brahmin high priest dispelled the king’s regret regarding the recipients in ten respects:	What a recipient does with a gift is beyond the donor’s control.
dn5:16.2	‘There will come to the sacrifice those who kill living creatures and those who refrain from killing living creatures.	NA
dn5:16.3	As to those who kill living creatures, the outcome of that is theirs alone.	NA
dn5:16.4	But as to those who refrain from killing living creatures, it is for their sakes that the king should sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart.	PTS edition acknowledges _sajjata_ only as a variant reading, but it is in the commentary, so should be accepted in the text. It is from √_sajj_ (relinquish).
dn5:16.5	There will come to the sacrifice those who steal …	NA
dn5:16.6	commit sexual misconduct …	NA

dn5:16.15	But as to those who have right view, it is for their sakes that the king should sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart.’	NA
dn5:16.16	These are the ten respects in which the high priest dispelled the king’s regret regarding the recipients before the sacrifice.	NA
dn5:17.0	4.6. The Sixteen Respects	NA
dn5:17.1	Next, while the king was performing the great sacrifice, the brahmin high priest educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired the king’s mind in sixteen respects:	NA
dn5:17.2	‘Now, while the king is performing the great sacrifice, someone might say,	NA
dn5:17.3	“King Mahāvijita performs a great sacrifice, but he did not announce it to the aristocrat vassals of town and country.	Another lesson in leadership: the importance of communication.
dn5:17.4	That’s the kind of great sacrifice that this king performs.”	NA
dn5:17.5	Those who speak against the king in this way have no legitimacy.	NA
dn5:17.6	For the king did indeed announce it to the aristocrat vassals of town and country.	NA
dn5:17.7	Let the king know this as a reason to sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart.	NA
dn5:17.8	While the king is performing the great sacrifice, someone might say,	NA
dn5:17.9	“King Mahāvijita performs a great sacrifice, but he did not announce it to the aristocrat vassals; the ministers and councillors; the well-to-do brahmins; and the well-off householders. That’s the kind of great sacrifice that this king performs.”	NA
dn5:17.10	Those who speak against the king in this way have no legitimacy.	NA
dn5:17.11	For the king did indeed announce it to all these people.	Due to abbreviation, the text only mentions householders here, but clearly all are intended.
dn5:17.12	Let the king know this too as a reason to sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart.	NA

dn5:17.45	These are the sixteen respects in which the high priest educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired the king’s mind while he was performing the sacrifice.	NA
dn5:18.1	And brahmin, in that sacrifice no cattle were killed, no goats or sheep were killed, and no chickens or pigs were killed. There was no slaughter of various kinds of creatures. No trees were felled for the sacrificial post. No grass was reaped to strew over the place of sacrifice.	NA
dn5:18.2	No bondservants, servants, or workers did their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping with tearful faces.	NA
dn5:18.3	Those who wished to work did so, while those who did not wish to did not.	A leader gets results through inspiration, not fear.
dn5:18.4	They did the work they wanted to, and did not do what they didn’t want to.	NA
dn5:18.5	The sacrifice was completed with just ghee, oil, butter, curds, honey, and molasses.	These were regarded as valuable yet harmless products.
dn5:19.1	Then the aristocrat vassals, ministers and councillors, well-to-do brahmins, and well-off householders came to the king bringing abundant wealth and said,	NA
dn5:19.2	‘Sire, this abundant wealth is specially for you alone; may Your Highness accept it!’	The king’s generosity and sincerity brings out the best in the others.
dn5:19.3	‘There’s enough raised for me through regular taxes. Let this be for you; and here, take even more!’	NA
dn5:19.4	NA	NA
dn5:19.5	When the king turned them down, they withdrew to one side to think up a plan,	NA
dn5:19.6	‘It wouldn’t be proper for us to take this abundant wealth back to our own homes.	NA
dn5:19.7	King Mahāvijita is performing a great sacrifice. Let us make an offering as an auxiliary sacrifice.’	NA
dn5:20.1	Then the aristocrat vassals of town and country set up gifts to the east of the sacrificial enclosure.	NA
dn5:20.2	The ministers and councillors of town and country set up gifts to the south of the sacrificial enclosure.	NA
dn5:20.3	The well-to-do brahmins of town and country set up gifts to the west of the sacrificial enclosure.	NA
dn5:20.4	The well-off householders of town and country set up gifts to the north of the sacrificial enclosure.	NA
dn5:20.5	And brahmin, in that sacrifice too no cattle were killed, no goats were killed, and no chickens or pigs were killed. There was no slaughter of various kinds of creatures. No trees were felled for the sacrificial post. No grass was reaped to strew over the place of sacrifice.	NA
dn5:20.6	No bondservants, servants, or workers did their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping with tearful faces.	NA
dn5:20.7	Those who wished to work did so, while those who did not wish to did not.	NA
dn5:20.8	They did the work they wanted to, and did not do what they didn’t want to.	NA
dn5:20.9	The sacrifice was completed with just ghee, oil, butter, curds, honey, and molasses.	NA
dn5:20.10	And so there were four consenting factions, eight factors possessed by King Mahāvijita, four factors possessed by the high priest,	NA
dn5:20.11	and three modes.	NA
dn5:20.12	Brahmin, this is called the sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories.”	NA
dn5:21.1	When he said this, those brahmins made an uproar,	Here ends the Buddha’s legendary account of the past.
dn5:21.2	“Hooray for such sacrifice! Hooray for the accomplishment of such sacrifice!”	NA
dn5:21.3	But the brahmin Kūṭadanta sat in silence.	The other brahmins are satisfied, but Kūṭadanta senses there is more to it.
dn5:21.4	So those brahmins said to him,	NA
dn5:21.5	“How can you not applaud the ascetic Gotama’s fine words?”	NA
dn5:21.6	“It’s not that I don’t applaud what he said.	NA
dn5:21.7	If anyone didn’t applaud such fine words, their head would explode!	NA
dn5:21.8	But, gentlemen, it occurs to me that	NA
dn5:21.9	the ascetic Gotama does not say:	NA
dn5:21.10	‘So I have heard’ or ‘It ought to be like this.’	“So I have heard” (_evaṁ me sutaṁ_) is the standard opening for Buddhist suttas. This tag was used to indicate that the speaker was not present at the events, but “heard” about them. This is in contrast with the phrase “I heard and learned this in the presence” (_sammukhā sutaṁ, sammukhā paṭiggahitaṁ_), which is used when reporting a teaching heard directly from the Buddha, eg. [sn55.52:5.1](), [sn22.90:9.1](), [mn47:10.7](), etc.
dn5:21.11	Rather, he just says:	NA
dn5:21.12	‘So it was then, this is how it was then.’	NA
dn5:21.13	It occurs to me that	NA
dn5:21.14	the ascetic Gotama at that time must have been King Mahāvijita, the owner of the sacrifice, or else the brahmin high priest who facilitated the sacrifice for him.	NA
dn5:21.15	Does the worthy Gotama recall having performed such a sacrifice, or having facilitated it, and then, when his body broke up, after death, being reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?”	NA
dn5:21.16	“I do recall that, brahmin. For I myself was the brahmin high priest at that time who facilitated the sacrifice.”	This qualifies the story of Mahāvijita as an early canonical Jātaka. There are a small number of such stories in the early suttas, only some of which overlap with the later Jātaka collections, the story of Mahāvijita not being among them.
dn5:22.0	5. A Regular Gift as an Propitious Sacrifice.	NA
dn5:22.1	“But worthy Gotama, apart from that sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories, is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?”	Kūṭadanta is hoping for a better return on his investment. Throughout the suttas, we find a strain of what might be called “spiritual economics”.
dn5:22.2	“There is, brahmin.”	NA
dn5:22.3	“But what is it?”	NA
dn5:22.4	“The regular gifts as propitious sacrifice given specially to ethical renunciates;	The _anukula_ (“propitious”) sacrifice is mentioned several times (eg. [dn5:22.4](), [an4.40:2.2]()). The Pali commentaries interpret it as “in line with (_anu-_) family (_kula_)”. But nothing in the contexts connects it with family customs, nor is such a term known in Sanskrit. It seems rather to be a misunderstanding of Sanskrit _anukūla_, literally “along the riverbank”, and in applied use, “in conformity with”, “favorable to”, as in the favor of the gods. This is the standard reading in Buddhist Sanskrit. Such a sacrifice is characterized, not by family custom, but by harmlessness. Thus _anukula_ means “propitious, favored (by the gods and the Dhamma)”.
dn5:22.5	this sacrifice, brahmin, has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial.”	NA
dn5:23.1	“What is the cause, Mister Gotama, what is the reason why those regular gifts as propitious sacrifice have fewer requirements and undertakings, yet are more fruitful and beneficial, compared with the sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories?”	NA
dn5:23.2	“Because neither perfected ones nor those who are on the path to perfection will attend such a sacrifice.	NA
dn5:23.3	Why is that?	NA
dn5:23.4	Because beatings and throttlings are seen there.	This contradicts the description given above.
dn5:23.5	But the regular gifts as propitious sacrifice given specially to ethical renunciates;	NA
dn5:23.6	perfected ones and those who are on the path to perfection will attend such a sacrifice.	NA
dn5:23.7	Why is that?	NA
dn5:23.8	Because no beatings and throttlings are seen there.	NA
dn5:23.9	This is the cause, brahmin, this is the reason why those regular gifts as propitious sacrifice have fewer requirements and undertakings, yet are more fruitful and beneficial, compared with the sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories.”	NA
dn5:24.1	“But Mister Gotama, apart from that sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories and those regular gifts as propitious sacrifice, is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?”	NA
dn5:24.2	“There is, brahmin.”	NA
dn5:24.3	“But what is it?”	NA
dn5:24.4	“When someone gives a dwelling specially for the Saṅgha of the four quarters.”	This means that the dwelling could be used by any Saṅgha member, as opposed to being given to a particular monastic or group. The gift of a dwelling is regarded as the best kind of offering to the Saṅgha.
dn5:25.1	“But is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?”	NA
dn5:25.2	NA	NA
dn5:25.3	NA	NA
dn5:25.4	“When someone with confident heart goes for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.”	NA
dn5:25.5	NA	NA
dn5:26.1	“But is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?”	NA
dn5:26.2	NA	NA
dn5:26.3	NA	NA
dn5:26.4	“When someone with a confident heart undertakes the training rules	NA
dn5:26.5	to refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.”	Thus far the Buddha has described the regular practice of a Buddhist lay person.
dn5:26.6	NA	NA
dn5:27.1	“But is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?”	NA
dn5:27.2	“There is, brahmin.	NA
dn5:27.3	NA	NA
dn5:27.4	It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha …	NA
dn5:27.5	That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. …	NA
dn5:27.6	They enter and remain in the first absorption …	NA
dn5:27.7	This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former, yet is more fruitful and beneficial. …	NA
dn5:27.8	They enter and remain in the second absorption …	NA

dn5:27.12	They project and extend the mind toward knowledge and vision …	NA
dn5:27.13	This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former, yet is more fruitful and beneficial.	NA
dn5:27.14	They understand: ‘… there is nothing further for this place.’	NA
dn5:27.15	This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former, yet is more fruitful and beneficial.	NA
dn5:27.16	And, brahmin, there is no other accomplishment of sacrifice which is better and finer than this.”	The entire path may be described as a “sacrifice”.
dn5:28.0	6. Kūṭadanta Declares Himself a Lay Follower	NA
dn5:28.1	When he had spoken, Kūṭadanta said to the Buddha,	NA
dn5:28.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	NA
dn5:28.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways.	NA
dn5:28.4	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
dn5:28.5	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.	NA
dn5:28.6	And these bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, and rams—seven hundred of each—I release them, I grant them life! Let them eat green grass and drink cool water, and may a cool breeze blow upon them!”	Releasing animals remains a Buddhist practice today.
dn5:29.0	7. The Realization of the Fruit of Stream-Entry	NA
dn5:29.1	Then the Buddha taught Kūṭadanta step by step, with	NA
dn5:29.2	a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation.	NA
dn5:29.3	And when he knew that Kūṭadanta’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas:	NA
dn5:29.4	suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.	NA
dn5:29.5	Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye,	NA
dn5:29.6	in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the brahmin Kūṭadanta:	NA
dn5:29.7	“Everything that has a beginning has an end.”	NA
dn5:30.1	Then Kūṭadanta saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha,	NA
dn5:30.2	“Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”	NA
dn5:30.3	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
dn5:30.4	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Kūṭadanta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	NA
dn5:30.5	And when the night had passed Kūṭadanta had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own sacrificial enclosure. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	NA
dn5:30.6	“It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.”	NA
dn5:30.7	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the sacrificial enclosure of Kūṭadanta together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out.	NA
dn5:30.8	Then Kūṭadanta served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	NA
dn5:30.9	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Kūṭadanta took a low seat and sat to one side.	NA
dn5:30.10	Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.	NA
dn6:0.1	Long Discourses 6	NA
dn6:0.2	With Mahāli	NA
dn6:1.0	1. On the Brahmin Emissaries	NA
dn6:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
dn6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	Lying some 60 kilometers north of Pāṭaliputra (Patna), Vesālī was the largest city in the Vajji Federation, a republican league in the region north of the Ganges.
dn6:1.3	Now at that time several brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha were residing in Vesālī on some business.	In the earlier suttas of this chapter, we have seen how news of the Buddha spread, evidently following Pokkharasāti’s conversion. Here we see an example of the kind of meeting at which such news would be discussed. | The phrase “brahmin emissaries” (_brāhmaṇadūtā_) does not seem to occur elsewhere and is not explained in the commentary. Perhaps they were emissaries of the kings, meeting in a neutral location. Or perhaps they were emissaries of their respective communities of brahmins.
dn6:1.4	They heard:	NA
dn6:1.5	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	This monastery features prominently as the Buddha’s usual place of residence near Vesālī.
dn6:1.6	He has this good reputation:	NA
dn6:1.7	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
dn6:1.8	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	NA
dn6:1.9	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
dn6:1.10	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	NA
dn6:2.1	Then they went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood to see the Buddha.	NA
dn6:2.2	Now, at that time Venerable Nāgita was the Buddha’s attendant.	NA
dn6:2.3	The brahmin emissaries went up to him and said,	NA
dn6:2.4	“Worthy Nāgita, where is the worthy Gotama at present?	NA
dn6:2.5	For we want to see him.”	NA
dn6:2.6	“It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha; he is on retreat.”	At some times the Buddha would go on retreat and ask that no-one visit him except to bring food; this sometimes happened at the Great Wood ([sn54.9:2.1]()). He also had the habit of withdrawing into the wood itself for meditation ([an5.58:1.3]()). At this time, however, he was simply staying in a nearby hut, so it seems Nāgita is being over-zealous.
dn6:2.7	So right there the brahmin emissaries sat down to one side, thinking,	NA
dn6:2.8	“We’ll go only after we’ve seen the worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn6:3.0	2. On Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi	NA
dn6:3.1	Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis also approached Nāgita at the hall with the peaked roof. He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Nāgita,	Oṭṭhaddha mean “hare-lip” and is evidently a nickname or epithet. Throughout, the Buddha refers to him by his personal name, Mahāli. And it is under that name we meet him again in [sn11.13]() and [sn22.60](). | The Licchavis, whose name is derived from “bear”, dominated the Vajji Federation. Note that the Mahāsaṅgīti edition here spells the masculine singular as _licchavī_, whereas normally it is _licchavi_.
dn6:3.2	“Worthy Nāgita, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?	NA
dn6:3.3	For we want to see him.”	NA
dn6:3.4	“It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha; he is on retreat.”	NA
dn6:3.5	So right there Oṭṭhaddha also sat down to one side, thinking,	NA
dn6:3.6	“I’ll go only after I’ve seen the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.”	NA
dn6:4.1	Then the novice Sīha approached Nāgita. He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Nāgita,	This Sīha is unknown elsewhere.
dn6:4.2	“Honorable Kassapa, these several brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha, and also Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis, have come here to see the Buddha. It’d be good if these people got to see the Buddha.”	Kassapa is Nāgita’s clan name; either he was a brahmin or a _khattiya_ whose family chaplain (_purohita_) was a Kassapa.
dn6:4.3	“Well then, Sīha, tell the Buddha yourself.”	In trying to protect the Buddha, Nāgita was inflexible and lacking compassion. When given good advice by Sīha, he responded gracelessly, fobbing off responsibility to a junior. No wonder he was replaced by Ānanda.
dn6:4.4	“Yes, sir,” replied Sīha. He went to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and told him of the people waiting to see him, adding:	NA
dn6:4.5	NA	NA
dn6:4.6	“Sir, it’d be good if these people got to see the Buddha.”	NA
dn6:4.7	“Well then, Sīha, spread out a seat in the shade of the dwelling.”	NA
dn6:4.8	“Yes, sir,” replied Sīha, and he did so.	NA
dn6:4.9	Then the Buddha came out of his dwelling and sat in the shade of the dwelling on the seat spread out.	This is still a common place for forest monks to receive guests.
dn6:5.1	Then the brahmin emissaries went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	This is the last we hear of these emissaries.

dn6:5.3	Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis also went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Oṭṭhaddha said to the Buddha, “Sir, a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and said:	Sunakkhatta features in several suttas, through which his journey may be traced. In [mn105]() he meets the Buddha and gains faith; here in [dn6]() he is becoming dissatisfied; in [dn24]() he rejects the Buddha; and in [mn12]() he attacks the Buddha after disrobing.
dn6:5.4	‘Mahāli, soon I will have been living in dependence on the Buddha for three years. I see heavenly sights that are pleasant, sensual, and arousing, but I don’t hear heavenly sounds that are pleasant, sensual, and arousing.’	This refers to “clairvoyance” and “clairaudience”, sometimes translated as the “divine eye” and “divine ear”. Despite being included in the Gradual Training, they are not a goal of Buddhist practice. Rather, they are unnecessary but potentially useful, as they reveal dimensions of being inaccessible to ordinary consciousness. Sunakkhatta, however, was evidently just interested in having pleasant supersensory experiences.

This description of meditation is unique in the Pali canon. The Buddha answers Mahāli’s question directly, even though the premise betrays Sunakkhatta’s limited understanding.

dn6:13.0	2.2. The Four Noble Fruits	NA
dn6:13.1	“But sir, what are those finer things?”	NA
dn6:13.2	“Firstly, Mahāli, with the ending of three fetters a mendicant is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.	This is the first description of the four stages of awakening which are featured throughout the Pali canon. The three fetters are identity view, doubt, and misapprehension of precepts and observances ([mn2:11.3]()).
dn6:13.3	This is one of the finer things for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me.	NA
dn6:13.4	Furthermore, a mendicant—with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion—is a once-returner. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.	NA
dn6:13.5	This too is one of the finer things.	NA
dn6:13.6	Furthermore, with the ending of the five lower fetters, a mendicant is reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.	The five lower fetters are the three mentioned above, plus sensual desire and ill will ([an10.13:1.5]()). This is the non-returner, who spends their last life in an exalted Brahmā realm. | A “spontaneous” rebirth is one that occurs without gestation in the womb, like most _devas_, or for that matter, Boltzmann brains.
dn6:13.7	This too is one of the finer things.	NA
dn6:13.8	Furthermore, a mendicant has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.	This is the arahant, the “worthy” or “perfected” one. Elsewhere it is said they abandon the five higher fetters: desire for rebirth in the realm of luminous form, desire for rebirth in the formless realm, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance ([an10.13:2.2]()).
dn6:13.9	This too is one of the finer things.	NA
dn6:13.10	These are the finer things, for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me.”	NA
dn6:14.0	2.3. The Noble Eightfold Path	NA
dn6:14.1	“But, sir, is there a path and a practice for realizing these things?”	NA
dn6:14.2	“There is, Mahāli.”	NA
dn6:14.3	“Well, what is it?”	NA
dn6:14.4	“It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:	This is the most fundamental of the Buddha’s teachings on the path, declared in his first sermon ([sn56.11]()). It reappears in [dn8:13.5](), [dn19:61.7](), and [dn22:21.2]().
dn6:14.5	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.	The eight factors map roughly on to the Gradual Training thus: hearing the Dhamma gives rise to right view; the choice to renounce is right thought; ethics includes right speech, action, and livelihood; undertaking seclusion and sense restraint is right effort; developing meditation is right mindfulness; and gaining the four _jhānas_ is right immersion. Realization of the Dhamma completes the circle by deepening conceptual right view to liberating insight. Sometimes this is expressed by adding two further factors, right knowledge and right liberation.
dn6:14.6	This is the path and the practice for realizing these things.	NA
dn6:15.0	2.4. On the Two Renunciates	NA
dn6:15.1	This one time, Mahāli, I was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery.	The Buddha retells the events recorded in the next sutta, [dn7]().
dn6:15.2	Then two renunciates—	NA
dn6:15.3	the wanderer Muṇḍiya and Jāliya, the pupil of the wood-bowl ascetic—came and exchanged greetings with me.	Muṇḍiya means “shaven one”; his name is spelled Mandissa in some manuscripts. He appears only in this passage. Jāliya returns in [dn24:2.4.1](), which recounts the farcical events following Sunakkhatta’s disrobal. There he takes the Buddha’s part against the delusional Pāṭikaputta favored by Sunakkhatta.
dn6:15.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they stood to one side and said to me:	NA
dn6:15.5	‘Reverend Gotama, are the soul and the body the same thing, or they are different things?’	The term “soul” (_jīva_) was favored by the _samaṇas_, as opposed to the “self” (_attā_) of the brahmins. Both are rejected by the Buddha as forms of “metaphysical” self: they postulate the absolute, eternal existence of entities that cannot be established empirically. The repeated demonstrative pronouns (_taṁ jīvaṁ taṁ sarīraṁ_) assert an emphatic identity.
dn6:16.1	‘Well then, reverends, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.’	NA
dn6:16.2	‘Yes, reverend,’ they replied.	NA
dn6:16.3	I said this:	NA

dn6:16.10	‘It would, reverend.’	They evidently believed that the experience of jhāna would grant insight into this dilemma. But it is a loaded question: it assumes that the soul is real and that what needs determining is its relation to the body.
dn6:16.11	NA	NA
dn6:16.12	‘But reverends, I know and see like this.	NA

dn6:19.4	‘It would not, reverend.’	Until this point, none of the experiences described are fundamentally incompatible with the notion of an eternal metaphysical self. Buddhists believe that non-Buddhists, before and after the Buddha, are quite capable of realizing such states. However, they would tend to interpret them in line with their previous beliefs, thus reinforcing their theories of self. Faced with the end of all rebirth, however, no theory of eternal self can stand.

dn8:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
dn8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Ujuññā, in the deer park at Kaṇṇakatthala.	Ujuññā was a Kosalan town at which King Pasenadi visited the Buddha in [mn90](). | “Deer parks” were nature reservations where the animals were safe from hunters.
dn8:1.3	Then the naked ascetic Kassapa went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	Naked ascetics are still found in India today. Some Jains went naked, but if he were a Jain he would have been introduced as such. Kassapa is an ancient clan name of the brahmins, and we meet four naked ascetics named Kassapa in the canon (here, [sn12.17](), [sn41.9](), and [mn124]()). They cannot be the same person, for at the end of each account it is said they went forth and attained arahantship.
dn8:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side and said to the Buddha:	NA
dn8:2.1	“Worthy Gotama, I have heard the following:	NA
dn8:2.2	‘The ascetic Gotama criticizes all fervent mortification. He categorically condemns and denounces all fervent mortifiers who live rough.’	In his first sermon, the Buddha rejected extremes of self-mortification. There the term was _attakilamatha_ (“self-mortification”), whereas here it is _tapas_ (“heat, burning, fervor”). These refer to the same practices, but _tapas_ points to the fervent ardor of the practitioner, generating an inner heat that “burns off” the corrupting traces of _kamma_ and defilements. This topic is also discussed in [an10.94]().
dn8:2.3	Do those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?	NA
dn8:2.4	For we don’t want to misrepresent the worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn8:3.1	“Kassapa, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false, baseless, and untrue.	NA
dn8:3.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see some fervent mortifier who lives rough reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	NA
dn8:3.3	But I see another fervent mortifier who lives rough reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	While the self-mortification itself may be useless, the person who practices it may have other good qualities. The Buddha is cautioning against rash judgement.
dn8:3.4	I see some fervent mortifier who takes it easy reborn in a place of loss.	NA
dn8:3.5	But I see another fervent mortifier who takes it easy reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	NA
dn8:3.6	Since I truly understand the coming and going, passing away and rebirth of these fervent mortifiers in this way, how could I criticize all forms of mortification, or categorically condemn and denounce those fervent mortifiers who live rough?	NA

dn8:14.0	3. The Courses of Fervent Mortification	NA
dn8:14.1	When he had spoken, Kassapa said to the Buddha:	NA
dn8:14.2	“Reverend Gotama, those ascetics and brahmins consider these courses of fervent mortification to be what makes someone a true ascetic or brahmin.	What follows is a description of ascetic practices undertaken by the Jains and similar groups. | The phrase “course of fervent mortification” (_tapopakkama_) is unique to this sutta. _Pakkama_ means “stepping out”.
dn8:14.3	They go naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on their behalf, or an invitation for a meal.	Buddhist mendicants may not receive food in their hands, nor lick them while eating. Followers of the practices listed here would have walked steadily and randomly for alms, accepting only what was given at the time.
dn8:14.4	They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who lives with a man; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or beer or wine, and drink no fermented gruel.	Keeping sheep (_eḷaka_, for slaughter) goes against the Jain principle of non-violence, as does keeping weapons (_daṇḍa_). | A _musala_ often means “pestle”, but it can also be a “shovel”; at [mn81:18.12]() it is regarded as a virtue to not use one to dig the soil (which is regarded as being alive in Jainism). | _Thusodaka_ is an alcoholic porridge fermented from grain-husks, mentioned alongside _sovīraka_ in the Pali commentaries and Carakasaṁhitā 27g.191.
dn8:14.5	They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls.	NA
dn8:14.6	They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day.	NA
dn8:14.7	They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals.	NA
dn8:14.8	Those ascetics and brahmins also consider these courses of fervent mortification to be what makes someone a true ascetic or brahmin.	NA
dn8:14.9	They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.	It is not easy to meaningfully distinguish the various kinds of grain.
dn8:14.10	Those ascetics and brahmins also consider these courses of fervent mortification to be what makes someone a true ascetic or brahmin.	NA
dn8:14.11	They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings.	All are extremely uncomfortable. Christian ascetics wore a “hair shirt” in order to “mortify the flesh” .
dn8:14.12	They tear out hair and beard, committed to this practice.	Jain ascetics tear out their hair at ordination, rather than shaving.
dn8:14.13	They constantly stand, refusing seats.	Remaining in one posture for months or years at a time is one of the most difficult practices.
dn8:14.14	They squat, committed to the endeavor of squatting.	NA
dn8:14.15	They lie on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns their bed.	NA
dn8:14.16	They make their bed on a plank, or the bare ground.	NA
dn8:14.17	They lie only on one side.	NA
dn8:14.18	They wear dust and dirt.	Strict Jain ascetics did not bathe.
dn8:14.19	They stay in the open air.	NA
dn8:14.20	They sleep wherever they lay their mat.	NA
dn8:14.21	They eat unnatural things, committed to the practice of eating unnatural foods.	At [pli-tv-kd6:14.6.3]() the four “great unnaturals” (or “filthy edibles”, _mahāvikaṭa_) are said to be feces, urine, ash, and clay. At [mn12:49.3]() the Buddha said he ate the “unnatural things” of feces and urine when undertaking ascetic practices.
dn8:14.22	They don’t drink, committed to the practice of not drinking liquids.	NA
dn8:14.23	They’re devoted to ritual bathing three times a day, including the evening.”	This seems out of place here. It was a Brahmanical practice ([sn7.21]()), as the Jains refused to bathe at all. Indeed, bathing three times a day in the Indian climate would, for most of the year, be quite pleasant.

dn8:18.3	“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha …	NA
dn8:18.4	Seeing danger in the slightest fault, a mendicant keeps the rules they’ve undertaken. They act skillfully by body and speech. They’re purified in livelihood and accomplished in ethical conduct. They guard the sense doors, have mindfulness and situational awareness, and are content.	NA
dn8:18.5	And how is a mendicant accomplished in ethics?	NA
dn8:18.6	It’s when a mendicant gives up killing living creatures. They renounce the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings.	NA

dn8:21.3	But as far as the highest noble ethics goes, I don’t see anyone who’s my equal, still less my superior.	NA
dn8:21.4	Rather, I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher ethics.	This is the ethical practices as described in the Gradual Training.
dn8:21.5	There are, Kassapa, some ascetics and brahmins who teach mortification in disgust of sin.	“Mortification in disgust of sin” renders _tapojigucchā_; _tapo_ is “fervent mortification” and _jigucchā_ is “loathing, disgust”. It captures the severity with which practitioners regarded the “evil” or “sin” with which they were infected, like a quasi-physical stain on the soul, and the burning flame of white-hot pain required to cauterize their spiritual wounds.
dn8:21.6	They praise fervent mortification in disgust of sin in many ways.	NA
dn8:21.7	But as far as the highest noble fervent mortification in disgust of sin goes, I don’t see anyone who’s my equal, still less my superior.	NA
dn8:21.8	Rather, I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher disgust of sin.	The Buddha repurposes the concept of “disgust of sin”, which here stands in the place of meditation (_samādhi_).
dn8:21.9	There are, Kassapa, some ascetics and brahmins who teach wisdom.	NA
dn8:21.10	They praise wisdom in many ways.	NA
dn8:21.11	But as far as the highest noble wisdom goes, I don’t see anyone who’s my equal, still less my superior.	NA

dn8:23.0	7. The Probation For One Previously Ordained	NA
dn8:23.1	Kassapa, this one time I was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.	NA
dn8:23.2	There a certain fervent celibate named Nigrodha asked me about the higher disgust of sin.	The Buddha is referring to the events of the Udumbarikasutta ([dn25]()). There Nigrodha is referred to as a “wanderer” (_paribbājaka_) who according to the commentary was clothed. The term _tapabrahmacārī_ here is unique and is not explained in the commentary. I think it means he was a celibate student of a Brahmanical teacher. _Tapas_ and _brahmacariya_ are closely linked in Atharvaveda 11.5.
dn8:23.3	I answered his question.	NA
dn8:23.4	He was extremely happy with my answer.”	NA
dn8:23.5	“Sir, who wouldn’t be extremely happy after hearing the Buddha’s teaching?	NA
dn8:23.6	For I too am extremely happy after hearing the Buddha’s teaching!	NA
dn8:23.7	Excellent, sir! Excellent!	NA
dn8:23.8	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, so too the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
dn8:23.9	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
dn8:23.10	Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”	NA
dn8:24.1	“Kassapa, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.	This probation is laid down in the Vinaya at [pli-tv-kd1:38.1.5](). The candidate shaves, dons the robes, takes refuge, and asks for probation. They must show good conduct and restraint, diligence in duties, and enthusiasm for the Buddha’s teachings and practice.
dn8:24.2	However, I have recognized individual differences in this matter.”	In addition to individual exceptions, there are general exceptions for dreadlocked ascetics, since they believe in kamma, and for the Buddha’s relatives.
dn8:24.3	“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.”	NA
dn8:24.4	And the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	NA
dn8:24.5	Not long after his ordination, Venerable Kassapa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
dn8:24.6	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	NA
dn8:24.7	And Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfected.	NA
dn9:0.1	Long Discourses 9	NA
dn9:0.2	With Poṭṭhapāda	NA
dn9:1.0	1. On the Wanderer Poṭṭhapāda	NA
dn9:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
dn9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
dn9:1.3	Now at that time the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda was residing together with three hundred wanderers in Mallikā’s single-halled monastery for philosophical debates, hedged by pale-moon ebony trees.	Poṭṭhapāda appears only here; he was named for a month of the lunar calendar (August/September). | Mallikā was the chief queen of Pasenadi, and her hall is mentioned in a similar context at [mn78:1.3](). The commentary explains that the brahmins, Jains, and others would assemble there to “debate their beliefs” (_samayaṁ pavadanti_). Evidently the monastery grounds had accommodation for many ascetics of different beliefs, but only “one hall” where they would gather for debate. We hear many times of such debates, but here we catch a glimpse of a place that was set up to facilitate them. For _-ācīra_, read in the sense of “boundary, hedge” (commentary: _timbarūrukkhapantiyā parikkhittattā_; cf. Sanskrit _prācīra_, “enclosure, hedge, fence, wall”).
dn9:1.4	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	NA
dn9:2.1	Then it occurred to him,	NA
dn9:2.2	“It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī.	According to the commentary, when he approached the vicinity of the city gate, he decided to check the position of the sun and noticed that it was too early to enter. The commentary and sub-commentary explain that it only sounds like the Buddha was in doubt, for Buddhas deliberate before deciding on a course of action.
dn9:2.3	Why don’t I go to Mallikā’s monastery to visit the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda?”	This can be understood as answering the criticism voiced in [dn8:22.2](), that the Buddha was afraid to speak in an assembly.
dn9:2.4	So that’s what he did.	NA
dn9:3.1	Now at that time, Poṭṭhapāda was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as	In contrast with the silence of the Buddha’s community at [dn2:10.7]().
dn9:3.2	talk about kings, bandits, and ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that place.	NA
dn9:4.1	Poṭṭhapāda saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,	NA
dn9:4.2	and hushed his own assembly,	NA
dn9:4.3	“Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound.	NA
dn9:4.4	Here comes the ascetic Gotama.	NA
dn9:4.5	The venerable likes quiet and praises quiet.	NA
dn9:4.6	Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”	The Buddha encourages quiet for the sake of mental development; Poṭṭhapāda does it for the sake of reputation.
dn9:4.7	Then those wanderers fell silent.	NA
dn9:5.1	Then the Buddha approached Poṭṭhapāda,	NA
dn9:5.2	who said to him,	NA
dn9:5.3	“Let the Blessed One come, sir!	Poṭṭhapāda’s address is almost overly deferential.
dn9:5.4	Welcome to the Blessed One, sir!	NA
dn9:5.5	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.	NA
dn9:5.6	Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”	NA
dn9:5.7	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,	NA
dn9:5.8	while Poṭṭhapāda took a low seat and sat to one side.	NA
dn9:5.9	The Buddha said to him,	NA
dn9:5.10	“Poṭṭhapāda, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	Always polite, the Buddha begins by showing an interest in them.
dn9:6.0	1.1. On the Cessation of Perception	NA
dn9:6.1	When he said this, the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda said to the Buddha,	NA
dn9:6.2	“Sir, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now.	NA
dn9:6.3	It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later.	NA
dn9:6.4	Sir, a few days ago several ascetics and brahmins who follow various other religions were sitting together at the debating hall, and a discussion about the cessation of perception came up among them:	_Abhisaññā_ does not appear elsewhere. Here the prefix _abhi-_ means not “higher”, but rather “about, concerning”. Compare _abhidhamma_ at [mn32:8.6](): _dve bhikkhū abhidhammakathaṁ kathenti_ (“two mendicants engage in discussion about the teaching”); also _abhivinaya_ at [an3.140:4.4](). The commentary here says _abhi-_ is a mere particle, so it need not be translated.
dn9:6.5	‘How does the cessation of perception happen?’	This discussion appears to have been directly sparked by the difficult passage in Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12 and 4.5.13. The sage Yājñavalkya, teaching his wife Maitreyī, says that the true Self is a sheer mass of “consciousness” (_vijñāna_, Pali _viññāṇa_), which is “great, endless, infinite reality”. After realizing this, he says, there is no “perception” (_saṁjñā_, Pali _saññā_), a statement that bewilders even the wise Maitreyī. He explains that only in an apparent state of duality (_dvaitamiva_) do the separate functions of sense consciousness operate. When all is realized as the Self, how, he asks, can one know that owing to which all this is known? He is implicitly distinguishing between _viññāna_ as “infinite” (= _vi-_) knowing and _saññā_ as “constrained” (_saṁ-_) knowing. Yājñavalkya says the separate Self emerges with these elements and vanishes with them (_etebhyo bhūtebhyaḥ samutthāya tānyevānu vinaśyati_), but he does not explain how or why this happens, which is the question the theorists here attempt to address.
dn9:6.6	Some of them said:	NA
dn9:6.7	‘A person’s perceptions arise and cease without cause or reason.	Here perception is not identified with the “person” (_purisa_), but rather belongs to them (cf. _etaṁ mama_, “this is mine”). In the discussion to follow, the Buddha only directly addresses this theory, while the remainder are included by inference.
dn9:6.8	When they arise, you become percipient.	NA
dn9:6.9	When they cease, you become non-percipient.’	NA
dn9:6.10	That’s how some describe the cessation of perception.	NA
dn9:6.11	But someone else says:	NA
dn9:6.12	‘That’s not how it is, good fellows!	This idiom is also at [sn47.19:1.10]().
dn9:6.13	Perception is a person’s self,	The self is defined as perception (_eso me attā_), one of the five aggregates. Compare the various theories of the self and perception at [dn1:2.38.0]().
dn9:6.14	which enters and departs.	NA
dn9:6.15	When it enters, you become percipient.	NA
dn9:6.16	When it departs, you become non-percipient.’	Implying that at such times a person lacks a “self”. This is perhaps related to Yājñavalkya’s: “That man, when born, acquiring a body, is connected with ills (the bodily organs); and when he dies, departing, he discards those ills” (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.8).
dn9:6.17	That’s how some describe the cessation of perception.	NA
dn9:6.18	But someone else says:	NA
dn9:6.19	‘That’s not how it is, good fellows!	NA
dn9:6.20	There are ascetics and brahmins of great power and might.	The commentary says these were devotees of _āthabbaṇa_, i.e the practices preserved in the Atharvaveda. This “fourth Veda” is mentioned only once by name in the early Pali ([snp4.14:13.1]()), where, as here, it is associated with the performance of magic and the casting of spells. The commentary fairly drips with contempt: “Allegedly, the Āthabbaṇa practitioners cast a spell, showing a creature’s head as if cut off, or their hand as if cut off, or as if dead. Then they show them back to normal; imagining so, they say, ‘From cessation they have arisen.’”
dn9:6.21	They insert and extract a person’s perception.	See [dn29:16.20]() for _upakaḍḍhati_ and _apakaḍḍhati_ in this sense.
dn9:6.22	When they insert it, you become percipient.	NA
dn9:6.23	When they extract it, you become non-percipient.’	NA
dn9:6.24	That’s how some describe the cessation of perception.	NA
dn9:6.25	But someone else says:	NA
dn9:6.26	‘That’s not how it is, good fellows!	NA
dn9:6.27	There are deities of great power and might.	NA
dn9:6.28	They insert and extract a person’s perception.	NA
dn9:6.29	When they insert it, you become percipient.	NA
dn9:6.30	When they extract it, you become non-percipient.’	NA
dn9:6.31	That’s how some describe the cessation of perception.	NA
dn9:6.32	That reminded me of the Buddha:	NA
dn9:6.33	‘Surely it must be the Blessed One, the Holy One who is so very skilled in such matters.’	NA
dn9:6.34	The Buddha is skilled and well-versed concerning the cessation of perception.	_Pakataññū_ is not elsewhere attested in the suttas, but it is found in the Vinaya, for example at [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc72:1.8]()).
dn9:6.35	How does the cessation of perception happen?”	NA
dn9:7.0	1.2. Perception Arises With a Cause	NA
dn9:7.1	“Regarding this, Poṭṭhapāda, those ascetics and brahmins who say that	NA
dn9:7.2	a person’s perceptions arise and cease without cause or reason are wrong from the start.	NA
dn9:7.3	Why is that?	NA
dn9:7.4	Because a person’s perceptions arise and cease with cause and reason.	NA
dn9:7.5	With training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease.	Here the Buddha argues that, since it is possible to change the nature of one’s own mind through practice, such changes cannot be random.
dn9:7.6	And what is that training?” said the Buddha.	It is is unusual if not unique to add “said the Buddha” (_bhagavā avoca_) in such a context. Normally, once a speaker starts, the text does not insert extra tags identifying the speaker without a reason, such as an interruption for a question.
dn9:7.7	“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha …	NA
dn9:7.8	That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. …	Sinhalese manuscripts, followed by PTS, include the paragraphs on the metaphor of the king’s security ([dn2:63.1]()) and on guarding the sense doors here.
dn9:9.1	Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed.	NA
dn9:10.1	Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
dn9:10.2	The sensual perception that they had previously ceases.	Progress through the _jhānas_ is explained in terms of the refining of perceptions.
dn9:10.3	At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of seclusion.	“Subtle and true” is _sukhumasacca_, a term that appears only here.
dn9:10.4	That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease.	NA
dn9:10.5	And this is that training,” said the Buddha.	NA
dn9:11.1	“Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
dn9:11.2	The subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of seclusion that they had previously ceases.	NA
dn9:11.3	At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of immersion.	NA
dn9:11.4	That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease.	NA
dn9:11.5	And this is that training,” said the Buddha.	NA
dn9:12.1	“Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA
dn9:12.2	The subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of immersion that they had previously ceases.	NA
dn9:12.3	At that time they have a subtle and true perception of bliss with equanimity.	NA
dn9:12.4	That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease.	NA
dn9:12.5	And this is that training,” said the Buddha.	NA
dn9:13.1	“Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
dn9:13.2	The subtle and true perception of bliss with equanimity that they had previously ceases.	NA
dn9:13.3	At that time they have a subtle and true perception of neutral feeling.	NA
dn9:13.4	That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease.	NA
dn9:13.5	And this is that training,” said the Buddha.	NA
dn9:14.1	“Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.	We have encountered the “formless attainments” (_arūpasamāpatti_) before, where they formed a refined basis for attachment to self ([dn1:3.13.4]()). Here they appear as part of the gradual refinement of consciousness through the cessation of increasingly subtle perceptions.
dn9:14.2	The perception of luminous form that they had previously ceases.	This is the vision of light that later came to be called a “sign” (_nimitta_). In the first four _jhānas_ this persists as a “subtle” (_sukhuma_) reflection or echo of the “substantial” (_olārika_) material basis of meditation, such as the breath or the parts of the body. Even though it is a purely mental phenomenon, it is still “form” (_rūpa_) since it has physical properties like light or extension.
dn9:14.3	At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite space.	The “light” (_obhāsa_) of _jhāna_ grows from “limited” (_paritta_) to “limitless” (_appamāṇa_, [mn128:29.1]()). Then the perception of even this limitless light vanishes, leaving only infinite space.
dn9:14.4	That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease.	NA
dn9:14.5	And this is that training,” said the Buddha.	NA
dn9:15.1	“Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness.	Perception of infinite space fades away leaving only the infinite consciousness that is aware.
dn9:15.2	The subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite space that they had previously ceases.	NA
dn9:15.3	At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness.	NA
dn9:15.4	That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease.	NA
dn9:15.5	And this is that training,” said the Buddha.	NA
dn9:16.1	“Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.	The meditator is no longer even aware of infinite consciousness, but of the even vaster nothingness.
dn9:16.2	The subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness that they had previously ceases.	NA
dn9:16.3	At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the dimension of nothingness.	NA
dn9:16.4	That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease.	The last of the four formless attainments is the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Since this, by definition, lies beyond the scope of perception, it is not included here.
dn9:16.5	And this is that training,” said the Buddha.	NA
dn9:17.1	“Poṭṭhapāda, from the time a mendicant here takes charge of their own perception, they proceed from one stage to the next, progressively reaching the peak of perception.	For _sakasaññī_ (“takes charge of their own perception”), see [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:6.2.2](). One relevant factor in determining whether an object has been stolen is if the accused “perceives it as their own”. Here it means that the meditator understands that they can evolve their own perceptions through meditation.
dn9:17.2	Standing on the peak of perception they think,	NA
dn9:17.3	‘Intentionality is bad for me, it’s better to be free of it.	NA
dn9:17.4	For if I were to intend and choose, these perceptions would cease in me, and other coarser perceptions would arise.	“Intend and choose” is _ceteyyaṁ abhisaṅkhareyyaṁ_ (1st singular optative). These synonyms are used in the sense of a subtle sense of will or intentionality that underlies such attainments ([mn52:14.3]()) and which must be let go lest they generate rebirth ([mn140:22.10]()).
dn9:17.5	Why don’t I neither make a choice nor form an intention?’	NA
dn9:17.6	They neither make a choice nor form an intention.	NA
dn9:17.7	Those perceptions cease in them, and other coarser perceptions don’t arise.	NA
dn9:17.8	They touch cessation.	NA
dn9:17.9	And that, Poṭṭhapāda, is how the progressive cessation of perception is attained with awareness.	Compare with “progressive cessation” ([an9.31]()), “progressive tranquilizing of conditions” ([sn36.15]()), “progressive meditations” ([an9.32]()), etc. | “Awareness” is _sampajāna_, which we have encountered previously as “situational awareness” in daily activities, or as the “awareness” in the third _jhāna_. Here it refers to a reflective capacity to understand the nature of deep meditation in terms of causality. The term was adopted by Patañjalī, who defined _saṁprajñātasamādhi_ in a way that is clearly drawn from the Buddhist definition of _jhāna_. It is attained with _vitakka_, _vicāra_, _ānanda_ (“bliss”), and _āsmitā_. According to the commentary, this last term is “experience of the one self”, _ekātmikā saṁvid_) and so is probably adapted from the Buddhist factor of _ekaggatā_.  (Yogasūtra 1.17).
dn9:18.1	What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda?	NA
dn9:18.2	Have you ever heard of this before?”	NA
dn9:18.3	“No, sir.	Taking the kernel of Yājñavalkya’s theory of the cessation of limited perception, the Buddha has expanded it in psychological and practical detail, while leaving out the metaphysical assumption of the Self.
dn9:18.4	This is how I understand what the Buddha said:	Poṭṭhapāda shows the Buddha that he has been paying attention. Notice how it is culturally assumed that it is possible to retain and repeat the exact content of the teaching.
dn9:18.5	‘From the time a mendicant here takes charge of their own perception, they proceed from one stage to the next, progressively reaching the peak of perception.	NA
dn9:18.6	Standing on the peak of perception they think,	NA
dn9:18.7	“Intentionality is bad for me, it’s better to be free of it.	NA
dn9:18.8	For if I were to intend and choose, these perceptions would cease in me, and other coarser perceptions would arise.	NA
dn9:18.9	Why don’t I neither make a choice nor form an intention?”	NA
dn9:18.10	Those perceptions cease in them, and other coarser perceptions don’t arise.	NA
dn9:18.11	They touch cessation.	NA
dn9:18.12	And that is how the progressive cessation of perception is attained with awareness.’”	NA
dn9:18.13	“That’s right, Poṭṭhapāda.”	NA
dn9:19.1	“Does the Buddha describe just one peak of perception, or many?”	NA
dn9:19.2	“I describe the peak of perception as both one and many.”	NA
dn9:19.3	“But sir, how do you describe it as one peak and as many?”	NA
dn9:19.4	“I describe the peak of perception according to the specific manner in which one touches cessation.	The meaning of this is not clear to me. It might mean that insight can be developed based on any of the stages of meditation, so for that person their peak of perception is different to another’s. The commentary says that it refers to different meditation subjects, or simply to different occasions of meditation.
dn9:19.5	That’s how I describe the peak of perception as both one and many.”	NA
dn9:20.1	“But sir, does perception arise first and knowledge afterwards? Or does knowledge arise first and perception afterwards? Or do they both arise at the same time?”	Poṭṭhapāda’s distinction between “perception” (_saññā_) and “knowledge” (_ñāṇa_) echoes Yājñavalkya’s distinction between “perception” (_saṁjā_) and “consciousness” (_vijñāna_, or in the repeated passage at 4.5.13, _prajñāna_).
dn9:20.2	“Perception arises first and knowledge afterwards. The arising of perception leads to the arising of knowledge.	Perception has been described in terms of the progress through more refined meditations (_samādhi_). Only then does the “knowledge” (_ñāṇa_) of insight arise.
dn9:20.3	They understand,	NA
dn9:20.4	‘My knowledge arose from a specific condition.’	The term “specific condition” (_idappaccayā_) is well known from dependent origination (eg. [sn12.20:2.3]()), where it applies to the general situation of ongoing existence in transmigration. When developing insight, a meditator takes their own meditation experience as their primary locus. This is then generalized to an understanding of the nature of conscious existence.
dn9:20.5	That is a way to understand how	NA
dn9:20.6	perception arises first and knowledge afterwards; that the arising of perception leads to the arising of knowledge.”	NA
dn9:21.0	1.3. Perception and the Self	NA
dn9:21.1	“Sir, is perception a person’s self, or are perception and self different things?”	This draws from the initial presentation of different theories of the person and perception ([dn9:6.4]()).
dn9:21.2	“But Poṭṭhapāda, do you believe in a self?”	“Believe” is _paccesi_, literally “fall back on”. It implies that an idea is something one relies on or takes as fundamental. The Buddha wants to know where Poṭṭhapāda stands before exploring this topic.
dn9:21.3	“I believe in a solid self, sir, which is formed, made up of the four principal states, and consumes solid food.”	Despite his previous questions about perception and the self, Poṭṭhapāda takes his stand on a purely materialist view, identifying the “self” with the organic “substantial” body.
dn9:21.4	“Suppose there were such a solid self, Poṭṭhapāda. In that case, perception would be one thing, the self another.	Again, the Buddha does not rush to tell Poṭṭhapāda he is right or wrong, but rather draws out the implications of his statement.
dn9:21.5	Here is another way to understand how perception and self are different things.	NA
dn9:21.6	So long as that solid self remains, still some perceptions arise in a person and others cease.	Here _tiṭṭhateva_ is not “leaving aside”, but “remains”. Compare the similar construction at [mn107:13.1]().
dn9:21.7	That is a way to understand how perception and self are different things.”	NA
dn9:22.1	“Sir, I believe in a mind-made self which is whole in its major and minor limbs, not deficient in any faculty.”	This is the “subtle” (_sukhuma_) body, corresponding with the form experienced in the four jhānas. All manuscripts appear to be missing the expected _rūpī_ in this passage, but it occurs in the corresponding passage on “reincarnation” below.
dn9:22.2	“Suppose there were such a mind-made self, Poṭṭhapāda. In that case, perception would be one thing, the self another.	NA
dn9:22.3	Here is another way to understand how perception and self are different things.	NA
dn9:22.4	So long as that mind-made self remains, still some perceptions arise in a person and others cease.	NA
dn9:22.5	That too is a way to understand how perception and self are different things.”	NA
dn9:23.1	“Sir, I believe in a formless self which is made of perception.”	This identifies the self as that which is experienced in the formless attainments. Poṭṭhapāda is simply cycling through possible self theories without really thinking through the implications.
dn9:23.2	“Suppose there were such a formless self, Poṭṭhapāda. In that case, perception would be one thing, the self another.	NA
dn9:23.3	Here is another way to understand how perception and self are different things.	NA
dn9:23.4	So long as that formless self remains, still some perceptions arise in a person and others cease.	NA
dn9:23.5	That too is a way to understand how perception and self are different things.”	NA
dn9:24.1	“But, sir, am I able to know whether	Poṭṭhapāda can only attest a belief in various theories and still does not know how to assess them for himself.
dn9:24.2	perception is a person’s self, or whether perception and self are different things?”	NA
dn9:24.3	“It’s hard for you to understand this, since you have a different view, creed, and belief, unless you dedicate yourself to practice with the guidance of tradition.”	The text shifts from _añña_ “other” (eg. _aññadiṭṭhikena_) to _aññatra_ (_aññatr’āyogena_), which normally means “apart from”. Most authorities follow the commentary in taking _aññatra_ here in the sense of “other”. However I think the change of sense is deliberate; the Buddha is not discouraging them, merely informing them what it will take.
dn9:25.1	“Well, if that’s the case, sir,	NA
dn9:25.3	then what do you make of this: ‘The cosmos is eternal. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”	This is the famous list of ten “undeclared points”, which are found throughout the suttas (eg. [mn25:10.21](), [mn63:2.3](), [mn72:3.1](), and the whole of SN 44). They seem to have functioned as a kind of checklist by which philosophers could be evaluated and classified. | The word _loka_ occurs in a number of senses, but here it refers to the entire “cosmos” of countless worlds.
dn9:25.4	“This has not been declared by me, Poṭṭhapāda.”	NA
dn9:26.1	“Then what do you make of this: ‘The cosmos is not eternal. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”	NA
dn9:26.2	“This too has not been declared by me.”	NA
dn9:27.1	“Then what do you make of this: ‘The cosmos is finite …’ …	NA
dn9:27.2	‘The cosmos is infinite …’ …	NA
dn9:27.3	‘The soul and the body are the same thing …’ …	NA
dn9:27.4	‘The soul and the body are different things …’ …	NA
dn9:27.5	‘A realized one still exists after death …’ …	NA
dn9:27.6	‘A realized one no longer exists after death …’ …	NA
dn9:27.7	‘A realized one both still exists and no longer exists after death …’ …	NA
dn9:27.8	‘A Realized One neither still exists nor no longer exists after death. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”	NA
dn9:27.9	“This too has not been declared by me.”	NA
dn9:28.1	“Why haven’t these things been declared by the Buddha?”	NA
dn9:28.2	“Because they’re not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.	NA
dn9:28.3	That’s why I haven’t declared them.”	NA
dn9:29.1	“Then what has been declared by the Buddha?”	NA
dn9:29.2	“I have declared this: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.”	NA
dn9:30.1	“Why have these things been declared by the Buddha?”	NA
dn9:30.2	“Because they are beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.	NA
dn9:30.3	That’s why I have declared them.”	NA
dn9:30.4	“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!	NA
dn9:30.5	Please, sir, go at your convenience.”	NA
dn9:30.6	Then the Buddha got up from his seat and left.	NA
dn9:31.1	Soon after the Buddha left, those wanderers beset Poṭṭhapāda on all sides with sneering and jeering.	This phrase recurs at [sn21.9:1.4]() and [an3.64:11.1](), with some variant readings.
dn9:31.2	“No matter what the ascetic Gotama says, Poṭṭhapāda agrees with him:	NA
dn9:31.3	‘That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!’	NA
dn9:31.4	We understand that the ascetic Gotama didn’t give any categorical teaching at all regarding whether the cosmos is eternal and so on.”	NA
dn9:31.6	When they said this, Poṭṭhapāda said to them,	NA
dn9:31.7	“I too understand that the ascetic Gotama didn’t give any categorical teaching at all regarding whether the cosmos is eternal and so on.	NA
dn9:31.10	Nevertheless, the practice that he describes is true, real, and accurate. It is the regularity of natural principles, the invariance of natural principles.	NA
dn9:31.11	So how could a sensible person such as I not agree that what was well spoken by the ascetic Gotama was in fact well spoken?”	NA
dn9:32.0	2. On Citta Hatthisāriputta	NA
dn9:32.1	Then after two or three days had passed, Citta Hatthisāriputta and Poṭṭhapāda went to see the Buddha. Citta Hatthisāriputta bowed and sat down to one side.	The commentary says Citta was the son of an elephant trainer. Here he shows greater respect to the Buddha than does Poṭṭhapāda.
dn9:32.2	But the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda exchanged greetings with the Buddha, and when the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.	NA
dn9:32.3	Poṭṭhapāda told the Buddha what had happened after he left. The Buddha said:	NA
dn9:33.1	“All those wanderers, Poṭṭhapāda, are blind and sightless.	NA
dn9:33.2	You are the only one whose eyes are clear.	NA
dn9:33.3	For I have taught and pointed out teachings that are categorical	This point seems to be lost on a number of modern commentators, who infer from passages such as the ten undeclared points that the Buddha refused to make any definitive declarations at all. The Buddha, rather, was a _vibhajjavādin_ ([mn99:4.4](), [an10.94:4.7]()), “one who speaks after analysis”.
dn9:33.4	and also teachings that are not categorical.	NA
dn9:33.5	And what teachings have I taught and pointed out as not categorical?	NA
dn9:33.6	‘The cosmos is eternal’ …	NA
dn9:33.7	‘The cosmos is not eternal’ …	NA
dn9:33.8	‘The cosmos is finite’ …	NA
dn9:33.9	‘The cosmos is infinite’ …	NA
dn9:33.10	‘The soul is the same thing as the body’ …	NA

dn9:33.15	‘A realized one neither still exists nor no longer exists after death.’	NA
dn9:33.16	And why have I taught and pointed out such teachings as not categorical?	NA
dn9:33.17	Because those things aren’t beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.	NA
dn9:33.18	That’s why I have taught and pointed out such teachings as not categorical.	NA
dn9:33.19.0	2.1. Teachings That Are Categorical	NA
dn9:33.20	And what teachings have I taught and pointed out as categorical?	NA
dn9:33.21	‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.	NA
dn9:33.25	And why have I taught and pointed out such teachings as categorical?	NA
dn9:33.26	Because they are beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.	NA
dn9:33.27	That’s why I have taught and pointed out such teachings as categorical.	NA
dn9:34.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	NA
dn9:34.2	‘The self is perfectly happy and free of disease after death.’	See [dn1:2.38.2]().
dn9:34.3	I go up to them and say,	NA
dn9:34.4	‘Is it really true that this is the venerables’ view?’	The Buddha does not rely on rumor; he begins by checking his facts with those concerned. Not only does this affirm his commitment to truth, it shows respect and establishes a common ground from which the argument proceeds.
dn9:34.6	And they answer, ‘Yes’.	NA
dn9:34.7	I say to them,	NA
dn9:34.8	‘But do you meditate knowing and seeing a perfectly happy world?’	The verb _viharati_ means “dwell”, and functions as an auxiliary verb implying duration. In spiritual contexts it often means “a period or state of meditation”. This first question is asking whether they see such a state in a regular meditation practice.
dn9:34.9	Asked this, they say, ‘No.’	NA
dn9:34.10	I say to them,	NA
dn9:34.11	‘But have you perceived a perfectly happy self for a single day or night, or even half a day or night?’	Perhaps they might not be able to develop a meditation for seeing that self, but at some point they may have had some sort of perception or vision or insight.
dn9:34.12	Asked this, they say, ‘No.’	NA
dn9:34.13	I say to them,	NA
dn9:34.14	‘But do you know	NA
dn9:34.15	a path and a practice to realize a perfectly happy world?’	Since they have no experience, they might at least have an idea how to reach that experience.
dn9:34.16	Asked this, they say, ‘No.’	NA
dn9:34.17	I say to them,	NA
dn9:34.18	‘But have you ever heard the voice of the deities reborn in a perfectly happy world saying,	NA
dn9:34.19	“Practice well, good fellows, practice directly so as to realize a perfectly happy world.	They haven’t even heard a report about it.
dn9:34.20	For this is how we practiced, and we were reborn in a perfectly happy world”?’	NA
dn9:34.21	Asked this, they say, ‘No.’	NA
dn9:34.22	What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda?	NA
dn9:34.23	This being so, doesn’t what they say turn out to have no demonstrable basis?”	“No demonstrable basis” renders _appāṭihīrakataṁ_. This is related to _pāṭihāra_, which is usually understood as “miracle, wonder”. But the root sense is “demonstration” and the sense of “display of wonder” is secondary.
dn9:34.24	“Clearly that’s the case, sir.”	NA
dn9:35.1	“Suppose, Poṭṭhapāda, a man were to say:	NA
dn9:35.2	‘Whoever the finest lady in the land is, it is her that I want, her that I desire!’	_Janapadakalyāṇī_ is typically rendered as “the most beautiful lady in the land”. At [sn47.20:2.2]() we learn that she is a dazzling singer and dancer. And while she was  famed for her beauty ([ud3.2:9.1]()), the word _kalyāṇa_ normally means “(morally) good, fine, lovely” and does not refer solely to her appearance.
dn9:35.3	They’d say to him,	NA
dn9:35.4	‘Worthy man, that finest lady in the land who you desire—do you know whether she’s an aristocrat, a brahmin, a peasant, or a menial?’	NA

dn9:39.0	2.2. Three Kinds of Reincarnation	NA
dn9:39.1	“Poṭṭhapāda, there are these three kinds of reincarnation in a life-form:	_Attapaṭilābha_ is literally “re-acquisition of self”, where _attā_ is explained by the commentary as _attabhāva_, the “state of the self” or “life-form” that is acquired at rebirth, i.e. the body (_sarīra_), whether material or immaterial.
dn9:39.2	a solid  life-form, a mind-made life-form, and a formless life-form.	These recap the three theses of perception and the self posted by Poṭṭhapāda from [dn9:22.1]().
dn9:39.3	And what is reincarnation in a solid life-form?	NA
dn9:39.4	It is formed, made up of the four principal states, and consumes solid food.	NA
dn9:39.5	What is reincarnation in a mind-made life-form?	NA
dn9:39.6	It is formed, mind-made, whole in its major and minor limbs, not deficient in any faculty.	NA
dn9:39.7	What is reincarnation in a formless life-form?	NA
dn9:39.8	It is formless, made of perception.	NA
dn9:40.1	I teach the Dhamma for the giving up of reincarnation in these three kinds of life-form.	NA
dn9:40.2	‘When you practice accordingly, corrupting qualities will be given up in you and cleansing qualities will grow. You’ll enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom, having realized it with your own insight in this very life.’	NA
dn9:40.3	Poṭṭhapāda, you might think:	NA
dn9:40.4	‘Corrupting qualities will be given up and cleansing qualities will grow. One will enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom, having realized it with one’s own insight in this very life. But such a life is suffering.’	Compare with the similar sentiment at [sn22.2:10.1]().
dn9:40.5	But you should not see it like this.	NA
dn9:40.6	Corrupting qualities will be given up and cleansing qualities will grow. One will enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom, having realized it with one’s own insight in this very life. And there will be only joy and happiness, tranquility, mindfulness and awareness. Such a life is blissful.	NA
dn9:43.1	Poṭṭhapāda, if others should ask us,	NA
dn9:43.2	‘But reverends, what is that reincarnation in a solid life-form for the giving up of which you teach?’ We’d answer like this,	NA
dn9:43.3	‘*This* is that reincarnation in a solid life-form.’	NA
dn9:44.1	If others should ask us,	NA
dn9:44.2	‘But reverends, what is that reincarnation in a mind-made life-form?’ We’d answer like this,	NA
dn9:44.4	‘*This* is that reincarnation in a mind-made life-form.’	The Buddha points to the experience to demonstrate what he is talking about, rather than offering a long theoretical explanation. _Ayaṁ_ is a pronoun of presence, used to indicate what is apparent before the subject.
dn9:45.1	If others should ask us,	NA
dn9:45.2	‘But reverends, what is that reincarnation in a formless life-form?’ We’d answer like this,	NA
dn9:45.4	‘*This* is that reincarnation in a formless life-form.’	NA
dn9:45.5	What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda?	NA
dn9:45.6	This being so, doesn’t that statement turn out to have a demonstrable basis?”	NA

dn9:46.8	“Clearly that’s the case, sir.”	NA
dn9:48.1	When the Buddha had spoken, Citta Hatthisāriputta said,	NA
dn9:48.2	“Sir, when reincarnated in a solid life-form, are the mind-made and formless life-forms fictitious,	Citta is asking an ontological question, assuming that these three states are existent realities of the self.
dn9:48.3	and only the solid life-form real?	NA

dn9:49.1	“When reincarnated in a solid life-form, it’s not referred to as a mind-made or formless life-form,	The Buddha reframes the question as one of conventional description. He is describing states in which one might be reborn, not underlying ontologies.
dn9:49.2	only as a solid life-form.	NA
dn9:49.3	When reincarnated in a mind-made life-form, it’s not referred to as a solid or formless life-form,	NA

dn9:49.6	only as a formless life-form.	NA
dn9:49.7	Citta, suppose they were to ask you,	NA
dn9:49.8	‘Did you exist in the past?	This anticipates one of the great philosophical debates of sectarian Buddhists which gave rise to the Sarvāstivāda, the school whose core doctrine was that “all exists (in the past, future, and present)”. The Buddha describes past, future, and present with the three grammatical tenses.
dn9:49.9	Will you exist in the future?	NA
dn9:49.10	Do you exist now?’	NA
dn9:49.11	How would you answer?”	NA
dn9:49.12	“Sir, if they were to ask me this,	NA
dn9:49.16	I’d answer like this,	NA
dn9:49.17	‘I did exist in the past.	NA
dn9:49.18	I will exist in the future.	NA
dn9:49.19	I do exist now.’	NA
dn9:49.20	That’s how I’d answer.”	NA
dn9:50.1	“But Citta, suppose they were to ask you,	NA
dn9:50.2	‘Is the reincarnation you had in the past your only real one, and those of the future and present fictitious?	NA
dn9:50.3	Is the reincarnation you will have in the future your only real one, and those of the past and present fictitious?	NA
dn9:50.4	Is the reincarnation you have now your only real one, and those of the past and future fictitious?’	NA
dn9:50.5	How would you answer?”	NA
dn9:50.6	“Sir, if they were to ask me this,	NA
dn9:50.10	I’d answer like this,	NA
dn9:50.11	‘The reincarnation I had in the past was real at that time, and those of the future and present fictitious.	NA
dn9:50.12	The reincarnation I will have in the future will be real at the time, and those of the past and present fictitious.	NA
dn9:50.13	The reincarnation I have now is real at this time, and those of the past and future fictitious.’	NA
dn9:50.14	That’s how I’d answer.”	NA
dn9:51.1	“In the same way, while in any one of the three reincarnations, it’s not referred to as the other two, only under its own name.	NA
dn9:52.1	From a cow comes milk, from milk comes curds, from curds come butter, from butter comes ghee, and from ghee comes cream of ghee. And the cream of ghee is said to be the best of these.	Compare Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3.3.3.2.
dn9:52.2	While it’s milk, it’s not referred to as curds, butter, ghee, or cream of ghee.	NA
dn9:52.3	It’s only referred to as milk.	NA
dn9:52.4	While it’s curd	NA
dn9:52.5	or butter	NA
dn9:52.6	or ghee	NA
dn9:52.7	or cream of ghee, it’s not referred to as anything else,	NA
dn9:52.8	only under its own name.	NA
dn9:53.1	In the same way, while in any one of the three reincarnations, it’s not referred to as the other two, only under its own name.	NA
dn9:53.5	These are the world’s common usages, terms, expressions, and descriptions, which the Realized One uses to communicate without getting stuck on them.”	Words such as “self” have a conventional usage and in that context are perfectly fine. But what that “self” refers to is constantly changing, as it is reincarnated in different states. It is like a river which keeps the same name even though the water is always changing. If, driven by attachment, we assume there is a metaphysical reality underlying the conventional “self”, we step beyond what can be empirically verified. Note, however, that the Buddha is *not* asserting that there are two levels of truth, conventional and ultimate, a distinction not found in early Buddhism. | Compare [mn139:3.9](), [mn74:13.1](), [sn1.25]().
dn9:54.1	When he had spoken, the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda said to the Buddha,	NA
dn9:54.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent!	NA
dn9:54.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, so too the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
dn9:54.4	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
dn9:54.5	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	NA
dn9:55.0	2.3. The Ordination of Citta Hatthisāriputta	NA
dn9:55.1	But Citta Hatthisāriputta said to the Buddha,	NA
dn9:55.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent!	NA
dn9:55.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, so too the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
dn9:55.4	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
dn9:55.5	Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”	NA
dn9:56.1	And Citta Hatthisāriputta received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	NA
dn9:56.2	Not long after his ordination, Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	In [an6.60]() we find Citta Hatthisāriputta, still a somewhat junior monk, rudely interrupting his seniors. After admonition he disrobed, but he ordained again and later achieved arahantship. We can reconcile these two accounts by recognizing that the phrase _acira_ “not long after” is a conventional term, which might be several years. Thus the events of AN 6.60 occurred some time between his ordination and awakening.
dn9:56.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	NA
dn9:56.4	And Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta became one of the perfected.	NA
dn10:0.1	Long Discourses 10	NA
dn10:0.2	With Subha	NA
dn10:1.1.1	So I have heard.	NA
dn10:1.1.2	At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. It was not long after the Buddha had become fully quenched.	Ānanda’s role became more prominent as a leader of the Saṅgha in the years after the Buddha’s passing. This sutta shows the continued propagation of the Buddha’s teachings after his death.
dn10:1.1.3	Now at that time the student Subha, Todeyya’s son, was residing in Sāvatthī on some business.	The same Subha earlier met the Buddha in [mn99]() and again in [mn135](), where he asked about kamma. His father Todeyya was a prominent brahmin, often mentioned alongside Pokkharasāti. The two apparently lived not far from each other, as, according to the commentary, Todeyya was named for his village of Tudi outside of Sāvatthī (see Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī 4.3.94). | These events suggest a certain, albeit tenuous, timeframe for the significant conversion of influential brahmins initiated by Pokkharasāti in [dn3](). Here, Subha is active after the Buddha’s death, suggesting his age is aligned with that of Ānanda, a generation younger than the Buddha. If this is so, Subha’s first meeting with the Buddha would have taken place no earlier than the middle period of his teaching, perhaps twenty years before the Parinibbāna (MN 99). There he mentions Pokkharasāti’s hostility to the claims of ascetics, so this must precede Pokkharasāti’s conversion in DN 3 by a considerable period. If we are on the right track, the conversion of Pokkharasāti, and the events that flowed from that, must have happened late in the Buddha’s career, perhaps in the final decade of his life.
dn10:1.2.1	Then he addressed a certain young student,	NA
dn10:1.2.2	“Here, young student, go to the ascetic Ānanda and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	NA
dn10:1.2.4	And then say:	NA
dn10:1.3.1	‘Sir, please visit the student Subha, Todeyya’s son, at his home out of sympathy.’”	NA
dn10:1.3.2	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied the young student, and did as he was asked.	NA
dn10:1.4.1	When he had spoken, Venerable Ānanda said to him,	NA
dn10:1.4.2	“It’s not the right time, young student.	NA
dn10:1.4.3	I have drunk a dose of medicine today.	Ānanda was getting old.
dn10:1.4.4	But hopefully tomorrow I’ll get a chance to visit him.”	NA
dn10:1.4.5	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied the young student. He went back to Subha, and told him what had happened, adding,	NA
dn10:1.4.13	“This much, sir, I managed to do. At least the worthy Ānanda will take the opportunity to visit tomorrow.”	NA
dn10:1.5.1	Then when the night had passed, Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went with Venerable Cetaka as his second monk to Subha’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Subha went up to Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him.	Cetaka is mentioned only here. The commentary says he was named for his home country of Cetī, which is roughly the modern region of Bundelkhand, about 500 km south-west of Sāvatthī.
dn10:1.5.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda:	NA
dn10:1.5.3	“Worthy Ānanda, you were the worthy Gotama’s attendant. You were close to him, living in his presence.	NA
dn10:1.5.4	You ought to know what things the worthy Gotama praised, and in which he encouraged, settled, and grounded all these people.	NA
dn10:1.5.5	What were those things?”	NA
dn10:1.6.1	“Student, the Buddha praised three spectrums of practice, and that’s what he encouraged, settled, and grounded all these people in.	NA
dn10:1.6.2	What three?	NA
dn10:1.6.3	The entire spectrum of noble ethics, immersion, and wisdom.	What follows has much the same content as [dn2](), but arranged under these three heads rather than as successively refined happiness.
dn10:1.6.4	These are the three  spectrums of practice that the Buddha praised.”	NA
dn10:1.6.5.0	1. The Entire Spectrum of Ethics	NA
dn10:1.6.6	“But what was that entire spectrum of noble ethics that the Buddha praised?”	NA
dn10:1.7.1	“Student, it’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.	NA
dn10:1.7.2	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	NA
dn10:1.7.3	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
dn10:1.8.1	A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in a good family.	NA
dn10:1.8.2	They gain faith in the Realized One	NA

dn10:1.8.4	‘Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide open.	NA
dn10:1.8.5	It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	NA

dn10:1.9.1	After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
dn10:1.10.1	Once they’ve gone forth, they live restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. They act skillfully by body and speech. They’re purified in livelihood and accomplished in ethical conduct. They guard the sense doors, have mindfulness and situational awareness, and are content.	NA
dn10:1.11.1	And how is a mendicant accomplished in ethics?	NA
dn10:1.11.2	It’s when a mendicant gives up killing living creatures. They renounce the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings. …	NA
dn10:1.12.1-1.27	This pertains to their ethics.	NA
dn10:1.28.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who, while enjoying food given in faith, still earn a living by low lore, by wrong livelihood.	NA
dn10:1.28.2	This includes rites for propitiation, for granting wishes, for ghosts, for the earth, for rain, for property settlement, and for preparing and consecrating house sites, and rites involving rinsing and bathing, and oblations. It also includes administering emetics, purgatives, expectorants, and phlegmagogues; administering ear-oils, eye restoratives, nasal medicine, ointments, and counter-ointments; surgery with needle and scalpel, treating children, prescribing root medicines, and binding on herbs.	NA
dn10:1.28.3	They refrain from such low lore, such wrong livelihood. …	NA
dn10:1.28.7	This pertains to their ethics.	NA
dn10:1.29.1	A mendicant thus accomplished in ethics sees no danger in any quarter in regards to their ethical restraint.	NA
dn10:1.29.2	It’s like a king who has defeated his enemies. He sees no danger from his foes in any quarter.	NA
dn10:1.29.3	A mendicant thus accomplished in ethics sees no danger in any quarter in regards to their ethical restraint.	NA
dn10:1.29.4	When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves.	NA
dn10:1.29.5	That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics.	NA
dn10:1.30.1	This is that entire spectrum of noble ethics that the Buddha praised.	NA
dn10:1.30.2	But there is still more to be done.”	NA
dn10:1.30.3	“It’s incredible, worthy Ānanda, it’s amazing,	NA
dn10:1.30.4	This entire spectrum of noble ethics is complete, not lacking anything!	NA
dn10:1.30.5	Such a complete spectrum of ethics cannot be seen among the other ascetics and brahmins.	NA

dn10:1.30.8	And yet you say:	NA
dn10:1.30.9	‘But there is still more to be done.’	NA
dn10:2.1.0	2. The Spectrum of Immersion	NA
dn10:2.1.1	But what, worthy Ānanda, was that noble spectrum of immersion that the Buddha praised?”	While _samādhi_ proper is the deep immersion in meditation, here it is a category that pertains to developing such states.
dn10:2.2.1	“And how, student, does a mendicant guard the sense doors?	NA
dn10:2.2.2	When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.	NA
dn10:2.2.3	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.	NA

dn10:2.3.1	And how does a mendicant have mindfulness and situational awareness?	NA
dn10:2.3.2	It’s when a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.

dn10:2.3.3	That’s how a mendicant has mindfulness and situational awareness.	NA
dn10:2.4.1	And how is a mendicant content?	NA
dn10:2.4.2	It’s when a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.	NA
dn10:2.4.3	They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden.	NA
dn10:2.4.4	In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.	NA

dn10:2.5.1	When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, this noble sense restraint, this noble mindfulness and situational awareness, and this noble contentment,	NA

dn10:2.6.4	Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.	NA
dn10:2.6.5	Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.	NA

dn11:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Nāḷandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove.	This was the scene for some controversial discussions with Jains ([mn56](), [sn42.8]()), and Sāriputta’s touching declaration of faith shortly before his passing ([sn47.12](), [dn16:1.16.1](), [dn28]()). It is probably the Pāvā (modern Pawapuri) at which Mahāvīra died according to the Jain tradition.
dn11:1.3	Then the householder Kevaḍḍha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	Kevaḍḍha is mentioned only here. Manuscripts spell his name variously as Kevaddha or Kevaṭṭa (“fisherman”). The Chinese form <span lang='lzh'>堅固</span> means “sturdy” (from _dṛḍha_) and thus supports Kevaḍḍha.
dn11:1.4	“Sir, this Nāḷandā is successful and prosperous, populous, full of people.	NA
dn11:1.5	Please direct a mendicant to perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power.	I have been asked to do the same thing for the same reason.

dn11:2.1	For a second time, Kevaḍḍha made the same request,	NA
dn11:2.2	“Sir, I am not teaching you the Dhamma,	The reading _dhaṁsemi_ is dubious. An old Burmese manuscript has the reading _dhammaṁ desemi_, which echoes the Buddha just above. Note too that Kevaḍḍha urges the Buddha to “direct” the monks (_samādisatu_, from the same root as _desemi_). I think the tension is deliberate: Kevaḍḍha says he isn’t telling the Buddha how to teach, but he absolutely is. Other readings convey the sense “attack, insult”, but this seems out of place.

dn11:3.9	What three?	NA
dn11:3.10	The demonstration of psychic power, the demonstration of revealing, and the demonstration of instruction.	These three are mentioned frequently in the suttas. Only the last is endorsed by the Buddha, as it leads to genuine growth.
dn11:4.1	And what is the demonstration of psychic power?	NA
dn11:4.2	It’s a mendicant who wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the realm of divinity.

dn11:5.2	‘There’s a spell named Gandhārī.	“Spell” is _vijjā_ (Sanskrit _vidyā_, “(potent) knowledge”, cf. English “wicca”, “wizard”, “witch”).  The commentary says it was practiced by the seers of Gandhāra (north-west Pakistan). Jain tradition also knows a Gandhārī mantra, but attribute it to certain _vidyādhara_ deities. Sanskrit tradition similarly knows of a _vidyādevī_ (“lore goddess”) named Gandhārī. Gandhāra was an ancient land of learning, and a convenient location for exotic magics.

dn11:6.0	2. The Demonstration of Revealing	NA
dn11:6.1	And what is the demonstration of revealing?	“Revealing” is _ādesana_, from root _dis_ “to indicate, show, or point”.
dn11:6.2	It’s when a mendicant reveals the mind, mentality, thoughts, and reflections of other beings and individuals:	The Pali terms here are _citta_, _cetasika_, _vitakka_, and _vicāra_.

dn11:67.2.0	4. On the Mendicant in Search of the Cessation of Being	NA
dn11:67.3	Once upon a time, Kevaḍḍha, a mendicant in this very Saṅgha had the following thought,	This story is presented as an actual event, but is phrased like a fable.
dn11:67.4	‘Where do these four principal states cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?’	The question is about meditation, not the annihilation of the material world. The first four _jhānas_ are based on the “subtle form” (_sukhumarūpa_) that manifests as light in deep meditation. He is asking how to go beyond this to the formless attainments.
dn11:68.1	Then that mendicant attained a state of immersion such that a path to the gods appeared.	The mendicant has already well developed the _jhānas_. | “Controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm” is one of the “demonstrations of psychic power” listed above.
dn11:68.2	Then he approached the gods of the four great kings and said,	The “gods of the Four Great Kings” are deities born in a realm subject to the overlords known as the Four Great Kings. These deities inhabit the lowest of the celestial realms.
dn11:68.3	‘Reverends, where do these four principal states cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?’	NA

dn11:69.6	But the gods of the thirty-three …	The “thirty-three” enjoy refined sensual delights. The number is a reduplication of the trinity. In Buddhist texts they are not enumerated, but Yājñavalkya reckons them as eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Ādityas, plus Indra and Prajāpati (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.9.2).

dn11:81.1	Not long afterwards, the Great Divinity appeared.	NA
dn11:81.2	Then that mendicant approached the Great Divinity and said to him,	NA

dn11:82.1	For a second time, that mendicant said to the Great Divinity,	NA
dn11:82.2	‘Reverend, I am not asking you whether you are	He addresses Brahmā with _āvuso_. This is often translated as “friend”, but the root is _āyu_ (“age”) and it is respectful not familiar.

dn11:83.1	For a third time, that mendicant said to the Great Divinity,	Rather than trying to engage with Brahmā’s agenda, he keeps restating his question. This is a skillful way of curbing narcissism.

dn11:83.4	I am asking	NA
dn11:83.5	where these four principal states cease without anything left over.’	NA
dn11:83.6	Then the Great Divinity took that mendicant by the arm, led him off to one side, and said to him,	Brahmā is embarrassed to reveal his ignorance. Perhaps a satire of Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.2.13, where Yājñavalkya takes Jāratkārava Ārtabhāga by the hand and leads him aside for a secret discussion.
dn11:83.7	‘Mendicant, these gods think that there is nothing at all that I don’t know and see and understand and realize.	NA
dn11:83.8	That’s why I didn’t answer in front of them.	NA

dn11:84.3	‘Sir, where do these four principal states cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?’	NA
dn11:85.0	4.1. The Simile of the Land-Spotting Bird	NA
dn11:85.1	When he said this, I said to him:	NA
dn11:85.2	‘Once upon a time, mendicant, some sea-merchants set sail for the ocean deeps, taking with them a land-spotting bird.	NA
dn11:85.3	When their ship was out of sight of land, they released the bird.	NA
dn11:85.4	It flew right away to the east, the west, the north, the south, upwards, and in-between.	NA
dn11:85.5	If it saw land on any side, it went there and stayed.	NA
dn11:85.6	But if it saw no land on any side it returned to the ship.	NA
dn11:85.7	In the same way, after failing to get an answer to this question even after searching as far as the realm of divinity, you’ve returned to me.	NA
dn11:85.8	Mendicant, this is not how the question should be asked:	NA
dn11:85.9	“Sir, where do these four principal states cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?”	NA
dn11:85.10	This is how the question should be asked:	NA
dn11:85.11	“Where do water and earth,	The first pair of couplets rephrase the question about where the (absorptions based on) material form cease. The verb is changed to _gādhati_, “find a footing”. | This couplet is also found at [sn1.27:2.1](), [ud1.10:14.1]().
dn11:85.12	fire and air not remain;	The verse is syntactically ambiguous, as there are three couplets, each with the question-word _kattha_, but only two verbs. I take the first pair of couplets as a distinct verse, with the verb _gādhati_ acting as a “lamp” illuminating both the first and second couplets. These are also unified in that they deal only with material qualities.
dn11:85.13	where long and short,	A similar list of descriptors elsewhere describes things that are not stolen ([snp3.9:45.1]()) or the kinds of sentient beings ([snp1.8:4.3]()). These are aspects of how “form” manifests in desirable or undesirable ways.
dn11:85.14	fine and coarse, beautiful and ugly?	Four terms in this verse are identical with the first four terms in Yājñavalkya’s description of the immutable Brahman as “neither coarse nor fine, neither short nor long” at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.8.8.
dn11:85.15	Where does name-and-form	This final couplet is distinguished in having a different verb (“cease”) and in including mental qualities (_nāma_). It therefore appears there are two questions with two answers.
dn11:85.16	cease with nothing left over?”	NA
dn11:85.17	And the answer to that is:	NA
dn11:85.18	“‘Consciousness where no form appears,	This couplet is spoken by Baka the Divinity at [mn49:25.1](), so it was probably a free-floating couplet illustrating the Upaniṣadic theory of the Self as infinite consciousness. I think the Buddha is quoting Brahmā here in order to contrast with his own teaching of the cessation of consciousness, to emphasize that *even this* most sublime form of consciousness will cease. | “Where no form appears” (_anidassanaṁ_) here is a synonym for “formless” (see eg. [mn21:14.8](), “space is formless and invisible”, _ākāso arūpī anidassano_). Normally the colors and images seen in the “form” absorptions are described as “appearing” (eg. [dn16:3.29.1]()), so this indicates a formless attainment.
dn11:85.19	infinite, luminous all-round.’	“Infinite” (_ananta_) is the direct qualifier of “consciousness”, but in the Pali it is shifted to the next line to fit the meter. It indicates the second of the formless attainments. Yājñavalkya describes consciousness as infinite in the famous passage at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12. | _Pabhaṁ_ means “luminous”, as with the deities that are “self-luminous” (_sayaṁpabhā_, [dn27:10.3]()). This echoes descriptions of the Divinity of consciousness as “radiant” (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.6.1, Chāndogya Upaniṣad 3.14.2) | _Sabbato pabhaṁ_ (“luminous all-round”) is synonymous with _pariyodāta_ (“bright”, literally “white all over”), a stock descriptor of the mind of fourth _jhāna_, on which the formless states are based.
dn11:85.20	Regarding this, water and earth,	The division of these ten lines is not obvious. Since the previous couplet appears to be an independent saying, I take the remaining eight lines as two four-line verses. This couplet, too, appears as the first two lines of a six-line verse, with the initial _yattha_ rather than _ettha_ ([sn1.27:2.1]()).
dn11:85.21	fire and air do not remain;	The verb “do not remain” applies to both the former and subsequent couplet.
dn11:85.22	regarding this, long and short,	NA
dn11:85.23	fine and coarse, beautiful and ugly.	NA
dn11:85.24	Regarding this, name and form	These lines also at [snp5.2:6.6](), with initial _yattha_ instead of _ettha_.
dn11:85.25	ceases with nothing left over—	NA
dn11:85.26	with the cessation of consciousness,	According to dependent origination, when consciousness ceases, name and form cease, and with it the manifestation of all things desirable and undesirable in the world.
dn11:85.27	they cease in reference to this.”’”	Throughout, take the locative _ettha_ as locative of reference, as in similar constructions at eg. [sn1.30](). The point is that when the Buddha is speaking of the cessation of consciousness, he is speaking specifically of the “infinite consciousness” of the Upaniṣads: *that* is what ceases.
dn11:85.28	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
dn11:85.29	Satisfied, the householder Kevaḍḍha approved what the Buddha said.	NA
dn12:0.1	Long Discourses 12	NA
dn12:0.2	With Lohicca	NA
dn12:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
dn12:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at Sālavatikā.	This is the only appearance of a place called Sālavatikā (“Abounding in Sal Trees”). A courtesan of Rājagaha named Sālavatī appears in [pli-tv-kd8:1.3.1](); she might perhaps have come from there.
dn12:1.3	Now at that time the brahmin Lohicca was living in Sālavatikā. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.	A certain brahmin Lohicca also appears in [sn35.132](). But since that is set far away in Avantī after the Buddha’s passing, and since in both cases he is said to have taken refuge, it seems likely these are different people.
dn12:2.1	Now at that time Lohicca had the following harmful misconception:	NA
dn12:2.2	“Should an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality, they ought not inform anyone else. For what can one person do for another?	A similar view is sometimes unjustly imputed to the Theravādins, that they are only interested in their own liberation.
dn12:2.3	Suppose someone cut off an old bond, only to create another new bond.	NA
dn12:2.4	That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one person do for another?”	NA
dn12:3.1	Lohicca heard:	NA
dn12:3.2	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Sālavatikā, together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants.	NA
dn12:3.3	He has this good reputation:	NA
dn12:3.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA

dn12:3.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	NA
dn12:4.1	Then Lohicca addressed his barber Rosika,	While _nhāpita_ would seem to be identical with _nhāpaka_ (“bathroom attendant”), it is usually translated per [ja395]() where it means “barber”.
dn12:4.2	“Here, dear Rosika, go to the ascetic Gotama and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	NA
dn12:4.3	NA	NA
dn12:4.4	And then ask him whether he,	NA
dn12:4.5	together with the mendicant Saṅgha, might please accept tomorrow’s meal from the brahmin Lohicca.”	Note the unusual use of _kira_ in this idiom, found in [sn35.133:2.3](), [mn85:3.5](), [mn127:2.5](), and [ud2.8:6.8](). I think this expresses polite deference, and render with “might” rather than “would”.
dn12:5.1	“Yes, worthy sir,” Rosika replied. He did as he was asked, and	NA

dn12:5.3	NA	NA
dn12:5.4	NA	NA
dn12:5.5	the Buddha consented with silence.	NA

dn12:6.4	NA	NA
dn12:6.5	NA	NA

dn12:7.1	And when the night had passed Lohicca had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	NA
dn12:7.2	“Here, dear Rosika, go to the ascetic Gotama and announce the time, saying:	NA
dn12:7.3	‘It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.’”	NA
dn12:7.4	“Yes, worthy sir,” Rosika replied. He did as he was asked.	NA
dn12:7.5	NA	NA
dn12:7.6	NA	NA
dn12:7.7	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Sālavatikā together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.	NA
dn12:8.1	Now, Rosika was following behind the Buddha,	NA

dn12:8.10	“Hopefully that’ll happen, Rosika, hopefully that’ll happen.”	The Buddha is modest as to his chances.
dn12:9.1	Then the Buddha approached Lohicca’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out.	NA
dn12:9.2	Then Lohicca served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	NA

And in addition, there are those who ripen the seeds for rebirth in a heavenly state. The person who spoke like that makes it difficult for them. They’re acting unkindly, their heart is full of hostility, and they have wrong view.	It is only through sharing what good things we know that we can support each other.

dn12:16.0	2. Three Teachers Who Deserve to Be Reprimanded	NA
dn12:16.1	Lohicca, there are three kinds of teachers in the world who deserve to be reprimanded.	Even though he has characterized Lohicca’s view as harmful, the Buddha goes out of his way to show that it is not entirely wrong. There are cases where it is best to avoid teaching.
dn12:16.2	When someone reprimands such teachers, the reprimand is true, correct, legitimate, and blameless.	NA
dn12:16.3	What three?	NA
dn12:16.4	Firstly, take a teacher who has not reached the goal of the ascetic life for which they went forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
dn12:16.5	They teach their disciples:	NA
dn12:16.6	‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’	NA
dn12:16.7	But their disciples don’t want to listen. They don’t actively listen or try to understand. They proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction.	NA
dn12:16.8	That teacher deserves to be reprimanded:	NA
dn12:16.9	‘Venerable, you haven’t reached the goal of the ascetic life; and when you teach disciples	NA
dn12:16.10	NA	NA
dn12:16.11	they proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction.	NA
dn12:16.12	It’s like a man who makes advances on a woman though she pulls away, or embraces her though she turns her back.	The genders of this passage are made clear through the use of feminine nouns. Making unwelcome advances was seen as an obvious example of something wrong.
dn12:16.13	That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one do for another?’	NA
dn12:16.14	NA	NA
dn12:16.15	This is the first kind of teacher who deserves to be reprimanded.	NA
dn12:16.16	NA	NA
dn12:17.1	Furthermore, take a teacher who has not reached the goal of the ascetic life for which they went forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
dn12:17.2	They teach their disciples:	NA
dn12:17.3	‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’	NA
dn12:17.4	Their disciples do want to listen. They actively listen and try to understand. They don’t proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction.	At [dn29:5.2]() the opposite sense is expressed as _samādāya taṁ dhammaṁ vattati_.
dn12:17.5	That teacher deserves to be reprimanded:	NA
dn12:17.6	‘Venerable, you haven’t reached the goal of the ascetic life; and when you teach disciples	NA
dn12:17.7	NA	NA
dn12:17.8	they don’t proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction.	NA
dn12:17.9	It’s like someone who abandons their own field and presumes to weed someone else’s field. That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one do for another?’	NA
dn12:17.10	This is the second kind of teacher who deserves to be reprimanded.	NA
dn12:17.11	NA	NA
dn12:18.1	Furthermore, take a teacher who has reached the goal of the ascetic life for which they went forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
dn12:18.2	They teach their disciples:	NA
dn12:18.3	‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’	NA
dn12:18.4	But their disciples don’t want to listen. They don’t actively listen or try to understand. They proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction.	NA
dn12:18.5	That teacher deserves to be reprimanded:	NA
dn12:18.6	‘Venerable, you have reached the goal of the ascetic life; yet when you teach disciples	NA
dn12:18.7	NA	NA
dn12:18.8	NA	NA
dn12:18.9	they proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction.	NA
dn12:18.10	Suppose someone cut off an old bond, only to create another new bond.	The Buddha adopts Lohicca’s formulation, but applies it in a specific sense, not as a generalization.
dn12:18.11	That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one person do for another?’	NA
dn12:18.12	This is the third kind of teacher who deserves to be reprimanded.	NA
dn12:18.13	NA	NA
dn12:18.14	These are the three kinds of teachers in the world who deserve to be reprimanded.	NA
dn12:18.15	When someone reprimands such teachers, the reprimand is true, correct, legitimate, and blameless.”	NA
dn12:19.0	3. A Teacher Who Does Not Deserve to Be Reprimanded	NA
dn12:19.1	When he had spoken, Lohicca said to the Buddha,	NA
dn12:19.2	“But worthy Gotama, is there a teacher in the world who does not deserve to be reprimanded?”	Now that the Buddha has established a degree of overlap between their views, Lohicca wants to hear more.
dn12:19.3	“There is, Lohicca.”	Again, the Buddha answers directly and simply.
dn12:19.4	“But who is that teacher?”	NA
dn12:20-55.1	“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha …	NA
dn12:20-55.2	That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. …	NA
dn12:20-55.3	They enter and remain in the first absorption …	NA
dn12:20-55.4	A teacher under whom a disciple achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimanded.	NA
dn12:20-55.5	When someone reprimands such a teacher, the reprimand is false, baseless, illegitimate, and blameworthy.	NA
dn12:56-62.1	NA	NA
dn12:56-62.2	They enter and remain in the second absorption …	NA
dn12:56-62.3	third absorption …	NA
dn12:56-62.4	fourth absorption.	NA
dn12:56-62.5	A teacher under whom a disciple achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimanded. …	NA
dn12:63-77.1	NA	NA
dn12:63-77.2	They project and extend the mind toward knowledge and vision …	NA
dn12:63-77.3	A teacher under whom a disciple achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimanded. …	NA
dn12:63-77.4	NA	NA
dn12:63-77.5	They understand: ‘… there is nothing further for this place.’	NA
dn12:63-77.6	A teacher under whom a disciple achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimanded. When someone reprimands such a teacher, the reprimand is false, baseless, illegitimate, and blameworthy.”	NA
dn12:78.1	When he had spoken, Lohicca said to the Buddha:	NA
dn12:78.2	“Suppose, worthy Gotama, a person was falling over a cliff, and another person were to grab them by the hair, pull them up, and place them on firm ground.	_Naraka_ means “cliff” or “abyss” in early Pali ([mn49:5.9](), [mn86:6.15](), [snp3.11:28.4](), [thag16.8:4.2]()). It does not have the sense “hell” until the late canonical period; the early Pali term for hell is _niraya_. Notably, _naraka_ is not strongly attested in the sense of “hell” for pre-Buddhist Sanskrit either, although we do find _nāraka_, apparently in the sense of “hell being”, at Atharva Veda 12.4.36c and Śukla Yajur Veda 30.5.
dn12:78.3	In the same way, when I was falling off a cliff the worthy Gotama pulled me up and placed me on safe ground.	NA
dn12:78.4	Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	NA
dn12:78.5	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways.	NA
dn12:78.6	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
dn12:78.7	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	NA
dn13:0.1	Long Discourses 13	NA
dn13:0.2	Experts in the Three Vedas	NA
dn13:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
dn13:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Manasākaṭa.	Manasākaṭa is mentioned only here.
dn13:1.3	He stayed in a mango grove on a bank of the river Aciravatī to the north of Manasākaṭa.	Aciravatī is called Rapti today. It was one of the great rivers that flowed from the Himalayas through Kosala into the Ganges.
dn13:2.1	Now at that time several very well-known well-to-do brahmins were residing in Manasākaṭa. They included	NA
dn13:2.2	the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jānussoṇi, Todeyya, and others.	NA
dn13:3.1	Then as the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began a discussion regarding what is the path and what is not the path.	Similar discussions are found in [mn98]() = [snp3.9]() and [dn27](). | The compound _maggāmagga_ can be read either as “what is the path and what is not the path” (per commentary, _magge ca amagge ca_), or as “the variety of paths” (compare _phalāphala_, “all sorts of fruit”). Here, however, they are concerned to distinguish one path as correct.
dn13:4.1	Vāseṭṭha said this:	NA
dn13:4.2	“This is the only straight path, the direct route that delivers one who practices it to the company of Divinity; namely, that explained by the brahmin Pokkharasāti.”	This must have been earlier than Pokkharasāti’s conversion at [dn3:2.22.1](). Pokkharasāti was a family man who denied the reality of superhuman meditative attainments ([mn99:10.4]()) and emphasized ethics and duties over lineage ([mn98:3.7]()), which agrees with him being cited on ethical matters at Āpastamba Dharmasūtra 1.6.19.7 and 1.10.28. | _Brahmasahabyatā_ does not mean “union with Brahmā” but rather “rebirth as one of the members of Brahma’s retinue” (see eg. [an5.34:9.4]()). The non-dualist concept that the limited personal self merges with the cosmic divinity is expressed in Pali, rather, with such phrases as _so attā so loko_ (“the self is identical with the cosmos”). | For _añjasa_ (“direct route”) see [sn12.65:7.1]() and note.
dn13:5.1	Bhāradvāja said this:	NA
dn13:5.2	“This is the only straight path, the direct route that delivers one who practices it to the company of Divinity; namely, that explained by the brahmin Tārukkha.”	In Pali we never meet Tārukkha and he is only mentioned in his absence. He evidently advocated that lineage rather than conduct made one a brahmin ([mn98:3.4]()). There is a Tārukṣya whose view was that union (with Brahmā) arose with the conjunction of speech and breath; this was discussed alongside the views of many other brahmins (Aitareya Āraṇyaka 3.1.6.1; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka 7.19). In Rig Veda 8.46.32 a certain Balbūtha Tarukṣa the Dāsa makes an offering to a sage. Sāyaṇa, the Vedic commentator, says that Balbūtha Tarukṣa was a guardian of cows, evidently alluding to the Aitareya Āraṇyaka, which describes Tārukṣya as a guardian of his teacher’s cows, thus locating Tārukṣya in the lineage of Tarukṣa. Hiraṇyakeśīgṛhyasūtra 2.8.19 also mentions him as a teacher, there spelled Tarukṣa.
dn13:6.1	But neither was able to persuade the other.	NA
dn13:7.1	So Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja,	NA
dn13:7.2	“Bhāradvāja, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying in a mango grove on a bank of the river Aciravatī to the north of Manasākaṭa.	NA
dn13:7.3	He has this good reputation:	NA
dn13:7.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
dn13:7.5	Come, let’s go to see him and ask him about this matter.	NA
dn13:7.6	As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”	NA
dn13:7.7	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Bhāradvāja.	NA
dn13:8.0	1. What is the Path and What is Not the Path	NA
dn13:8.1	So they went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
dn13:8.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and Vāseṭṭha told him of their conversation, adding:	NA
dn13:8.3	NA	NA
dn13:8.4	NA	NA
dn13:8.5	NA	NA
dn13:8.6	NA	NA
dn13:8.7	NA	NA
dn13:8.8	“In this matter we have a dispute, a disagreement, a difference of opinion.”	NA
dn13:9.1	“So, Vāseṭṭha, it seems that you say that	NA
dn13:9.2	the straight path is that explained by Pokkharasāti,	NA
dn13:9.3	while Bhāradvāja says that	NA
dn13:9.4	the straight path is that explained by Tārukkha.	NA
dn13:9.5	But what exactly is your disagreement about?”	NA
dn13:10.1	“About what is the path and what is not the path, worthy Gotama.	NA
dn13:10.2	Even though brahmins describe different paths—the Adhvaryu brahmins, the Taittirīya brahmins, the Chāndogya brahmins, the Cāndrāyaṇa brahmins, and the Bahvṛca brahmins—all of them still lead someone who practices them to the company of Divinity.	Identified by Wijesekera (*A Pali Reference to Brāhmaṇa-Caraṇas*, Adyar Library Bulletin, vol 20, 1956; reprinted in *Buddhist and Vedic Studies*) and Jayatilleke (*Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge*, p. 480). I use the familiar Sanskrit forms, as the Pali has several dubious spellings and variants. Their texts and corresponding Vedas are respectively: Adhvaryu = Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (incl. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad; White Yajur Veda); Taittirīya = Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (Black Yajur Veda); Chāndogya = Chāndogya Brāhmaṇa (Sāman Veda); Cāndrāyaṇa (omitted from MS edition) = Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (Rig Veda; spelling established by Wijesekera; see below at [dn13:16.2]()); Bahvṛca = Bahvṛca Brāhmaṇa (Rig Veda; incorporated in Aitareya and Kauśītaki.) This is the only time the Pali canon mentions these schools, but in some cases we can identify them with brahmins in the canon. Examples include the murmuring Chāndogya brahmin ([ud1.4]()); or the Buddha’s former teachers, who evidently hailed from the Addhariya tradition of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa ([mn26:15.1]()ff.). | Jayatilleke notes that the Śatapatha describes its own adherents as Adhvaryu (_addhariyā_), those priests of the Yajur Veda responsible for the physical acts at the ritual. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 10.5.2.20 and Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 6.5.6–10 list the Adhvaryu, Chandoga, and  Bahvṛca, thus including the same schools in the same order, except the Pali has split the Yajur and Rig followers into two.
dn13:10.3	It’s like a village or town that has many different roads nearby, yet all of them meet at that village.	Earlier they were arguing over which one of the paths was correct, whereas now they have shifted to a more universalist “many roads up the same mountain” position. When speaking with each other they saw each others’ views as contradictory, but when speaking with an outsider they adopted a more conciliatory position.
dn13:10.4	In the same way, even though brahmins describe different paths—the Adhvaryu brahmins, the Taittirīya brahmins, the Chāndogya brahmins, the Cāndrāyaṇa brahmins, and the Bahvṛca brahmins—all of them still lead someone who practices them to the company of Divinity.”	NA
dn13:11.0	2. Questioning Vāseṭṭha	NA
dn13:11.1	“Do you say, ‘they lead someone’, Vāseṭṭha?”	NA
dn13:11.2	“I do, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn13:11.3	“Do you say, ‘they lead someone’, Vāseṭṭha?”	NA
dn13:11.4	“I do, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn13:11.5	“Do you say, ‘they lead someone’, Vāseṭṭha?”	NA
dn13:11.6	“I do, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn13:12.1	“Well, of the brahmins who are proficient in the three Vedas, Vāseṭṭha, is there even a single one who has seen the Divinity with their own eyes?”	NA
dn13:12.2	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn13:12.3	“Well, has even a single one of their tutors seen the Divinity with their own eyes?”	NA
dn13:12.4	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn13:12.5	“Well, has even a single one of their tutors’ tutors seen the Divinity with their own eyes?”	NA
dn13:12.6	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn13:12.7	“Well, has anyone back to the seventh generation of tutors seen the Divinity with their own eyes?”	NA
dn13:12.8	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn13:13.1	“Well, what of the ancient seers of the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas, namely Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu? They were the authors and propagators of the hymns. Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times; and these days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it, chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taught.	The ten names in Pali include the seven authors of the so-called “family books” of the Rig Veda (Maṇḍalas 2–8). As founders of poetic lineages, we often find works by their descendants, which are not always confined to their dedicated family book. Poems by the other three authors are mostly outside the family books. Thus the sages listed here cover most of the Rig Veda, although the Vedic tradition records many other authors as well. | Aṭṭhaka = Atri Bhauma (Maṇḍala 5, rather than Aṣṭaka Vaiśvāmitra of 10.104); Vāmaka = Vamra(ka) Vaikhānasa (10.99; see 9.66); Vāmadeva = Vāmadeva Gautama (Maṇḍala 4); Vessāmitta = Viśvāmitra Gāthina (Maṇḍala 3); Yamadaggi = Jamadagni Bhārgava, a descendant of Bhṛgu (several hymns mostly in Maṇḍalas 9 and 10); Aṅgīrasa = Aṅgirasa, identified with Agni as the founder of a lineage of poet-singers (Maṇḍala 8); Bhāradvāja = Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya (Maṇḍala 6); Vāseṭṭha = Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi (Maṇḍala 7); Kassapa = Kaśyapa Mārīca (several hymns mostly in Maṇḍalas 9 and 10); Bhagu = Bhṛgu, the bringer of fire from heaven whose adoptive descendant was Gṛtsamada Bhārgava Śaunaka (Maṇḍala 2).
dn13:13.2	Did they say:	NA
dn13:13.3	‘We know and see where the Divinity is or what way he lies’?”	Unlike the Buddhist monk at [dn11:80.1]().
dn13:13.4	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn13:14.1	“So it seems that none of those brahmins have seen the Divinity with their own eyes,	NA

dn13:14.10	What do you think, Vāseṭṭha?	NA
dn13:14.11	This being so, doesn’t their statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?”	“No demonstrable basis” is _appāṭihīrakataṁ_.
dn13:14.12	“Clearly that’s the case, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn13:15.1	“Good, Vāseṭṭha. For it is impossible that they should teach the path to that which they neither know nor see.	NA
dn13:15.2	Suppose there was a queue of blind men, each holding the one in front: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see.	The “blind following the blind” is also at [mn95:13.24]() and [mn99:9.25](). Maitrī Upaniṣad 7.8–9 turns it around, saying that the blind teach false doctrines aimed at destroying the Vedas, “the doctrine of not-self” (_nairātmyavāda_), an obvious reference to Buddhists. We also find it at Kaṭha Upaniṣad 1.2.5, Mahābhārata 2.38.3, and the Jain Sūyagaḍa 1.1.2.19.
dn13:15.3	In the same way, it seems to me that the brahmins’ statement turns out to be comparable to a queue of blind men: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see.	NA
dn13:15.4	Their statement turns out to be a joke—mere words, vacuous and hollow.	NA
dn13:16.1	What do you think, Vāseṭṭha?	NA
dn13:16.2	Do the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas see the sun and moon just as other folk do? And do they pray to them and exalt them, following their course from where they rise to where they set with joined palms held in worship?”	Kuṣītaka worshiped the rising and setting sun and moon, turning himself to follow their course (Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad 2.7–9). He founded the Kauṣītaki lineage, referred to above as “those who follow the course of the moon” (_cāndrāyaṇa_).
dn13:16.3	“Yes, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn13:17.1	“What do you think, Vāseṭṭha?	NA
dn13:17.2	Though this is so, are the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas able to teach the path to the company of the sun and moon, saying:	NA
dn13:17.3	‘This is the only straight path, the direct route that delivers one who practices it to the company of the sun and moon’?”	Indra taught Bhāradvāja a new threefold knowledge by which he might become immortal and realize companionship (_sāyujya_) with the sun (Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 3.10.11.15).
dn13:17.4	“No, worthy Gotama.”	NA

He was later identified with Rudra and Śiva. | Pajāpati (“progenitor”) was the lonely god of creation; the heat of his fervent exertions (_tapas_) created the world and all things in it (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 6). | Brahmā, like Pajāpati, is also a creator god, but is the divine power immanent within creation, rather than the forgotten instigator of the past. | The Mahāsaṅgīti reading Mahiddhi (“great power”) does not seem to correspond with any particular Vedic deity. Accept the BJT reading Mahinda (Sanskrit Mahendra), the “Great Indra”, said to be a title of Indra bestowed after slaying the dragon Vṛtra (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.5.4.9). | Yama (“twin”, with his incestuous sister Yamī) was born immortal but chose mortality, becoming the god of the dead.

dn13:40-75.0	4. Teaching the Path to the Divinity	NA
dn13:40-75.1	The Buddha said this:	NA
dn13:40-75.2	“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha …	NA
dn13:40-75.3	That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. …	NA
dn13:40-75.4	Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed.	NA
dn13:76.1	They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	Here the four _brahmavihāras_ (“meditations of Brahmā”) stand in place of the four _jhānas_. _Brahmavihāras_ are simply one of the means by which _jhānas_ may be attained, chosen here to fit the stated goal of teaching the path to Brahmā. The suttas treat them as pre-Buddhist, but they have not been traced as a group in pre-Buddhist texts. However, they are shared with later non-Buddhist texts such as  Yogasūtra 1.33 and the Jain Tattvārthasūtra 7.11. | “Love” (_mettā_) is a universal positive regard and well-wishing free of personal desires or attachments. It ultimately derives from the Vedic in the sense of “union”; Mitra was the god of alliances (Rig Veda 3.59).
dn13:77.1	Suppose there was a powerful horn blower. They’d easily make themselves heard in the four quarters.	NA
dn13:77.2	In the same way, when the heart’s release by love has been developed like this, any limited deeds they’ve done don’t remain or persist there.	The mind in _jhāna_ is so powerful that it effectively overrides any limited kamma, including ordinary good or bad deeds. Unless they have committed serious crimes with a fixed kammic result such as matricide, etc., the meditator will be reborn in a Brahmā realm.
dn13:77.3	This is a path to company with Divinity.	NA
dn13:78.1	Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion …	“Compassion” (_karuṇā_) is the quality of empathy with the suffering of another or oneself and the wish to remove it.
dn13:78.2	They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing …	“Rejoicing” (_muditā_) is joyful celebration in the success of others or oneself, free of jealousy or cynicism.
dn13:78.3	They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	Equanimity (_upekkhā_) is literally “close watching”, not interfering but standing ready when needed. It is not indifference, which is why it emerges only at the end, after the positive emotions are developed.
dn13:79.1	Suppose there was a powerful horn blower. They’d easily make themselves heard in the four quarters.	NA
dn13:79.2	In the same way, when the heart’s release by equanimity has been developed and cultivated like this, any limited deeds they’ve done don’t remain or persist there.	NA
dn13:79.3	This too is a path to company with Divinity.	A brahmin student who for their whole life practices harmlessness for all beings—except at holy places—attains the world of Brahmā (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.15.1). The exception for holy places is, of course, to allow for the sacrifice.
dn13:80.1	What do you think, Vāseṭṭha?	NA
dn13:80.2	When a mendicant meditates like this, are they encumbered with possessions or not?”	NA
dn13:80.3	“They are not.”	NA

dn13:80.10	“Do they wield power or not?”	NA
dn13:80.11	“They do.”	NA
dn13:81.1	“So it seems that that mendicant is not encumbered with possessions, and neither is the Divinity.	NA
dn13:81.2	Would a mendicant who is not encumbered with possessions come together and converge with the Divinity, who isn’t encumbered with possessions?”	NA
dn13:81.3	“Yes, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn13:81.4	“Good, Vāseṭṭha! It’s quite possible that a mendicant who is not encumbered with possessions will, when the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of Divinity, who isn’t encumbered with possessions.	NA
dn13:81.5	And it seems that that mendicant has no enmity,	NA
dn13:81.6	ill will,	NA
dn13:81.7	corruption,	NA
dn13:81.8	and does wield power, while the Divinity is the same in all these things. Would a mendicant who is the same as the Divinity in all things come together and converge with him?”	NA
dn13:81.9	“Yes, worthy Gotama.”	NA
dn13:81.10	“Good, Vāseṭṭha! It’s quite possible that that mendicant will, when the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of Divinity.”	Here the entire concluding section of the Gradual Training dealing with wisdom is omitted, as the aim is limited to teaching rebirth with Brahmā to Brahmanical laypeople, rather than teaching liberation. Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja later applied to ordain, in which time the Buddha taught the full path to Nibbana ([dn27:7.8]()).
dn13:82.1	When he had spoken, Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja said to him,	NA
dn13:82.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	NA
dn13:82.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
dn13:82.4	We go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	They also went for refuge in similar circumstances at [mn98:14.4]() = [snp3.9:69.3](). According to the commentary, that was the first time they went for refuge, while this was the second time. This makes sense in terms of the progress of the teachings, for there they discuss what makes a brahmin, whereas here they ask the more subtle question how to achieve rebirth with Brahmā. The discussion, too, is on a more detailed level, with a more explicit criticism of the brahmins. Nonetheless, it is difficult to square the details of the narratives, for the opening of this sutta depicts Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja speaking about the Buddha by reputation rather than as devotees who have previously met him and gone for refuge.

dn14:0.2	The Great Discourse on Traces Left Behind	NA
dn14:1.0	1. On Past Lives	NA
dn14:1.1.1	So I have heard.	In the suttas, _apadāna_ means “evidence”, “traces left behind” ([dn27:16.4](), [dn24:2.7.3](), [mn15:3.32](), [an3.2:1.1]()). The sense here seems to have been “(story about) the traces that deeds leave behind”. The sense “legend of past lives” probably grew out of this sutta, and later became the title of the collections of legends of past lives of the monks (Thera-apadāna) and nuns (Therī-apadāna).
dn14:1.1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery, in the hut by the kareri tree.	_Kareri_ is evidently <i lang='la'>Miliusa tomentosa</i>, known as <i lang='hi'>hoom</i> or <i lang='hi'>kari</i> in Hindi. It is related to the custard apple, not the curry tree (<i lang='la'>Murraya koenigii</i>).
dn14:1.1.3	Then after the meal, on return from almsround, several mendicants sat together in the pavilion by the kareri tree and this Dhamma talk on the subject of past lives came up among them,	NA
dn14:1.1.4	“So it was in a past life; such it was in a past life.”	“Past life” is _pubbenivāsa_, literally “former abode”.
dn14:1.2.1	With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard that discussion among the mendicants.	NA
dn14:1.2.2	So he got up from his seat and went to the pavilion, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants,	NA
dn14:1.2.3	“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	NA
dn14:1.2.4	The mendicants told him what had happened, adding,	NA
dn14:1.2.5	NA	NA
dn14:1.2.6	NA	NA
dn14:1.2.7	“This is the conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.”	NA
dn14:1.3.1	“Would you like to hear a Dhamma talk on the subject of past lives?”	NA
dn14:1.3.2	“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!	NA
dn14:1.3.3	Let the Buddha give a Dhamma talk on the subject of past lives. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	NA
dn14:1.3.4	“Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
dn14:1.3.5	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
dn14:1.3.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
dn14:1.4.1	“Ninety-one eons ago, the Buddha Vipassī arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened.	At [mn71:14.2]() and [sn42.9:4.5]() the Buddha says he recollects ninety-one eons, which must refer back to the life of Vipassī. We shall see the origin of his name below.
dn14:1.4.2	Thirty-one eons ago, the Buddha Sikhī arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened.	_Sikhī_ means “crested one” and refers to a halo or crown. A story of him and his disciples is told at [sn6.14]().
dn14:1.4.3	In the same thirty-first eon, the Buddha Vessabhū arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened.	_Vessabhū_ is Sanskrit Viśvabhṛt. It means “all-bearing”, probably originating as a word for the earth. A legendary king of the same name once ruled over the city of Avantī ([dn19:36.14]()).
dn14:1.4.4	In the present fortunate eon, the Buddhas Kakusandha,	Due to the appearance of four Buddhas in this cycle it is known as “fortunate” (_bhadda_). | Stories from Kakusandha’s day appear at [mn50]() and [sn15.20:2.8](). There is no obvious etymology for his name, but perhaps it stems from _kaku_ (“peak”) and thus “the union of the peaks”, a valley at the junction of mountains.
dn14:1.4.5	Koṇāgamana,	The meaning of Koṇāgamana is unclear. In Sanskrit it is often spelled Kanakamuni, “the golden sage”, while in the (dubious) Nigali Sagar Edict of Ashoka it is Konākamana. At [thig16.1:71.1]() we hear the past life of three nuns in the time of Koṇāgamana.
dn14:1.4.6	and Kassapa arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened.	Kassapa (Sanskrit Kaśyapa) means “tortoise”. It is a common Brahmanical clan name, stemming from an ancient figure reckoned as the eldest of the “seven sages”, to whom some Vedic verses are attributed. Details of the Buddha Kassapa’s time are found at [mn81](), [sn15.20:4.1](), and [sn48.57:3.1]().
dn14:1.4.7	And in the present fortunate eon, I have arisen in the world, perfected and fully awakened.	These numbers make up a quasi-logarithmic scale: the time gaps multiply by three, while the number of Buddhas divides by two. In eon one there are four Buddhas. Thirty eons ago the number is halved, so they had two Buddhas. Twice-thirty eons before that, the number is halved again, to one Buddha, thus ending the scale.
dn14:1.5.1	The Buddhas Vipassī,	NA
dn14:1.5.2	Sikhī,	NA
dn14:1.5.3	and Vessabhū were born as aristocrats into aristocrat families.	NA
dn14:1.5.4	The Buddhas Kakusandha,	NA
dn14:1.5.5	Koṇāgamana,	NA
dn14:1.5.6	and Kassapa were born as brahmins into brahmin families.	NA
dn14:1.5.7	I was born as an aristocrat into an aristocrat family.	In ancient India, the “aristocrats” (_khattiya_) and the brahmins vied for the prestige of being the highest class. The traditional business of the aristocrats was land, politics, agriculture, and war, while the brahmins were a hereditary priestly caste who served as advisers and ritualists. It is said that the Buddha-to-be was born in whatever caste was most prestigious at the time so that his word would have the most impact. | In this sutta, the Buddha simply refers to himself as “I” with no personal name. When the seven Buddhas are listed at [dn32:3.14](), however, he is called Aṅgīrasa.
dn14:1.6.1	Koṇḍañña was the clan of Vipassī,	The Koṇḍaññas (Sanskrit Kauṇḍinya) originated as the leading clan of the city of Kuṇḍina the capital of Vidarbha, which is probably modern Kaundinyapura on the Wardha River.

dn14:1.6.7	Gotama is my clan.	Gotama is an ancient Brahmanical clan name, which like Kassapa stems from the Vedas and the seven sages. Why does the Buddha, an aristocrat, have a Brahmanical clan? During initiation by a Brahmanical family priest (_purohita_), an aristocrat was ritually determined to be a brahmin for a short time, during which he would assume the lineage name of the priest. After being restored as an aristocrat, he and his family would still be referred to by that name. Thus the Sakyans’ _purohita_ must have been of the Gotama lineage. Other examples of this practice include the Mallas who are called Vāseṭṭha ([dn16:5.19.2]()) and Saccaka who is called Aggivessana ([mn35:4.2]()). The Jain Ācārāṅgasūtra 2.15.15 records a similar situation, for while Mahāvīra was, like the Buddha, a _khattiya_, he was of the Kāśyapa _gotta_, and various relatives were assigned to Vāsiṣṭha,  Kauṇḍinya, and  Kauśika.

dn14:1.8.1	Vipassī was awakened at the root of a patala tree.	*Stereospermum chelonoides*. Dictionaries of Pali and Sanskrit call this the “trumpet-flower tree”, but that is more commonly used for *Oroxylum indicum*.
dn14:1.8.2	Sikhī was awakened at the root of a white-mango tree.	_Puṇḍarīka_ is the white lotus, but here it is the name of a tree. The commentary says this is _setamba_ (“white-mango”). It is not, however, the mango variety known by that name today (*Mangifera caesia*), which is not found in India.
dn14:1.8.3	Vessabhū was awakened at the root of a sal tree.	*Shorea robusta*.
dn14:1.8.4	Kakusandha was awakened at the root of a sirisa tree.	*Albizia lebbeck*, sometimes still known by the old name of sirisa. Older sources sometimes call it an acacia.

dn14:1.12.9	and their capital city was named Anoma.	NA
dn14:1.12.10	Kakusandha’s father was the brahmin Aggidatta,	The names of the brahmin fathers all refer to ritual offerings. Aggidatta means “offered to the fire”.
dn14:1.12.11	and his birth mother was the brahmin lady Visākhā.	The names of the brahmin mothers all recall Indian _nakkhatta_. These are “constellations” or more properly “lunar mansions”; segments of the sky through which the Moon passes and which are associated with certain stars or clusters. In the Atharvaveda system, Visākhā is the 16th lunar asterism (Libra).
dn14:1.12.12	At that time the king was Khema,	NA
dn14:1.12.13	whose capital city was named Khemavatī.	Based on the Ashoka pillar there, this is identified with modern Gotihawa, southeast of Kapilavastu in Nepal.
dn14:1.12.14	Koṇāgamana’s father was the brahmin Yaññadatta,	“Offered in sacrifice”.
dn14:1.12.15	and his birth mother was the brahmin lady Uttarā.	Several constellations are distinguished as “former” (_pubba_) and “later” (_uttara_). Since it lies between Visākhā and Dhanavatī, this may be the 21st constellation, Uttara Āṣāḍhā (Sagittarius/Capricorn).
dn14:1.12.16	At that time the king was Sobha,	NA
dn14:1.12.17	whose capital city was named Sobhavatī.	If the dubious Ashokan edict there is to be believed, this was traditionally identified with the town known today as Nigali Sagar near Kapilavastu in Nepal.
dn14:1.12.18	Kassapa’s father was the brahmin Brahmadatta,	“Offered to Brahmā”. Many of the Jātakas feature a king of this name, usually said to reside in Benares.
dn14:1.12.19	and his birth mother was the brahmin lady Dhanavatī.	Dhanavatī means “wealthy”, but it is also an alternate name for the 23rd constellation, _dhaniṣṭhā_ (or _śraviṣṭā_, Delphinus).
dn14:1.12.20	At that time the king was Kikī,	Kikī (“blue jay”) appears in the story of the past Buddha Kassapa at [mn81]().

dn14:1.17.0	2. What’s Normal For One Intent on Awakening	NA
dn14:1.17.1	When Vipassī, the being intent on awakening, passed away from the host of joyful gods, he was conceived in his mother’s womb, mindful and aware.	These characteristics of the birth of the Buddha-to-be are also found in [mn123](), where Ānanda quotes the Buddha, although the wording is a little different and three extra details are added at the start. In addition, this detail and that about emerging mindfully from the womb are found at [an4.127](). | Normally in early Pali, the word _bodhisatta_ is reserved for the Buddha-to-be once he has left home and is practicing “intent on awakening” (eg. [mn26:13.1]()). This passage extends the usage back as far as the end of the immediate past life.
dn14:1.17.2	This is normal in such a case.	“Normal” is _dhammatā_, a natural principle. This entire passage differs from the earliest concept of the bodhisatta (“one intent on awakening”), which in early texts is typically applied to Siddhattha after he left the home.
dn14:1.17.3	It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening passes away from the host of joyful gods, he is conceived in his mother’s womb.	NA
dn14:1.17.4	And then—in this world with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—an immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the gods.	NA
dn14:1.17.5	Even in the boundless void of interstellar space—so utterly dark that even the light of the moon and the sun, so mighty and powerful, makes no impression—an immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the gods.	The commentary identifies this realm of “utter darkness” (_andhakāratimisā_) with a cold hell realm. There is a corresponding Purāṇic hell called _andhatāmisra_. | _Asaṁvutā_ was translated by Ñāṇamoḷī as “abysmal”, but this relies on a commentarial cosmology that is not found in the suttas. The sense, rather, is “boundless”. The root harks back to the Vedic serpent Vṛtra who wraps the world in darkness. | _Nānubhonti_ (“makes no impression”) is glossed in the commentary to [an4.127]() as _nappahonti_ “ineffective”.
dn14:1.17.6	And the sentient beings reborn there recognize each other by that light: ‘So, it seems other sentient beings have been reborn here!’	The light is a physical one, not just a metaphor. From this, it appears that sentient beings may be spontaneously reborn in interstellar space. Compare the problem of the “Boltzmann brain” in physics.
dn14:1.17.7	And this ten-thousandfold galaxy shakes and rocks and trembles. And an immeasurable, magnificent light appears in the world, surpassing the glory of the gods.	NA
dn14:1.17.8	This is normal in such a case.	NA
dn14:1.17.9	It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, four godlings approach to guard the four quarters, so that no human or non-human or anyone at all shall harm the being intent on awakening or his mother.	These are the Four Great Kings, regarded as protector deities.
dn14:1.17.10	This is normal in such a case.	NA
dn14:1.18.1	It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, she becomes naturally ethical. She refrains from killing living creatures, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.	The five precepts.
dn14:1.18.2	This is normal in such a case.	NA
dn14:1.19.1	It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, she no longer feels sexual desire for men, and she cannot be violated by a man of lustful intent.	NA
dn14:1.19.2	This is normal in such a case.	NA
dn14:1.20.1	It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, she obtains the five kinds of sensual stimulation and amuses herself, supplied and provided with them.	While sensual pleasures provoke attachment, they are nonetheless a kind of pleasure and therefore a sign of virtue and good past kamma.
dn14:1.20.2	This is normal in such a case.	NA
dn14:1.21.1	It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, no afflictions beset her. She’s happy and free of bodily fatigue. And she sees the being intent on awakening in her womb, whole in his major and minor limbs, not deficient in any faculty.	NA
dn14:1.21.2	Suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed with all good qualities. And it was strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown.	NA
dn14:1.21.3	And someone with clear eyes were to take it in their hand and examine it: ‘This beryl gem is naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed with all good qualities. And it’s strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown.’	NA
dn14:1.21.4	In the same way, when the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, no afflictions beset her. She’s happy and free of bodily fatigue. And she sees the being intent on awakening in her womb, whole in his major and minor limbs, not deficient in any faculty.	NA
dn14:1.21.5	This is normal in such a case.	NA
dn14:1.22.1	It’s normal that, seven days after the being intent on awakening is born, his mother passes away and is reborn in the host of joyful gods.	This tragic detail is also mentioned in [ud5.2](). The Buddha is raised by a step-mother, which in our Buddha’s case was Māyā’s sister Mahāpajāpatī ([an8.51:9.8](), [mn142:3.3]()).
dn14:1.22.2	This is normal in such a case.	NA
dn14:1.23.1	It’s normal that, while other women carry the infant in the womb for nine or ten months before giving birth, not so the mother of the being intent on awakening. She gives birth after exactly ten months.	Ten signifies fullness and completion, as for example the “ten directions”. | The notion that the term of pregnancy was “nine or ten months” is also found at Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.9.1. In the Rig Veda it is typically “in the tenth month” (5.78.7, 10.84.3).
dn14:1.23.2	This is normal in such a case.	NA
dn14:1.24.1	It’s normal that, while other women give birth while sitting or lying down, not so the mother of the being intent on awakening. She only gives birth standing up.	In illustrations she is depicted standing while holding a tree in the pose known as _sālabhañjikā_, a common motif in Indian art representing the abundance of springtime.
dn14:1.24.2	This is normal in such a case.	NA
dn14:1.25.1	It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening emerges from his mother’s womb, gods receive him first, then humans.	NA
dn14:1.25.2	This is normal in such a case.	NA
dn14:1.26.1	It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening emerges from his mother’s womb, before he reaches the ground, four godlings receive him and place him before his mother, saying: ‘Rejoice, O Queen! An illustrious son is born to you.’	NA
dn14:1.26.2	This is normal in such a case.	NA
dn14:1.27.1	It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening emerges from his mother’s womb, he emerges already clean, unsoiled by waters, mucus, blood, or any other kind of impurity, pure and clean.	NA
dn14:1.27.2	Suppose a jewel-treasure was placed on a cloth from Kāsi. The jewel would not soil the cloth, nor would the cloth soil the jewel.	Kāsi is the nation of which Varanasi is the capital. Their cloth was of exceptional quality.
dn14:1.27.3	Why is that?	NA
dn14:1.27.4	Because of the cleanliness of them both.	NA
dn14:1.27.5	In the same way, when the being intent on awakening emerges from his mother’s womb, he emerges already clean, unsoiled by waters, mucus, blood, or any other kind of impurity, pure and clean.	NA
dn14:1.27.6	This is normal in such a case.	NA
dn14:1.28.1	It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening emerges from his mother’s womb, two showers of water appear from the sky, one cool, one warm, for bathing the being intent on awakening and his mother.	NA
dn14:1.28.2	This is normal in such a case.	NA
dn14:1.29.1	It’s normal that, as soon as he’s born, the being intent on awakening stands firm with his own feet on the ground. Facing north, he takes seven strides with a white parasol held above him, surveys all quarters, and makes this dramatic proclamation: ‘I am the foremost in the world! I am the eldest in the world! I am the first in the world! This is my last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.’	This passage implies that Buddhahood was destined from the time of birth, which stands in contrast to the rest of the suttas, where Buddhahood was hard-won by the Bodhisatta’s efforts while striving for awakening. | “Stands firm on his own feet” signifies that he will be awakened by his own efforts. | “North” is _uttara_, which is also “the beyond”; this predicts his attaining Nibbana. | “Seven strides” signifies crossing over the vast cycles of birth and death, especially by developing the seven awakening factors. | The “white parasol” signifies purity and royalty. | “Surveying all quarters” signifies his universal knowledge. | The “dramatic proclamation” is _āsabhiṁ vācaṁ_, literally the “voice of a bull”. Other contexts show that this is is an expression emphasizing speech that is dramatic and imposing ([sn52.9:3.2](), [dn28:1.5]() = [sn47.12:5.2]()). | At Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.1.1 and Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.1.1 the “vital breath” (_prāṇa_) is said to be “eldest and first” (_jyeṣṭhaśca śreṣṭhaśca_).
dn14:1.29.2	This is normal in such a case.	NA
dn14:1.30.1	It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening emerges from his mother’s womb, then—in this world with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—an immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the gods.	NA

dn14:1.31.0	3. The Thirty-Two Marks of a Great Man	NA
dn14:1.31.1	When Prince Vipassī was born, they announced it to King Bandhumā,	Many of the details of the following account were later incorporated into the life of Gotama, under the principle that the major events of the lives of Buddhas follow a natural order. Nonetheless, they are not always consistent with other accounts in early texts. For example, in the Attadaṇḍasutta the Buddha says his going forth was prompted by disillusionment and fear due to chronic conflict and warfare ([snp4.15]()).
dn14:1.31.2	‘Sire, your son is born! Let your majesty examine him!’	NA
dn14:1.31.3	When the king had examined the prince, he had the brahmin soothsayers summoned and said to them,	In [snp3.11](), the newborn Siddhattha is examined by the dark hermit Asita. These two versions are combined in later accounts.
dn14:1.31.4	‘Gentlemen, please examine the prince.’	NA
dn14:1.31.5	When they had examined him they said to the king,	NA
dn14:1.31.6	‘Rejoice, O King! An illustrious son is born to you. You are fortunate, so very fortunate, to have a son such as this born in this family!	NA
dn14:1.31.7	For the prince has the thirty-two marks of a great man. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.	Asita did not look at the 32 marks, and he predicted only one destiny: that he would become a Buddha.
dn14:1.31.8	If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures.	NA

dn14:1.31.10	the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure.	NA
dn14:1.31.11	He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.	NA
dn14:1.31.12	After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword.	NA
dn14:1.31.13	But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world.	NA
dn14:1.32.1	And what are the marks which he possesses?	The marks are elsewhere listed in [dn30:1.2.1]() and [mn91:9.1](). Here I list the related marks in the Bṛhatsaṁhitā as identified by Nathan McGovern (*On the Origins of the 32 Marks of a Great Man*, Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, 2016, vol. 39, pp. 207–247).
dn14:1.32.2	NA	NA
dn14:1.32.3	NA	NA
dn14:1.32.4	NA	NA
dn14:1.32.5	NA	NA
dn14:1.32.6	NA	NA
dn14:1.32.7	He has well-planted feet.	This echoes the posture of the newborn bodhisatta, and has the same meaning: that he will become awakened by “standing on his own two feet”.
dn14:1.32.8	On the soles of his feet there are thousand-spoked wheels, with rims and hubs, complete in every detail.	These leave marks that were seen by Doṇa ([an4.36:1.3]()). They are often depicted in Buddhist art, signifying the perfection and completeness of the traces that the Buddha leaves behind in his teachings and practice. Bṛhatsaṁhitā 69.17 lists several auspicious marks, including the wheel.
dn14:1.32.9	He has stretched heels.	Described as “abundantly long” at [dn30:1.12.8]().
dn14:1.32.10	He has long fingers.	Same at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.36.
dn14:1.32.11	His hands and feet are tender.	Tender feet at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.2.
dn14:1.32.12	He has serried hands and feet.	Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.2 has _śliṣtāṅgulī_ (“compact or sticky fingers”). The commentary denies that the Pali _jāla_ means a physical web. I think it means that the fingers and toes were usually held together rather than splayed, hence not letting things slip through the fingers.
dn14:1.32.13	The tops of his feet are arched.	_Ussaṅkha_ means “(curved) up like a shell”, while Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.2 says “curved up like a tortoise”. The descriptive verse at [dn30:1.21.12]() shows that it refers to the tops of the feet.
dn14:1.32.14	His calves are like those of an antelope.	These are presumably the long, elegant rear calves of the Indian Blackbuck.
dn14:1.32.15	When standing upright and not bending over, the palms of both hands touch the knees.	This agrees with Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.35.
dn14:1.32.16	His private parts are covered in a foreskin.	Same at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.8.
dn14:1.32.17	He is golden colored; his skin shines like lustrous gold.	Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.102 says kings have a shining complexion.
dn14:1.32.18	He has delicate skin, so delicate that dust and dirt don’t stick to his body.	Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.102 mentions a “clean complexion” (_śuddha_).
dn14:1.32.19	His hairs grow one per pore.	Same at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.5.
dn14:1.32.20	His hairs stand up; they’re blue-black and curl clockwise.	Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.26 says those with hairs turning right become kings.
dn14:1.32.21	His body is tall and straight-limbed.	Here _brahm-_ is an adjective from √_brah_ + _ma_, equivalent to the Sanskrit _bṛṁh_, having the sense “grown, extended”. The Sanskrit form here is _bṛhadṛjugātra_.
dn14:1.32.22	He has bulging muscles in seven places.	Hands, feet, shoulders, and chest ([dn30:1.13.5]()).
dn14:1.32.23	His chest is like that of a lion.	Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.18 compares not the chest but the hips with a lion.
dn14:1.32.24	He is filled out between the shoulders.	Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.27 says the heart is raised and muscular.
dn14:1.32.25	He has the proportional circumference of a banyan tree: the span of his arms equals the height of his body.	Bṛhatsaṁhitā 69.13 has the same proportions without the simile. These are the normal human proportions, yet we cannot touch our knees without bending. The only way these marks could be reconciled is if the arms were extra long and the length of the legs below the knees was extra long as well. And this is exactly what we are told: the ankles are stretched and long, and the calves are like those of an antelope, whose rear calves are long proportionate to the thigh. Thus in this regard the marks appear to be internally consistent, though not describing normal human anatomy.
dn14:1.32.26	His torso is cylindrical.	NA
dn14:1.32.27	He has ridged taste buds.	“Ridged taste buds” is _rasaggasaggī_. _Rasa_ can mean either “taste” or “nutrition”, but the use of _ojā_ in [dn30:2.9.8]() confirms the latter. _Gasa_ is “swallow” and per [dn30:2.7.4]() it is the “conveyance of savor” (_rasaharaṇīyo_). _Agga_ often means “best”, but this is derived from the primary sense of “peak”. The descriptors _uddhagga_ (“raised”) at [dn30:2.7.4]() and _susaṇṭhitā_ (“prominent”) at [dn30:2.9.8]() confirm that the latter is meant. The mark refers to taste buds raised in noticeable ridges on the tongue that absorb nutrition and aid digestion. It has often been interpreted as “excellent (_aggī_) sense (_gasa_) of taste (_rasa_)”, but this, being imperceptible to others, is rather a secondary consequence of the mark.
dn14:1.32.28	His jaw is like that of a lion.	NA
dn14:1.32.29	He has forty teeth.	NA
dn14:1.32.30	His teeth are even.	Even, gapless, and white teeth are at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.52.
dn14:1.32.31	His teeth have no gaps.	NA
dn14:1.32.32	His teeth are perfectly white.	NA
dn14:1.32.33	He has a large tongue.	Same at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.53.
dn14:1.32.34	He has the voice of the Divinity, like a cuckoo’s call.	NA
dn14:1.32.35	His eyes are indigo.	At [thig13.1:6.2]() Ambapālī describes her eyes as _abhinīla_. While some Indians do indeed have blue eyes, this probably describes a black so deep it appears blue.
dn14:1.32.36	He has eyelashes like a cow’s.	Cows have long and elegant eyelashes.
dn14:1.32.37	Between his eyebrows there grows a tuft, soft and white like cotton-wool.	NA
dn14:1.32.38	The crown of his head is like a turban.	The _uṇhīsa_ is depicted as a bulge on the Buddha’s crown.
dn14:1.33.1	These are the thirty-two marks of a great man that the prince has. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.	NA
dn14:1.33.2	If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn14:1.33.3	NA	NA
dn14:1.33.4	NA	NA
dn14:1.33.5	NA	NA
dn14:1.33.6	NA	NA
dn14:1.33.7	But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world.’	NA
dn14:1.33.8.0	4. How He Came to be Known as Vipassī	NA
dn14:1.33.9	Then King Bandhumā had the brahmin soothsayers dressed in unworn clothes and satisfied all their needs.	This is the _dakkhiṇā_, the religious offering given in gratitude and respect for the services.
dn14:1.34.1	Then the king appointed nursemaids for Prince Vipassī.	His birth mother has passed away and there is no mention of a step-mother.
dn14:1.34.2	Some suckled him, some bathed him, some held him, and some carried him on their hip.	NA
dn14:1.34.3	From when he was born, a white parasol was held over him night and day, with the thought,	NA
dn14:1.34.4	‘Don’t let cold, heat, grass, dust, or damp bother him.’	NA
dn14:1.34.5	He was dear and beloved by many people,	NA
dn14:1.34.6	like a blue water lily, or a pink or white lotus.	NA
dn14:1.34.7	NA	NA
dn14:1.34.8	He was always passed from hip to hip.	NA
dn14:1.35.1	From when he was born, his voice was charming, graceful, sweet, and lovely.	NA
dn14:1.35.2	It was as sweet as the song of a cuckoo-bird found in the Himalayas.	NA
dn14:1.35.3	NA	NA
dn14:1.36.1	From when he was born, Prince Vipassī had the power of clairvoyance which manifested as a result of past deeds, by which he could see for a league all around both by day and by night.	Normally clairvoyance and related abilities are said to arise due to the power of the fourth _jhāna_, whereas here it comes naturally due to past kamma. After _jhāna_ this ability is empowered by the radiant mind clear of hindrances, whereas here it seems to be a more limited ability to see clearly and in the dark.
dn14:1.37.1	And he was unblinkingly watchful, like the gods of the thirty-three.	NA
dn14:1.37.2	And because it was said that he was unblinkingly watchful, he came to be known as ‘Vipassī’.	Vipassī’s name is simply the personal form of the word made famous in Buddhist meditation, _vipassanā_. This is usually rendered as “insight”, but the sense here is more like “clear seeing”.
dn14:1.37.3	Then while King Bandhumā was sitting in court, he’d sit Prince Vipassī in his lap and explain the case to him.	NA
dn14:1.37.4	And sitting there in his father’s lap, Vipassī would thoroughly consider the case and draw a conclusion using a logical procedure.	NA
dn14:1.37.5	So this was all the more reason for him to be known as ‘Vipassī’.	Indian epistemology acknowledges two fundamental sources of knowledge: direct perception (_paccakkha_) and inference (_anumāna_). This passage shows that _vipassanā_ includes both. I render _vipassanā_ with “discernment” in an attempt to capture both nuances, rather than the standard “insight”.
dn14:1.38.1	Then King Bandhumā had three stilt longhouses built for him—one for the winter, one for the summer, and one for the rainy season,	NA
dn14:1.38.2	and provided him with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	NA
dn14:1.38.3	Prince Vipassī stayed in a stilt longhouse without coming downstairs for the four months of the rainy season, where he was entertained by musicians—none of them men.	NA
dn14:1.38.4	The first recitation section.	NA
dn14:2.1.0	5. The Old Man	NA
dn14:2.1.1	Then, after many years, many hundred years, many thousand years had passed, Prince Vipassī addressed his charioteer,	Here begins the story of the four signs that led to Vipassī’s going forth—an old man, a sick man, a dead man, and a renunciate. Later texts apply the same story to Siddhattha, indeed to all bodhisattvas. | These four “signs” (_nimitta_) are also called “messengers of the gods”, reckoned as five ([mn130]()) or three ([an3.36]()).
dn14:2.1.2	‘My dear charioteer, harness the finest chariots. We will go to a park and see the scenery.’	NA
dn14:2.1.3	‘Yes, sir,’ replied the charioteer. He harnessed the chariots and informed the prince,	NA
dn14:2.1.4	‘Sire, the finest chariots are harnessed.	NA
dn14:2.1.5	Please go at your convenience.’	NA
dn14:2.1.6	Then Prince Vipassī mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out for the park.	NA
dn14:2.2.1	Along the way he saw an elderly man, bent double, crooked, leaning on a staff, trembling as he walked, ailing, past his prime.	NA
dn14:2.2.2	He addressed his charioteer,	NA
dn14:2.2.3	‘My dear charioteer, what has that man done?	NA
dn14:2.2.4	For his hair and his body are unlike those of other men.’	NA
dn14:2.2.5	‘That, Your Majesty, is called an old man.’	NA
dn14:2.2.6	‘But why is he called an old man?’	NA
dn14:2.2.7	‘He’s called an old man because now he has not long to live.’	NA
dn14:2.2.8	‘But my dear charioteer, am I liable to grow old? Am I not exempt from old age?’	NA
dn14:2.2.9	‘Everyone is liable to grow old, Your Majesty, including you. No-one is exempt from old age.’	NA
dn14:2.2.10	‘Well then, my dear charioteer, that’s enough of the park for today. Let’s return to the royal compound.’	_Antepuraṁ_ (“royal compound”) was the inner sanctum of the royal residence. Maximally it referred to the area enclosed by walls within which the ruling families and staff lived. It later became used in the more restricted sense of “harem”.
dn14:2.2.11	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the charioteer and did so.	NA
dn14:2.2.12	Back at the royal compound, the prince brooded, miserable and sad:	“Brood” is _pajjhāyati_. He is having an existential crisis.
dn14:2.2.13	‘Curse this thing called rebirth, since old age will come to anyone who’s born.’	NA
dn14:2.3.1	Then King Bandhumā summoned the charioteer and said,	NA
dn14:2.3.2	‘My dear charioteer, I hope the prince enjoyed himself at the park? I hope he was happy there?’	NA
dn14:2.3.3	‘No, Your Majesty, the prince didn’t enjoy himself at the park.’	NA
dn14:2.3.4	‘But what did he see on the way to the park?’	NA
dn14:2.3.5	And the charioteer told the king about seeing the old man and the prince’s reaction.	NA
dn14:2.3.6	NA	NA
dn14:2.3.7	NA	NA
dn14:2.3.8	NA	NA
dn14:2.3.9	NA	NA
dn14:2.3.10	NA	NA
dn14:2.3.11	NA	NA

dn14:2.3.14	NA	NA
dn14:2.3.15	NA	NA
dn14:2.3.16	NA	NA
dn14:2.4.0	6. The Sick Man	NA
dn14:2.4.1	Then King Bandhumā thought,	NA
dn14:2.4.2	‘Prince Vipassī must not renounce the throne. He must not go forth from the lay life to homelessness. And the words of the brahmin soothsayers must not come true.’	In any story of prophecy, efforts are made to avert it and they invariably fail. This is a recursive property of prophetic myth. If the prophecy were averted, the myth would not exist and we would not know of it; but because the myth does exist, we know how it ends and the prophecy must come true.
dn14:2.4.3	To this end he provided the prince with even more of the five kinds of sensual stimulation,	NA
dn14:2.4.4	NA	NA
dn14:2.4.5	with which the prince amused himself.	NA
dn14:2.5.1	Then, after many thousand years had passed, Prince Vipassī had his charioteer drive him to the park once more.	An existential crisis takes its own time; it cannot be rushed.
dn14:2.6.1	Along the way he saw a man who was sick, suffering, gravely ill, collapsed in his own urine and feces, being picked up by some and put down by others.	NA
dn14:2.6.2	He addressed his charioteer,	NA
dn14:2.6.3	‘My dear charioteer, what has that man done?	NA
dn14:2.6.4	For his eyes and his voice are unlike those of other men.’	NA
dn14:2.6.5	‘That, Your Majesty, is called a sick man.’	NA
dn14:2.6.6	‘But why is he called a sick man?’	NA
dn14:2.6.7	‘He’s called a sick man; hopefully he will recover from that illness.’	NA
dn14:2.6.8	‘But my dear charioteer, am I liable to fall sick? Am I not exempt from sickness?’	NA
dn14:2.6.9	‘Everyone is liable to fall sick, Your Majesty, including you. No-one is exempt from sickness.’	NA
dn14:2.6.10	‘Well then, my dear charioteer, that’s enough of the park for today. Let’s return to the royal compound.’	NA
dn14:2.6.11	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the charioteer and did so.	NA
dn14:2.6.12	Back at the royal compound, the prince brooded, miserable and sad:	NA
dn14:2.6.13	‘Curse this thing called rebirth, since old age and sickness will come to anyone who’s born.’	NA
dn14:2.7.1	Then King Bandhumā summoned the charioteer and said,	NA
dn14:2.7.2	‘My dear charioteer, I hope the prince enjoyed himself at the park? I hope he was happy there?’	NA
dn14:2.7.3	‘No, Your Majesty, the prince didn’t enjoy himself at the park.’	NA
dn14:2.7.4	‘But what did he see on the way to the park?’	NA
dn14:2.7.5	And the charioteer told the king about seeing the sick man and the prince’s reaction.	NA

dn14:2.7.15	NA	NA
dn14:2.7.16	NA	NA
dn14:2.8.0	7. The Dead Man	NA
dn14:2.8.1	Then King Bandhumā thought,	NA
dn14:2.8.2	‘Prince Vipassī must not renounce the throne. He must not go forth from the lay life to homelessness. And the words of the brahmin soothsayers must not come true.’	NA
dn14:2.8.3	To this end he provided the prince with even more of the five kinds of sensual stimulation,	NA
dn14:2.8.4	NA	NA
dn14:2.9.1	with which the prince amused himself.	NA
dn14:2.9.2	Then, after many thousand years had passed, Prince Vipassī had his charioteer drive him to the park once more.	NA
dn14:2.10.1	Along the way he saw a large crowd gathered making a bier out of garments of different colors.	Neither reading _vilāta_ or _milāta_ appears to occur elsewhere in this sense. The commentary says it is a bier (_sivika_).
dn14:2.10.2	He addressed his charioteer,	NA
dn14:2.10.3	‘My dear charioteer, why is that crowd making a bier?’	NA
dn14:2.10.4	‘That, Your Majesty, is for someone who’s departed.’	NA
dn14:2.10.5	‘Well then, drive the chariot up to the departed.’	NA
dn14:2.10.6	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the charioteer, and did so.	NA
dn14:2.10.7	When the prince saw the corpse of the departed, he addressed the charioteer,	NA
dn14:2.10.8	‘But why is he called departed?’	NA
dn14:2.10.9	‘He’s called departed because now his mother and father, his relatives and kin shall see him no more, and he shall never again see them.’	NA
dn14:2.10.10	‘But my dear charioteer, am I liable to die? Am I not exempt from death?	NA
dn14:2.10.11	Will the king and queen and my other relatives and kin see me no more?	NA
dn14:2.10.12	And shall I never again see them?’	NA
dn14:2.10.13	‘Everyone is liable to die, Your Majesty, including you. No-one is exempt from death.	NA
dn14:2.10.14	The king and queen and your other relatives and kin shall see you no more,	NA
dn14:2.10.15	and you shall never again see them.’	NA
dn14:2.10.16	‘Well then, my dear charioteer, that’s enough of the park for today. Let’s return to the royal compound.’	NA

dn14:2.12.3	To this end he provided the prince with even more of the five kinds of sensual stimulation,	NA

dn14:2.13.7	NA	NA
dn14:2.14.1	Along the way he saw a man, a renunciate with shaven head, wearing an ocher robe.	“Renunciate” is _pabbajita_ (“one who has gone forth”), one of the many words for religious ascetics. It is a general term and does not specify his affiliation.
dn14:2.14.2	He addressed his charioteer,	NA
dn14:2.14.3	‘My dear charioteer, what has that man done?	NA
dn14:2.14.4	For his head and his clothes are unlike those of other men.’	NA
dn14:2.14.5	‘That, Your Majesty, is called a renunciate.’	NA
dn14:2.14.6	‘But why is he called a renunciate?’	NA
dn14:2.14.7	‘He is called a renunciate because he celebrates principled and fair conduct, skillful actions, good deeds, harmlessness, and sympathy for living creatures.’	“Celebrate” is _sādhu_, the famous Buddhist words of approval and rejoicing still heard every day in Theravāda Buddhist cultures. It later acquired the meaning “renunciate” but does not have that sense in early Pali. The virtues that he celebrates are common values of Indian religions.
dn14:2.14.8	‘Then I celebrate the one called a renunciate, who celebrates principled and fair conduct, skillful actions, good deeds, harmlessness, and sympathy for living creatures!	NA
dn14:2.14.9	Well then, drive the chariot up to that renunciate.’	NA
dn14:2.14.10	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the charioteer, and did so.	NA
dn14:2.14.11	Then Prince Vipassī said to that renunciate,	NA
dn14:2.14.12	‘My good man, what have you done?	NA
dn14:2.14.13	For your head and your clothes are unlike those of other men.’	NA
dn14:2.14.14	‘Sire, I am what is called a renunciate.’	NA
dn14:2.14.15	‘But why are you called a renunciate?’	NA
dn14:2.14.16	‘I am called a renunciate because I celebrate principled and fair conduct, skillful actions, good deeds, harmlessness, and sympathy for living creatures.’	NA
dn14:2.14.17	‘Then I celebrate the one called a renunciate, who celebrates principled and fair conduct, skillful actions, good deeds, harmlessness, and sympathy for living creatures!’	NA
dn14:2.15.0	9. The Going Forth	NA
dn14:2.15.1	Then the prince addressed the charioteer,	NA
dn14:2.15.2	‘Well then, my dear charioteer, take the chariot and return to the royal compound.	NA
dn14:2.15.3	I shall shave off my hair and beard right here, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’	His apparently sudden decision to go forth arises only after an extensive period of crisis and contemplation.
dn14:2.15.4	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the charioteer and did so.	NA
dn14:2.15.5	Then Prince Vipassī shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
dn14:2.16.0	10. A Great Crowd Goes Forth	NA
dn14:2.16.1	A large crowd of 84,000 people in the capital of Bandhumatī heard	NA
dn14:2.16.2	that Vipassī had gone forth.	NA
dn14:2.16.3	It occurred to them,	NA
dn14:2.16.4	‘This must be no ordinary teaching and training, no ordinary going forth in which Prince Vipassī has gone forth.	NA
dn14:2.16.5	If even the prince goes forth, why don’t we do the same?’	NA
dn14:2.16.6	Then that great crowd of 84,000 people shaved off their hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and followed the one intent on awakening, Vipassī, by going forth from the lay life to homelessness.	The idea that a whole populace would follow the bodhisatta on his renunciate path occurs several times in the Jātakas.
dn14:2.16.7	Escorted by that assembly, Vipassī wandered on tour among the villages, towns, and capital cities.	Following the PTS edition in omitting _janapada_, which is absent from the commentary and the parallel passage at [dn19:58.3]().
dn14:2.17.1	Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	NA
dn14:2.17.2	‘It’s not appropriate for me to live in a crowd. Why don’t I live alone, withdrawn from the group?’	NA
dn14:2.17.3	After some time he withdrew from the group to live alone. The 84,000 went one way, but Vipassī went another.	NA
dn14:2.18.0	11. Vipassī’s Reflections	NA
dn14:2.18.1	Then as Vipassī, the one intent on awakening, was in private retreat in his dwelling, this thought came to his mind,	This is the only place _vāsūpagata_ (“entered his dwelling”) is added to this stock phrase.
dn14:2.18.2	‘Alas, this world has fallen into trouble. It’s born, grows old, dies, passes away, and is reborn, yet it doesn’t understand how to escape from this suffering, from old age and death.	At [sn12.4]()–10 this same reflection is attributed to each of the seven past Buddhas, kicking off an investigation into dependent origination in reverse order, starting with the outcome: suffering. Here this is treated as a meditative contemplation, whereas the next sutta, [dn15]() Mahānidānasutta, delves into the philosophical implications.
dn14:2.18.3	Oh, when will an escape be found from this suffering, from old age and death?’	NA
dn14:2.18.4	Then Vipassī thought,	NA
dn14:2.18.5	‘When what exists is there old age and death? What is a condition for old age and death?’	The reflection shows how the bodhisatta is still digging into the trauma of discovering the reality of old age and death.
dn14:2.18.6	Then, through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,	_Yoniso maniskāra_ (“rational application of mind”) is a distinctively Buddhist term that literally means “applying the mind by way of source”. It is mostly used in investigating causality, although over time it came to have a more general sense of “reflection, inquiry, attention”.
dn14:2.18.7	‘When rebirth exists there’s old age and death. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’	Here begins the sequence of dependent origination. I give basic definitions of terms here, and more details in [dn15](). | Rebirth is a necessary antecedent condition for old age and death. Note that it is not a *sufficient* condition for old age, for many die when young.
dn14:2.18.8	Then Vipassī thought,	NA
dn14:2.18.9	‘When what exists is there rebirth? What is a condition for rebirth?’	Since there cannot be an end to the “birth” that starts this life, _jāti_ means “rebirth”, the next stage in the ongoing cycle.
dn14:2.18.10	Then, through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,	NA
dn14:2.18.11	‘When continued existence exists there’s rebirth. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.’	_Bhava_ means “being, existence, life” in the sense of “past and future lives”. It refers to the ongoing process of continued existence, transmigrating through life after life. By itself, _bhava_ has a positive connotation, and represents the longing that many people have to continue to exist after death in a permanent and happy state. The Buddha, however, situates it as just one more dimension of the flow of conditions.
dn14:2.18.12	Then Vipassī thought,	NA
dn14:2.18.13	‘When what exists is there continued existence? What is a condition for continued existence?’	NA
dn14:2.18.14	Then, through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,	NA
dn14:2.18.15	‘When grasping exists there’s continued existence. Grasping is a condition for continued existence.’	“Grasping” (_upādāna_) at sensual pleasures, views, precepts and observances, and theories of a self ([dn15:6.3]()). Grasping has the active sense of “taking up” a new life, not just “clinging” to what one has. It has a dual sense, because it also means the “fuel” that sustains the fire of existence.
dn14:2.18.16	Then Vipassī thought,	NA
dn14:2.18.17	‘When what exists is there grasping? What is a condition for grasping?’	NA
dn14:2.18.18	Then, through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,	NA
dn14:2.18.19	‘When craving exists there’s grasping. Craving is a condition for grasping.’	Craving (_taṇhā_, literally “thirst”) and grasping have a similar meaning, but craving is primal desire while grasping is more complex, involving doctrines and behaviors.
dn14:2.18.20	Then Vipassī thought,	NA
dn14:2.18.21	‘When what exists is there craving? What is a condition for craving?’	NA
dn14:2.18.22	Then, through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,	NA
dn14:2.18.23	‘When feeling exists there’s craving. Feeling is a condition for craving.’	“Feeling” (_vedanā_) is more fundamental than the complex concept of “emotion”. It refers to the hedonic tone of experience as pleasant, painful, or neutral.
dn14:2.18.24	Then Vipassī thought,	NA
dn14:2.18.25	‘When what exists is there feeling? What is a condition for feeling?’	NA
dn14:2.18.26	Then, through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,	NA
dn14:2.18.27	‘When contact exists there’s feeling. Contact is a condition for feeling.’	“Contact” is literally “touch” (_phassa_), and refers to the stimulation that occurs when sense object meets sense organ in experience.
dn14:2.18.28	Then Vipassī thought,	NA
dn14:2.18.29	‘When what exists is there contact? What is a condition for contact?’	NA
dn14:2.18.30	Then, through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,	NA
dn14:2.18.31	‘When the six sense fields exist there’s contact. The six sense fields are a condition for contact.’	The five senses with the mind as sixth. This topic is treated extensively throughout early Buddhism, with a special focus on understanding and restraining the pull of sense stimulation. _Āyatana_ has a root sense “stretch”, from which derived senses include “dimension”, “field”, etc.
dn14:2.18.32	Then Vipassī thought,	NA
dn14:2.18.33	‘When what exists are there the six sense fields? What is a condition for the six sense fields?’	NA
dn14:2.18.34	Then, through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,	NA
dn14:2.18.35	‘When name and form exist there are the six sense fields. Name and form are a condition for the six sense fields.’	“Name and form” (_nāmarūpa_) is a Vedic concept referring to the multiplicity of material forms (_rūpa_) and associated names (_nāma_), especially the individual “sentient organisms” such as gods and humans (Rig Veda 5.43.10, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.6.1, Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.3.2), which are ultimately absorbed into the divine, like rivers in the ocean (Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad 3.2.8, Praśna Upaniṣad 6.5). The Buddha treated “name” analytically as feeling, perception, intention, contact, and application of mind, and “form” as the four elements and derived matter ([dn15:20.8](), [mn9:52-54.7](), and [sn12.2:11.1]()).
dn14:2.18.36	Then Vipassī thought,	NA
dn14:2.18.37	‘When what exists are there name and form? What is a condition for name and form?’	NA
dn14:2.18.38	Then, through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,	NA
dn14:2.18.39	‘When consciousness exists there are name and form. Consciousness is a condition for name and form.’	“Consciousness” (_viññāṇa_) is simple subjective awareness, the sense of knowing. It arises stimulated by either an external sense impression or a mental phenomena such as thought, memory, etc. It is the subjective awareness that makes the entire multiform world of concepts and appearances possible. Thus far the analysis agrees with Yājñavalkya, who says that the manifold appearances in the world arise from consciousness (_etebhyo bhūtebhyaḥ samutthāya_, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12).
dn14:2.18.40	Then Vipassī thought,	NA
dn14:2.18.41	‘When what exists is there consciousness? What is a condition for consciousness?’	NA
dn14:2.18.42	Then, through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,	NA
dn14:2.18.43	‘When name and form exist there’s consciousness. Name and form are a condition for consciousness.’	Here the Buddha decisively departs from Yājñavalkya’s view that individuated awareness (_saññā_) returns into “this great reality, infinite, unbounded, a sheer mass of consciousness” (_idaṁ mahadbhūtam anantam apāraṁ vijñānaghana eva_, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12). Consciousness (_viññāṇa_) is not a fundamental reality (_mahadbhūta_) underlying multiplicity, but rather a conditioned process that exists only together with name and form.
dn14:2.19.1	Then Vipassī thought,	NA
dn14:2.19.2	‘This consciousness turns back from name and form, and doesn’t go beyond that.’	Dependent origination normally continues with two further factors: choices and ignorance. The full series does not appear in the Dīghanikāya. This truncated series emphasizes the mutuality of name and form with consciousness, but does not preclude the normal linear series. Each presentation of dependent origination reveals a different aspect of a complex, ramified process.
dn14:2.19.3	It is to this extent that one may be reborn, grow old, die, pass away, or reappear. That is:	NA
dn14:2.19.4	Name and form are conditions for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be.	Note the use of repetition to sum up the main doctrinal teachings. This serves to lock the sequence in memory and ensure no items are missing or displaced, while for one who is reciting the text from memory it provides an opportunity to reflect and apply the meaning in their own experience.
dn14:2.19.5	That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.’	NA
dn14:2.19.6	‘Origination, origination.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in Vipassī, the one intent on awakening, regarding teachings not learned before from another.	This phrasing recalls the Buddha’s first sermon ([sn56.11:5.1]()), an insight that is said to be common to all Buddhas ([sn56.12:1.1]()). _Pubbe ananussutesu_ (“not learned before from another”) means that this is a fresh insight not passed down in an oral tradition.
dn14:2.20.1	Then Vipassī thought,	NA
dn14:2.20.2	‘When what doesn’t exist is there no old age and death? When what ceases do old age and death cease?’	NA
dn14:2.20.3	Then, through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,	NA
dn14:2.20.4	‘When rebirth doesn’t exist there’s no old age and death. When rebirth ceases, old age and death cease.’	NA

dn14:2.20.23	Then, through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,	NA
dn14:2.20.24	‘When contact doesn’t exist there’s no feeling. When contact ceases, feeling ceases.’	NA
dn14:2.20.25	Then Vipassī thought,	NA
dn14:2.20.26	‘When what doesn’t exist is there no contact? When what ceases does contact cease?’	NA
dn14:2.20.27	Then, through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,	NA
dn14:2.20.28	‘When the six sense fields don’t exist there’s no contact. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases.’	NA
dn14:2.20.29	Then Vipassī thought,	NA
dn14:2.20.30	‘When what doesn’t exist are there no six sense fields? When what ceases do the six sense fields cease?’	NA

dn14:2.20.39	Then, through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,	NA
dn14:2.20.40	‘When name and form don’t exist there’s no consciousness. When name and form cease, consciousness ceases.’	NA
dn14:2.21.1	Then Vipassī thought,	NA
dn14:2.21.2	‘I have discovered the path to awakening. That is:	The PTS edition has _vipassanā-maggo_ here, despite admitting the term is found in no manuscripts and is taken from the commentary, where it is clearly an explanation not a reading (_maggoti vipassanāmaggo_). This error is followed by Rhys Davids and Walshe in their translations.
dn14:2.21.3	When name and form cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease.	NA
dn14:2.21.4	That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’	NA
dn14:2.21.5	‘Cessation, cessation.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in Vipassī, the one intent on awakening, regarding teachings not learned before from another.	Insight into dependent origination here indicates the attaining of stream entry.
dn14:2.22.1	After some time he meditated observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates.	The five grasping aggregates (_pañcūpādānakkhandhā_) are mentioned as a summary of suffering in the Buddha’s first sermon ([sn56.11:4.2]()). Most of the teachings on this topic are collected in the Khandhasaṁyutta at SN 22, but they are also found in the Dīghanikāya at [dn22:14.1](), [dn33:1.11.45](), [dn33:2.1.4](), and [dn34:1.6.16](). The contemplation on the aggregates dispels the mistaken assumption of a self. Many of the theorists in [dn1]() identify the self with one or other of the aggregates.
dn14:2.22.2	‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.	NA
dn14:2.22.3	Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling.	NA
dn14:2.22.4	Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is the ending of perception.	NA
dn14:2.22.5	Such are choices, such is the origin of choices, such is the ending of choices.	_Saṅkhāra_ in early Buddhism has three main doctrinal senses. (1) The broadest sense is “conditioned phenomena”, which we find in the Dīghanikāya at [dn16:6.10.10](), [dn17:2.16.1](), and [dn34:1.8.59](). This essentially means “everything except Nibbana”. (2) Sometimes it is a physical or mental “process” or “activity” as at [dn18:24.1](), where it refers to the gradual stilling of energies in the development of meditation. (3) In the five aggregates and dependent origination it has the sense of “morally potent volitions or choices” and is a synonym for _cetanā_ (“intention”). It is defined as good, bad, and imperturbable choices ([dn33:1.10.77]()), the latter of which refers to the kamma of the fourth _jhāna_ and above. In this sense it is the moral “choices” for good or ill that propel consciousness into a new rebirth.
dn14:2.22.6	Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’	The radical thesis of the Buddha’s teaching is the idea that consciousness is merely another empirical phenomena that comes to an end, as is also emphasized in the concluding verses of [dn11]().
dn14:2.22.7	Meditating like this his mind was soon freed from defilements by not grasping.	This indicates the attainment of arahantship, the complete release from all attachments leading to rebirth.
dn14:2.22.8	The second recitation section.	NA
dn14:3.1.0	12. The Appeal of the Divinity	NA
dn14:3.1.1	Then the Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, thought,	No longer a bodhisatta, he is now called a Buddha for the first time.
dn14:3.1.2	‘Why don’t I teach the Dhamma?’	In early Buddhism, the idea of teaching the Dhamma only arose after awakening.
dn14:3.1.3	Then he thought,	NA
dn14:3.1.4	‘This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute.	A similar account is told of Gotama Buddha at [sn6.1:1.4](), [mn26:19.2](), [mn85:43.2](), and [pli-tv-kd1:5.2.2]().
dn14:3.1.5	But people like clinging, they love it and enjoy it.	Here “clinging” is _ālaya_, from a root meaning “to stick”.
dn14:3.1.6	It’s hard for them to see this topic; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination.	“Specific conditionality” (_ idappaccayatā_) refers to the fact that dependent origination traces the specific conditions for other specific things: this conditions that. It is not a general principle of universal conditionality (“everything is interconnected”).
dn14:3.1.7	It’s also hard for them to see this topic; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.	“Stilling of all activities” (_sabbasaṅkhārasamatho_) is the cessation of all conditioned energies or phenomena. | “Attachment” here is _upadhi_, which is both the things of the world to which we cling, and the inner clinging. The Jains defined _upadhi_ similarly (Tattvārthasūtra 9.26). The dominant meaning in Sanskrit is “fraud”, which perhaps informs the Buddhist sense.
dn14:3.1.8	And if I were to teach this principle, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.’	The commentary is careful to specify that the Buddha means physical exhaustion only.
dn14:3.2.1	And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to him:	“Not supernaturally inspired” (_anacchariyā_) rejects the Vedic “channeling” of scripture from the Divinity, while “not learned before in the past” (_pubbe assutapubbā_), echoing the Dhammacakkappavattanasutta ([sn56.11:5.1]()), rejects the oral tradition.
dn14:3.2.2	‘I’ve struggled hard to realize this,	NA
dn14:3.2.3	enough with trying to explain it!	NA
dn14:3.2.4	Those mired in greed and hate	NA
dn14:3.2.5	can’t really understand this teaching.	NA
dn14:3.2.6	It goes against the stream, subtle,	NA
dn14:3.2.7	deep, obscure, and very fine.	NA
dn14:3.2.8	Those besotted by greed cannot see,	NA
dn14:3.2.9	for they’re shrouded in a mass of darkness.’	“Shrouded” is _āvuṭā_, which is from the same root as _asaṁvutā_ in [dn14:1.17.5]() above, as well as _nīvaraṇa_ (“hindrance”). All these terms ultimately stem from the Vedic serpent Vṛtra (“the constrictor”) who wraps the world in darkness.
dn14:3.2.10	So, as the Buddha Vipassī reflected like this, his mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.	Had he followed this inclination he would have been a _paccekabuddha_, a Buddha “awakened for himself”.
dn14:3.2.11	Then a certain Great Divinity, knowing the Buddha Vipassī’s train of thought, thought,	In the accounts of Gotama’s life this is specified as Brahmā Sahampati (see [mn26:20.1]() and note). This whole passage is a moment of high cosmic solemnity and drama.
dn14:3.2.12	‘Oh lord! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.’	NA
dn14:3.2.13	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared in front of the Buddha Vipassī.	NA
dn14:3.3.1	He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha Vipassī, and said,	NA
dn14:3.3.2	‘Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma!	The Buddha teaches on the invitation of the highest divinity. This sets a precedent for Buddhists to refrain from proselytizing, but rather teach by invitation. These passages are still recited in some places to invite a teaching.
dn14:3.3.3	There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching.	NA
dn14:3.3.4	There will be those who understand the teaching!’	_Aññātāro_ is an agent noun in plural, literally “understanders”.
dn14:3.4.1	When he said this, the Buddha Vipassī said to him,	NA
dn14:3.4.2	‘I too thought this, Divinity,	NA
dn14:3.4.3	“Why don’t I teach the Dhamma?”	NA
dn14:3.4.4	Then it occurred to me,	NA

dn14:3.5.2	and a third time that Great Divinity begged the Buddha to teach.	NA
dn14:3.5.3	NA	NA
dn14:3.6.1	Then, understanding the Divinity’s invitation, the Buddha Vipassī surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, out of his compassion for sentient beings.	Previously he simply reflected to himself, now he uses his psychic abilities to ascertain people’s spiritual potential.
dn14:3.6.2	And he saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not.	_Indriya_ (“faculty”) is an abstract noun from _indra_, the name of the potent Vedic god of war. In the Vedas, Indra manifests his _indriya_ by drinking soma. The drug enables him to release his full potential and power; originally this probably referred to drinking an amphetamine-like substance before battle. Here we see that it means something like “spiritual potential” which is unleashed by the practice of the eightfold path.
dn14:3.6.3	It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them.	NA
dn14:3.6.4	In the same way, the Buddha Vipassī saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes.	NA
dn14:3.7.1	Then that Great Divinity, knowing the Buddha Vipassī’s train of thought, addressed him in verse:	NA
dn14:3.7.2	‘Standing high on a rocky mountain,	NA

dn14:3.7.9	wander the world cleared of debt.	A “caravan leader” (_satthavāha_) guides their flock through treacherous deserts and wastelands, as illustrated at [dn23:23.3](). | _Anaṇa_ (“debtless”) is a technical term in the Vedic system. According to Manu 6.35–7, a renunciate must first pay off three debts: study of Vedas, begetting a son, and offering of sacrifices. One who goes forth with these debts unpaid is headed for a downfall. The Buddha has indeed paid off all these debts: he studied the Vedas under his former teachers ([mn26:15.6]()); he has a son Rāhula; and his path is regarded as the highest form of sacrifice ([dn5:24.1]()). But in Buddhism the concept is reinterpreted as meaning one has let go of all defilements, becoming a “perfected”, literally “worthy” one, after which one can eat almsfood free of debt ([mn124:38.1](), [sn16.11:13.2]()).
dn14:3.7.10	Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma!	NA
dn14:3.7.11	There will be those who understand!’	NA
dn14:3.7.12	Then the Buddha Vipassī addressed that Great Divinity in verse:	NA
dn14:3.7.13	‘Flung open are the doors to freedom from death!	NA
dn14:3.7.14	Let those with ears to hear commit to faith.	_Pamuñcantu saddhaṁ_ has long troubled translators, as the basic sense of _pamuñcantu_ is “release”. The problem is a long-standing one, for Sanskrit variants include _pramodantu_ (“celebrate”) or _praṇudantu kāṅkṣāḥ_ (“dispel doubts”). I think it is a poetic variant of _adhimuñcantu_, to “decide” or “commit” to faith. Pali commonly uses a synonymous verb to reinforce the sense of the noun. In [snp5.19](), _muttasaddho_, _pamuñcassu saddhaṁ_, and _adhimuttacittaṁ_ are all used in this sense.
dn14:3.7.15	Thinking it would be troublesome, Divinity, <j>I did not teach	NA
dn14:3.7.16	the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among mankind.’	NA
dn14:3.7.17	Then the Great Divinity, knowing that his request for the Buddha Vipassī to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled him, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.	NA
dn14:3.8.0	13. The Chief Disciples	NA
dn14:3.8.1	Then the Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, thought,	NA
dn14:3.8.2	‘Who should I teach first of all?	NA
dn14:3.8.3	Who will quickly understand this teaching?’	NA
dn14:3.8.4	Then he thought,	NA
dn14:3.8.5	‘That Khaṇḍa, the king’s son, and Tissa, the high priest’s son, are astute, competent, clever, and have long had little dust in their eyes.	In the account of Gotama, he first thinks to teach his former colleagues under whom he practiced the formless attainments. Here we see the start of a tendency in the legends of past Buddhas to erase the education among other spiritual teachers before awakening. Note that these two, who will become Vipassī’s chief disciples, are leading _khattiya_ and brahmin sons of the royal household. Khaṇḍa was Vipassī’s brother, and the priest’s son was virtually family.
dn14:3.8.6	Why don’t I teach them first of all? They will quickly understand this teaching.’	NA
dn14:3.9.1	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the tree of awakening and reappeared near the capital city of Bandhumatī, in the deer park named Sanctuary.	_Khema_ (“sanctuary”) originally meant “oasis”. It is common name for lakes and nature parks in the Jātakas.
dn14:3.9.2	Then the Buddha Vipassī addressed the park keeper,	There is a clear distinction between such managed “parks” and wilderness regions (_arañña_).
dn14:3.9.3	‘My dear park keeper, please enter the city and say this to the king’s son Khaṇḍa and the high priest’s son Tissa:	NA
dn14:3.9.4	“Sirs, the Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, has arrived at Bandhumatī and is staying in the deer park named Sanctuary. He wishes to see you.”’	NA
dn14:3.9.5	‘Yes, sir,’ replied the park keeper, and did as he was asked.	NA
dn14:3.9.6	NA	NA
dn14:3.10.1	Then the king’s son Khaṇḍa and the high priest’s son Tissa had the finest carriages harnessed. Then they mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out from Bandhumatī for the Sanctuary.	NA
dn14:3.10.2	They went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the Buddha Vipassī on foot. They bowed and sat down to one side.	NA
dn14:3.11.1	The Buddha Vipassī taught them step by step, with	NA
dn14:3.11.2	a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation.	NA
dn14:3.11.3	And when he knew that their minds were ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas:	NA
dn14:3.11.4	suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.	NA
dn14:3.11.5	Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye,	NA
dn14:3.11.6	in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the king’s son Khaṇḍa and the high priest’s son Tissa:	NA
dn14:3.11.7	‘Everything that has a beginning has an end.’	NA
dn14:3.12.1	They saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. They went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. They said to the Buddha Vipassī,	NA
dn14:3.12.2	‘Excellent, sir! Excellent!	NA
dn14:3.12.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
dn14:3.12.4	We go for refuge to the Blessed One and to the teaching.	NA
dn14:3.12.5	Sir, may we receive the going forth and ordination in the Buddha’s presence?’	NA
dn14:3.13.1	And they received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha Vipassī’s presence.	In the early period, there was no distinction between “going forth” (_pabbajjā_) and “ordination” (_upasampadā_). They refer to two sides of the same coin: leaving the home life and entering the ascetic life. Ordination was originally granted with the simple call, “Come mendicant!” (_ehi bhikkhu_).
dn14:3.13.2	Then the Buddha Vipassī educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk.	NA
dn14:3.13.3	He explained the drawbacks of conditioned phenomena, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of extinguishment.	NA
dn14:3.13.4	Being taught like this their minds were soon freed from defilements by not grasping.	Thus they became arahants, realizing the same truth that Vipassī had.
dn14:3.14.0	14. The Going Forth of the Large Crowd	NA
dn14:3.14.1	A large crowd of 84,000 people in the capital of Bandhumatī heard	NA
dn14:3.14.2	that the Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, had arrived at Bandhumatī and was staying in the deer park named Sanctuary.	NA
dn14:3.14.3	And they heard that the king’s son Khaṇḍa and the high priest’s son Tissa had shaved off their hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the Buddha’s presence.	NA
dn14:3.14.4	It occurred to them,	NA
dn14:3.14.5	‘This must be no ordinary teaching and training, no ordinary going forth in which the king’s son Khaṇḍa and the high priest’s son Tissa have gone forth.	NA
dn14:3.14.6	If even they go forth, why don’t we do the same?’	NA
dn14:3.14.7	Then those 84,000 people left Bandhumatī for the deer park named Sanctuary, where they approached the Buddha Vipassī, bowed and sat down to one side.	NA
dn14:3.15.1	The Buddha Vipassī taught them step by step, with	NA
dn14:3.15.2	a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation.	NA
dn14:3.15.3	And when he knew that their minds were ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas:	NA
dn14:3.15.4	suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.	NA
dn14:3.15.5	Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye,	NA
dn14:3.15.6	in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in those 84,000 people:	NA
dn14:3.15.7	‘Everything that has a beginning has an end.’	NA
dn14:3.16.1	They saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. They went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. They said to the Buddha Vipassī,	NA
dn14:3.16.2	‘Excellent, sir! Excellent!’	NA
dn14:3.16.3	And just like Khaṇḍa and Tissa they asked for and received ordination. Then the Buddha taught them further.	NA

dn14:3.16.5	NA	NA
dn14:3.17.1	NA	NA
dn14:3.17.2	NA	NA

dn14:3.17.4	Being taught like this their minds were soon freed from defilements by not grasping.	NA
dn14:3.18.0	15. The 84,000 Who Had Gone Forth Previously	NA
dn14:3.18.1	The 84,000 people who had gone forth previously also heard:	NA
dn14:3.18.2	‘It seems the Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, has arrived at Bandhumatī and is staying in the deer park named Sanctuary. And he is teaching the Dhamma!’	NA
dn14:3.18.3	Then they too went to see the Buddha Vipassī, realized the Dhamma, went forth, and became freed from defilements.	NA

dn14:3.22.0	16. The Allowance to Wander	NA
dn14:3.22.1	Now at that time a large Saṅgha of 6,800,000 mendicants were residing at Bandhumatī.	NA
dn14:3.22.2	As the Buddha Vipassī was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	NA
dn14:3.22.3	‘The Saṅgha residing at Bandhumatī now is large. What if I was to urge them:	NA
dn14:3.22.4	“Wander forth, mendicants, for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.	As at [pli-tv-kd1:11.1.4]() and [sn4.5:2.3](). One of the Buddha’s first acts is to empower his students.
dn14:3.22.5	Let not two go by one road.	NA
dn14:3.22.6	Teach the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
dn14:3.22.7	There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching.	NA
dn14:3.22.8	There will be those who understand the teaching!	NA
dn14:3.22.9	But when six years have passed, you must all come to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code.”’	In the Vinaya of the current Buddha, the recitation occurs every fortnight on the _uposatha_ (“sabbath”), and it includes only the mendicants resident in a specific monastery. Here they gathered from all over India.
dn14:3.23.1	Then a certain Great Divinity, knowing the Buddha Vipassī’s train of thought, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared in front of the Buddha Vipassī.	NA
dn14:3.23.2	He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha Vipassī, and said,	NA
dn14:3.23.3	‘That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!	NA
dn14:3.23.4	The Saṅgha residing at Bandhumatī now is large. Please urge them to wander, as you thought.	NA
dn14:3.23.5	NA	NA
dn14:3.23.6	NA	NA
dn14:3.23.7	NA	NA
dn14:3.23.8	NA	NA
dn14:3.23.9	And sir, I’ll make sure that when six years have passed the mendicants will return to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code.’	NA
dn14:3.23.10	That’s what that Great Divinity said.	NA
dn14:3.23.11	Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha Vipassī, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there.	NA
dn14:3.24.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha Vipassī came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants, telling them all that had happened. Then he said,	NA
dn14:3.24.2	NA	NA
dn14:3.24.3	NA	NA
dn14:3.24.4	NA	NA
dn14:3.24.5	NA	NA

dn14:3.26.2	Let not two go by one road.	NA
dn14:3.26.3	Teach the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
dn14:3.26.4	There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching.	NA
dn14:3.26.5	There will be those who understand the teaching!	NA
dn14:3.26.6	But when six years have passed, you must all come to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code.’	NA
dn14:3.26.7	Then most of the mendicants departed to wander the country that very day.	NA
dn14:3.27.1	Now at that time there were 84,000 monasteries in the Black Plum Tree Land.	“Black Plum Tree Land” is _jambudīpa_, the South Asian subcontinent, including India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. The number 84,000 does not seem excessive, as the Chinese pilgrims recorded many thousands of monasteries throughout India. In modern Thailand there are around 40,000 monasteries.
dn14:3.27.2	And when the first year came to an end the deities raised the cry:	NA
dn14:3.27.3	‘Good fellows, the first year has ended.	NA
dn14:3.27.4	Now five years remain.	NA
dn14:3.27.5	When five years have passed, you must all go to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code.’	NA
dn14:3.27.6	And when the second year …	NA
dn14:3.27.7	the third year …	NA
dn14:3.27.8	the fourth year …	NA
dn14:3.27.9	the fifth year came to an end, the deities raised the cry:	NA
dn14:3.27.10	‘Good fellows, the fifth year has ended.	NA
dn14:3.27.11	Now one year remains.	NA
dn14:3.27.12	When one year has passed, you must all go to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code.’	NA
dn14:3.27.13	And when the sixth year came to an end the deities raised the cry:	NA
dn14:3.27.14	‘Good fellows, the sixth year has ended.	NA
dn14:3.27.15	Now is the time that you must go to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code.’	NA
dn14:3.27.16	Then that very day the mendicants went to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code. Some went by their own psychic power, and some by the psychic power of the deities.	NA
dn14:3.28.1	And there the Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, recited the monastic code thus:	The verses that follow form the climax of the whole discourse. They are known as the Ovāda Pātimokkha, the “monastic code for exhortation”. It seems that they were recited on the _uposatha_ in the days before the establishment of the list of rules that is also called _pātimokkha_. Most of the extant Vinayas still include these verses in the _pātimokkha_ texts, the Pali being a notable exception.
dn14:3.28.2	‘Patient acceptance is the ultimate fervor.	The Buddha redefines _tapas_ from painful mortification to gentle acceptance.
dn14:3.28.3	Extinguishment is the ultimate, say the Buddhas.	These verses speak of “Buddhas” in plural.
dn14:3.28.4	No true renunciate injures another,	NA
dn14:3.28.5	nor does an ascetic hurt another.	NA
dn14:3.28.6	Not to do any evil;	These famous lines serve as a succinct summary of the entire Buddhist path.
dn14:3.28.7	to embrace the good;	“Embrace” is _upasampadā_, to “enter into”. It is the same word used for taking ordination as well as entering _jhāna_.
dn14:3.28.8	to purify one’s mind:	Through meditation.
dn14:3.28.9	this is the instruction of the Buddhas.	The _buddhasāsana_ (“instruction of the Buddha” or “dispensation of the Buddha”) is the normal word used by Buddhists to refer to their own religion.
dn14:3.28.10	Not speaking ill nor doing harm;	NA
dn14:3.28.11	restraint in the monastic code;	Here “monastic code” means the principles outlined in these verses. They are spelled out in more detail in the Gradual Training ([dn2](), etc.), and ultimately in the detailed legal code of the Vinayapiṭaka.
dn14:3.28.12	moderation in eating;	NA
dn14:3.28.13	staying in remote lodgings;	NA
dn14:3.28.14	commitment to the higher mind—	The “higher mind” is the four _jhānas_ ([an3.90:3.2]()).
dn14:3.28.15	this is the instruction of the Buddhas.’	NA
dn14:3.29.0	17. Being Informed by Deities	NA
dn14:3.29.1	This one time, mendicants, I was staying near Ukkaṭṭhā, in the Subhaga Forest at the root of a magnificent sal tree.	The Buddha now returns to the present life. Ukkaṭṭhā is the home of Pokkharasāti ([dn3:2.13.1]()) and the site of the astonishing and cosmically significant discourses [mn1]() and [mn49]().
dn14:3.29.2	As I was in private retreat this thought came to mind,	NA
dn14:3.29.3	‘It’s not easy to find an abode of sentient beings where I haven’t previously abided in all this long time, except for the gods of the pure abodes.	Only non-returners are born in the pure abodes (_suddhāvāsā_), from where they realize full awakening.
dn14:3.29.4	Why don’t I go to see them?’	NA
dn14:3.29.5	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, I vanished from the Subhaga Forest and reappeared with the gods of Aviha.	NA
dn14:3.29.6	In that order of gods, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of deities approached me, bowed, stood to one side, and said to me,	“Order of gods” is _devanikāya_. I use “deity” to distinguish _devatā_ from _deva_ but there is no substantial difference.
dn14:3.29.7	‘Ninety-one eons ago, good fellow, the Buddha Vipassī arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened.	NA
dn14:3.29.8	He was born as an aristocrat into an aristocrat family.	NA
dn14:3.29.9	Koṇḍañña was his clan.	NA
dn14:3.29.10	He lived for 80,000 years.	NA
dn14:3.29.11	He was awakened at the root of a patala tree.	NA
dn14:3.29.12	He had a fine pair of chief disciples named Khaṇḍa and Tissa.	NA
dn14:3.29.13	He had three gatherings of disciples—one of 6,800,000, one of 100,000, and one of 80,000—all of them mendicants who had ended their defilements.	NA
dn14:3.29.14	He had as chief attendant a mendicant named Asoka.	NA
dn14:3.29.15	His father was King Bandhumā,	NA
dn14:3.29.16	his birth mother was Queen Bandhumatī,	NA
dn14:3.29.17	and their capital city was named Bandhumatī.	NA
dn14:3.29.18	And such was his renunciation, such his going forth, such his striving, such his awakening, and such his rolling forth of the wheel of Dhamma.	This is a list of the major events in any Buddha biography.
dn14:3.29.19	And good fellow, after leading the spiritual life under that Buddha Vipassī we lost our desire for sensual pleasures and were reborn here.’	The lifespan in such a realm can be many hundreds of eons.
dn14:3.29.20	And other deities came and similarly recounted the details of the Buddhas Sikhī, Vessabhū, Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa.	These are absent in the Pali text at this point, but they are mentioned below, and the commentary says they should be included here.
dn14:3.30.1	In that order of gods, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of deities approached me, bowed, stood to one side, and said to me,	NA
dn14:3.30.2	‘In the present fortunate eon, good fellow, you have arisen in the world, perfected and fully awakened.	NA
dn14:3.30.3	You were born as an aristocrat into an aristocrat family.	NA
dn14:3.30.4	Gotama is your clan.	NA
dn14:3.30.5	For you the life-span is short, brief, and fleeting. A long life is a hundred years or a little more.	NA
dn14:3.30.6	You were awakened at the root of a peepal tree.	NA
dn14:3.30.7	You have a fine pair of chief disciples named Sāriputta and Moggallāna.	NA
dn14:3.30.8	You have had one gathering of disciples—1,250 mendicants who had ended their defilements.	NA
dn14:3.30.9	You have as chief attendant a mendicant named Ānanda.	NA
dn14:3.30.10	Your father was King Suddhodana,	NA
dn14:3.30.11	your birth mother was Queen Māyā,	NA
dn14:3.30.12	and your capital city was Kapilavatthu.	NA

dn14:3.30.14	And good fellow, after leading the spiritual life under you we lost our desire for sensual pleasures and were reborn here.’	NA
dn14:3.31.1	Then together with the gods of Aviha I went to see the gods of Atappa …	NA
dn14:3.31.2	the gods fair to see …	NA

dn15:1.1	So I have heard.	This sutta with its commentary was translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi in his *The Great Discourse on Causation*. It is the longest and most complex discourse on dependent origination in early Buddhism.
dn15:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma.	The Kurukṣetra was an ancient Brahmanical kingdom situated in the region around modern Delhi, bordered by the Ganges in the east, the Sarasvatī in the west, the Himalayas in the north, and the hills of the Aravalli Range in the south. The Mahābharata climaxes with the battle fought there between the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas. These events, to the extent that they can be established historically, took place several centuries before the Buddha. Kuru marks the north-western extent of the Buddha’s travels. Kammāsadamma is identified with modern Kumashpur in Haryana, about 40 km north of Delhi.
dn15:1.3	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	While we cannot date this text, the fact that Ānanda has evidently been studying deep matters for a long time, that it takes place outside the Buddha’s accustomed locales, and that it builds on teachings found elsewhere, suggests that it happened rather late in the Buddha’s life. At [sn12.60]() we find the same introduction to a much shorter discourse.
dn15:1.4	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing,	NA
dn15:1.5	in that this dependent origination is deep and appears deep, yet to me it seems as plain as can be.”	At [sn6.1:1.6]() (and [dn14:3.1.6]() in the case of Vipassī), the Buddha hesitated to teach the Dhamma because dependent origination is so hard to see. Ānanda was not only learned and wise, he was a stream enterer who had directly experienced dependent origination ([an10.92:6.1]()), yet he still underestimates it.
dn15:1.6	“Don’t say that, Ānanda, don’t say that!	NA
dn15:1.7	This dependent origination is deep and appears deep.	The sutta introduce subtle variations in the standard formula as a means to illuminate hidden implications and dimensions.
dn15:1.8	It is because of not understanding and not penetrating this teaching that this population has become tangled like string, knotted like a ball of thread, and matted like rushes and reeds, and it doesn’t escape the places of loss, the bad places, the underworld, transmigration.	The Buddha establishes the primary purpose of dependent origination: to understand transmigration so as to be free from it.
dn15:2.1	When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for old age and death?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’	Dependent origination is here taught in “reverse order” (_paṭiloma_, [ud1.2:1.4]()), starting with the existential problem: we are all going to die. This factor and the next are resultant, so we cannot solve them directly.
dn15:2.2	If they say, ‘What is a condition for old age and death?’ you should answer, ‘Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’	With this the Buddha denies the promise of immortality in this or any other realm.
dn15:2.3	When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for rebirth?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’	NA
dn15:2.4	If they say, ‘What is a condition for rebirth?’ you should answer, ‘Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.’	“Continued existence” (or “life”) is an encompassing term, including both resultant and causal dimensions.
dn15:2.5	When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for continued existence?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’	NA
dn15:2.6	If they say, ‘What is a condition for continued existence?’ you should answer, ‘Grasping is a condition for continued existence.’	“Grasping” and “craving” (together with “ignorance” in the full sequence) are the defilements that drive the process on. It is here that the practice of the path takes effect, uprooting them entirely.
dn15:2.7	When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for grasping?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’	NA
dn15:2.8	If they say, ‘What is a condition for grasping?’ you should answer, ‘Craving is a condition for grasping.’	NA
dn15:2.9	When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for craving?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’	NA
dn15:2.10	If they say, ‘What is a condition for craving?’ you should answer, ‘Feeling is a condition for craving.’	The next three factors spell out the process of sense experience that unfolds automatically. Meditation slows it down so it can be seen clearly, but the process remains even for the perfected ones.
dn15:2.11	When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for feeling?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’	NA
dn15:2.12	If they say, ‘What is a condition for feeling?’ you should answer, ‘Contact is a condition for feeling.’	NA
dn15:2.13	When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for contact?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’	NA
dn15:2.14	If they say, ‘What is a condition for contact?’ you should answer, ‘Name and form are conditions for contact.’	Here we encounter the first unique feature of this sequence, as normally the six sense fields appear as the condition for contact. The reason for this special presentation becomes clear later on.
dn15:2.15	When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for name and form?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’	NA
dn15:2.16	If they say, ‘What is a condition for name and form?’ you should answer, ‘Consciousness is a condition for name and form.’	NA
dn15:2.17	When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for consciousness?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’	NA
dn15:2.18	If they say, ‘What is a condition for consciousness?’ you should answer, ‘Name and form are conditions for consciousness.’	The mutual conditioning of consciousness with name and form is a further subtlety of this presentation. We have met this idea before in [dn14:2.18.43](); it also occurs in [sn12.65]() and [sn12.67](). Again, implications of this are explored below.
dn15:3.1	So: name and form are conditions for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be.	The sequence is recapped in forward order (_anuloma_, [ud1.1:1.4]()).
dn15:3.2	That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.	NA
dn15:4.1	‘Rebirth is a condition for old age and death’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.	The Buddha now takes up each of the terms in more depth.
dn15:4.2	Suppose there were totally and utterly no rebirth for anyone anywhere.	This emphatic phrasing drives home that “cessation” (_nirodha_) is not simply temporary suppression or non-arising, but permanent and complete absence.
dn15:4.3	That is, there were no rebirth of sentient beings into their various realms—of gods, centaurs, spirits, creatures, humans, quadrupeds, birds, or reptiles, each into their own realm. When there’s no rebirth at all, with the cessation of rebirth, would old age and death still be found?”	“Rebirth” (_jāti_) is defined as the birth of a new life, not as simple arising.
dn15:4.4	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:4.5	“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of old age and death, namely rebirth.	The various terms for “cause” are used as synonyms (_hetu_, _nidāna_, _samudaya_, _paccaya_). The purpose of using different terms is not to add nuances, but to reinforce the central meaning and guard against the corruption of meaning; if one word is lost or misunderstood, the meaning of the sentence as a whole is not changed.
dn15:5.1	‘Continued existence is a condition for rebirth’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.	NA
dn15:5.2	Suppose there were totally and utterly no continued existence for anyone anywhere.	NA
dn15:5.3	That is, continued existence in the sensual realm, the realm of luminous form, or the formless realm. When there’s no continued existence at all, with the cessation of continued existence, would rebirth still be found?”	These realms relate to the kamma that projects consciousness into them. The realms of “luminous form” (_rūpabhava_) and the “formless” (_arūpabhava_) are generated by the form and formless attainments respectively. Any other kamma, good or bad, pertains to the sensual realm (_kāmabhava_). All rebirth takes place in one or other of these realms.
dn15:5.4	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:5.5	“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of rebirth, namely continued existence.	NA
dn15:6.1	‘Grasping is a condition for continued existence’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.	NA
dn15:6.2	Suppose there were totally and utterly no grasping for anyone anywhere.	NA
dn15:6.3	That is, grasping at sensual pleasures, views, precepts and observances, and theories of a self. When there’s no grasping at all, with the cessation of grasping, would continued existence still be found?”	“Grasping” (_upādāna_) begins with the primal desire of the senses, but the three other graspings are rather intellectual and sophisticated. Only a grown human being with a developed linguistic ability is able to formulate a view to become attached to, and likewise with attachment to religious observances and vows, and to theories of a self. This is why the bulk of kamma is produced by adult humans, rather than by, say, animals or children, for whom these dimensions of grasping are nascent.
dn15:6.4	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:6.5	“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of continued existence, namely grasping.	NA
dn15:7.1	‘Craving is a condition for grasping’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.	NA
dn15:7.2	Suppose there were totally and utterly no craving for anyone anywhere.	NA
dn15:7.3	That is, craving for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and ideas. When there’s no craving at all, with the cessation of craving, would grasping still be found?”	“Craving” (_taṇhā_) is a fundamental desire or urge. Unlike grasping, it is fully active in children and animals. Often it has a threefold definition, which we find below, but in dependent origination it is usually defined in terms of the six senses, which relates it to the items to come.
dn15:7.4	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:7.5	“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of grasping, namely craving.	NA
dn15:8.1	‘Feeling is a condition for craving’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.	NA
dn15:8.2	Suppose there were totally and utterly no feeling for anyone anywhere.	NA
dn15:8.3	That is, feeling born of contact through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. When there’s no feeling at all, with the cessation of feeling, would craving still be found?”	The usual threefold definition of feeling (pleasant, painful, neutral) is reframed in terms of the six senses.
dn15:8.4	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:8.5	“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of craving, namely feeling.	NA
dn15:9.1	So it is, Ānanda, that feeling is a cause of craving. Craving is a cause of seeking. Seeking is a cause of gaining material things. Gaining material things is a cause of evaluation. Evaluation is a cause of desire and lust. Desire and lust is a cause of attachment. Attachment is a cause of ownership. Ownership is a cause of stinginess. Stinginess is a cause of safeguarding.	Here the Buddha introduces another, even more radical, departure from the typical sequence. Rather than continue back to contact and name and form, he branches out in an entirely new direction. These “nine things rooted in craving” are found independently at [an9.23:1.2]() and [dn34:2.2.31](), but only here are they integrated with the standard dependent origination.
dn15:9.2	Owing to safeguarding, many bad, unskillful things come to be: taking up the rod and the sword, quarrels, arguments, and disputes, accusations, divisive speech, and lies.	While the purpose of the main dependent origination is to disclose the web of conditions that generates the suffering of transmigration, here the Buddha looks at the arising of social conflict and disorder.
dn15:10.1	‘Owing to safeguarding, many bad, unskillful things come to be: taking up the rod and the sword, quarrels, arguments, and disputes, accusations, divisive speech, and lies’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.	In [dn27]() Aggaññasutta the Buddha narrates a legend showing how these things arise. The point is not that we should not safeguard (_ārakkha_) our possessions. It is, rather, that so long as we live in a world where safeguarding possessions is necessary, there will be conflict and violence.
dn15:10.2	Suppose there were totally and utterly no safeguarding for anyone anywhere. When there’s no safeguarding at all, with the cessation of safeguarding, would those many bad, unskillful things still come to be?”	NA
dn15:10.3	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:10.4	“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason for the origination of those many bad, unskillful things, namely safeguarding.	NA
dn15:11.1	‘Stinginess is a cause of safeguarding’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.	“Stinginess” is _macchariya_.
dn15:11.2	Suppose there were totally and utterly no stinginess for anyone anywhere. When there’s no stinginess at all, with the cessation of stinginess, would safeguarding still be found?”	NA
dn15:11.3	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:11.4	“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of safeguarding, namely stinginess.	NA
dn15:12.1	‘Ownership is a cause of stinginess’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.	NA
dn15:12.2	Suppose there were totally and utterly no ownership for anyone anywhere. When there’s no ownership at all, with the cessation of ownership, would stinginess still be found?”	NA
dn15:12.3	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:12.4	“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of stinginess, namely ownership.	NA
dn15:13.1	‘Attachment is a cause of ownership’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.	There are many words in Pali that approximate the English word “attachment”. Here it is _ajjhosāna_.
dn15:13.2	Suppose there were totally and utterly no attachment for anyone anywhere. When there’s no attachment at all, with the cessation of attachment, would ownership still be found?”	NA
dn15:13.3	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:13.4	“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of ownership, namely attachment.	NA
dn15:14.1	‘Desire and lust is a cause of attachment’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.	NA
dn15:14.2	Suppose there were totally and utterly no desire and lust for anyone anywhere. When there’s no desire and lust at all, with the cessation of desire and lust, would attachment still be found?”	NA
dn15:14.3	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:14.4	“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of attachment, namely desire and lust.	NA
dn15:15.1	Evaluation is a cause of desire and lust’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.	“Evaluation” is _vinicchaya_. We like to weigh up and consider the pros and cons of different objects of desire.
dn15:15.2	Suppose there were totally and utterly no evaluation for anyone anywhere. When there’s no evaluation at all, with the cessation of evaluation, would desire and lust still be found?”	NA
dn15:15.3	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:15.4	“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of desire and lust, namely evaluation.	NA
dn15:16.1	‘Gaining material things is a cause of evaluation’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.	Those who have nothing are grateful for any small thing, and do not indulge in picking and choosing.
dn15:16.2	Suppose there were totally and utterly no gaining of material things for anyone anywhere. When there’s no gaining of material things at all, with the cessation of gaining material things, would evaluation still be found?”	NA
dn15:16.3	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:16.4	“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of evaluation, namely the gaining of material things.	NA
dn15:17.1	‘Seeking is a cause of gaining material things’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.	Our senses are tuned to hunt out and acquire pleasure.
dn15:17.2	Suppose there were totally and utterly no seeking for anyone anywhere. When there’s no seeking at all, with the cessation of seeking, would the gaining of material things still be found?”	NA
dn15:17.3	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:17.4	“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of gaining material things, namely seeking.	NA
dn15:18.1	‘Craving is a cause of seeking’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.	NA
dn15:18.2	Suppose there were totally and utterly no craving for anyone anywhere.	NA
dn15:18.3	That is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for continued existence, and craving to end existence. When there’s no craving at all, with the cessation of craving, would seeking still be found?”	This is the normal definition of craving in the four noble truths, supplementing the previous definition in terms of the six senses. Both are included in this sutta to show that they do not contradict, but rather reveal different aspects of the same thing. It is not just sensual desire that drives acquisition. For example, religious people fight over sacred ground or holy objects to gain a place in heaven; or else those driven by nihilism go to any lengths for alcohol or drugs to erase existence.
dn15:18.4	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:18.5	“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of seeking, namely craving.	NA
dn15:18.6	And so, Ānanda, these two things are united by the two aspects of feeling.	The threefold analysis of feeling leads to the process of acquisition, while the sixfold analysis of feeling leads to dependent origination.
dn15:19.1	‘Contact is a condition for feeling’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.	And now we rejoin the main sequence.
dn15:19.2	Suppose there were totally and utterly no contact for anyone anywhere.	NA
dn15:19.3	That is, contact through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. When there’s no contact at all, with the cessation of contact, would feeling still be found?”	People mostly want to enjoy pleasant sensations, in this life and the next, but those sensations depend on a constant supply of the appropriate stimuli.
dn15:19.4	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:19.5	“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of feeling, namely contact.	NA
dn15:20.1	‘Name and form are conditions for contact’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.	Name and form are said to be conditions for contact also at [snp4.11:11.1]().
dn15:20.2	Suppose there were none of the features, attributes, signs, and details by which the set of mental phenomena known as name is found. Would labeling contact still be found in the set of physical phenomena?”	The “set of mental phenomena known as name” is _nāmakāya_. Its function depends not any underlying essence, but on the “features” by which it is “made known”; this is a phenomenological analysis. | “Labeling contact” is _adhivacanasamphassa_; it is the active process by which the mind makes sense of the world by attaching labels to experience. This passage reinforces the linguistic significance of _nāma_.
dn15:20.3	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:20.4	“Suppose there were none of the features, attributes, signs, and details by which the set of physical phenomena known as form is found. Would impingement contact still be found in the set of mental phenomena?”	The “set of physical phenomena known as form” is _rūpakāya_. | “Impingement contact” is _paṭighasamphassa_. Here _paṭigha_ refers to the “striking” of physical phenomena against each other, such as light “hitting” the eye. It most commonly appears in this sense in the formula that begins the formless attainments.
dn15:20.5	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:20.6	“Suppose there were none of the features, attributes, signs, and details by which the set of phenomena known as name and the set of phenomena known as form are found. Would either labeling contact or impingement contact still be found?”	Labeling moves from the mind to the world; impingement moves from the world to the mind. Together they create a dynamic two-way process by which we learn about the world and how to make sense of it.
dn15:20.7	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:20.8	“Suppose there were none of the features, attributes, signs, and details by which name and form are found. Would contact still be found?”	Contact is fundamentally a meeting, normally expressed as the coming together of the sense stimulus (light), the sense organ (eye), and sense consciousness. By skipping the direct mention of the six senses, the Buddha opens another perspective on this process: mental labeling meets sense impingement, each essential to the other, and together making contact possible. The analysis itself exemplifies this process, as it starts by looking at the process from each side, and moves towards integration, seeing them both together.
dn15:20.9	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:20.10	“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of contact, namely name and form.	NA
dn15:21.1	‘Consciousness is a condition for name and form’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.	Consciousness in dependent origination is normally defined as the six kinds of sense consciousness ([sn12:6.3]()). The purpose of this is to emphasize that the process of rebirth and transmigration is an empirical process, which depends on the same ordinary consciousness we are experiencing now. Here, once again, by skipping the six senses, a new mode of analysis opens up, which emphasizes the organic growth of the individual.
dn15:21.2	If consciousness were not conceived in the mother’s womb, would name and form coagulate there?”	“Conceived” is _okkamissatha_, literally “descend” or “arrive”. | “Coagulate” assumes the PTS reading _samucchissatha_ (Sanskrit _sammurch_). I believe this echoes the belief that the embryo is “coagulated” from the mix of blood and semen. | Linguistically, this passage through to [dn15:22.2]() is marked with the extremely rare verbal ending _-issatha_, which is the middle form of the third person singular conditional.
dn15:21.3	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:21.4	“If consciousness, after being conceived in the mother’s womb, were to be miscarried, would name and form be born into this place?”	“Miscarried” is _vokkamissatha_. | “State of existence” is _itthattā_, which is most commonly found in the declaration of the arahant that they will no longer be reborn into “this state of existence”. | Here “born” is _abhinibbatti_, which is listed along with _jāti_, _okkanti_, and other terms as a synonym in the standard definition of rebirth ([sn12.2:4.2](), [mn9:24-26.7](), [dn22:18.4]()).
dn15:21.5	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:21.6	“If the consciousness of a young boy or girl were to be cut off, would name and form achieve growth, increase, and maturity?”	The connection between dependent origination and childhood development is further explored in [mn38:28.1]().
dn15:21.7	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:21.8	“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of name and form, namely consciousness.	NA
dn15:22.1	‘Name and form are conditions for consciousness’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.	Now we turn to the mirror side of the pair of conditions.
dn15:22.2	If consciousness were not established in name and form, would the coming to be of the origin of suffering—of rebirth, old age, and death in the future—be found?”	Just as name and form—the organic, sensual, and sense-making body—cannot grow without consciousness, so too consciousness must acquire a landing or grounding place to be “planted” in name and form. | _Dukkhasamudayasambhavo_ (“the coming to be of the origin of suffering”) might be rendered “the coming to be and origin of suffering”. However, _dukkhasamudaya_ occurs some hundreds of times in the sense “origin of suffering” so I take it in the same way here. This is supported by the PTS variant reading _dukkhasamudayo sambhavo_.
dn15:22.3	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:22.4	“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of consciousness, namely name and form.	NA
dn15:22.5	This is the extent to which one may be reborn, grow old, die, pass away, or reappear.	This passage continues to employ rare middle forms, this time _-etha_, the third person singular optative.
dn15:22.6	This is how far the scope of labeling, terminology, and description extends; how far the sphere of wisdom extends; how far the cycle of rebirths spins so that this state of being may be found; namely, name and form together with consciousness.	This passage explains why the sequence ends here rather than proceeding in the usual way to choices and ignorance. Any state of being ultimately depends on the codependency of name and form with consciousness. Within this key relationship is the extent not only of language, but also of wisdom, and the secret to the undoing of transmigration itself. One of the many profound implications of this is that there is no such thing as a state of pure consciousness independent of concepts. | _Ettāvatā vaṭṭaṁ vattati itthattaṁ paññāpanāya_ should be read with such passages as [sn22.56:5.3](): _ye kevalino vaṭṭaṁ tesaṁ natthi paññāpanāya_ (“For consummate ones, there is no cycle of rebirths to be found”). | In Chāndogya Upaniṣad 7.1.5, one who worships Divinity as name can do as they please “within the limits of name” (_yāvannāmno gataṁ_). | The Mahāsaṅgīti reading _aññamaññapaccayatā pavattati_ is spurious, since it inserts an Abhidhamma concept from the commentary.
dn15:23.0	2. Describing the Self	NA
dn15:23.1	How do those who describe the self describe it?	The text now turns to an analysis of theories of “self” (_attā_), which is comparable to some of the passages of [dn1](). The Buddha began his discourse by stating that it is the failure to understand dependent origination that keeps beings trapped in transmigration. Dependent origination explains transmigration in a purely empirical way by inferring from the mental and physical phenomena we experience here and now. Self theorists, on the other hand, explain transmigration by introducing a new metaphysical principle, the “self” or “soul”, by which they assume that the individual has an eternal underlying essence.
dn15:23.2	They describe it as formed and limited:	“Formed” is _rūpī_ (“possessing form”), identifying the self with the first of the five aggregates. If something were really the core essence of a person, you would think it is readily knowable. But the Buddha shows that theorists describe the self in multiple different and incompatible ways. Each of these draws on some more-or-less arbitrary aspect of empirical reality, such as “form”, to describe an unknowable metaphysical entity that is in fact just pure supposition.
dn15:23.3	‘My self is formed and limited.’	An example of a self that is “physical and limited” would be the body.
dn15:23.4	Or they describe it as formed and infinite:	NA
dn15:23.5	‘My self is formed and infinite.’	Such as the cosmos.
dn15:23.6	Or they describe it as formless and limited:	NA
dn15:23.7	‘My self is formless and limited.’	Perhaps this is the self of “limited perception” ([dn1:2.38.13]()). This would be where the mind is aware of something limited, and the self is identified with the mental dimension of that awareness.
dn15:23.8	Or they describe it as formless and infinite:	NA
dn15:23.9	‘My self is formless and infinite.’	Such as the formless dimensions.
dn15:24.1	Now, take those who describe the self as formed and limited.	NA
dn15:24.2	They describe the self in the present as formed and limited; or they describe it as sure to be in some other place formed and limited; or else they think: ‘Though it is not like that, I will ensure it is provided with what it needs to become like that.’	The three options (“it is”, “it will be so”, and “I will make it be so”) illustrate how the theorist resorts to ever more convoluted means to justify the lack of empirical support for their pet theory. | _Bhāviṁ_ (“sure to become”) is the root _bhū_ with the primary affix _-ī_, which connotes an inevitable future state. | _Tattha_ (“in some other place”, literally “there”) is explained by the commentary as _paraloke_ (“in the next world”).
dn15:24.3	This being so, it’s appropriate to say that a view of self as formed and limited underlies them.	Their surface differences rest on the same underlying assumption, so if the assumption is disproved there is no need to refute each individual theory. | _Iccālaṁ_ resolves to _iti alaṁ_.
dn15:24.4	Now, take those who describe the self as formed and infinite …	NA

dn15:25.1	How do those who don’t describe the self not describe it?	This is the Buddha, who does not theorize a metaphysical self. Implicit in this argument is Occam’s razor, “entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity”. Since the self theorists want to prove the existence of the “self”, it is up to them to supply the grounds to support their suppositions. Since they fail to do so, the rational position is that there is no self. The Buddha is not under a similar obligation to prove the non-existence of the “self”, since it is reasonable to assume that things do not exist until the evidence says otherwise.

dn15:27.0	4. Regarding a Self	NA
dn15:27.1	How do those who regard the self regard it?	Having asserted a metaphysical “self”, the theorists go on to make certain observations and interpretations regarding it.
dn15:27.2	They regard feeling as self:	The Buddha moves from theories of the self as form to feeling, the second of the five aggregates.
dn15:27.3	‘Feeling is my self.’	For example, identifying the self with the supposed eternal bliss of heaven. As with the description of self in physical terms, the theorist proceeds from a simple assertion of identity to more complicated hypotheses.
dn15:27.4	Or they regard it like this: ‘Feeling is definitely not my self. My self does not experience feeling.’	This is the inverse of the previous. The self is still defined *in relation to* feeling, but it is a negative relation. Such theories are commonly found in the Upaniṣads, where a prominent thread of analysis systematically rejects all the things that are *not* the self (_neti_), before finally arriving at what *is* the self (eg. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.5.15).
dn15:27.5	Or they regard it like this: ‘Feeling is definitely not my self. But it’s not that my self does not experience feeling. My self feels, for my self is liable to feel.’	Here the theorist describes feeling as a function of the self: it is not what the self *is*, but what the self *does*. At [mn38:5.11]() (= [mn2:8.8]()), Sāti describes the self as consciousness, “the speaker and feeler who experiences the results of good and bad deeds in all the different realms”.
dn15:28.1	Now, as to those who say:	The Buddha goes on to develop specific arguments addressing each position.
dn15:28.2	‘Feeling is my self.’	NA
dn15:28.3	You should say this to them:	NA
dn15:28.4	‘Reverend, there are three feelings:	NA
dn15:28.5	pleasant, painful, and neutral.	The Buddha points out the universal experience of feeling, thus establishing his argument on common ground. This same argument is found at [mn74:10.1]().
dn15:28.6	Which one of these do you regard as self?’	NA
dn15:28.7	Ānanda, at a time when you feel a pleasant feeling, you don’t feel a painful or neutral feeling;	The idea that only one kind of feeling can be experienced at a time became an adage of Buddhist psychology, but it is not obvious to me that it is the case. Here and at MN 74 it is assumed to be a shared belief with non-Buddhists.
dn15:28.8	you only feel a pleasant feeling.	NA
dn15:28.9	At a time when you feel a painful feeling, you don’t feel a pleasant or neutral feeling;	NA
dn15:28.10	you only feel a painful feeling.	NA
dn15:28.11	At a time when you feel a neutral feeling, you don’t feel a pleasant or painful feeling;	NA
dn15:28.12	you only feel a neutral feeling.	NA
dn15:29.1	Pleasant feelings, painful feelings, and neutral feelings are all impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated, liable to end, vanish, fade away, and cease.	NA
dn15:29.2	NA	NA
dn15:29.3	NA	NA
dn15:29.4	When feeling a pleasant feeling they think: ‘This is my self.’	NA
dn15:29.5	When their pleasant feeling ceases they think: ‘My self has disappeared.’	NA
dn15:29.6	When feeling a painful feeling they think: ‘This is my self.’	NA
dn15:29.7	When their painful feeling ceases they think: ‘My self has disappeared.’	NA
dn15:29.8	When feeling a neutral feeling they think: ‘This is my self.’	NA
dn15:29.9	When their neutral feeling ceases they think: ‘My self has disappeared.’	NA
dn15:29.10	So those who say ‘feeling is my self’ regard as self that which is evidently impermanent, mixed with pleasure and pain, and liable to rise and fall.	NA
dn15:29.11	That’s why it’s not acceptable to regard feeling as self.	NA
dn15:30.1	Now, as to those who say:	NA
dn15:30.2	‘Feeling is definitely not my self. My self does not experience feeling.’ You should say this to them,	NA
dn15:30.3	‘But reverend, where there is nothing felt at all, would the thought “I am” occur there?’”	Feeling is part of the fundamental structure of consciousness. This argument comes through more clearly in Pali, for the word for “feeling” (_vedanā_) is derived from and still lies close to the sense of “knowing, experiencing”. Thus the question is, “If there was no mind, would there be the thought ‘I am this’?” The commentary explains that this refers to the bare material realm which is devoid of consciousness. The commentary appears to support the variant reading _ahamasmī_ here. This makes sense in context, for “I am” is the first and most primordial assertion of a self, while “I am this” is a more sophisticated identification of the self in relation to the aggregates.
dn15:30.4	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:30.5	“That’s why it’s not acceptable to regard self as that which does not experience feeling.	NA
dn15:31.1	Now, as to those who say:	NA
dn15:31.2	‘Feeling is definitely not my self. But it’s not that my self does not experience feeling. My self feels, for my self is liable to feel.’	NA
dn15:31.3	You should say this to them,	NA
dn15:31.4	‘Suppose feelings were to totally and utterly cease without anything left over.	NA
dn15:31.5	When there’s no feeling at all, with the cessation of feeling, would the thought “I am this” occur there?’”	The theorist avoids identifying feeling as the self, but they must identify *something* as the self (as for example, Sāti said the self was _viññāṇa_). Feeling, however, is deeply wound into the structure of consciousness, so if feeling were to be utterly absent, no other mental phenomena could continue, and there would therefore be no possibility of forming a theory of self.
dn15:31.6	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:31.7	“That’s why it’s not acceptable to regard self as that which is liable to feel.	NA
dn15:32.1	NA	NA
dn15:32.2	Not regarding anything in this way, they don’t grasp at anything in the world.	NA
dn15:32.3	Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.	Letting go is not just a conceptual matter, it has immediate emotional consequences. _Paritassati_ conveys the twin senses of desire and agitation, for which “anxiety” seems the best fit.
dn15:32.4	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’	NA
dn15:32.5	It wouldn’t be appropriate to say that a mendicant whose mind is freed like this holds the following views:	NA
dn15:32.6	‘A realized one still exists after death’;	NA
dn15:32.7	‘A realized one no longer exists after death’;	NA
dn15:32.8	‘A realized one both still exists and no longer exists after death’;	NA
dn15:32.9	‘A realized one neither still exists nor no longer exists after death’.	NA
dn15:32.10	Why is that?	NA
dn15:32.11	A mendicant is freed by directly knowing this: how far labeling and the scope of labeling extend; how far terminology and the scope of terminology extend; how far description and the scope of description extend; how far wisdom and the sphere of wisdom extend; how far the cycle of rebirths and its continuation extend. It wouldn’t be appropriate to say that a mendicant freed by directly knowing this holds the view: ‘There is no such thing as knowing and seeing.’	This recalls the similar statement at [dn15:22.6](). Whereas there it was a statement about name and form with consciousness, here it is a description of the arahant who has fully realized it. Unlike the theorists whose views do not withstand empirical scrutiny, the arahant’s liberation is based on a direct understanding of reality.
dn15:33.0	5. Planes of Consciousness	NA
dn15:33.1	Ānanda, there are seven planes of consciousness and two dimensions.	The Buddha returns once more to the question of rebirth, describing various states of rebirth in terms of consciousness. The seven planes are also mentioned at [dn33:2.3.28](), [dn34:1.8.11](), and [an7.44:1.1]().
dn15:33.2	What seven?	NA
dn15:33.3	There are sentient beings that are diverse in body and diverse in perception, such as human beings, some gods, and some beings in the underworld.	NA
dn15:33.4	This is the first plane of consciousness.	“Plane of consciousness” is _viññāṇaṭṭhiti_, which could also be rendered “station”.
dn15:33.5	There are sentient beings that are diverse in body and unified in perception, such as the gods reborn in the Divinity’s host through the first absorption.	NA
dn15:33.6	This is the second plane of consciousness.	NA
dn15:33.7	There are sentient beings that are unified in body and diverse in perception, such as the gods of streaming radiance.	NA
dn15:33.8	This is the third plane of consciousness.	NA
dn15:33.9	There are sentient beings that are unified in body and unified in perception, such as the gods of universal beauty.	NA
dn15:33.10	This is the fourth plane of consciousness.	NA
dn15:33.11	There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond perceptions of form. With the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they have been reborn in the dimension of infinite space.	NA
dn15:33.12	This is the fifth plane of consciousness.	NA
dn15:33.13	There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite space. Aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they have been reborn in the dimension of infinite consciousness.	NA
dn15:33.14	This is the sixth plane of consciousness.	NA
dn15:33.15	There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness. Aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they have been reborn in the dimension of nothingness.	NA
dn15:33.16	This is the seventh plane of consciousness.	NA
dn15:33.17	Then there is the dimension of non-percipient beings, and secondly, the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	In the first of these dimensions there is no consciousness at all, and in the second there is no consciousness in the normal sense, which is why they cannot be called “planes of consciousness”.
dn15:34.1	Now, regarding these seven planes of consciousness and two dimensions,	NA
dn15:34.2	is it appropriate for someone who understands them—and their origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape—to take pleasure in them?”	_Abhinandituṁ_, to “take pleasure in”, to “relish”, or to “delight in” appears in the standard formula for the second noble truth, where craving “takes pleasure in various realms” (_tatratatrābhinandinī_).
dn15:34.3	“No, sir.”	NA
dn15:34.4	NA	NA
dn15:34.5	NA	NA
dn15:34.6	NA	NA
dn15:34.7	NA	NA
dn15:34.8	NA	NA
dn15:34.9	NA	NA
dn15:34.10	“When a mendicant, having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape regarding these seven planes of consciousness and these two dimensions, is freed by not grasping, they’re called a mendicant who is freed by wisdom.	One “freed by wisdom” has wisdom as the dominant faculty.
dn15:35.0	6. The Eight Liberations	NA
dn15:35.1	Ānanda, there are these eight liberations.	The eight liberations (_vimokkhā_) are an alternative way of describing the meditative experiences of _jhāna_. Elsewhere they are listed at [dn16:3.33.1](), [dn33:3.1.168](), [dn34:2.1.191](), [an:8.66](), [mn77:22.1](), and referred to at [an4.189:1.8]() and [thag20.1:33.1](). At [an8.120]() and [mn137:27.1]() they are listed but not called the eight liberations.
dn15:35.2	What eight?	NA
dn15:35.3	Having physical form, they see forms.	Someone sees a meditative vision based on the perception of their own body, such as through mindfulness of breathing or one’s own body parts. The first three liberations all cover the four _jhānas_.
dn15:35.4	This is the first liberation.	NA
dn15:35.5	Not perceiving form internally, they see forms externally.	A meditator grounds their practice on some external focus, such as a light, the sight of a corpse, or an external element such as earth.
dn15:35.6	This is the second liberation.	NA
dn15:35.7	They’re focused only on beauty.	This is a practice based on wholly pure and exalted meditation, such as the meditation on love, or the sight of a pure brilliant color like the sky.
dn15:35.8	This is the third liberation.	NA
dn15:35.9	Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space.	NA
dn15:35.10	This is the fourth liberation.	NA
dn15:35.11	Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness.	NA
dn15:35.12	This is the fifth liberation.	NA
dn15:35.13	Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness.	NA
dn15:35.14	This is the sixth liberation.	NA
dn15:35.15	Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	NA
dn15:35.16	This is the seventh liberation.	NA
dn15:35.17	Going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling.	The “cessation of perception and feeling” (_saññāvedayitanirodha_) is a culminating meditation state of supreme subtlety that often leads directly to awakening (but see [an5.166]()). The state itself, like all meditation states, is temporary, but afterwards the defilements can be eliminated forever. This liberating insight is the consequence of the balanced development of all eight factors of the path.
dn15:35.18	This is the eighth liberation.	NA
dn15:35.19	These are the eight liberations.	NA
dn15:36.1	When a mendicant enters into and withdraws from these eight liberations—in forward order, in reverse order, and in forward and reverse order—wherever they wish, whenever they wish, and for as long as they wish;	This passage emphasizes that this person is fully adept and has mastered all the states of meditation. The Buddha claimed such mastery ([an9.41:16.1]()), and retained the ability even on his deathbed ([dn16:6.8.1]()).
dn15:36.2	and when they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements, they’re called a mendicant who is freed both ways.	Here we see the terms “one who is freed” used in two ways. All arahants have “freedom of heart” (by means of _samādhi_) and “freedom by wisdom” (the realization of the Dhamma). At the same time, one who emphasizes _samādhi_ is said to have “freedom of heart” in contrast with one who emphasizes wisdom, who has “freedom by wisdom”. One who has consummate mastery of both _samādhi_ and wisdom is said to be “freed both ways”.
dn15:36.3	And, Ānanda, there is no other freedom both ways that is better or finer than this.”	NA
dn15:36.4	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
dn15:36.5	Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what the Buddha said.	NA
dn16:0.1	Long Discourses 16	NA
dn16:0.2	The Great Discourse on the Buddha’s Extinguishment	NA
dn16:1.1.1	So I have heard.	The longest of all early discourses, this dramatic and moving narrative tells the story of the Buddha’s slow journey towards his final passing.
dn16:1.1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.	NA
dn16:1.1.3	Now at that time King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, wanted to invade the Vajjis.	After the events of [dn2](), Ajātasattu retained and consolidated his power. Magadha ultimately conquered the Vajji Federation and continued to expand until almost all of India was under its sway.
dn16:1.1.4	He declared:	NA
dn16:1.1.5	“I shall wipe out these Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy them, and lay ruin and devastation upon them!”	According to the commentary, Ajātasattu’s anger was rooted in a dispute on trade routes. Control of shipping on the Ganges was essential for establishing international trade. There was a port on the Ganges extending over a league, split half and half between Magadha and Vajji. Valuable products were sourced from a mountain and brought down for trade, but the Vajjis kept absconding with the whole lot. The place is not identified, but Munger, a strategic port east of Patna, fits the description. The nearby hills have been mined since paleolithic times. It is also likely, as maintained in Jain tradition, that the Vajjis disputed Ajātasattu’s accession after committing regicide. His threatening posture towards the Vajjis is also mentioned in [sn20.8:2.2]().
dn16:1.2.1	And then King Ajātasattu addressed Vassakāra the brahmin minister of Magadha,	Vassakāra appears in the suttas as a devoted follower of the Buddha.
dn16:1.2.2	“Please, brahmin, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	NA
dn16:1.2.4	And then say:	NA
dn16:1.2.5	‘Sir, King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, wants to invade the Vajjis.	NA
dn16:1.2.6	He says,	NA
dn16:1.2.7	“I shall wipe out these Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy them, and lay ruin and devastation upon them!”’	The Vajji Federation harks back to an early settlement founded by the legendary Nābhānediṣṭha in the Vedic period. It built its wealth on its extensive fertile plains and the trading possibilities opened up by the Gandak and Ganges rivers.
dn16:1.2.8	Remember well how the Buddha answers and tell it to me.	NA
dn16:1.2.9	For Realized Ones say nothing that is not so.”	While it may seem strange to consult the Buddha on such a violent plan, Ajātasattu knows from his experience in DN 2 that the Buddha will not hesitate to tell him the truth, even if it is bad news. It seems he is trying to avoid the downfall of tyrants who are surrounded only with yes men.
dn16:1.3.0	1. The Brahmin Vassakāra	NA
dn16:1.3.1	“Yes, worthy sir,” Vassakāra replied. He had the finest carriages harnessed. Then he mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out from Rājagaha for the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.	Reading _yojapetvā_ (“had them harnessed”), which is found in the Mahāsaṅgīti in similar passages, and in this passage in the PTS edition.
dn16:1.3.2	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the Buddha on foot, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
dn16:1.3.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,	NA
dn16:1.3.4	“Worthy Gotama, King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, bows with his head to your feet. He asks if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	NA
dn16:1.3.5	Worthy Gotama, King Ajātasattu wants to invade the Vajjis.	NA
dn16:1.3.6	He has declared:	NA
dn16:1.3.7	‘I shall wipe out these Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy them, and lay ruin and devastation upon them!’”	NA
dn16:1.4.0	2. Principles That Prevent Decline	NA
dn16:1.4.1	Now at that time Venerable Ānanda was standing behind the Buddha fanning him.	Ānanda cares for the Buddha in his old age. Shortly after these events, Ānanda was entrusted with reciting the suttas at the First Council. This discourse would have been composed by him in the years following his Master’s death. More than a simple interlocutor, Ānanda shapes the story as its second lead, a relatable character with an empathetic point of view. He imbues the discourse with his emotional struggles as he deals with the Buddha’s passing and helps ensure the future survival of the Dhamma, while still developing his own meditation practice.
dn16:1.4.2	Then the Buddha said to him,	NA
dn16:1.4.3	“Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings?”	As for example at [an8.12:1.2]().
dn16:1.4.4	“I have heard that, sir.”	NA
dn16:1.4.5	“As long as the Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings, they can expect growth, not decline.	NA
dn16:1.4.6	Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis meet in harmony, leave in harmony, and carry on their business in harmony?”	Harmony is especially important as the Vajji Federation was comprised of several different clans, among them the Licchavis of Vesālī, the Ñātikas just south of Vesālī, the Uggas of Hatthigāma (Elephant Village), and the Bhogas of Bhoganagara. Some sources say the Vajjis proper were another tribe within the alliance. The Videhans of Mithilā are also sometimes included, but several sources indicate that they remained an independent, if reduced, kingdom until they were conquered by Magadha some years later. The Mallas of Pāvā and Kusinārā formed a closely allied independent republic ([mn35:12.8]()).
dn16:1.4.7	“I have heard that, sir.”	NA
dn16:1.4.8	“As long as the Vajjis meet in harmony, leave in harmony, and carry on their business in harmony, they can expect growth, not decline.	NA
dn16:1.4.9	Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis don’t make new decrees or abolish existing decrees, but proceed having undertaken the ancient Vajjian traditions as they have been decreed?”	The “ancient Vajjian traditions” (_porāṇe vajjidhamme_) would have been established with the founding of the Vajji Federation some centuries earlier, which ensured that the members of the federation would have a voice in the Licchavi-dominated union. Compare with the “ancient traditions of the brahmins” (_porāṇā brāhmaṇadhammā_ at [an5.191]() and [snp2.7]()), the falling away from which is said to be the cause of Brahmanical decline. Similarly, the Buddha elsewhere scolds the Vajjis for their indulgence ([an5.143]()), suggesting that the decline may have already set in.
dn16:1.4.10	“I have heard that, sir.”	NA
dn16:1.4.11	“As long as the Vajjis don’t make new decrees or abolish existing decrees, but proceed having undertaken the ancient Vajjian traditions as they have been decreed, they can expect growth, not decline.	NA
dn16:1.4.12	Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate Vajjian elders, and think them worth listening to?”	NA
dn16:1.4.13	“I have heard that, sir.”	NA
dn16:1.4.14	“As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate Vajjian elders, and think them worth listening to, they can expect growth, not decline.	NA
dn16:1.4.15	Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis don’t forcibly abduct the women or girls of the clans and make them live with them?”	This advocates for legal protection for women from sexual violence. | For various legal regulations regarding women and sex, see Kauṭilya’s Arthaśāstra 12.
dn16:1.4.16	“I have heard that, sir.”	NA
dn16:1.4.17	“As long as the Vajjis don’t forcibly abduct the women or girls of the clans and make them live with them, they can expect growth, not decline.	NA
dn16:1.4.18	Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajjian shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the proper spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past?”	The Buddha will stay at several of these shrines later in this discourse. They were sacred groves, maintained by the people in reverence for the powerful spirits of nature. | “Spirit-offerings” is _bali_. | The commentary explains “inner or outer” as inside or outside the town.
dn16:1.4.19	“I have heard that, sir.”	NA
dn16:1.4.20	“As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajjian shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the proper spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past, they can expect growth, not decline.	NA
dn16:1.4.21	Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis organize proper protection, shelter, and security for perfected ones, so that more perfected ones might come to the realm and those already here may live in comfort?”	It is an old Indian belief that the presence of holy persons provides a kind of umbrella effect that protects the realm.
dn16:1.4.22	“I have heard that, sir.”	NA
dn16:1.4.23	“As long as the Vajjis organize proper protection, shelter, and security for perfected ones, so that more perfected ones might come to the realm and those already here may live in comfort, they can expect growth, not decline.”	NA
dn16:1.5.1	Then the Buddha said to Vassakāra,	NA
dn16:1.5.2	“Brahmin, this one time I was staying near Vesālī at the Sārandada Tree-shrine.	This event is recorded at [an7.21](), where the Buddha addresses the Licchavis. That chapter of the Aṅguttara mostly consists of the teachings found here presented as separate suttas. | The Sārandada shrine was short walk from Vesālī ([an5.143]()).
dn16:1.5.3	There I taught the Vajjis these seven principles that prevent decline.	There is a certain tension here: the Buddha taught these principles to the Vajjis, one of which is that the Vajjis should not adopt new decrees. It seems that a “decree” (_paññatta_) is more like constitutional law, whereas a “principle” (_dhamma_) is more like a behavioral guideline.
dn16:1.5.4	As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the Vajjis, and as long as the Vajjis are seen following them, they can expect growth, not decline.”	NA
dn16:1.5.5	When the Buddha had spoken, Vassakāra said to him,	NA
dn16:1.5.6	“Worthy Gotama, if the Vajjis follow even a single one of these principles they can expect growth, not decline.	NA
dn16:1.5.7	How much more so all seven!	NA
dn16:1.5.8	King Ajātasattu cannot defeat the Vajjis in war, unless by bribery or by sowing dissension.	_Upalāpana_ is used a number of times in the Vinaya, where it always has the sense of giving someone something to get them to do what you want. It has the same sense at [sn3.25:4.13](), where an enemy king may be bribed with gold from the royal treasury. | The commentary says that Vassakāra himself was assigned with the task of weakening the Vajjis in this way.
dn16:1.5.9	Well, now, worthy Gotama, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.”	NA
dn16:1.5.10	“Please, brahmin, go at your convenience.”	NA
dn16:1.5.11	Then Vassakāra the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got up from his seat and left.	NA
dn16:1.6.0	3. Principles That Prevent Decline Among the Mendicants	NA
dn16:1.6.1	Soon after he had left, the Buddha said to Ānanda,	NA
dn16:1.6.2	“Go, Ānanda, gather all the mendicants staying in the vicinity of Rājagaha together in the assembly hall.”	There were several monasteries and hermitages around Rājagaha ([pli-tv-kd2:11.1.1]()).
dn16:1.6.3	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He did what the Buddha asked. Then he went back, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	NA
dn16:1.6.4	“Sir, the mendicant Saṅgha has assembled. Please, sir, go at your convenience.”	NA
dn16:1.6.5	Then the Buddha went to the assembly hall, where he sat on the seat spread out	NA
dn16:1.6.6	and addressed the mendicants:	NA
dn16:1.6.7	“Mendicants, I will teach you these seven principles that prevent decline.	Also at [an7.23]().
dn16:1.6.8	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
dn16:1.6.9	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
dn16:1.6.10	The Buddha said this:	NA
dn16:1.6.11	“As long as the mendicants meet frequently and have many meetings, they can expect growth, not decline.	This especially refers to the fortnightly _uposatha_. Despite the dangers faced in the rugged hills around Rājagaha ([pli-tv-kd2:12.1.1]()), the Buddha insisted that all monks of the locality attended the _uposatha_ ([pli-tv-kd2:5.3.1]()).
dn16:1.6.12	As long as the mendicants meet in harmony, leave in harmony, and carry on their business in harmony, they can expect growth, not decline.	The Buddha encouraged the mendicants to recite the Dhamma in harmony ([mn103:3.2]()), to resolve issues in harmony ([mn104:14.3]()), and on the _uposatha_ to recite and train in the _pātimokkha_ in harmony ([pli-tv-bu-vb-as7:4.11]()).
dn16:1.6.13	As long as the mendicants don’t make new decrees or abolish existing decrees, but undertake and follow the training rules as they have been decreed, they can expect growth, not decline.	Picking up from the similar injunction to the Vajjis, this kicks off a long narrative arc that binds together the Buddha’s invitation to abolish the minor rules ([dn16:6.3.1]()) with the bad monk Subhadda’s seizing on the Buddha’s death as an excuse to give up the rules, which was the direct motivation for the First Council ([dn16:6.20.3]() = [pli-tv-kd21:1.1.24]()), at the end of which the Sangha agreed not to abolish any rules ([pli-tv-kd21:1.9.20]()), a decision that was affirmed a century later at the Second Council ([pli-tv-kd22]()).
dn16:1.6.14	As long as the mendicants honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the senior mendicants—of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha—and think them worth listening to, they can expect growth, not decline.	The nature of seniority in the Saṅgha is often misunderstood. There is no “hierarchy” (literally “rule of priests”) in the sense of power-based relationships: no monastic has the authority to command another monk or nun. Seniority is owed respect, not obedience.
dn16:1.6.15	As long as the mendicants don’t fall under the sway of arisen craving for future lives, they can expect growth, not decline.	This stands in place of the injunction against sexual violence, both principles being concerned with the harmful effects of desire.
dn16:1.6.16	As long as the mendicants take care to live in wilderness lodgings, they can expect growth, not decline.	This stands in place of the injunction to maintain the shrines, where mendicants would frequently stay.
dn16:1.6.17	As long as the mendicants individually establish mindfulness, so that more good-hearted spiritual companions might come, and those that have already come may live comfortably, they can expect growth, not decline.	This stands in place of the injunction to look after arahants.
dn16:1.6.18	As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the mendicants, and as long as the mendicants are seen following them, they can expect growth, not decline.	NA
dn16:1.7.1	I will teach you seven more principles that prevent decline. …	Also at [an7.24]().
dn16:1.7.4	As long as the mendicants don’t relish work, loving it and liking to relish it, they can expect growth, not decline.	“Work” is _kamma_, which especially means “building work”. Of course it is essential to do work, but one should not get too caught up in it. The Buddha did not believe that working hard was ennobling in and of itself.
dn16:1.7.5	As long as they don’t relish talk …	NA

dn16:1.11.1	I will teach you six principles that prevent decline. …	These six principles are found in several places, but they are not elsewhere called “principles that prevent decline”; for example at [an6.11]() they are called “warm-hearted qualities” (_dhammā sāraṇīyā_). At [an6.22](), however, a different six qualities are called “principles that prevent decline”: not relishing work, talk, sleep, and company, being easy to admonish, and having good friends.
dn16:1.11.4	As long as the mendicants consistently treat their spiritual companions with bodily kindness …	NA
dn16:1.11.5	verbal kindness …	NA
dn16:1.11.6	and mental kindness both in public and in private, they can expect growth, not decline.	NA
dn16:1.11.7	As long as the mendicants share without reservation any material things they have gained by legitimate means, even the food placed in the alms-bowl, using them in common with their ethical spiritual companions, they can expect growth, not decline.	NA
dn16:1.11.8	As long as the mendicants live according to the precepts shared with their spiritual companions, both in public and in private—such precepts as are intact, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion—they can expect growth, not decline.	NA
dn16:1.11.9	As long as the mendicants live according to the view shared with their spiritual companions, both in public and in private—the view that is noble and emancipating, and delivers one who practices it to the complete end of suffering—they can expect growth, not decline.	This is the right view of the noble eightfold path, in other words, the four noble truths.
dn16:1.11.10	As long as these six principles that prevent decline last among the mendicants, and as long as the mendicants are seen following them, they can expect growth, not decline.”	NA
dn16:1.12.1	And while staying there at the Vulture’s Peak the Buddha often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicants:	This epitome of the Dhamma is repeated eight times in this discourse, summarizing the teachings in the Gradual Training. It is not found in this exact form elsewhere.
dn16:1.12.2	“Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom.	NA
dn16:1.12.3	When immersion is imbued with ethics it’s very fruitful and beneficial.	“Imbued” (_paribhāvita_) as a mother hen imbues her eggs with warmth by sitting on them ([an7.71:2.2]()). See also [sn55.21:2.3]().
dn16:1.12.4	When wisdom is imbued with immersion it’s very fruitful and beneficial.	NA
dn16:1.12.5	When the mind is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements, namely,	NA
dn16:1.12.6	the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.”	Some editions add _diṭṭhāsava_ (“defilement of views”), but since that appears to be a late interpolation I follow the Mahāsaṅgīti in omitting it.
dn16:1.13.1	When the Buddha had stayed in Rājagaha as long as he pleased, he addressed Venerable Ānanda,	NA
dn16:1.13.2	“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Ambalaṭṭhikā.”	This is the same rest-house at which the Buddha sojourned on his way from Rājagaha to Nāḷandā in the Brahmajālasutta ([dn1]()).
dn16:1.13.3	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
dn16:1.13.4	Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Ambalaṭṭhikā,	NA
dn16:1.14.1	where he stayed in the royal rest-house.	NA

dn16:1.16.0	4. Sāriputta’s Lion’s Roar	NA
dn16:1.16.1	Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	This was apparently the last time that the Buddha met Sāriputta. This encounter is recorded in an independent sutta at [sn47.12]() and expanded into a long discourse at [dn28](). The Saṁyutta follows this meeting with the record of Sāriputta’s passing at [sn47.13](), and then the lament for the absence of both Sāriputta and Moggallāna at [sn47.14 ](). For some reason these events were omitted from the present discourse, even though they fit well thematically.
dn16:1.16.2	“Sir, I have such confidence in the Buddha that	NA

dn16:1.16.6	I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.’	NA
dn16:1.16.7	What about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past? Have you comprehended their minds to know that	NA

dn16:1.16.15	“No, sir.”	NA
dn16:1.16.16	“Well then, Sāriputta, given that you don’t comprehend the minds of Buddhas past, future, or present,	NA
dn16:1.16.17	what exactly are you doing, making such a grand and dramatic statement, roaring such a definitive, categorical lion’s roar?”	NA
dn16:1.17.1	“Sir, though I don’t comprehend the minds of Buddhas past, future, and present,	NA
dn16:1.17.2	still I understand this by inference from the teaching.	As at [dn14:1.37.4](), inference (_anvaya_) is regarded as a valid form of knowledge. The Buddha himself is said to rely on inference using the same simile at [an10.95:10.4]().
dn16:1.17.3	Suppose there was a king’s frontier citadel with fortified embankments, ramparts, and arches, and a single gate.	NA
dn16:1.17.4	And it has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and intelligent. He keeps strangers out and lets known people in.	NA
dn16:1.17.5	As he walks around the patrol path, he doesn’t see a hole or cleft in the wall, not even one big enough for a cat to slip out.	NA
dn16:1.17.6	He thinks:	NA
dn16:1.17.7	‘Whatever sizable creatures enter or leave the citadel, all of them do so via this gate.’	NA
dn16:1.17.8	In the same way, I understand this by inference from the teaching:	NA
dn16:1.17.9	‘All the perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas—whether past, future, or present—give up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Their mind is firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They correctly develop the seven awakening factors. And they wake up to the supreme perfect awakening.’”	NA
dn16:1.18.1	And while staying at Nāḷandā, too, the Buddha often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicants:	NA

dn16:1.19.0	5. The Drawbacks of Unethical Conduct	NA
dn16:1.19.1	When the Buddha had stayed in Nāḷandā as long as he pleased, he addressed Venerable Ānanda,	NA
dn16:1.19.2	“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Pāṭali Village.”	This is modern Patna. In this account we see how it was developed from the simple riverside village of Pāṭaligāma to the citadel of Pāṭaliputta. Ajātasattu ultimately moved the capital of Magadha from the defensively-postured Rājagaha surrounded by hills to this trading center on open waters. Under Ashoka it became one of the greatest cities of the ancient world. It was named after the _pāṭalī_ tree (*Stereospermum chelonoides*), known as *patala* in Hindi.
dn16:1.19.3	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
dn16:1.19.4	Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Pāṭali Village.	NA
dn16:1.20.1	The lay followers of Pāṭali Village heard that he had arrived.	NA
dn16:1.20.2	So they went to see him, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
dn16:1.20.3	“Sir, please consent to come to our guest house.”	NA
dn16:1.20.4	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
dn16:1.21.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, the lay followers of Pāṭali Village got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the guest house, where they spread carpets all over, prepared seats, set up a water jar, and placed an oil lamp. Then they went back to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and told him of their preparations, saying:	NA
dn16:1.21.3	“Please, sir, come at your convenience.”	NA
dn16:1.22.1	In the morning, the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the guest house together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Having washed his feet he entered the guest house and sat against the central column facing east.	NA
dn16:1.22.2	The Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet, entered the guest house, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them.	NA
dn16:1.22.3	The lay followers of Pāṭali Village also washed their feet, entered the guest house, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Buddha right in front of them.	NA
dn16:1.23.1	Then the Buddha addressed them:	NA
dn16:1.23.2	“Householders, there are these five drawbacks for an unethical person because of their failure in ethics.	Also at [an5.213](), [ud8.6:4.1](), [dn33:2.1.36](), and [pli-tv-kd1:28.4.1]().
dn16:1.23.3	What five?	NA
dn16:1.23.4	Firstly, an unethical person loses great wealth on account of negligence.	The Buddha begins with the things most obvious and pertinent to the audience.
dn16:1.23.5	This is the first drawback for an unethical person because of their failure in ethics.	NA
dn16:1.23.6	Furthermore, an unethical person gets a bad reputation.	NA

dn16:1.23.8	Furthermore, an unethical person enters any kind of assembly timid and embarrassed, whether it’s an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics.	NA
dn16:1.23.9	This is the third drawback.	NA
dn16:1.23.10	Furthermore, an unethical person feels lost when they die.	Bewildered by fear and regret.
dn16:1.23.11	This is the fourth drawback.	NA
dn16:1.23.12	Furthermore, an unethical person, when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	NA
dn16:1.23.13	This is the fifth drawback.	NA
dn16:1.23.14	These are the five drawbacks for an unethical person because of their failure in ethics.	NA
dn16:1.24.0	6. The Benefits of Ethical Conduct	NA
dn16:1.24.1	There are these five benefits for an ethical person because of their accomplishment in ethics.	NA
dn16:1.24.2	What five?	NA
dn16:1.24.3	Firstly, an ethical person gains great wealth on account of diligence.	NA
dn16:1.24.4	This is the first benefit.	NA
dn16:1.24.5	Furthermore, an ethical person gets a good reputation.	NA
dn16:1.24.6	This is the second benefit.	NA
dn16:1.24.7	Furthermore, an ethical person enters any kind of assembly bold and self-assured, whether it’s an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics.	NA
dn16:1.24.8	This is the third benefit.	NA
dn16:1.24.9	Furthermore, an ethical person dies not feeling lost.	NA
dn16:1.24.10	This is the fourth benefit.	NA
dn16:1.24.11	Furthermore, when an ethical person’s body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	NA
dn16:1.24.12	This is the fifth benefit.	NA
dn16:1.24.13	These are the five benefits for an ethical person because of their accomplishment in ethics.”	NA
dn16:1.25.1	The Buddha spent much of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the lay followers of Pāṭali Village with a Dhamma talk. Then he dismissed them,	NA
dn16:1.25.2	“The night is getting late, householders. Please go at your convenience.”	NA
dn16:1.25.3	“Yes, sir,” replied the lay followers of Pāṭali Village. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving.	NA
dn16:1.25.4	Soon after they left the Buddha entered a private cubicle.	_Suññāgāra_ normally means an “empty dwelling”, but here the commentary describes it as a curtained-off cubicle.
dn16:1.26.0	7. Building a Citadel	NA
dn16:1.26.1	Now at that time the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra were building a citadel at Pāṭali Village to keep the Vajjis out.	Vassakāra was no dawdler, as he preceded the Buddha to Pāṭaligāma. And not long after, he returned to Rājagaha to build more fortifications there ([mn108:6.2]()). | _Nagara_ here means “citadel, fortress”, not “city”. It has the same sense as _pura_. The construction is defensive and may well have begun before Ajātasattu began thinking of invading.
dn16:1.26.2	At that time thousands of deities were taking possession of building sites in Pāṭali Village.	The relation between deities and building sites (_vatthu_) appears only in this passage in the early texts (repeated at [ud8.6:15.2]() and [pli-tv-kd1:28.7.3]()). Divination and geomancy (_vatthuvijjā_) for building sites is said to be a wrong livelihood at [dn1:1.21.2]().
dn16:1.26.3	Illustrious rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by illustrious deities.	NA
dn16:1.27.1	Middling rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by middling deities.	NA
dn16:1.27.2	Lesser rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by lesser deities.	NA
dn16:1.27.3	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha saw those deities taking possession of building sites in Pāṭali Village.	NA
dn16:1.27.4	The Buddha rose at the crack of dawn and addressed Ānanda,	NA
dn16:1.27.5	“Ānanda, who is building a citadel at Pāṭali Village?”	NA
dn16:1.27.6	“Sir, the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra are building a citadel to keep the Vajjis out.”	NA
dn16:1.28.1	“It’s as if they were building the citadel in consultation with the gods of the thirty-three.	NA
dn16:1.28.3	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw those deities taking possession of building sites.	NA
dn16:1.28.4	Illustrious rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by illustrious deities.	NA
dn16:1.28.5	Middling rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by middling deities.	NA
dn16:1.28.6	Lesser rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by lesser deities.	NA
dn16:1.28.7	As far as the civilized region extends, as far as the trading zone extends, this will be the chief city: the Pāṭaliputta trade center.	From this point, later texts always refer to Pāṭaliputta, but the reason for the change of name from Pāṭaligāma is not explained in the commentary. _Putta_ is a suffix indicating the people of a certain clan or place, so _pāṭaliputta_ means “a person from Pāṭalī (village)” or as we might say, “Pāṭalian”. As the city became well known and its identity as a village receded, it must have become known as the “city of the Pāṭaliputtas” and hence simply Pāṭaliputta. Compare the uses of _ñātika_ below. | The commentary explains that _puṭabhedanaṁ_ refers to the “opening of packages”, signifying that it was a center of trade. This usage is attested as late as the 13th century Jain Vividhatīrthakalpa of Jinaprabhasūri.
dn16:1.28.8	But Pāṭaliputta will face three threats:	NA
dn16:1.28.9	from fire, flood, and dissension.”	Excavations reveal that Pāṭaliputta was constructed of wood, so the danger of fire was real. It is situated on a low-lying flood plain of the Ganges, so flooding would also have been an obvious danger. As for dissension (_mithubheda_), Vassakāra had indicated that this was a means of bringing down the Vajjis, so it would seem that kamma was lying in wait for them.
dn16:1.29.1	Then the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra approached the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
dn16:1.29.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they stood to one side and said,	NA
dn16:1.29.3	“Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept today’s meal from me?”	NA
dn16:1.29.4	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
dn16:1.30.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, they went to their own guest house, where they had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared. Then they had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	NA
dn16:1.30.2	“It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.”	NA
dn16:1.30.3	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to their guest house together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out.	NA
dn16:1.30.4	Then Sunidha and Vassakāra served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with their own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	NA
dn16:1.30.5	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Sunidha and Vassakāra took a low seat and sat to one side.	NA
dn16:1.31.1	The Buddha expressed his appreciation with these verses:	This is the _anumodanā_ recited for the meal offering. Other examples are found at [snp3.7:34.3]() = [mn92:25.6](), [sn55.26:20.1](), [pli-tv-kd1:15.14.4](), and [pli-tv-kd1:1.5.1](). | It is worth noting that no early _anomodanā_ uses the imperative verb form _-tu_ signifying giving a blessing (eg. _bhavatu sabbamaṅgalaṁ_, “may all blessings be”). They strictly use the indicative _-ti_ to teach cause and effect: if you do this, that happens.
dn16:1.31.2	“In the place he makes his dwelling,	NA
dn16:1.31.3	having fed the astute	NA
dn16:1.31.4	and the virtuous here,	NA
dn16:1.31.5	the restrained spiritual practitioners,	NA
dn16:1.31.6	he should dedicate an offering	Buddhism promotes good neighborliness with all beings, seen and unseen. Making an offering to the local spirits helps create a positive and healthy sense of place.
dn16:1.31.7	to the deities there.	NA
dn16:1.31.8	Venerated, they venerate him;	NA
dn16:1.31.9	honored, they honor him.	NA
dn16:1.31.10	After that they have sympathy for him,	NA
dn16:1.31.11	like a mother for the child at her breast.	NA
dn16:1.31.12	A man beloved of the deities	NA
dn16:1.31.13	always sees nice things.”	At [an4.67:8.3]() a similar sentiment is expressed for animals.
dn16:1.31.14	When the Buddha had expressed his appreciation to Sunidha and Vassakāra with these verses, he got up from his seat and left.	NA
dn16:1.32.1	Sunidha and Vassakāra followed behind the Buddha, thinking,	NA
dn16:1.32.2	“The gate through which the ascetic Gotama departs today shall be named the Gotama Gate.	NA
dn16:1.32.3	The ford at which he crosses the Ganges River shall be named the Gotama Ford.”	The “ford” (_tittha_) is symbolic; those who forge a path to salvation are called _titthakara_, such as the six leading ascetics of [dn2](). Today there is a 5.7 km bridge at this crossing, which is appropriately called the Mahatma Gandhi Setu.
dn16:1.32.4	Then the gate through which the Buddha departed was named the Gotama Gate.	NA
dn16:1.32.5	Then the Buddha came to the Ganges River.	NA
dn16:1.33.1	Now at that time the Ganges was full to the brim so a crow could drink from it.	NA
dn16:1.33.2	Wanting to cross from the near to the far shore, some people were seeking a boat, some a dinghy, while some were tying up a raft.	“Dinghy” translates _uḷumpa_.
dn16:1.33.3	But, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, the Buddha, together with the mendicant Saṅgha, vanished from the near shore and landed on the far shore.	In this stock phrase, we sometimes find _paccuṭṭhāsi_ (“landed”) and sometimes _pāturahosi_ (“reappeared”).
dn16:1.34.1	He saw all those humans wanting to cross over.	NA
dn16:1.34.2	Knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
dn16:1.34.3	“Those who cross a deluge or stream	_Aṇṇavaṁ_ cannot mean “sea” here, since it is to be crossed with a bridge.
dn16:1.34.4	have built a bridge and left the marshes behind.	NA
dn16:1.34.5	While some people are still tying a raft,	NA
dn16:1.34.6	intelligent people have crossed over.”	NA
dn16:1.34.7	The first recitation section.	NA
dn16:2.1.0	8. Talk on the Noble Truths	NA
dn16:2.1.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	NA
dn16:2.1.2	“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the village of Koṭi.”	Koṭigāma lay a short distance from the Ganges. The Buddha’s stay here must therefore have followed the events of [sn47.14]() at Ukkacelā on the Vajjian bank of the Ganges, where he laments the passing of Sāriputta and Moggallāna. He would have heard of Sāriputta’s passing before then, while on the road from Nāḷandā to Pāṭaligāma, even though that is implausibly said to have happened at Sāvatthī ([sn47.13]()).
dn16:2.1.3	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
dn16:2.1.4	Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at the village of Koṭi,	NA
dn16:2.1.5	and stayed there.	NA
dn16:2.2.1	There he addressed the mendicants:	Also at [sn56.21]().
dn16:2.2.2	“Mendicants, due to not understanding and not penetrating four noble truths, both you and I have wandered and transmigrated for such a very long time.	NA
dn16:2.2.3	What four?	NA
dn16:2.2.4	The noble truths of suffering,	NA
dn16:2.2.5	the origin of suffering,	NA
dn16:2.2.6	the cessation of suffering,	NA
dn16:2.2.7	and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.	NA
dn16:2.2.8	These noble truths of suffering, origin, cessation, and the path have been understood and comprehended. Craving for continued existence has been cut off; the conduit to rebirth is ended; now there’ll be no more future lives.”	NA
dn16:2.3.1	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
dn16:2.3.2	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	NA
dn16:2.3.3	“Because of not truly seeing	NA
dn16:2.3.4	the four noble truths,	NA
dn16:2.3.5	we have transmigrated for a long time	NA
dn16:2.3.6	from one rebirth to the next.	NA
dn16:2.3.7	But now that these truths have been seen,	NA
dn16:2.3.8	the conduit to rebirth is eradicated.	NA
dn16:2.3.9	The root of suffering is cut off,	NA
dn16:2.3.10	now there’ll be no more future lives.”	NA
dn16:2.4.1	And while staying at the village of Koṭi, too, the Buddha often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicants:	NA
dn16:2.4.2	“Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom.	NA
dn16:2.4.3	When immersion is imbued with ethics it’s very fruitful and beneficial.	NA
dn16:2.4.4	When wisdom is imbued with immersion it’s very fruitful and beneficial.	NA
dn16:2.4.5	When the mind is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements, namely,	NA
dn16:2.4.6	the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.”	NA
dn16:2.5.0	9. The Deaths in Ñātika	NA
dn16:2.5.1	When the Buddha had stayed in the village of Koṭi as long as he pleased, he said to Ānanda,	NA
dn16:2.5.2	“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the land of the Ñātikas.”	Ñātika (also spelled _nātika_, or _nādika_; Sanskrit _jñātṛka_; Prākrit _nāyika_) was the clan to which the Jain leader Mahāvīra (called Nāṭaputta, i.e. Ñātiputta) belonged. Here it is unusually spelled in plural, which means “the land of the Ñātika clan”.
dn16:2.5.3	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
dn16:2.5.4	Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived in the land of the Ñātikas,	NA
dn16:2.5.5	where he stayed in the brick house at Ñātika.	Here Ñātika is in singular and appears to be the name of a town. Thus Ñātika is first of all a name of a clan, then the land they live in, then their chief town. | Over a millennium previously, the Indus Valley Civilization had built cities of fired brick with standardized size and construction methods, but in the Buddha’s day most buildings were wood. This is the only brick building mentioned in the suttas; brick construction is also discussed in the Vinaya.
dn16:2.6.1	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
dn16:2.6.2	“Sir, the monk named Sāḷha has passed away in Ñātika. Where has he been reborn in his next life?	It is unprecedented to discuss the spiritual destinies of an entire town like this. Normally this question is only asked when specific individuals known to the Buddha have passed away. Likely the passage was created in the wake of the passing of Mahāvīra to show that even his own people were enthusiastic Buddhists. This portion of the text is also found at [sn55.8]().
dn16:2.6.3	The nun named Nandā,	NA
dn16:2.6.4	the layman named Sudatta,	NA
dn16:2.6.5	and the laywoman named Sujātā have passed away in Ñātika. Where have they been reborn in the next life?	[sn55.9]() inserts another series on a monk, nun, layman, and laywoman all called Asoka.
dn16:2.6.6	The laymen named Kakkaṭa,	This portion of the text is at [sn55.10](). I spell names consistently with there.
dn16:2.6.7	Kaḷibha,	NA
dn16:2.6.8	Nikata,	NA
dn16:2.6.9	Kaṭissaha,	NA
dn16:2.6.10	Tuṭṭha,	NA
dn16:2.6.11	Santuṭṭha,	NA
dn16:2.6.12	Bhadda, and	NA
dn16:2.6.13	Subhadda have passed away in Ñātika. Where have they been reborn in the next life?”	NA
dn16:2.7.1	“Ānanda, the monk Sāḷha had realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.	NA
dn16:2.7.2	The nun Nandā had ended the five lower fetters. She’s been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.	NA
dn16:2.7.3	The layman Sudatta had ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. He’s a once-returner; he will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.	NA
dn16:2.7.4	The laywoman Sujātā had ended three fetters. She’s a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.	NA
dn16:2.7.5	The laymen Kakkaṭa,	NA
dn16:2.7.6	Kaḷibha,	NA
dn16:2.7.7	Nikata,	NA
dn16:2.7.8	Kaṭissaha,	NA
dn16:2.7.9	Tuṭṭha,	NA
dn16:2.7.10	Santuṭṭha,	NA
dn16:2.7.11	Bhadda,	NA
dn16:2.7.12	and Subhadda had ended the five lower fetters. They’ve been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.	The suttas consistently depict lay folk as attaining the third stage of awakening, non-return, but not the highest stage of arahantship, except in rare cases on the deathbed. The tradition extended this by saying that if a lay person becomes an arahant, they must ordain or die that day, but this is not supported in the early texts. The point is not whether you receive an ordination, but whether you let go of attachments.
dn16:2.7.13	Over fifty laymen in Ñātika have passed away having ended the five lower fetters. They’ve been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.	NA
dn16:2.7.14	More than ninety laymen in Ñātika have passed away having ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. They’re once-returners, who will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.	NA
dn16:2.7.15	More than five hundred laymen in Ñātika have passed away having ended three fetters. They’re stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.	The commentary to the Saṁyutta attributes the large number of deaths to a recent plague (_ahivātaroga_, “viper’s breath disease”). This deadly contagion was known to kill off entire families ([pli-tv-kd1:50.1.1]()). According to the commentaries, the same disease once afflicted Vesālī, prompting the teaching of the Ratanasutta ([snp2.1](), [kp6]()).
dn16:2.8.0	10. The Mirror of the Teaching	NA
dn16:2.8.1	It’s no wonder that a human being should pass away.	NA
dn16:2.8.2	But if you should come and ask me about it each and every time someone passes away, that would be a bother for me.	NA
dn16:2.8.3	So Ānanda, I will teach you the explanation of the Dhamma called ‘the mirror of the teaching’. A noble disciple who has this may declare of themselves:	Mirrors are for doing makeup ([dn1:1.16.2]()) or admiring oneself ([mn77:33.18]()), which a mendicant should not do ([pli-tv-kd15:2.4.1]()). In the Dhamma a mirror is for self-reflection ([mn61:8.2]()), while the mind is purified like polishing a mirror ([an3.70:13.4]()).
dn16:2.8.4	‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’	NA
dn16:2.9.1	And what is that mirror of the teaching?	The four principles that follow are elsewhere identified as four factors of stream-entry ([an9.27]()). At [sn12.41](), understanding of dependent origination is included.
dn16:2.9.3	It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha:	“Experiential” is _avecca_, literally “having undergone”. “Experiential confidence” is the faith of a stream-enterer, who has seen for themselves.
dn16:2.9.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	They have experiential confidence in the Buddha as a teacher because they have followed his path and realized the results that he speaks of.
dn16:2.9.5	They have experiential confidence in the teaching:	NA
dn16:2.9.6	‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’	A stream-enterer has direct experience of the four noble truths, so they have confirmed that the teaching is indeed realizable in this very life.
dn16:2.9.7	They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha:	NA
dn16:2.9.8	‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’	The suttas distinguish between two senses of Saṅgha. The “mendicant Saṅgha” (_bhikkhusaṅgha_) is the conventional community of monks and nuns. The “Saṅgha of disciples” (_sāvakasaṅgha_) is classified as fourfold according to the stages of awakening: stream-entry, once-return, non-return, and perfection. Each of these stages is further subdivided into those of the path who are practicing for realization and those of the fruit who have realized. These are referred to as “noble disciples”, four of the path and four of the fruit, making eight individuals in total.
dn16:2.9.9	And a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.	This entails keeping the five precepts at a minimum.
dn16:2.9.10	This is that mirror of the teaching.”	NA
dn16:2.10.1	And while staying there in Ñātika the Buddha often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicants:	NA
dn16:2.10.2	“Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom.	NA
dn16:2.10.3	When immersion is imbued with ethics it’s very fruitful and beneficial.	NA
dn16:2.10.4	When wisdom is imbued with immersion it’s very fruitful and beneficial.	NA
dn16:2.10.5	When the mind is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements, namely,	NA
dn16:2.10.6	the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.”	NA
dn16:2.11.1	When the Buddha had stayed in Ñātika as long as he pleased, he addressed Venerable Ānanda,	NA
dn16:2.11.2	“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Vesālī.”	NA
dn16:2.11.3	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
dn16:2.11.4	Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Vesālī,	NA
dn16:2.11.5	where he stayed in Ambapālī’s mango grove.	Ambapālī means “protector of mangoes”. Here the text just says she had a “grove”, but it is identified as a mango grove below ([dn16:2.14.1]()).
dn16:2.12.1	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:	NA
dn16:2.12.2	“Mendicants, a mendicant should live mindful and aware.	In some versions, the Buddha is said to have taught the monks mindfulness in anticipation of the arrival of the beautiful courtesan.
dn16:2.12.3	This is my instruction to you.	NA
dn16:2.12.4	And how is a mendicant mindful?	In the Gradual Training the mendicant “establishes mindfulness” to begin meditation. Here this practice is expanded, and in [dn22]() it is expanded even further.
dn16:2.12.5	It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	The locative idiom _kāye kāyānupassī_ indicates that the meditator focuses on a particular aspect of body contemplation, such as observing the breath, awareness of the body parts, or reflection on the four elements. | “Rid of desire and aversion for the world” refers to clearing the mind through the previous practice of sense restraint.
dn16:2.12.6	They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …	NA
dn16:2.12.7	mind …	NA
dn16:2.12.8	principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	_Dhammā_ here refers to the “principles” of cause and effect and the four noble truths which are understood by reflecting on the psychology of meditation itself. In this context _dhammā_ does not mean “mental objects” or “phenomena” or “mental qualities”.
dn16:2.12.9	That’s how a mendicant is mindful.	NA
dn16:2.13.1	And how is a mendicant aware?	NA
dn16:2.13.2	It’s when a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.	NA
dn16:2.13.3	That’s how a mendicant is aware.	NA
dn16:2.13.4	A mendicant should live mindful and aware.	NA
dn16:2.13.5	This is my instruction to you.”	NA
dn16:2.14.0	11. Ambapālī the Courtesan	NA
dn16:2.14.1	Ambapālī the courtesan heard that the Buddha had arrived and was staying in her mango grove.	A _gaṇikā_ was a trained entertainer and escort whose company commanded a high fee ([pli-tv-kd8:1.1.7]()). It was a respected position, as we see the city guild of Rājagaha, with King Bimbisāra’s blessing, appoint the young woman Sālavatī in a similar position ([pli-tv-kd8:1.2.13]()).
dn16:2.14.2	She had the finest carriages harnessed. Then she mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out from Vesālī for her own park.	NA
dn16:2.14.3	She went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the Buddha on foot. She bowed and sat down to one side.	NA
dn16:2.14.4	The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired her with a Dhamma talk.	NA
dn16:2.14.5	Then she said to the Buddha,	NA
dn16:2.14.6	“Sir, may the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me.”	NA
dn16:2.14.7	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
dn16:2.14.8	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Ambapālī got up from her seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on her right, before leaving.	NA
dn16:2.15.1	The Licchavis of Vesālī also heard that the Buddha had arrived and was staying in Ambapālī’s mango grove.	NA
dn16:2.15.2	They had the finest carriages harnessed. Then they mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out from Vesālī.	NA
dn16:2.15.3	Some of the Licchavis were in blue, of blue color, clad in blue, adorned with blue. And some were similarly colored in yellow, red, or white.	The text spends more time on the Vajjis’ appearance than on Ambapālī’s. At [thig15.1:12.1]() the nun Isidāsī recalls how she used to do the makeup for her husband every day, like his own personal beautician.
dn16:2.16.1	Then Ambapālī the courtesan collided with those Licchavi youths, axle to axle, wheel to wheel, yoke to yoke.	There are various reading for _paṭivaṭṭesi_. The commentary glosses with _pahari_ (“struck, collided”).
dn16:2.16.2	The Licchavis said to her,	NA
dn16:2.16.3	“What, you wench Ambapālī, are you doing colliding with us axle to axle, wheel to wheel, yoke to yoke?”	The derogatory indeclinable vocative _je_ is otherwise used of the “naughty maid” Kāḷī at [mn21:9.13](). “Wench” is a term meant to insult on the basis of servitude or promiscuity, so it seems appropriate. The Licchavis are not distinguishing themselves here; given their youth, wealth, licentiousness, and evident familiarity with Ambapālī, it seems safe to conclude that they had been her clients.
dn16:2.16.4	“Well, masters, it’s because I’ve invited the Buddha for tomorrow’s meal together with the mendicant Saṅgha.”	NA
dn16:2.16.5	“Wench, give us that meal for a hundred thousand!”	NA
dn16:2.16.6	“Masters, even if you were to give me Vesālī with her provinces, I still wouldn’t give that meal to you.”	_Dassatha_ is second future plural of _dadāti_. The Vinaya parallel at [pli-tv-kd6:30.4.5]() uses optative forms instead. | “With provinces” is _sāhāraṁ_ (literally “with food”, commentary: _sajanapadaṁ_) refers to the holdings around the city that supplied food and other necessities.
dn16:2.16.7	Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers, saying,	NA
dn16:2.16.8	“We’ve been beaten by the aunty! We’ve been beaten by the aunty!”	Despite the context, _ambakā_ has no etymological relation to _amba_ (“mango”) but is a term for “woman, mother”, used here as a play on words.
dn16:2.16.9	Then they continued on to Ambapālī’s mango grove.	NA
dn16:2.17.1	The Buddha saw them coming off in the distance,	NA
dn16:2.17.2	and addressed the mendicants:	NA
dn16:2.17.3	“Any of the mendicants who’ve never seen the gods of the thirty-three, just have a look at the assembly of Licchavis.	NA
dn16:2.17.4	See the assembly of Licchavis,	NA
dn16:2.17.5	check them out:	NA
dn16:2.17.6	they’re just like the thirty-three!”	NA
dn16:2.18.1	The Licchavis went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the Buddha on foot. They bowed to the Buddha, sat down to one side,	NA
dn16:2.18.2	and the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk.	NA
dn16:2.18.3	Then they said to the Buddha,	NA
dn16:2.18.4	“Sir, may the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from us.”	NA
dn16:2.18.5	Then the Buddha said to the Licchavis,	NA
dn16:2.18.6	“I have already accepted tomorrow’s meal from Ambapālī the courtesan.”	NA
dn16:2.18.7	Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers, saying,	NA
dn16:2.18.8	“We’ve been beaten by the aunty! We’ve been beaten by the aunty!”	NA
dn16:2.18.9	And then those Licchavis approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving.	NA
dn16:2.19.1	And when the night had passed Ambapālī had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in her own park. Then she had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	NA
dn16:2.19.2	“Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.”	NA
dn16:2.19.3	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Ambapālī together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out.	NA
dn16:2.19.4	Then Ambapālī served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with her own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	NA
dn16:2.19.5	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hands and bowl, Ambapālī took a low seat, sat to one side,	NA
dn16:2.19.6	and said to the Buddha,	NA
dn16:2.19.7	“Sir, I present this park to the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha.”	This demonstrates that a woman of Ambapālī’s profession could own land and control significant resources.
dn16:2.19.8	The Buddha accepted the park.	An _ārāma_ is a tended and pleasant ground, a “park”. Here it has previously been referred to as “grove” (_vana_) and “mango grove”. Usually in the suttas, however, it is a name for a place where monastics live. In English, monastics don’t live in parks, they live in monasteries. So once a place has been dedicated for the Saṅgha, I translate _ārāma_ as “monastery”.
dn16:2.19.9	Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired her with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.	NA
dn16:2.20.1	And while staying at Vesālī, too, the Buddha often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicants:	NA
dn16:2.20.2	“Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom.	NA
dn16:2.20.3	When immersion is imbued with ethics it’s very fruitful and beneficial.	NA
dn16:2.20.4	When wisdom is imbued with immersion it’s very fruitful and beneficial.	NA
dn16:2.20.5	When the mind is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements, namely,	NA
dn16:2.20.6	the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.”	NA
dn16:2.21.0	12. Commencing the Rains at Beluva	NA
dn16:2.21.1	When the Buddha had stayed in Ambapālī’s mango grove as long as he pleased, he addressed Venerable Ānanda,	NA
dn16:2.21.2	“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the little village of Beluva.”	Pali texts waver between _beluva_ (“wood-apple”) and _veḷuva_ (from _veḷuvant_, “full of bamboo”).
dn16:2.21.3	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
dn16:2.21.4	Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at the little village of Beluva,	NA
dn16:2.21.5	and stayed there.	NA
dn16:2.22.1	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:	NA
dn16:2.22.2	“Mendicants, please enter the rainy season residence with whatever friends or acquaintances you have around Vesālī.	The Buddha was travelling with a large retinue, which could become burdensome on a small village if they were to stay the three months of the rains residence. The texts note several monasteries and places to stay around Vesālī.
dn16:2.22.3	I’ll commence the rainy season residence right here in the little village of Beluva.”	NA
dn16:2.22.4	“Yes, sir,” those mendicants replied. They did as the Buddha said,	NA
dn16:2.22.5	while the Buddha commenced the rainy season residence right there in the little village of Beluva.	NA
dn16:2.23.1	After the Buddha had commenced the rainy season residence, he fell severely ill, struck by dreadful pains, close to death.	NA
dn16:2.23.2	But he endured unbothered, with mindfulness and situational awareness.	NA
dn16:2.23.3	Then it occurred to the Buddha,	NA
dn16:2.23.4	“It would not be appropriate for me to be fully extinguished before informing my supporters and taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha.	Here _upaṭṭhāka_ refers to the lay devotees. | _Apaloketi_ (“take leave”) also has a literal sense of “glance back”; both senses are found in the sutta (see [dn16:4.1.2]()).
dn16:2.23.5	Why don’t I forcefully suppress this illness, stabilize the life force, and live on?”	“Life force” is _jīvitasaṅkhāra_ whereas below we find _āyusaṅkhāra_ ([dn16:3.10.1]()). They are evidently synonyms; [ps1.6:4.3]() refers to the three _jīvitasaṅkhāras_ from [mn43:24.2](), but there the text has _āyusaṅkhāra_. _Saṅkhāra_ could be interpreted here either as “volition” (“will to live”) or as “life force” (i.e. the vital energy that sustains life). Elsewhere, however, _āyusaṅkhāra_ clearly means “life force” ([sn20.6:3.2](), [mn43:23.1]()).
dn16:2.24.1	So that is what he did.	NA
dn16:2.24.2	Then the Buddha’s illness died down.	NA
dn16:2.24.3	Soon after the Buddha had recovered from that sickness, he came out from his dwelling and sat in the shade of the porch on the seat spread out.	NA
dn16:2.24.4	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
dn16:2.24.5	“Sir, it’s fantastic that the Buddha is comfortable and well. Because when the Buddha was sick, my body felt like it was drugged. I was disorientated, and the teachings weren’t clear to me.	This is the first indication of Ānanda’s fragile emotional state in the days to come. | Read _diṭṭhā_ (= Sanskrit _diṣṭyā_), “fantastic, how fortunate”, per [dn26:21.9]() and [ja81:1.4]().
dn16:2.24.6	Still, at least I was consoled by the thought that	NA
dn16:2.24.7	the Buddha won’t be fully extinguished without bringing something up regarding the Saṅgha of mendicants.”	Previously the Buddha had spoken of “taking leave” of the Saṅgha, but here something more specific is meant. _Udāharati_ is typically used when a previously-mentioned matter (often unpleasant) is “brought up”, as at the monastic procedures for confession or invitation to admonish ([pli-tv-kd1:16.2.5](), [pli-tv-kd1:2.1.9]()). Ānanda is implying that there is some unfinished disciplinary business that needs attention. Despite the Buddha’s response, he did in fact go on to make a number of statements and rulings.
dn16:2.25.1	“But what could the mendicant Saṅgha expect from me, Ānanda?	For forty-five years he had been teaching and supporting the community.
dn16:2.25.2	I’ve taught the Dhamma without making any distinction between secret and public teachings.	A principle not followed by some contemporary Buddhist schools that harbor “secret teachings”.
dn16:2.25.3	The Realized One doesn’t have the closed fist of a tutor when it comes to the teachings.	“Closed fist of a teacher” is _ācariyamuṭṭhi_.
dn16:2.25.4	If there’s anyone who thinks:	NA
dn16:2.25.5	‘I shall lead the mendicant Saṅgha,’ or ‘the Saṅgha of mendicants is meant for me,’ let them bring something up regarding the Saṅgha.	NA
dn16:2.25.6	But the Realized One doesn’t think like this,	NA
dn16:2.25.8	so why should he bring something up regarding the Saṅgha?	_Pariharissāmi_ needs careful parsing with regard to tenses. The general meaning is to “carry about” or “maintain, nurture”. The Buddha elsewhere said that he “leads” the Saṅgha ([dn26:25.6](): _pariharāmi_). When the Buddha was about to go on retreat, Moggallāna said that he and Sāriputta “shall lead” (_pariharissāmi_), to which the Buddha said they “should lead” ([mn67:13.7](): _parihareyyaṁ_). Devadatta, on the other hand, ensured his downfall when he determined that he “shall lead” the Saṅgha, having taken over from the Buddha ([an5.100:2.3](), [pli-tv-kd1:2.1.23]()). Thus the future tense indicates the determination to lead. But at this point, the Buddha’s mind is already set on letting go. He is not saying that no-one should lead the Saṅgha, but that it is up to whoever leads it to address the issues.
dn16:2.25.9	I’m now old, elderly and senior. I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life.	NA
dn16:2.25.10	I’m currently eighty years old.	NA
dn16:2.25.11	Just as a decrepit old cart is kept going by a rope,	The reading and derivation of _veṭhamissakena_ are unclear. As a form of violence we find _veṭhamissena_ at [thag2.12:1.1](), notably also in instrumental. _Veṭha_ means “twist, strap, turban”. _Missa_ means “mixed” or “plaited” ([pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:2.1.21]()). Thus it probably refers to a kind of strong twisted material used to tie or bind, i.e. rope.
dn16:2.25.12	in the same way, the Realized One’s body is kept going as if by a rope.	Compare Rig Veda 8.48.5: “As leather binds a chariot, soma knits my joints together.” Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.35 compares the labored breathing of one near death with the creaking of a heavily-laden cart. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13.2.7.8 says a handsome cart is well-finished with ropes. Indian carts were bound with ropes down to modern times.
dn16:2.25.13	Sometimes the Realized One, not focusing on any signs, and with the cessation of certain feelings, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart. Only then does the Realized One’s body become more comfortable.	The suttas say little about this signless (_animitta_) meditation. Its defining characteristic is that consciousness does not “follow after signs” (_nimittānusāri viññāṇaṁ_, eg. [an6.13:5.3]()). This is explained in [mn138:10.2]() as not being distracted or affected by the features of sense impressions, as the “signs” are created by greed, hate, and delusion ([mn43:37.1]()). The mental unification (_ekattaṁ_)  based on this practice is listed after the form (and formless) _jhānas_, so it is very advanced. It is nonetheless a conditioned state ([mn121:11.4]()), so it is possible that a mendicant might fall from it and disrobe ([an6.60:8.10]()). However it may also be used to describe the meditation of an arahant ([sn41.7:6.12]()). It is clear from [mn121:10.5]() that the six senses are still functioning, unlike in deep serenity meditations. It seems that in such a state, the Buddha was able to function normally while seeing through the pain in his body.
dn16:2.26.1	So Ānanda, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge.	This central theme of the Buddha’s teaching—that each of us is responsible for our own salvation—becomes even more important as the Buddha’s days grow short.
dn16:2.26.2	And how does a mendicant do this?	NA
dn16:2.26.3	It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
dn16:2.26.4	They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …	NA
dn16:2.26.5	mind …	NA
dn16:2.26.6	principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
dn16:2.26.7	That’s how a mendicant is their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how the teaching is their island and their refuge, with no other refuge.	NA
dn16:2.26.8	Whether now or after I have passed, any who shall live as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the teaching as their island and their refuge, with no other refuge—those mendicants of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the best.”	Read _tama(t)agge_ with _tama_ as superlative, literally “at the peak of the best”.
dn16:2.26.9	The second recitation section.	NA
dn16:3.1.0	13. An Obvious Hint	NA
dn16:3.1.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.	NA
dn16:3.1.2	Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Ānanda:	NA
dn16:3.1.3	“Ānanda, get your sitting cloth.	This detail is often mentioned in texts of the Sarvāstivāda school, but rarely in Pali.
dn16:3.1.4	Let’s go to the Cāpāla Shrine for the day’s meditation.”	NA
dn16:3.1.5	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha.	NA
dn16:3.2.1	Then the Buddha went up to the Cāpāla Shrine, where he sat on the seat spread out.	NA
dn16:3.2.2	Ānanda bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.	NA
dn16:3.2.3	The Buddha said to him:	NA
dn16:3.2.4	“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Seven Maidens, Many Sons, Sārandada, and Cāpāla Tree-shrines are all lovely.	NA
dn16:3.3.1	Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.	Normally _kappa_ as a period of time means “eon”, but the late canonical texts Kathāvatthu ([Kv 11.5](https://suttacentral.net/kv11.5)) and Milindapañha ([Mil 5.1.10](https://suttacentral.net/mil5.1.10)) argue that it means the “lifespan”, an interpretation followed by the commentaries. Support for this comes from [dn26:28.3](), which says that “long life” for a mendicant is the four bases of psychic power which enable you to remain for the _kappa_. Here it is surely talking about a full lifespan. Underlying this is the idea that in different epochs the “proper lifespan” varies; in the Buddha’s day it was one hundred years ([dn14:1.7.7]()). We can resolve the problem if we read _kappa_ here, not as a period of time, but as “proper, fitting”, i.e. the “proper” lifespan of a hundred years.
dn16:3.3.2	The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.”	NA
dn16:3.4.1	But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign.	NA
dn16:3.4.2	He didn’t beg the Buddha:	NA
dn16:3.4.3	“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the proper lifespan! May the Holy One please remain for the proper lifespan! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra.	Here Ānanda’s mind is “as if” possessed (_yathā_), but in the Vinaya _yathā_ is missing: he is possessed ([pli-tv-kd1:1.10.17]()). Remember, Ānanda is telling this story about himself.
dn16:3.5.1	For a second time …	NA
dn16:3.5.2	And for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda:	NA
dn16:3.5.3	“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Seven Maidens, Many Sons, Sārandada, and Cāpāla Tree-shrines are all lovely.	NA
dn16:3.5.4	Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.	NA
dn16:3.5.5	The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.”	NA
dn16:3.5.6	But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign.	NA
dn16:3.5.7	He didn’t beg the Buddha:	NA
dn16:3.5.8	“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the proper lifespan! May the Holy One please remain for the proper lifespan! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra.	NA
dn16:3.6.1	Then the Buddha got up and said to Venerable Ānanda,	NA
dn16:3.6.2	“Go now, Ānanda,	NA
dn16:3.6.3	at your convenience.”	NA
dn16:3.6.4	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He rose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before sitting at the root of a tree close by.	NA
dn16:3.7.0	14. The Appeal of Māra	NA
dn16:3.7.1	And then, not long after Ānanda had left, Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha, stood to one side, and said to him:	Māra is the Buddhist deity of death, sex, and delusion; his aim is to trap beings in transmigration. He appears in many guises, both real and metaphorical, throughout the canon, but this sequence is his only direct appearance in the Dīghanikāya. Here he feigns compassion, urging the Buddha to find his final peace; but he has an ulterior motive, for with the Buddha’s passing Māra’s job will be much easier.
dn16:3.7.2	“Sir, may the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One now be fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment of the Buddha.	_Parinibbāna_ means “extinguishment”, as of a flame. Here it appears as both noun (“extinguishment”) and verb (“become extinguished”). It is not a particularly difficult term to translate. Linguistically it has nothing to do with “attachment”, so renderings such as “unbinding” are untenable. It should be translated rather than just keeping “Nibbāna”, not least because English resists verbifying adopted words, resulting in such constructions as “enter Nibbāna”, which reifies it in a way that the Pali does not.
dn16:3.7.3	Sir, you once made this statement:	NA
dn16:3.7.4	‘Wicked One, I shall not be fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and practice in line with the teachings. Not until they practice properly, living in line with the teaching. Not until they’ve learned their tradition, and explain, teach, assert, establish, disclose, analyze, and make it clear. Not until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis.’	Māra is citing the Buddha’s words for his own purpose. The Pali tradition does not say when this encounter took place, but the Sanskrit Sarvāstivāda Catuṣparisatsūtra places it shortly after the Buddha’s awakening.
dn16:3.8.1	Today you do have such monk disciples.	NA
dn16:3.8.2	May the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One now be fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment of the Buddha.	NA
dn16:3.8.3	Sir, you once made this statement:	NA
dn16:3.8.4	‘Wicked One, I shall not be fully extinguished until I have nun disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’	This passage makes it clear that it was the Buddha’s intention from the beginning to establish an order of nuns (_bhikkhunī_).
dn16:3.8.5	Today you do have such nun disciples.	NA
dn16:3.8.6	May the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One now be fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment of the Buddha.	NA
dn16:3.8.7	Sir, you once made this statement:	NA
dn16:3.8.8	‘Wicked One, I shall not be fully extinguished until I have layman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’	NA
dn16:3.8.9	Today you do have such layman disciples.	NA
dn16:3.8.10	May the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One now be fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment of the Buddha.	NA
dn16:3.8.11	Sir, you once made this statement:	NA
dn16:3.8.12	‘Wicked One, I shall not be fully extinguished until I have laywoman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’	NA
dn16:3.8.13	Today you do have such laywoman disciples.	NA
dn16:3.8.14	May the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One now be fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment of the Buddha.	NA
dn16:3.8.15	Sir, you once made this statement:	NA
dn16:3.8.16	‘Wicked One, I will not be fully extinguished until my spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.’	NA
dn16:3.8.17	Today your spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.	NA
dn16:3.8.18	May the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One now be fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment of the Buddha.”	NA
dn16:3.9.1	When this was said, the Buddha said to Māra,	NA
dn16:3.9.2	“Relax, Wicked One. The full extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon.	This passage is the narrative inverse of the occasion when Brahmā begged the Buddha to teach ([sn6.1:5.5](), etc.). Throughout, the sutta artfully preserves a degree of narrative ambiguity. Here it almost appears as if the Buddha assents to passing away because of Māra’s request, although his intent was clear earlier. Māra’s reasoning, moreover, is based on the Buddha’s own words.
dn16:3.9.3	Three months from now the Realized One will be fully extinguished.”	It seems that at this point, the Buddha is still spending the rains in Beluva village, from where he would sometimes go to nearby Vesālī for alms, or to a local shrine for meditation. He left Vesālī only after holding a meeting for all the Saṅgha, which probably signified the completion of the rains ([dn16:4.1.2]()). If this reasoning is correct—and the text is not explicit—then he made this statement during the rains retreat. If, however, this reasoning is incorrect and we are already after the rains, it could not have been long after. Thus it is probably September/October, meaning that the final extinguishment was to take place in December/January. This conflicts with the tradition of ascribing his final extinguishment to the full moon of Vesak, in May.
dn16:3.10.0	15. Surrendering the Life Force	NA
dn16:3.10.1	So at the Cāpāla Shrine the Buddha, mindful and aware, surrendered the life force.	The Cāpāla shrine is unknown outside of this context. The Udāna commentary says that it was named after the _yakkha_ who formerly lived there. Now, _cāpalla_ means “fickleness, propensity to tremble” and is from the same root as earth-“quake” (_bhumicāla_; _capala_ = _pacala_ via metathesis). It is no great leap to _cāpāla_. If this is correct, it suggests that the shrine was dedicated to an earth spirit who commanded earthquakes; a fitting setting for the events to follow.
dn16:3.10.2	When he did so there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky.	Northern India lies in the shadow of the seismically active Alpide Belt, so the occurrence of earthquakes is realistic even if the causes are not scientific.
dn16:3.10.3	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
dn16:3.10.4	“Comparing the incomparable <j>with the creation of prolonged life,	For this difficult verse, I generally follow Bhikkhu Bodhi’s long discussion in *Connected Discourses of the Buddha*, note 255 on the Mahāvagga. | _Sambhava_ means “production, creation”, and here I think it refers to the prolonging of life which the Buddha had just rejected.
dn16:3.10.5	the sage surrendered the life force.	_Bhavasaṅkhāra_ (“life force”) here is equivalent to _āyusaṅkhāra_ and _jīvitasaṅkhāra_.
dn16:3.10.6	Happy inside, serene,	NA
dn16:3.10.7	he shattered self-creation like a suit of armor.”	_Attasambhava_ (“self-creation”) refers back to _sambhava_ in the first line.
dn16:3.11.0	16. The Causes of Earthquakes	NA
dn16:3.11.1	Then Venerable Ānanda thought,	NA
dn16:3.11.2	“How incredible, how amazing! That was a really big earthquake!	NA
dn16:3.11.3	That was really a very big earthquake; awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky!	NA
dn16:3.11.4	What’s the cause, what’s the reason for a great earthquake?”	NA
dn16:3.12.1	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha,	NA
dn16:3.12.2	bowed, sat down to one side,	NA
dn16:3.12.3	and said to him,	NA
dn16:3.12.4	“How incredible, sir, how amazing!	NA
dn16:3.12.5	That was a really big earthquake!	NA
dn16:3.12.6	That was really a very big earthquake; awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky!	NA
dn16:3.12.7	What’s the cause, what’s the reason for a great earthquake?”	NA
dn16:3.13.1	“Ānanda, there are these eight causes and reasons for a great earthquake.	NA
dn16:3.13.2	What eight?	NA
dn16:3.13.3	This great earth is grounded on water, the water is grounded on air, and the air stands in space. At a time when a great wind blows, it stirs the water, and the water stirs the earth.	So far as it goes, this is a naturalistic explanation. The “water element” has the quality of softening, while the “air element” is traditionally understood as “movement”. Thus in modern terms this means, “When underground forces disturb a region of instability.”
dn16:3.13.4	This is the first cause and reason for a great earthquake.	NA
dn16:3.14.1	Furthermore, there is an ascetic or brahmin with psychic power who has achieved mastery of the mind, or a god who is mighty and powerful. They’ve developed a limited perception of earth and a limitless perception of water. They make the earth shake and rock and tremble.	The might of ascetics was legendary in ancient India (eg. [mn56:14.2]()). The meditation described here might be compared with the “dimensions of mastery” below ([dn16:3.25.1]()).
dn16:3.14.2	This is the second cause and reason for a great earthquake.	NA
dn16:3.15.1	Furthermore, when the being intent on awakening passes away from the host of joyful gods, he’s conceived in his mother’s belly, mindful and aware. Then the earth shakes and rocks and trembles.	At [dn14:1.17.7]() and [mn123:7.6]() it is, rather, the entire galaxy that trembles, perhaps indicating that the enhanced miracle is a later development.
dn16:3.15.2	This is the third cause and reason for a great earthquake.	NA
dn16:3.16.1	Furthermore, when the being intent on awakening comes out of his mother’s belly mindful and aware, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles.	NA
dn16:3.16.2	This is the fourth cause and reason for a great earthquake.	NA
dn16:3.17.1	Furthermore, when the Realized One realizes the supreme perfect awakening, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles.	There are many accounts of the Buddha’s awakening in the suttas, but none, so far as I know, that mention an earthquake.
dn16:3.17.2	This is the fifth cause and reason for a great earthquake.	NA
dn16:3.18.1	Furthermore, when the Realized One rolls forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles.	See [sn56.11:13.2]().
dn16:3.18.2	This is the sixth cause and reason for a great earthquake.	NA
dn16:3.19.1	Furthermore, when the Realized One, mindful and aware, surrenders the life force, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles.	NA
dn16:3.19.2	This is the seventh cause and reason for a great earthquake.	NA
dn16:3.20.1	Furthermore, when the Realized One becomes fully extinguished in the element of extinguishment with no residue, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles.	This refers to the Buddha’s death. The Pali here uses both _nibbāna_ and _parinibbāna_. Sometimes it is said that _nibbāna_ is the attainment of arahantship, while _parinibbāna_ is the death of an arahant, but this distinction is not consistently applied in the suttas. | Regarding _nibbānadhātuyā_ (“the element of extinguishment”), in Pali the case is ambiguous. It is sometimes translated “by means of” or “through”, which assumes the instrumental; but the Sanskrit is _nirvāṇadhātau_, which must be locative.
dn16:3.20.2	This is the eighth cause and reason for a great earthquake.	NA
dn16:3.20.3	These are the eight causes and reasons for a great earthquake.	NA
dn16:3.21.0	17. Eight Assemblies	NA
dn16:3.21.1	There are, Ānanda, these eight assemblies.	As at [an8.69](). The following series of “eight things” seems arbitrarily inserted here and breaks the flow of the narrative. They are absent from the Sanskrit Sarvāstivāda text edited by Waldschmidt, which goes directly to the conversation where Ānanda realizes that the Buddha is going to die.
dn16:3.21.2	What eight?	NA
dn16:3.21.3	The assemblies of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics. An assembly of the gods of the four great kings. An assembly of the gods of the thirty-three. An assembly of Māras. An assembly of divinities.	These “assemblies” were formal deliberative meetings, not just gatherings. Thus “householders” here does not mean “lay folk” in apposition to “ascetics”; rather it means “home owners”. Some of these assemblies are depicted or alluded to in the Dīghanikāya. At [dn6:1.3](), brahmins assemble in Vesālī; while at [dn3:1.13.3](), Ambaṭṭha speaks of an assembly of Sakyans, who were aristocrats. At [dn18:12.1](), we get a glimpse of the proceedings at a meeting of the gods of the thirty-three.
dn16:3.22.1	I recall having approached an assembly of hundreds of aristocrats.	NA
dn16:3.22.2	There I used to sit with them, converse, and engage in discussion.	NA
dn16:3.22.3	And my appearance and voice became just like theirs.	NA
dn16:3.22.4	I educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk.	NA
dn16:3.22.5	But when I spoke they didn’t know:	NA
dn16:3.22.6	‘Who is this that speaks? Is it a god or a human?’	NA
dn16:3.22.7	And when my Dhamma talk was finished I vanished.	NA
dn16:3.22.8	But when I vanished they didn’t know:	NA
dn16:3.22.9	‘Who was that who vanished? Was it a god or a human?’	There do not appear to be any records of this happening in the early texts, although  that is perhaps to be expected. It does feel out of character for the Buddha, as normally he is very up front. The commentary says that this ruse was adopted so the Buddha could plant subtle seeds (_vāsanā_) for the future.

dn16:3.23.17	These are the eight assemblies.	NA
dn16:3.24.0	18. Eight Dimensions of Mastery	NA
dn16:3.24.1	Ānanda, there are these eight dimensions of mastery.	These are another way of describing the different experiences of _jhāna_. Also at [an8.65](), [an10.29:6.1](), [dn33:3.1.142](), [dn34:2.1.160](), and [mn77:23.1]().
dn16:3.24.2	What eight?	NA
dn16:3.25.1	Perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally, limited, both pretty and ugly.	“Perceiving form (_rūpa_) internally” refers to someone developing meditation based on an aspect of their own body, such as the breath or the parts of the body. The “forms” (_rūpā_) seen externally are the lights or other meditation phenomena that today are usually called _nimitta_. An “ugly” form is the mental image that arises in such contemplations as the parts of the body. A “beautiful” image arises from practices such as mindfulness of breathing.
dn16:3.25.2	Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’	NA
dn16:3.25.3	This is the first dimension of mastery.	NA
dn16:3.26.1	Perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally, limitless, both pretty and ugly.	NA
dn16:3.26.2	Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’	NA
dn16:3.26.3	This is the second dimension of mastery.	NA
dn16:3.27.1	Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally, limited, both pretty and ugly.	“Not perceiving form internally” refers to meditations such as the external elements, or the decaying of another’s body.
dn16:3.27.2	Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’	NA
dn16:3.27.3	This is the third dimension of mastery.	NA
dn16:3.28.1	Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally, limitless, both pretty and ugly.	NA
dn16:3.28.2	Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’	NA
dn16:3.28.3	This is the fourth dimension of mastery.	NA
dn16:3.29.1	Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally that are blue, with blue color and blue appearance.	This is the meditation where one contemplates an external color, either a prepared disk or a natural phenomena such as the sky or a flower, which eventually gives rise to a “counterpart” image. Today such meditations are called _kasiṇa_ following the Visuddhimagga, but in the early texts _kasiṇa_ means “totality” and refers rather to the state of _samādhi_ that results.
dn16:3.29.2	They’re like a flax flower that’s blue, with blue color and blue appearance. Or a cloth from Varanasi that’s smoothed on both sides, blue, with blue color and blue appearance.	NA
dn16:3.29.3	In the same way, not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally, blue, with blue color and blue appearance.	NA
dn16:3.29.4	Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’	NA
dn16:3.29.5	This is the fifth dimension of mastery.	NA
dn16:3.30.1	Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally that are yellow, with yellow color and yellow appearance.	NA
dn16:3.30.2	They’re like a champak flower that’s yellow, with yellow color and yellow appearance. Or a cloth from Varanasi that’s smoothed on both sides, yellow, with yellow color and yellow appearance.	NA
dn16:3.30.3	In the same way, not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally that are yellow, with yellow color and yellow appearance.	NA
dn16:3.30.4	Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’	NA
dn16:3.30.5	This is the sixth dimension of mastery.	NA
dn16:3.31.1	Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally that are red, with red color and red appearance.	NA
dn16:3.31.2	They’re like a scarlet mallow flower that’s red, with red color and red appearance. Or a cloth from Varanasi that’s smoothed on both sides, red, with red color and red appearance.	NA
dn16:3.31.3	In the same way, not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally that are red, with red color and red appearance.	NA
dn16:3.31.4	Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’	NA
dn16:3.31.5	This is the seventh dimension of mastery.	NA
dn16:3.32.1	Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally that are white, with white color and white appearance.	NA
dn16:3.32.2	They’re like the morning star that’s white, with white color and white appearance. Or a cloth from Varanasi that’s smoothed on both sides, white, with white color and white appearance.	NA
dn16:3.32.3	In the same way, not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally that are white, with white color and white appearance.	NA
dn16:3.32.4	Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’	NA
dn16:3.32.5	This is the eighth dimension of mastery.	NA
dn16:3.32.6	These are the eight dimensions of mastery.	NA
dn16:3.33.0	19. The Eight Liberations	NA
dn16:3.33.1	Ānanda, there are these eight liberations.	Already encountered at [dn15:35.1]().
dn16:3.33.2	What eight?	NA
dn16:3.33.3	Having physical form, they see forms.	NA
dn16:3.33.4	This is the first liberation.	NA
dn16:3.33.5	Not perceiving form internally, they see forms externally.	NA
dn16:3.33.6	This is the second liberation.	NA
dn16:3.33.7	They’re focused only on beauty.	NA
dn16:3.33.8	This is the third liberation.	NA
dn16:3.33.9	Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space.	NA
dn16:3.33.10	This is the fourth liberation.	NA
dn16:3.33.11	Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness.	NA
dn16:3.33.12	This is the fifth liberation.	NA
dn16:3.33.13	Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness.	NA
dn16:3.33.14	This is the sixth liberation.	NA
dn16:3.33.15	Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	NA
dn16:3.33.16	This is the seventh liberation.	NA
dn16:3.33.17	Going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling.	NA
dn16:3.33.18	This is the eighth liberation.	NA
dn16:3.33.19	These are the eight liberations.	NA
dn16:3.34.1	Ānanda, this one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying in Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.	NA
dn16:3.34.2	Then Māra the wicked approached me, stood to one side, and said:	NA
dn16:3.34.3	‘Sir, may the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One now be fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment of the Buddha.’	NA
dn16:3.34.4	When he had spoken, I said to Māra:	NA
dn16:3.35.1	‘Wicked One, I shall not be fully extinguished until I have monk disciples …	NA
dn16:3.35.2	nun disciples …	NA
dn16:3.35.3	layman disciples …	NA
dn16:3.35.4	laywoman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned.	NA
dn16:3.35.5	I shall not be fully extinguished until my spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.’	NA
dn16:3.36.1	Today, just now at the Cāpāla Shrine Māra the Wicked approached me once more with the same request, reminding me of my former statement, and saying that those conditions had been fulfilled.	NA
dn16:3.37.1	When he had spoken, I said to Māra:	NA
dn16:3.37.2	‘Relax, Wicked One. The full extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon.	NA
dn16:3.37.3	Three months from now the Realized One will be fully extinguished.’	NA
dn16:3.37.4	So today, just now at the Cāpāla Shrine, mindful and aware, I surrendered the life force.”	NA
dn16:3.38.0	20. The Appeal of Ānanda	NA
dn16:3.38.1	When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,	NA
dn16:3.38.2	“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the proper lifespan! May the Holy One please remain for the proper lifespan! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.”	NA
dn16:3.38.3	“Enough now, Ānanda.	NA
dn16:3.38.4	Do not beg the Realized One. Now is not the time to beg the Realized One.”	NA
dn16:3.39.1	For a second time …	NA
dn16:3.39.2	For a third time, Ānanda said to the Buddha,	NA
dn16:3.39.3	“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the proper lifespan! May the Holy One please remain for the proper lifespan! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.”	NA
dn16:3.39.4	“Ānanda, do you have faith in the Realized One’s awakening?”	NA
dn16:3.39.5	“Yes, sir.”	NA
dn16:3.39.6	“Then why do you keep pressing me up to the third time?”	NA
dn16:3.40.1	“Sir, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:	Note that this is the idiom that Ānanda uses when directly quoting the Buddha.
dn16:3.40.2	‘Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.	NA
dn16:3.40.3	The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.’”	NA
dn16:3.40.4	“Do you have faith, Ānanda?”	NA
dn16:3.40.5	“Yes, sir.”	NA
dn16:3.40.6	“Therefore, Ānanda, the misdeed is yours alone, the mistake is yours alone. For even though the Realized One dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign, you didn’t beg me to remain for the proper lifespan, or what’s left of it.	“Misdeed” is _dukkaṭaṁ_. This term is familiar as the most minor class of offences in the Vinaya. Here we see an informal use of the term as something that has been wrongly done, rather than a legal violation. It is used in a similar way by Mahākassapa at the First Council, who accuses Ānanda of several misdeeds. As a legal term, _dukkaṭa_ is late; the category of offences is not found in the Vinayas of the Mahāsaṅghika group of schools, which use _vinayatikkrama_ for a similar idea.
dn16:3.40.8	If you had begged me, I would have refused you twice, but consented on the third time.	NA
dn16:3.40.9	Therefore, Ānanda, the misdeed is yours alone, the mistake is yours alone.	NA
dn16:3.41.1	Ānanda, this one time I was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.	The Buddha goes on to list multiple places where he hinted to Ānanda, but the only record of such a conversation is at the Cāpāla shrine.
dn16:3.41.2	There I said to you:	NA
dn16:3.41.3	‘Ānanda, Rājagaha is lovely, and so is the Vulture’s Peak.	NA
dn16:3.41.4	Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.	NA
dn16:3.41.5	The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.’	NA
dn16:3.41.6	But you didn’t get it, even though I dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. You didn’t beg me to remain for the proper lifespan, or what’s left of it.	NA
dn16:3.41.8	If you had begged me, I would have refused you twice, but consented on the third time.	NA
dn16:3.41.9	Therefore, Ānanda, the misdeed is yours alone, the mistake is yours alone.	NA
dn16:3.42.1	Ānanda, this one time I was staying right there near Rājagaha, at the Gotama banyan tree …	The following group of places are all near Rājagaha, and collectively illustrate the variety of dwellings and environs enjoyed by the mendicants practicing there. | The Gotama banyan tree-shrine is mentioned only here. Gotama is a common name, and this shrine does not appear to have any connection with the Buddha.
dn16:3.42.2	at Bandit’s Cliff …	A cliff from which bandits were tossed as a means of execution.
dn16:3.42.3	in the Sattapaṇṇi cave on the slopes of Vebhara …	The Pali tradition says the First Council was held near the entrance to this cave  (Dīpavaṁsa 4.19, Mahāvaṁsa 3.19, Samantapāsādikā Paṭhamamahāsaṅgītikathā). The Vinayas all agree that it was at Rājagaha, but traditions vary as to the exact location.
dn16:3.42.4	at the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili …	A large open area where Jains did their penances ([mn14:15.2]()) and the Buddha taught occasionally ([sn8.10]()), but it is most famous as the place the monks Godhika ([sn4.23]()) and Vakkali took their lives ([sn22.87]()).
dn16:3.42.5	in the Cool Grove, under the Snake’s Hood Grotto …	Mentioned several times in the suttas as a pleasant place to meditate, it is notable as the site of the conversion of the Buddha’s chief layman disciple Anāthapiṇḍika ([sn10.8]()). But the most famous event there was when the Buddha moderated the monk Soṇa’s excessive striving ([an6.55]()).
dn16:3.42.6	in the Hot Springs Monastery …	The hot springs near Rājagaha were a popular place for monks to bathe, so much so that they prompted a rule ensuring that the monks did not monopolize the springs ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57]()). They are still in use and just as popular as ever.
dn16:3.42.7	in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground …	A personal gift of King Bimbisāra, this was the first permanent monastery offered to the Buddha and his Saṅgha ([pli-tv-kd1:22.17.3]()).
dn16:3.42.8	in Jīvaka’s mango grove …	NA
dn16:3.42.9	in the Maddakucchi deer park …	Mahākappina stayed here ([pli-tv-kd1:5.3.1]()), and the Buddha rested there when his foot was first injured, apparently by Devadatta, before Jīvaka offered his mango grove ([sn1.38](), [sn4.13]()).
dn16:3.43.1	And in each place I said to you:	NA
dn16:3.43.2	‘Ānanda, Rājagaha is lovely, and so are all these places. …	NA
dn16:3.44.2	If he wished, the Realized One could live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.’	NA
dn16:3.44.3	But you didn’t get it, even though I dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. You didn’t beg me to remain for the proper lifespan, or what’s left of it.	NA
dn16:3.45.1	Ānanda, this one time I was staying right here near Vesālī, at the Udena Shrine …	The following group of places are all in the Vajjian country near Vesālī. Whereas the varied sites around Rājagaha reflect the rugged terrain there, at Vesālī all the sites are tree-shrines, as the surrounding land is flat. [dn24:1.11.5]() indicates where they lay relative to Vesālī; the Udena shrine was to the east, and the next three to the south, west, and north respectively. | _Udena_ is an epithet of the “arising” sun (Rig Veda 1.48.7), although here it may have the sense “prosperity”.
dn16:3.46.1	at the Gotamaka Shrine …	Named after the local _yakkha_, to whom offerings would have been made. It could get cold enough to snow, prompting the Buddha to lay down a rule permitting three robes ([pli-tv-kd1:13.2.1]()). A short but galaxy-shaking discourse was once taught there ([an3.125:0.3]()).
dn16:3.46.2	at the Seven Maidens Shrine …	The Pali has _amba_ (“mango”) and _ambaka_ (“maiden”) as variants. The commentary supports the latter, saying it was named for seven legendary princesses of Varanasi in the time of Buddha Kassapa, all of whom went on to become great disciples of our Buddha. I made this translation on the small island of Qimei off the south coast of Taiwan, where there is a shrine to the “seven maidens” who gave the island its name. Stories of “seven maidens” are widespread in myth and folklore all over the world, including Aboriginal Dreamtime stories. The archetype descends from the constellation known in English as Pleiades and in Sanskrit as Kṛttikā. Since there are six main visible stars in the cluster today, the stories often tell of how the youngest of the seven sisters was lost. In the Buddhist telling this is Visākhā, the only sister not to become an arahant in this life.
dn16:3.46.3	at the Many Sons Shrine …	This was, obviously, a fertility shrine.
dn16:3.46.4	at the Sārandada Shrine …	Previously mentioned as the place where the seven principles of non-decline were taught to the Licchavis. The meaning of Sārandada is obscure and variants profligate, but it might be derived from the Munda word _sara_, “funeral pyre”. The commentary says it was taken over from an old shrine to a _yakkha_ of that name.
dn16:3.47.1	and just now, today at the Cāpāla Shrine. There I said to you:	NA
dn16:3.47.2	‘Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Seven Maidens, Many Sons, Sārandada, and Cāpāla Tree-shrines are all lovely.	NA
dn16:3.47.3	Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.	NA
dn16:3.47.4	The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.’	NA
dn16:3.47.5	But you didn’t get it, even though I dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. You didn’t beg me to remain for the proper lifespan, or what’s left of it, saying:	NA
dn16:3.47.6	‘Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the proper lifespan! May the Holy One please remain for the proper lifespan! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.’	NA
dn16:3.47.7	If you had begged me, I would have refused you twice, but consented on the third time.	NA
dn16:3.47.8	Therefore, Ānanda, the misdeed is yours alone, the mistake is yours alone.	NA
dn16:3.48.1	Did I not prepare for this when I explained that	NA
dn16:3.48.2	we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved?	NA
dn16:3.48.3	How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out?	NA
dn16:3.48.4	The Realized One has discarded, eliminated, released, given up, relinquished, and surrendered the life force. He has categorically stated:	NA
dn16:3.48.5	‘The full extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon.	NA
dn16:3.48.6	Three months from now the Realized One will be fully extinguished.’	NA
dn16:3.48.7	It’s not possible for the Realized One, for the sake of life, to take back the life force once it has been given up like that.	“Take back” is _paccāvamissati_, which has several variants. It occurs in [ja69]() and [ja509](), where it is the opposite of _vamati_, to “expel, vomit”.
dn16:3.48.8	Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the Great Wood, the hall with the peaked roof.”	This was the major Saṅgha residence near Vesālī. The Great Wood, according to the commentary, stretched as far as the Himalayas. Later tradition says that a town should have three woods: a “great wood” for wilderness (_mahāvana_); a “prosperity wood” for resources (_sirivana_); and an “ascetic wood” for spiritual practice (_tapovana_).
dn16:3.48.9	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
dn16:3.49.1	So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the hall with the peaked roof, and said to him,	NA
dn16:3.49.2	“Go, Ānanda, gather all the mendicants staying in the vicinity of Vesālī together in the assembly hall.”	Compare the earlier request to gather all the mendicants around Rājagaha ([dn16:1.6.2]()).
dn16:3.49.3	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He did what the Buddha asked, went up to him, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	NA
dn16:3.49.4	“Sir, the mendicant Saṅgha has assembled. Please, sir, go at your convenience.”	NA
dn16:3.50.1	Then the Buddha went to the assembly hall, where he sat on the seat spread out	NA
dn16:3.50.2	and addressed the mendicants:	NA
dn16:3.50.3	“So, mendicants, having carefully memorized those things I have taught you from my direct knowledge, you should cultivate, develop, and make much of them so that this spiritual practice may last for a long time. That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.	Memorization was considered an essential basis for learning. In similar passages, we also find the injunction to “recite” the teachings, thus authorizing the recitation of the Buddha’s teachings after his death, which was later formalized in the Councils (_saṅgīti_).
dn16:3.50.4	And what are those things I have taught from my direct knowledge?	NA
dn16:3.50.5	They are: the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path.	These are the sets of practices later called the 37 _bodhiyapakkhiyā dhammā_, the “wings to awakening”. Here they are presented as an essential summary of the Buddha’s teachings. They form the backbone of the final book of the Saṁyuttanikāya, the Maggavagga (or Mahāvagga). It is likely that the Buddha was referring to the earliest recension of this text. They are found as a summary of the Buddha’s teachings at [dn29:17.3](), [mn103:3.2](), [mn104:5.3](), and [an8.19:17.2]() = [ud5.5:25.2]().
dn16:3.51.1	These are the things I have taught from my direct knowledge. Having carefully memorized them, you should cultivate, develop, and make much of them so that this spiritual practice may last for a long time. That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.”	NA
dn16:3.51.2	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:	NA
dn16:3.51.3	“Come now, mendicants, I say to you all:	NA
dn16:3.51.4	‘Conditions fall apart. Persist with diligence.’	This is perhaps the briefest summary possible of the Buddha’s teaching. The world as it is, and all the beings in it, are created and sustained through conditions. Since the conditions that sustain them are finite, the conditioned phenomena are also finite and must come to an end. Reflecting on this gives rise to gratitude for the life we have and the opportunities it grants us, and determination to live and practice dedicated to the realization of the unconditioned, Nibbana.

dn16:4.1.0	21. The Elephant Look	NA
dn16:4.1.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.	NA
dn16:4.1.2	Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he turned to gaze back at Vesālī, the way that elephants do. He said to Venerable Ānanda:	_Nāgāpalokitaṁ_ is the “elephant look”. There is a similar Sanskrit term _siṁhāvalokana_, the “lion look”, said to be the slow glance back that a lion makes as he leaves his kill. There is a nuance in meaning here, because while _apalokana_ literally means to “look back”, it is used in the sense to “take leave” before setting out on a journey.
dn16:4.1.3	“Ānanda, this will be the last time the Realized One sees Vesālī.	NA
dn16:4.1.4	Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Wares Village.”	_Bhaṇḍagāma_, where _bhaṇḍa_ means “wares”; it must have been a trading post. It seems the villages in this passage were named after their chief economic activity, so I translate them to highlight this pragmatic system.
dn16:4.1.5	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
dn16:4.2.1	Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Wares Village,	NA
dn16:4.2.2	and stayed there.	NA
dn16:4.2.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:	NA
dn16:4.2.4	“Mendicants, due to not understanding and not penetrating four things, both you and I have wandered and transmigrated for such a very long time.	NA
dn16:4.2.5	What four?	NA
dn16:4.2.6	Noble ethics,	This four also found at [an4.1:2.3]() and [an7.66:14.4]().

dn16:4.3.1	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
dn16:4.3.2	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	NA
dn16:4.3.3	“Ethics, immersion, and wisdom,	NA

dn16:4.4.1	And while staying there, too, he often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicants:	NA
dn16:4.4.2	“Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom.	NA
dn16:4.4.3	When immersion is imbued with ethics it’s very fruitful and beneficial.	NA
dn16:4.4.4	When wisdom is imbued with immersion it’s very fruitful and beneficial.	NA

dn16:4.4.6	the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.”	NA
dn16:4.5.0	22. The Four Great References	NA
dn16:4.5.1	When the Buddha had stayed in Wares Village as long as he pleased, he addressed Ānanda,	NA
dn16:4.5.2	“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Elephant Village.”…	_Hatthigāma_, probably a village which specialized in training elephants.
dn16:4.5.3	“Let’s go to Mango Village.”…	_Ambagāma_.
dn16:4.5.4	“Let’s go to Black Plum Village.”…	_Jambugāma_.
dn16:4.5.5	“Let’s go to Bhoga City.”	Departing from the economic naming scheme, here _bhoga_ does not mean “wealth”. Rather, the Bhogas were one of the clans of the Vajji Federation.
dn16:4.6.1	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
dn16:4.6.2	Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Bhoga City,	NA
dn16:4.7.1	where he stayed at the Ānanda Shrine.	NA
dn16:4.7.2	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:	NA
dn16:4.7.3	“Mendicants, I will teach you the four great references.	“Great references” is _mahāpadesa_; also at [an4.180](). A different set of four _mahāpadesas_ are [pli-tv-kd1:40.1.1](), which provide criteria by which mendicants may judge what is and is not allowable.
dn16:4.7.4	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
dn16:4.7.5	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	NA
dn16:4.7.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
dn16:4.8.1	“Take a mendicant who says:	NA
dn16:4.8.2	‘Reverend, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:	The phrase used in the suttas when reporting a teaching heard directly from the Buddha, eg. [sn55.52:5.1](), [sn22.90:9.1](), [mn47:10.7](), etc.
dn16:4.8.3	this is the teaching, this is the training, this is the Teacher’s instruction.’	_Dhamma_, _vinaya_, and _satthusāsana_ are used in the suttas in the general sense of the entirety of the Buddha’s teachings. In his advice to Mahāpajāpatī ([an8.53]()) and Upāli ([an7.83]()), they are said to be whatever conforms with letting go. A stream-enterer who is a lay person is grounded in them ([an6.16:7.2]()). They are more frequent in the Vinaya, being used as a general qualifier of a legitimate legal procedure ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc63:2.1.8]()). Due to this, the fact that there are three items, and the fact that _dhamma_ and _sutta_ are different words, we should not take _dhamma_ and _vinaya_ here as equivalent to _sutta_ and _vinaya_ below. Rather, they are a general claim to authenticity and do not specify particular texts.
dn16:4.8.4	You should neither approve nor dismiss that mendicant’s statement.	As at [mn112:3.1](), [dn29:18.4](), and [an4.180:2.5]().
dn16:4.8.5	Instead, having carefully memorized those words and phrases, you should make sure they fit in the discourse and are exhibited in the training.	It is tempting to assume that _sutta_ here means the Suttapiṭaka and _vinaya_ means the Vinayapiṭaka, or at least an earlier version of these texts; but this is not supported by tradition. The late canonical Netti explains _sutta_ as “the four noble truths” and _vinaya_ as “the removal of greed, hate, and delusion” ([ne6]()). The commentaries discuss many interpretations; ultimately they agree with the Netti for _vinaya_, but say _sutta_ means the entire Tipiṭaka. I think the Netti is correct: teachings should “fit in” with the four noble truths (like other footprints fit in to an elephant’s footprint, [mn28]()), and they should “be exhibited” in that the results of practice should be apparent (_sandiṭṭhika_). | “Memorize” (_uggahetvā_), because in an oral tradition a text is not learned until it is known by heart; such claims must be taken seriously. | “Fit into” is _osāreti_ or _otāreti_ per [an4.180](); the two words have a similar meaning, “to flow down into”.
dn16:4.8.6	If they do not fit in the discourse and are not exhibited in the training, you should draw the conclusion:	The text has _ca_ (“and”) rather than _vā_ (“or”), which would be expected if they were to be found in one or other textual collection. This is urging that any teaching fits in with the fundamental principles of the four noble truths, and is effective in removing defilements.
dn16:4.8.7	‘Clearly this is not the word of the Buddha.	NA
dn16:4.8.8	It has been incorrectly memorized by that mendicant.’	NA
dn16:4.8.9	And so you should reject it.	NA
dn16:4.8.10	If they do fit in the discourse and are exhibited in the training, you should draw the conclusion:	NA
dn16:4.8.11	‘Clearly this is the word of the Buddha.	NA
dn16:4.8.12	It has been correctly memorized by that mendicant.’	NA
dn16:4.8.13	You should remember it. This is the first great reference.	The Pali text appears to say that one should remember the _mahāpadesa_, whereas the Sanskrit clearly says one should remember the passage (_ayaṁ dharmo’yaṁ vinaya idaṁ śāstuḥ śāsanam iti viditvā dhārayitavyāḥ_). It seems as if this pattern should underlie the Pali too, for if the passage is false, one “should reject it” (_chaḍḍeyyātha_). In the case of a correct passage we should expect a parallel injunction that one “should remember it” (_dhāreyyātha_). But if this applies to the _mahāpadesa_ there is no such injunction. Thus it seems as if the Sanskrit is correct here and the Pali corrupt. I restore it by reversing the order of the phrases.
dn16:4.9.1	Take another mendicant who says:	NA
dn16:4.9.2	‘In such-and-such monastery lives a Saṅgha with seniors and leaders.	Each of the four references is a little less solid than the previous. Here one hasn’t heard from the Buddha, but from the Saṅgha. The fact that one hears it from the Saṅgha implies a kind of formal group recitation such as a _saṅgīti_ or “council”.
dn16:4.9.3	I’ve heard and learned this in the presence of that Saṅgha:	NA
dn16:4.9.4	this is the teaching, this is the training, this is the Teacher’s instruction.’	NA
dn16:4.9.5	You should neither approve nor dismiss that mendicant’s statement.	NA

dn16:4.9.14	You should remember it. This is the second great reference.	NA

dn16:4.10.2	‘In such-and-such monastery there are several senior mendicants who are very learned, inheritors of the heritage, who have memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the outlines.	Now one learns not from a unified Saṅgha, but from several learned elders. This is a stock description of learned mendicants (eg. [an3.20:6.2]()). | “Inheritors of the heritage” is _āgatāgamā_, where _āgama_ means “what has come down”, namely the scriptural heritage. _Āgama_ is a synonym for _nikāya_ in the sense of “collection of scripture”. | The “outlines” (_mātikā_, literally “matrix”) are the summary outlines of topics that served as seeds for the development of Abhidhamma. [dn16:3.50.5]() features one of the earliest of such lists, the 37 path factors that the Buddha “taught from his own direct knowledge”. These serve as outline for the section on the path in the Saṁyutta, from where they were adopted in various Abhidhamma texts such as the Vibhaṅga.
dn16:4.10.3	I’ve heard and learned this in the presence of those senior mendicants:	NA

dn16:4.11.2	‘In such-and-such monastery there is a single senior mendicant who is very learned, an inheritor of the heritage, who has memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the outlines.	Finally the testimony of a single mendicant, which is the weakest of all. Nonetheless, the procedure is the same.

dn16:4.12.1	And while staying at the Ānanda Shrine, too, the Buddha often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicants:	NA

dn16:4.13.0	23. On Cunda the Smith	NA
dn16:4.13.1	When the Buddha had stayed in Bhoga City as long as he pleased, he addressed Ānanda,	NA
dn16:4.13.2	“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Pāvā.”	Pāvā, a town of the Mallas, has more significance for this narrative than appears at first sight. It was, according to Buddhist texts, the place where Mahāvīra had recently died, plunging the Jains into chaos. (The Jains, however, say this was another Pāvā, east of Nāḷandā.) Pāvā became associated with especially ascetic monks: thirty Pāvā monks became awakened on hearing a particularly strong discourse ([sn15.13]()); Mahākassapa heard the news of the Buddha’s passing at Pāvā; and monks from Pāvā allied with monks of “Avanti and the south” arguing for strict Vinaya in the Second Council ([pli-tv-kd1:1.7.11]()).
dn16:4.13.3	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
dn16:4.13.4	Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Pāvā,	This passage also at [ud8.5]().
dn16:4.13.5	where he stayed in Cunda the smith’s mango grove.	Cunda was apparently a metal-worker, which was an advanced form of technological craftsmanship.
dn16:4.14.1	Cunda heard that the Buddha had arrived and was staying in his mango grove.	NA
dn16:4.14.2	Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.	NA
dn16:4.14.3	The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk.	This is, according to the commentary, preserved as the other discourse taught to Cunda, which deals with proper asceticism ([snp1.5]()).
dn16:4.14.4	Then Cunda said to the Buddha,	NA
dn16:4.15.1	“Sir, may the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me.”	NA
dn16:4.15.2	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
dn16:4.16.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Cunda got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	NA
dn16:4.17.1	And when the night had passed Cunda had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home, and plenty of pork on the turn. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	The exact meaning of _sūkaramaddava_ is unclear. _Sūkara_ is “pig”, but some Chinese translations suggest the sense “mushroom”; and it is true that there are several names of plants or plant dishes that begin with _sūkara_ or other animals. At [dhp377](), flowers are described as _maddava_, meaning “overripe, withering on the vine”. It is a common practice to allow meat to sit for a while to become tender and “high” for extra flavor when cooked. But this can lead to a proliferation of dangerous bacteria unless properly cooked, and such seems to have been the case here. In any case, this disputed term is marginal in a consideration of meat-eating in early Buddhism, which is discussed more fully elsewhere.
dn16:4.17.2	“Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.”	NA
dn16:4.18.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Cunda together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out	NA
dn16:4.18.2	and addressed Cunda,	NA
dn16:4.18.3	“Cunda, please serve me with the pork on the turn that you’ve prepared.	If the Buddha knew the meal was dangerous, why ask to be served it? This is even more striking in light of the fact that it is a Vinaya offence to request fine food, including meat, and nowhere else is such a request recorded ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:2.10.1]()). Such narrative ambiguities serve to escalate a sense of wonder.
dn16:4.18.4	And serve the mendicant Saṅgha with the other foods.”	NA
dn16:4.18.5	“Yes, sir,” replied Cunda, and did as he was asked.	NA
dn16:4.19.1	Then the Buddha addressed Cunda,	NA
dn16:4.19.2	“Cunda, any pork on the turn that’s left over, you should bury it in a pit.	NA
dn16:4.19.3	I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could properly digest it except for the Realized One.”	NA
dn16:4.19.4	“Yes, sir,” replied Cunda. He did as he was asked, then came back to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.	NA
dn16:4.19.5	Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.	NA
dn16:4.20.1	After the Buddha had eaten Cunda’s meal, he fell severely ill with bloody dysentery, struck by dreadful pains, close to death.	The Buddha’s illness is sometimes diagnosed as mesenteric infarction. The Buddha’s body rejects the world of conditioned existence entirely.
dn16:4.20.2	But he endured unbothered, with mindfulness and situational awareness.	NA
dn16:4.20.3	Then he addressed Ānanda,	NA
dn16:4.20.4	“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Kusinārā.”	NA
dn16:4.20.5	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
dn16:4.20.6	I’ve heard that after eating	The commentary says that these verses were added by the elders at the Council.
dn16:4.20.7	the meal of Cunda the smith,	NA
dn16:4.20.8	the attentive one fell severely ill,	NA
dn16:4.20.9	with pains, close to death.	NA
dn16:4.20.10	A severe sickness struck the Teacher	NA
dn16:4.20.11	who had eaten the pork on the turn.	NA
dn16:4.20.12	While still purging the Buddha said:	NA
dn16:4.20.13	“I’ll go to the citadel of Kusinārā.”	NA
dn16:4.21.0	24. Bringing a Drink	NA
dn16:4.21.1	Then the Buddha left the road and went to the root of a certain tree, where he addressed Ānanda,	NA
dn16:4.21.2	“Please, Ānanda, fold my outer robe in four and spread it out for me. I am tired and will sit down.”	The _saṅghāṭi_ (“outer robe” or “cloak”) is double-layered, and served both for warmth and as bedding. The Buddha has not recovered fully from his illness.
dn16:4.21.3	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda, and did as he was asked.	NA
dn16:4.21.4	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out.	NA
dn16:4.22.1	When he was seated he said to Venerable Ānanda,	NA
dn16:4.22.2	“Please, Ānanda, fetch me some water. I am thirsty and will drink.”	The Buddha was an exemplary patient. He did not complain, but made his needs known clearly to his carer.
dn16:4.22.3	When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,	NA
dn16:4.22.4	“Sir, just now around five hundred carts have passed by. The shallow water has been churned up by their wheels, and it flows cloudy and murky.	NA
dn16:4.22.5	The Kakudhā river is not far away, with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful.	NA
dn16:4.22.6	There the Buddha can drink and cool his limbs.”	It would seem that, since the Buddha was enduring his illness without complaint and with dignity, Ānanda did not fully realize how weak he has become.
dn16:4.23.1	For a second time, the Buddha asked Ānanda for a drink,	NA
dn16:4.23.3	and for a second time Ānanda suggested going to the Kakudhā river.	NA
dn16:4.24.1	And for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda,	NA
dn16:4.24.2	“Please, Ānanda, fetch me some water. I am thirsty and will drink.”	NA
dn16:4.24.3	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his bowl he went to the river.	The bowl (_patta_) was used both for eating and drinking.
dn16:4.24.4	Now, though the shallow water in that creek had been churned up by wheels, and flowed cloudy and murky, when Ānanda approached it flowed transparent, clear, and unclouded.	NA
dn16:4.25.1	Then Ānanda thought,	NA
dn16:4.25.2	“Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! The Realized One has such psychic power and might!	NA
dn16:4.25.3	For though the shallow water in that creek had been churned up by wheels, and flowed cloudy and murky, when I approached it flowed transparent, clear, and unclouded.”	NA
dn16:4.25.4	Gathering a bowl of drinking water he went back to the Buddha, and said to him,	NA
dn16:4.25.5	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! The Realized One has such psychic power and might!	NA
dn16:4.25.6	Just now, though the shallow water in that creek had been churned up by wheels, and flowed cloudy and murky, when I approached it flowed transparent, clear, and unclouded.	NA
dn16:4.25.7	Drink the water, Blessed One! Drink the water, Holy One!”	NA
dn16:4.25.8	So the Buddha drank the water.	NA
dn16:4.26.0	25. On Pukkusa the Malla	NA
dn16:4.26.1	Now at that time Pukkusa the Malla, a disciple of Āḷāra Kālāma, was traveling along the road from Kusinārā to Pāvā.	Pukkusa is not elsewhere mentioned. The reference to Āḷāra Kālāma recalls the narrative of the bodhisatta’s practices before awakening. There are several details that indicate the stories of the first part and the last part of the Buddha’s life were unified by such callbacks. We meet the Malla clan later on.
dn16:4.26.2	He saw the Buddha sitting at the root of a certain tree.	NA
dn16:4.26.3	He went up to him, bowed, sat down to one side, and said,	NA
dn16:4.26.4	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! Those who have gone forth remain in such peaceful meditations.	NA
dn16:4.27.1	Once it so happened that Āḷāra Kālāma, while traveling along a road, left the road and sat at the root of a nearby tree for the day’s meditation.	NA
dn16:4.27.2	Then around five hundred carts passed by right beside Āḷāra Kālāma.	_Niśraya_ in the sense of “near” occurs at Śatapathabrāhmaṇa 3.1.2.17.
dn16:4.27.3	Then a certain person coming behind those carts went up to Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him:	NA
dn16:4.27.4	‘Sir, didn’t you see the five hundred carts pass by?’	In deep meditation the senses cease to function.
dn16:4.27.5	‘No, friend, I didn’t see them.’	NA

dn16:4.27.13	Why sir, even your outer robe is covered with dust!’	As were Mahāpajāpatī’s limbs ([an8.51]()).
dn16:4.27.14	‘Yes, friend.’	NA
dn16:4.27.15	Then that person thought:	NA
dn16:4.27.16	‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! Those who have gone forth remain in such peaceful meditations,	NA
dn16:4.27.17	in that, while conscious and awake he neither saw nor heard a sound as five hundred carts passed by right next to him.’	NA
dn16:4.27.18	And after declaring his lofty confidence in Āḷāra Kālāma, he left.”	NA
dn16:4.28.1	“What do you think, Pukkusa?	NA
dn16:4.28.2	Which is harder and more challenging to do while conscious and awake:	NA
dn16:4.28.3	to neither see nor hear a sound as five hundred carts pass by right next to you?	NA

dn16:4.29.1	“What do five hundred carts matter, or six hundred, or seven hundred, or eight hundred, or nine hundred, or a thousand, or even a hundred thousand carts?	NA
dn16:4.29.2	It’s far harder and more challenging to neither see nor hear a sound as the heavens are raining and pouring, lightning’s flashing, and thunder’s cracking!”	NA
dn16:4.30.1	“This one time, Pukkusa, I was staying near Ātumā in a threshing-hut.	A nearby town where the Buddha had stayed previously ([pli-tv-kd1:37.4.2]()).
dn16:4.30.2	At that time the heavens were raining and pouring, lightning was flashing, and thunder was cracking. And not far from the threshing-hut two farmers who were brothers were killed, as well as four oxen.	NA
dn16:4.30.3	Then a large crowd came from Ātumā to the place where that happened.	NA
dn16:4.31.1	Now at that time I came out of the threshing-hut and was walking mindfully in the open near the door of the hut.	NA
dn16:4.31.2	Then having left that crowd, a certain person approached me, bowed, and stood to one side. I said to them,	NA
dn16:4.32.1	‘Why, friend, has this crowd gathered?’	NA
dn16:4.32.2	‘Just now, sir, the heavens were raining and pouring, lightning was flashing, and thunder was cracking. And two farmers who were brothers were killed, as well as four oxen.	NA
dn16:4.32.3	Then this crowd gathered here.	NA
dn16:4.32.4	But sir, where were you?’	NA
dn16:4.32.5	‘I was right here, friend.’	NA

dn16:4.33.4	And after declaring their lofty confidence in me, they bowed and respectfully circled me, keeping me on their right, before leaving.”	NA
dn16:4.34.1	When he said this, Pukkusa said to him,	NA
dn16:4.34.2	“Any confidence I had in Āḷāra Kālāma I sweep away as in a strong wind, or float away as down a swift stream.	NA
dn16:4.34.3	Excellent, sir! Excellent!	NA
dn16:4.34.4	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
dn16:4.34.5	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
dn16:4.34.6	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	NA
dn16:4.35.1	Then Pukkusa addressed a certain man,	NA
dn16:4.35.2	“Please, my man, fetch a pair of ready to wear garments the color of mountain gold.”	_Siṅgīvaṇṇa_, or else _siṅgīsuvaṇṇa_ ([an3.70:38.3]()), is gold from a mountain peak (_siṅgī_). Kauṭilya mentions a form of gold that is _śṛṅgaśūktija_, “occurring on mount Śūkti” (Arthaśāstra 2.13.3). The commentary to that passage says it had the color of red arsenic, so it would have been a rose gold color.
dn16:4.35.3	“Yes, sir,” replied that man, and did as he was asked.	NA
dn16:4.35.4	Then Pukkusa brought the garments to the Buddha,	NA
dn16:4.35.5	“Sir, please accept this pair of ready to wear garments the color of mountain gold from me out of sympathy.”	NA
dn16:4.35.6	“Well then, Pukkusa, clothe me in one, and Ānanda in the other.”	NA
dn16:4.35.7	“Yes, sir,” replied Pukkusa, and did so.	NA
dn16:4.36.1	Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Pukkusa the Malla with a Dhamma talk,	NA
dn16:4.36.2	after which he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving.	NA
dn16:4.37.1	Then, not long after Pukkusa had left, Ānanda placed the pair of garments the color of mountain gold by the Buddha’s body.	NA
dn16:4.37.2	But when placed by the Buddha’s body they seemed to lose their shine.	NA
dn16:4.37.3	Then Ānanda said to the Buddha,	NA
dn16:4.37.4	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing, how pure and bright is the color of the Realized One’s skin.	NA
dn16:4.37.5	When this pair of ready to wear garments  the color of mountain gold is placed by the Buddha’s body they seem to lose their lustre.”	NA
dn16:4.37.6	“That’s so true, Ānanda, that’s so true! There are two times when the color of the Realized One’s skin becomes extra pure and bright.	NA
dn16:4.38.1	What two?	NA
dn16:4.38.2	The night when a Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening; and the night he becomes fully extinguished in the element of extinguishment with no residue.	Closing the narrative circle with the story of awakening.

dn16:4.38.4	Today, Ānanda, in the last watch of the night, between a pair of sal trees in the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā, shall be the Realized One’s full extinguishment.	NA
dn16:4.38.5	Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the Kakudhā River.”	NA
dn16:4.38.6	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
dn16:4.38.7	A pair of garments the color of mountain gold	The commentary says this verse was added by the senior monks at the Council.
dn16:4.38.8	was presented by Pukkusa;	NA
dn16:4.38.9	when the teacher was clothed with them,	NA
dn16:4.38.10	his snow gold skin glowed bright.	NA
dn16:4.39.1	Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants went to the Kakudhā River. He plunged into the river and bathed and drank. And when he had emerged, he went to the mango grove,	NA
dn16:4.39.2	where he addressed Venerable Cundaka,	The monk Cundaka makes an abrupt appearance here; this is the only mention of this name. The commentary to this passage calls him _cunda_, while the gloss to the parallel passage at [ud8.5:14.3]() has _cundaka_ throughout. The diminutive ending _-ka_ is perhaps meant to differentiate him from the smith Cunda. There are various Cundas whose connection is unclear. Mahācunda was one of the great disciples ([mn118:](), [an6.17](), [mn8]()), who later brought the Dhamma to the land of the Cetīs ([an6.46](), [an10.24]()). He once stayed with Channa and Sāriputta ([mn144:4.1](), [sn35.87:1.2]()); the commentaries say he was in fact Sāriputta’s younger brother. They also identify him with the “novice Cunda” who reported the deaths of Sāriputta ([sn47.13:1.3]()) and Mahāvīra ([dn29:2.1](), [mn104:3.1]()), explaining that the title “novice” was a nickname that persisted from the time he ordained as a young novice. It is unclear whether the commentaries take the Cundaka of this passage to be the same person, but he is here performing a similar role as carer adjacent to the Buddha’s death. Later there appears a Cūḷacunda ([tha-ap52:13.3]()). Thus there may have been one person known by different names, or several people whose stories have become conflated.
dn16:4.39.3	“Please, Cundaka, fold my outer robe in four and spread it out for me. I am tired and will lie down.”	NA
dn16:4.40.1	“Yes, sir,” replied Cundaka, and did as he was asked.	NA
dn16:4.40.2	And then the Buddha laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.	NA
dn16:4.40.3	But Cundaka sat down right there in front of the Buddha.	NA
dn16:4.41.1	Having gone to Kakudhā Creek,	These verses were also added at the Council according to the commentary.
dn16:4.41.2	whose water was transparent, sweet, and clear,	NA
dn16:4.41.3	the Teacher, being tired, plunged in,	NA
dn16:4.41.4	the Realized One, without compare in the world.	NA
dn16:4.41.5	And after bathing and drinking the Teacher emerged.	NA
dn16:4.41.6	Before the group of mendicants, in the middle, <j>the Buddha,	NA
dn16:4.41.7	the Teacher <j>who rolled forth the present dispensation,	Adopt PTS and BJT reading _satthā pavattā_.
dn16:4.41.8	the great seer went to the mango grove.	NA
dn16:4.41.9	He addressed the mendicant named Cundaka:	NA
dn16:4.41.10	“Spread out my folded robe so I can lie down.”	NA
dn16:4.41.11	The evolved one urged Cunda,	NA
dn16:4.41.12	who quickly spread the folded robe.	NA
dn16:4.41.13	The Teacher lay down so tired,	NA
dn16:4.41.14	while Cunda sat there before him.	NA
dn16:4.42.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda:	NA
dn16:4.42.2	“Now it may happen, Ānanda, that someone may give rise to regret in Cunda the smith:	NA
dn16:4.42.3	‘It’s your loss, respected Cunda, it’s your misfortune, in that the Realized One was fully quenched after eating his last almsmeal from you.’	The text addresses Cunda with the respectful _āvuso_.
dn16:4.42.4	You should dispel remorse in Cunda the smith like this:	NA
dn16:4.42.5	‘You’re fortunate, respected Cunda, you’re so very fortunate,	NA
dn16:4.42.6	in that the Realized One was fully quenched after eating his last almsmeal from you.	NA
dn16:4.42.7	I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha.	NA
dn16:4.42.8	There are two almsmeal offerings that have identical fruit and result, and are more fruitful and beneficial than other almsmeal offerings.	Again, the narrative circle.
dn16:4.42.9	What two?	NA
dn16:4.42.10	The almsmeal after eating which a Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening; and the almsmeal after eating which he becomes fully extinguished in the element of extinguishment with no residue.	NA
dn16:4.42.11	These two almsmeal offerings have identical fruit and result, and are more fruitful and beneficial than other almsmeal offerings.	NA
dn16:4.42.12	You’ve accumulated a deed that leads to long life, beauty, happiness, fame, heaven, and sovereignty.’	The text uses _āyasmā_ here for Cunda, as does the Sanskrit, whereas it is normally reserved for mendicants (see below, [dn16:6.2.1]()).
dn16:4.42.13	That’s how you should dispel remorse in Cunda the smith.”	NA
dn16:4.43.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
dn16:4.43.2	“A giver’s merit grows;	This became a point of discussion in later Buddhism: can it be that the merit of a gift grows after it is given?
dn16:4.43.3	enmity doesn’t build up when you have self-control.	NA
dn16:4.43.4	A skillful person gives up bad things—	NA
dn16:4.43.5	with the end of greed, hate, and delusion, <j>they’re quenched.”	NA
dn16:4.43.6	The fourth recitation section.	NA
dn16:5.1.0	26. The Pair of Sal Trees	NA
dn16:5.1.1	Then the Buddha said to Ānanda,	NA
dn16:5.1.2	“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the far shore of the Golden River, and on to the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā.”	Known today as Kushinagar, it is a popular site for pilgrims, with many ancient stupas, Buddha images, and a peaceful park for meditation.
dn16:5.1.3	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
dn16:5.1.4	And that’s where they went. Then the Buddha addressed Ānanda,	NA
dn16:5.1.5	“Please, Ānanda, set up a cot for me between the twin sal trees, with my head to the north. I am tired and will lie down.”	NA
dn16:5.1.6	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda, and did as he was asked.	NA
dn16:5.1.7	And then the Buddha laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware.	Normally when the Buddha lies down, his mind is focused on getting up. But now he knows that he will not rise again.
dn16:5.2.1	Now at that time the twin sal trees were in full blossom with flowers out of season.	Sal trees blossom in April/May. This detail agrees with the Buddha’s final extinguishment in December/January, rather than in May (Vesak) as is currently celebrated (see note to [dn16:3.9.3]()).
dn16:5.2.2	They sprinkled and bestrewed the Realized One’s body in honor of the Realized One.	NA
dn16:5.2.3	And the flowers of the heavenly Flame Tree fell from the sky, and they too sprinkled and bestrewed the Realized One’s body in honor of the Realized One.	NA
dn16:5.2.4	And heavenly sandalwood powder fell from the sky, and it too sprinkled and bestrewed the Realized One’s body in honor of the Realized One.	NA
dn16:5.2.5	And heavenly music played in midair in honor of the Realized One.	NA
dn16:5.2.6	And heavenly choirs sang in midair in honor of the Realized One.	NA
dn16:5.3.1	Then the Buddha pointed out to Ānanda what was happening, adding:	NA
dn16:5.3.8	“That’s not the full extent of how the Realized One is honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed.	NA
dn16:5.3.9	Any monk or nun or male or female lay follower who practices in line with the teachings, practicing properly, living in line with the teachings—they honor, respect, revere, venerate, and esteem the Realized One with the highest honor.	This calls back to the description of the fourfold assembly in the Māra section above ([dn16:3.7.4]()).
dn16:5.3.10	So Ānanda, you should train like this: ‘We shall practice in line with the teachings, practicing properly, living in line with the teaching.’”	This kind of narrative elevation is characteristic of the Buddha’s teaching. He did not try to deny or eliminate any belief in the miraculous, or in the power of devotion, but rather to show that such things were of limited worth compared with practice.
dn16:5.4.0	27. The Monk Upavāna	NA
dn16:5.4.1	Now at that time Venerable Upavāna was standing in front of the Buddha fanning him.	Like Cundaka above, Upavāna shares the duties of an attendant with Ānanda; at [dn29:41.1]() he is also fanning the Buddha. At [an5.166](), Ānanda goes to Upavāna for support when he feels he has disappointed the Buddha.
dn16:5.4.2	Then the Buddha made him move,	NA
dn16:5.4.3	“Move over, mendicant, don’t stand in front of me.”	NA
dn16:5.4.4	Ānanda thought,	NA
dn16:5.4.5	“This Venerable Upavāna has been the Buddha’s attendant for a long time, close to him, living in his presence.	In [sn7.13]() Upavāna fetched hot water and molasses for the Buddha, an event he remembered in his own verses at [thag2.33]().
dn16:5.4.6	Yet in his final hour the Buddha makes him move, saying:	NA
dn16:5.4.7	‘Move over, mendicant, don’t stand in front of me.’	NA
dn16:5.4.8	What is the cause, what is the reason for this?”	NA
dn16:5.5.1	Then Ānanda said to the Buddha,	NA
dn16:5.5.2	“This Venerable Upavāna has been the Buddha’s attendant for a long time, close to him, living in his presence.	NA
dn16:5.5.3	Yet in his final hour the Buddha makes him move, saying:	NA
dn16:5.5.4	‘Move over, mendicant, don’t stand in front of me.’	NA
dn16:5.5.5	What is the cause, sir, what is the reason for this?”	NA
dn16:5.5.7	“Most of the deities from ten solar systems have gathered to see the Realized One.	NA
dn16:5.5.8	For twelve leagues all around this sal grove there’s no spot, not even a fraction of a hair’s tip, that’s not crowded full of illustrious deities.	For this usage of _phuṭo_, see [an3.56:1.3]().
dn16:5.5.9	The deities are complaining:	NA
dn16:5.5.10	‘We’ve come such a long way to see the Realized One!	NA
dn16:5.5.11	Only rarely do Realized Ones arise in the world, perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.	NA
dn16:5.5.12	This very day, in the last watch of the night, the Realized One will be fully extinguished.	NA
dn16:5.5.13	And this illustrious mendicant is standing in front of the Buddha blocking the view. We won’t get to see the Realized One in his final hour!’”	NA
dn16:5.6.1	“But sir, what kind of deities are you thinking of?”	NA
dn16:5.6.2	“There are, Ānanda, deities—both in space and on the earth—who are aware of the earth. With hair disheveled and arms raised, they fall down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamenting:	Elsewhere, _pathavīsaññī_ refers to those who develop a form of meditation where they are “percipient of earth” ([an10.6:1.2]()). Here, however, it simply means those deities who are aware of events on the ground. | Read _chinnaṁpādaṁ viya papatanti_.
dn16:5.6.3	‘Too soon the Blessed One will be fully extinguished! Too soon the Holy One will be fully extinguished! Too soon the Eye of the World will vanish!’	The Buddha as “eye” evokes the common (eg. Rig Veda 1.164.14, 5.40.8, 5.59.5, 10.10.9) Vedic image of the Sun as the “eye of all” (_viśvacakṣāḥ_, 7.63.1), the “eye” for “eyes to see” (10.158.4), moving as an unaging wheel through the sky (1.164.14). See [snp3.9:11.1]() = [mn98:7.23](). | Pali has _cakkhuṁ loke_ (“eye in the world”), Sanskrit has _cakṣur lokasya_ (“eye of the world”).
dn16:5.6.6	But the deities who are free of desire endure, mindful and aware, thinking:	NA
dn16:5.6.7	‘Conditions are impermanent. How could it possibly be otherwise?’”	These two reactions—grief and equanimity—are depicted often in Buddhist art and narrative. They stimulated the two poles of development of the Buddhist community. The devotional tradition, feeling the need for an emotional connection with the Teacher, developed art, story, and doctrines to, as it were, keep him alive, resulting in the Jātakas and the Bodhisattva doctrine. A cooler, rational tradition developed a comprehensive system analyzing the impermanence of “conditions”, leading to the Abhidhamma.
dn16:5.7.0	28. The Four Inspiring Places	NA
dn16:5.7.1	“Previously, sir, when mendicants had completed the rainy season residence in various districts they came to see the Realized One.	As for example at [mn24:2.1]().
dn16:5.7.2	We got to see the esteemed mendicants, and to pay homage to them.	_Manobhāvanīya_ is explained in the commentaries as “those who, when seen, cause the mind to grow in what is skillful.”
dn16:5.7.3	But when the Buddha has passed, we won’t get to see the esteemed mendicants or to pay homage to them.”	NA
dn16:5.8.1	“Ānanda, a faithful gentleman should go to see these four inspiring places.	These four sites are the primary destinations of modern Buddhist pilgrims in India. | _Saṁvejanīya_ is “stirring, provoking inspiration or urgency” such as when seeing an astonishing, disturbing, or amazing sight.
dn16:5.8.2	What four?	NA
dn16:5.8.3	Thinking: ‘Here the Realized One was born!’—that is an inspiring place.	Lumbinī in modern Nepal, which today is a well-maintained and quiet place for devotion and meditation. The site is marked with an Ashokan pillar dated perhaps 150 years after this time. On the pillar is inscribed in Brahmī characters _hida bhagavaṁ jāte ti_, which is a direct quote in Māgadhī of the Pali phrase here, _idha tathāgato jāto ti_. (_Tathāgata_ “realized one” is how the Buddha referred to himself, while _bhagavā_ “blessed one” is how his followers referred to him.) This is the oldest direct quote from the early canon preserved in the archaeological record.
dn16:5.8.4	Thinking: ‘Here the Realized One became awakened as a supreme fully awakened Buddha!’—that is an inspiring place.	Bodhgaya in modern Bihar, which is called Uruvelā in the Pali texts. It is a bustling center for pilgrims from all over the Buddhist world, at the center of which is the great stupa next to the Bodhi tree.
dn16:5.8.5	Thinking: ‘Here the supreme Wheel of Dhamma was rolled forth by the Realized One!’—that is an inspiring place.	Isipatana is modern Sarnath, in the northern part of Varanasi on the Ganges. In the temple next to the park, the first sermon is recited every night. | Note the passive voice, whereas the parallel at [an4.118]() is active.
dn16:5.8.6	Thinking: ‘Here the Realized One was fully quenched in the element of extinguishment with no residue!’—that is an inspiring place.	The phrase _nibbānadhātuyā parinibbuto_, “fully quenched in the element of extinguishment” shows how the Pali uses two roots simultaneously for Nibbana. The better-known term, _nibbāna_ (Sanskrit _nirvāṇa_), is from the root _vā_ (“to blow”), with the basic sense of going out through being deprived of air. The past participle form _nibbuta_ (Sanskrit _nirvṛta_), from the root _var_ (“to check or restrain”), has the basic sense of freedom from obstacles and constrictions. Generally, the Pali treats _nibbuta_ as the past participle form of _nibbāna_, and for the most part the difference is purely verbal. Yet I believe the ambiguity is deliberate, as each captures a slightly different nuance of Nibbana. “Quenched” means both to go out like a flame and to be satisfied like a thirst. This positive feel appears in Sanskrit passages using _nirvṛta_, such as Manusmṛti 1.54, where it describes the blissful absorption of all beings into the great divinity. By using “extinguishment” for _nibbāna_ and “quenched” for _nibbuta_ I hope to express this subtle distinction, or at least to alert the reader that it exists.
dn16:5.8.7	These are the four inspiring places that a faithful gentleman should go to see.	NA
dn16:5.8.8	Faithful monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen will come, and think:	NA
dn16:5.8.9	‘Here the Realized One was born!’ and ‘Here the Realized One became awakened as a supreme fully awakened Buddha!’ and ‘Here the supreme Wheel of Dhamma was rolled forth by the Realized One!’ and ‘Here the Realized One was fully quenched in the element of extinguishment with no residue!’	NA
dn16:5.8.10	Anyone who passes away while on pilgrimage to these shrines will, when their body breaks up, after death, be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”	NA
dn16:5.9.0	29. Ānanda’s Questions	NA
dn16:5.9.1	“Sir, how do we proceed when it comes to females?”	This passage is absent from the Sanskrit parallel and it is probably a late interpolation. Ānanda was handsome, and many stories of his encounters with women are preserved, for example at [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.5]().
dn16:5.9.2	“Without looking, Ānanda.”	As it stands, this appears to contradict [mn152:2.10](), where the Buddha ridicules the idea that sense restraint implies not seeing. The commentary, however, explains it as not looking at a woman who is standing in the doorway of a monk’s hut, so as not to give rise to lust. Thus it restricts this apparently general rule to an unusually intimate encounter.
dn16:5.9.3	“But when looking, how to proceed?”	The verb changes from _paṭipajjāma_ (first person plural) to _paṭipajjitabbaṁ_ (future passive participle), a shift that mirrors the following passage regarding the funeral proceedings. There, the shift to future passive participle indicates that the subject is the lay folk who carry out the funeral, whereas here that does not apply. This suggests that this passage has been derived from that later passage.
dn16:5.9.4	“Without chatting, Ānanda.”	The commentary refers to [an5.55:6.5](), which speaks of chatting alone in private with a woman, a circumstance also dealt with in [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc45]().
dn16:5.9.5	“But when chatting, how to proceed?”	Ānanda does not hesitate to let the Buddha know he has no intention of following his advice.
dn16:5.9.6	“Be mindful, Ānanda.”	The commentary says, quoting [sn35.127:1.6](), that when a woman has sincere motivations, one should speak while thinking of them as a mother, a sister, or a daughter.
dn16:5.10.1	“Sir, how do we proceed when it comes to the Realized One’s corpse?”	“Corpse” is _sarīra_.
dn16:5.10.2	“Don’t get involved in the rites for venerating the Realized One’s corpse, Ānanda.	For _abyāvaṭā_ (“don’t get involved”), compare _samaṇena bhavitabbaṁ abyāvaṭena_ (“a monastic shouldn’t get involved” (in domestic matters)) at [pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.34]().
dn16:5.10.3	Please, Ānanda, you must all strive and practice for your own goal! Meditate diligent, keen, and resolute for your own goal!	Read _sadatthe_ (“own goal”) rather than _sāratthe_ (“essential goal”).
dn16:5.10.4	There are astute aristocrats, brahmins, and householders who are devoted to the Realized One. They will perform the rites for venerating the Realized One’s corpse.”	NA
dn16:5.11.1	“But sir, how to proceed when it comes to the Realized One’s corpse?”	NA
dn16:5.11.2	“Proceed in the same way as they do for the corpse of a wheel-turning monarch.”	NA
dn16:5.11.3	“But how do they proceed with a wheel-turning monarch’s corpse?”	NA
dn16:5.11.4	“They wrap a wheel-turning monarch’s corpse with unworn cloth, then with uncarded cotton, then again with unworn cloth.	NA
dn16:5.11.5	In this way they wrap the corpse with five hundred double-layers. Then they place it in an iron case filled with oil and close it up with another case. Then, having built a funeral pyre out of all kinds of aromatics, they cremate the corpse.	An iron case was also used for Queen Bhaddā’s body at [an5.50:1.6](). The second iron case does not “enclose” the first; rather it “crooks” (_paṭikujjati_) like a lid to “close it up”.
dn16:5.11.6	They build a monument for the wheel-turning monarch at the crossroads.	This is a rare mention of the _thūpa_ (“sepulchral momunent”) that became a major feature of the Buddhist landscape. Buddhist monuments were round in shape, which was apparently a characteristic of the lands around Magadha. Śatapathabrāhmaṇa 13.8.1.5 says that the correct form of such a monument was square, and that round monuments were built by godless “easterners”.
dn16:5.11.7	That’s how they proceed with a wheel-turning monarch’s corpse.	NA
dn16:5.11.8	Proceed in the same way with the Realized One’s corpse.	Here the Buddha is said to be explicitly instructing his followers to adopt the building of monuments from the local customs.
dn16:5.11.9	A monument for the Realized One is to be built at the crossroads.	NA
dn16:5.11.10	When someone there lifts up garlands or fragrance or powder, or bows, or inspires confidence in their heart, that will be for their lasting welfare and happiness.	NA
dn16:5.12.0	30. Persons Worthy of Monument	NA
dn16:5.12.1	Ānanda, these four are worthy of a monument.	NA
dn16:5.12.2	What four?	NA
dn16:5.12.3	A Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha; an independent Buddha; a disciple of a Realized One; and a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn16:5.12.4	And for what reason is a Realized One worthy of a monument?	NA
dn16:5.12.5	So that many people will inspire confidence in their hearts, thinking: ‘This is the monument for that Blessed One, perfected and fully awakened!’	NA
dn16:5.12.6	And having done so, when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	NA
dn16:5.12.7	It is for this reason that a Realized One is worthy of a monument.	NA
dn16:5.12.8	And for what reason is an independent Buddha worthy of a monument?	“Independent Buddhas” are sages who discover the Dhamma and are awakened independently, but who do not themselves go on to found a dispensation or establish a monastic order. Text has _paccekasambuddho_ rather than the usual _paccekabuddho_.
dn16:5.12.9	So that many people will inspire confidence in their hearts, thinking: ‘This is the monument for that independent Buddha!’	NA
dn16:5.12.10	And having done so, when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	NA
dn16:5.12.11	It is for this reason that an independent Buddha is worthy of a monument.	NA
dn16:5.12.12	And for what reason is a Realized One’s disciple worthy of a monument?	This refers to the “eight individuals” who make up the “Saṅgha of disciples”, namely those who have achieved the four stages of awakening and those on the path.
dn16:5.12.13	So that many people will inspire confidence in their hearts, thinking: ‘This is the monument for that Blessed One’s disciple!’	NA
dn16:5.12.14	And having done so, when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	NA
dn16:5.12.15	It is for this reason that a Realized One’s disciple is worthy of a monument.	NA
dn16:5.12.16	And for what reason is a wheel-turning monarch worthy of a monument?	NA
dn16:5.12.17	So that many people will inspire confidence in their hearts, thinking: ‘This is the monument for that just and principled king!’	In contrast with Ajātasattu.
dn16:5.12.18	And having done so, when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	NA
dn16:5.12.19	It is for this reason that a wheel-turning monarch is worthy of a monument.	NA
dn16:5.12.20	These four are worthy of a monument.”	NA
dn16:5.13.0	31. Ānanda’s Incredible Qualities	NA
dn16:5.13.1	Then Venerable Ānanda entered a building, and stood there leaning against the door-jamb and crying,	Like Queen Subhaddā, wife of Mahāsudassana, at [dn17:2.8.7]() and [dn17:2.12.1](). | _Kapisīsa_ is door-jamb, not lintel. | For _vihāra_ (“building”) the commentary has “pavilion” (_maṇḍalamāla_), which may have been a temporary construction for the occasion (compare [mn92:4.6]()).
dn16:5.13.2	“Oh! I’m still only a trainee with work left to do; and my Teacher is about to be fully extinguished, he who is so kind to me!”	At this point Ānanda was a stream-enterer.
dn16:5.13.3	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,	NA
dn16:5.13.4	“Mendicants, where is Ānanda?”	NA
dn16:5.13.5	“Sir, Ānanda has entered a dwelling, and stands there leaning against the door-jamb and crying:	NA
dn16:5.13.6	‘Oh! I’m still only a trainee with work left to do; and my Teacher is about to be fully extinguished, he who is so kind to me!’”	NA
dn16:5.13.7	So the Buddha addressed one of the monks,	NA
dn16:5.13.8	“Please, monk, in my name tell Ānanda that	NA
dn16:5.13.9	the teacher summons him.”	NA
dn16:5.13.10	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Ānanda and said to him,	NA
dn16:5.13.11	“Reverend Ānanda, the teacher summons you.”	NA
dn16:5.14.1	“Yes, reverend,” Ānanda replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:	NA
dn16:5.14.2	“Enough, Ānanda! Do not grieve, do not lament. Did I not prepare for this when I explained that	When admonishing Ānanda, the Buddha first gently but firmly restrains him, then gives words of support and encouragement.
dn16:5.14.3	we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved?	NA
dn16:5.14.4	How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out, even the Realized One’s body?	NA
dn16:5.14.5	For a long time, Ānanda, you’ve treated the Realized One with deeds of body, speech, and mind that are loving, beneficial, pleasant, undivided, and limitless.	The phrase “undivided and limitless” (_advayena appamāṇena_) normally describes _kasiṇa_ meditation ([an10.25:1.3]()); here it is also found in the Sanskrit: _ānanda maitreṇa kāyakarmaṇā hitena sukhenādvayenāpramāṇena_.
dn16:5.14.6	You have done good deeds, Ānanda. Devote yourself to meditation, and you will soon be free of defilements.”	On the eve of the First Council—in about six months time—Ānanda devoted himself to meditation and achieved arahantship.
dn16:5.15.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:	NA
dn16:5.15.2	“The Buddhas of the past or the future have attendants who are no better than Ānanda is for me.	The same is said regarding the chief disciples Sāriputta and Moggallāna at [sn47.14:2.4]() and regarding assemblies of deities at [dn20:4.3]().
dn16:5.15.4	Ānanda is astute,	NA
dn16:5.15.5	he is intelligent.	NA
dn16:5.15.6	He knows the time for monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, king’s ministers, monastics of other religions and their disciples to visit the Realized One.	_Tittha_, literally “ford”, is a path to salvation, used as a term for a non-Buddhist “religion”. _Titthakara_ is a “religious founder” (literally “ford-maker”); _titthiya_ is a “monastic of (another) religion” (for example at [pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.2.5]()); _titthiyasāvaka_ is a “disciple of a monastic of (another) religion”.
dn16:5.16.1	There are these four incredible and amazing things about Ānanda.	As at [an4.130:6.4](). Ānanda was in awe of the “incredible and amazing” qualities of the Buddha, and spoke of them often. Here, when Ānanda is at his most vulnerable, the Buddha turns the teaching around, pointing out that Ānanda is incredible and amazing too.
dn16:5.16.2	What four?	NA
dn16:5.16.3	If an assembly of monks goes to see Ānanda, they’re uplifted by seeing him	NA
dn16:5.16.4	and uplifted by hearing him speak.	NA
dn16:5.16.5	And when he falls silent, they’ve never had enough.	NA
dn16:5.16.6	If an assembly of nuns …	NA
dn16:5.16.9	laymen …	NA
dn16:5.16.12	or laywomen goes to see Ānanda, they’re uplifted by seeing him	NA
dn16:5.16.13	and uplifted by hearing him speak.	NA
dn16:5.16.14	And when he falls silent, they’ve never had enough.	NA
dn16:5.16.15	These are the four incredible and amazing things about Ānanda.	NA
dn16:5.16.16	There are these four incredible and amazing things about a wheel-turning monarch.	This anticipates the story to follow.
dn16:5.16.17	What four?	NA
dn16:5.16.18	If an assembly of aristocrats goes to see a wheel-turning monarch, they’re uplifted by seeing him	NA
dn16:5.16.19	and uplifted by hearing him speak.	NA
dn16:5.16.20	And when he falls silent, they’ve never had enough.	NA
dn16:5.16.21	If an assembly of brahmins …	NA
dn16:5.16.22	householders …	NA
dn16:5.16.23	or ascetics goes to see a wheel-turning monarch, they’re uplifted by seeing him	NA
dn16:5.16.24	and uplifted by hearing him speak.	NA
dn16:5.16.25	And when he falls silent, they’ve never had enough.	NA
dn16:5.16.26	In the same way, there are those four incredible and amazing things about Ānanda.”	NA
dn16:5.17.0	32. Teaching the Discourse on Mahāsudassana	NA
dn16:5.17.1	When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha:	NA
dn16:5.17.2	“Sir, please don’t be fully extinguished in this little hamlet, this jungle hamlet, this branch hamlet.	NA
dn16:5.17.3	There are other great cities such as	NA
dn16:5.17.4	Campā, Rājagaha, Sāvatthī, Sāketa, Kosambī, and Varanasi.	Campā, Rājagaha, Sāvatthī, and Kosambī were the capitals of Aṅga, Magadha, Kosala, and Vaccha respectively. Sāketa was the former capital of Kosala. Varanasi was formerly the capital of Kāsi, but at this time was contested by Kosala and Magadha, and had recently been won from Ajātasattu ([sn3.14](), [sn3.15]()).
dn16:5.17.5	Let the Buddha be fully extinguished there.	NA
dn16:5.17.6	There are many well-to-do aristocrats, brahmins, and householders there who are devoted to the Buddha.	NA
dn16:5.17.7	They will perform the rites of venerating the Realized One’s corpse.”	NA
dn16:5.17.8	“Don’t say that Ānanda! Don’t say that	NA
dn16:5.17.9	this is a little hamlet, a jungle hamlet, a branch hamlet.	NA
dn16:5.18.1	Once upon a time there was a king named Mahāsudassana who was a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extended to all four sides, he achieved stability in the country, and he possessed the seven treasures.	This story is also found in [dn17](). It seems that the Pali tradition extracted the story and greatly expanded it in an independent long discourse, whereas the Sanskrit tradition kept it at a more moderate length within the Mahāparinirvāṇasūtra itself.
dn16:5.18.2	His capital was this Kusinārā, which at the time was named Kusāvatī.	Kusāvatī features in the Kusajātaka ([ja531]()), where the ugly but wise prince Kusa, son of the legendary Okkāka, wins the hand of the radiant Pabhāvatī. The Rāmāyaṇa also tells the story of a Kusa, son of Rāma, who ruled the city of Kusāvatī, although this city was located far to the south in the Vindhya ranges. Both stories are united by the detail that _kusa_ grass, a prominent feature of Vedic ritual, ensured the kingly lineage.
dn16:5.18.3	It stretched for twelve leagues from east to west, and seven leagues from north to south.	A “league” (_yojana_) is usually estimated at between seven and twelve kilometers. By way of comparison, even at its greatest extent under Ashoka, Pāṭaliputta was less than a league per side, so the dimensions of Kusāvatī here are strictly legendary.
dn16:5.18.4	The royal capital of Kusāvatī was successful, prosperous, populous, full of people, with plenty of food.	NA
dn16:5.18.5	It was just like Āḷakamandā, the royal capital of the gods, which is successful, prosperous, populous, full of spirits, with plenty of food.	According to [dn32](), Āḷakamandā was one of the many cities of Kuvera in Uttarakuru.
dn16:5.18.7	Kusāvatī was never free of ten sounds by day or night, namely:	NA
dn16:5.18.8	the sound of elephants, horses, chariots, drums, clay drums, arched harps, singing, horns, gongs, and handbells; and the cry: ‘Eat, drink, be merry!’ as the tenth.	NA
dn16:5.19.1	Go, Ānanda, into Kusinārā and inform the Mallas:	NA
dn16:5.19.2	‘This very day, Vāseṭṭhas, in the last watch of the night, the Realized One will be fully extinguished.	Vāseṭṭha is a Vedic priestly clan. The Mallas adopted the name of their priest’s lineage, which was the normal custom for initiated _khattiyas_. Other examples in the Pali are Saccaka who is called Aggivessana ([mn35:4.2]()), and the Buddha and his family who are called Gotama.
dn16:5.19.3	Come forth, Vāseṭṭhas! Come forth, Vāseṭṭhas!	NA
dn16:5.19.4	Don’t regret it later, thinking:	NA
dn16:5.19.5	‘The Realized One became fully extinguished in our own village district, but we didn’t get a chance to see him in his final hour.’”	NA
dn16:5.19.6	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Then he robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kusinārā with a companion.	_Attadutiyo_ “with self as second” is also at [mn146:4.6]() where Nandaka visits the nuns. Sanskrit has _bhikṣuṇā paścācchramaṇena_ (“with a mendicant as accompanying ascetic”). It was apparently evening (the “wrong time”, _vikāla_), when it is inappropriate for a monk to be wandering the town alone.
dn16:5.20.0	33. The Mallas Pay Homage	NA
dn16:5.20.1	Now at that time the Mallas of Kusinārā were sitting together at the town hall on some business.	Evidently the Mallas, like the Vajjis, met frequently.
dn16:5.20.2	Ānanda went up to them, and announced:	NA
dn16:5.20.3	“This very day, Vāseṭṭhas, in the last watch of the night, the Realized One will be fully extinguished.	NA
dn16:5.20.4	Come forth, Vāseṭṭhas! Come forth, Vāseṭṭhas!	NA
dn16:5.20.5	Don’t regret it later, thinking:	NA
dn16:5.20.6	‘The Realized One became fully extinguished in our own village district, but we didn’t get a chance to see him in his final hour.’”	NA
dn16:5.21.1	When they heard what Ānanda had to say, the Mallas, their sons, daughters-in-law, and wives became distraught, saddened, and grief-stricken. And some, with hair disheveled and arms raised, falling down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamented,	NA
dn16:5.21.2	“Too soon the Blessed One will be fully extinguished! Too soon the Holy One will be fully extinguished! Too soon the Eye of the World will vanish!”	NA
dn16:5.21.3	Then the Mallas, their sons, daughters-in-law, and wives, distraught, saddened, and grief-stricken went to the Mallian sal grove at Upavattana and approached Ānanda.	NA
dn16:5.22.1	Then Ānanda thought,	NA
dn16:5.22.2	“If I have the Mallas pay homage to the Buddha one by one, they won’t be finished before first light.	NA
dn16:5.22.3	I’d better separate them family by family and then have them pay homage, saying:	NA
dn16:5.22.4	‘Sir, the Malla named so-and-so with children, wives, retinue, and ministers bows with his head at your feet.’”	NA
dn16:5.22.5	And so that’s what he did.	NA
dn16:5.22.7	So by this means Ānanda got the Mallas to finish paying homage to the Buddha in the first watch of the night.	NA
dn16:5.23.0	34. On Subhadda the Wanderer	NA
dn16:5.23.1	Now at that time a wanderer named Subhadda was residing near Kusinārā.	This is the second Subhadda we have met in this discourse, the first being a deceased devotee of Ñātika ([dn16:2.6.13]()). The corrupt monk who, after the Buddha’s death, urges the rejection of the Vinaya rules is another person of the same name ([dn16:6.20.1]()). The Mahāsudassanasutta also features a Queen Subhaddā ([dn17:2.5.9]()).
dn16:5.23.2	He heard that	NA
dn16:5.23.3	on that very day, in the last watch of the night, will be the full extinguishment of the ascetic Gotama.	NA
dn16:5.23.4	He thought:	NA
dn16:5.23.5	“I have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior, the tutors of tutors, said:	NA
dn16:5.23.6	‘Only rarely do Realized Ones arise in the world, perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.’	NA
dn16:5.23.7	And this very day, in the last watch of the night, will be the full extinguishment of the ascetic Gotama.	NA
dn16:5.23.8	This state of uncertainty has come up in me.	NA
dn16:5.23.9	I am quite confident that the Buddha is capable of teaching me so that I can give up this state of uncertainty.”	NA
dn16:5.24.1	Then Subhadda went to the Mallian sal grove at Upavattana, approached Ānanda, and said to him,	NA
dn16:5.24.2	“Master Ānanda, I have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior, the tutors of tutors, said:	NA
dn16:5.24.3	‘Only rarely do Realized Ones arise in the world, perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.’	NA
dn16:5.24.4	And this very day, in the last watch of the night, will be the full extinguishment of the ascetic Gotama.	NA
dn16:5.24.5	This state of uncertainty has come up in me.	NA
dn16:5.24.6	I am quite confident that the Buddha is capable of teaching me so that I can give up this state of uncertainty.	NA
dn16:5.24.7	Worthy Ānanda, please let me see the ascetic Gotama.”	NA
dn16:5.24.8	When he had spoken, Ānanda said,	NA
dn16:5.24.9	“Enough, Reverend Subhadda, do not trouble the Realized One. He is tired.”	NA
dn16:5.24.10	For a second time,	NA
dn16:5.24.11	and a third time, Subhadda asked Ānanda, and a third time Ānanda refused.	NA
dn16:5.25.1	The Buddha heard that discussion between Ānanda and Subhadda.	NA
dn16:5.25.2	He said to Ānanda,	NA
dn16:5.25.3	“Enough, Ānanda, don’t obstruct Subhadda; let him see the Realized One.	NA
dn16:5.25.4	For whatever he asks me, he will only be looking to understand, not to trouble me.	NA
dn16:5.25.5	And he will quickly understand any answer I give to his question.”	NA
dn16:5.25.6	So Ānanda said to the wanderer Subhadda,	NA
dn16:5.25.7	“Go, Reverend Subhadda, the Buddha is making time for you.”	NA
dn16:5.26.1	Then the wanderer Subhadda went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:	NA
dn16:5.26.2	“Worthy Gotama, there are those ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community, and tutor a community. They’re well-known and famous religious founders, deemed holy by many people.	NA
dn16:5.26.3	Namely: Pūraṇa Kassapa, the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla, Ajita of the hair blanket, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, and the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan.	NA
dn16:5.26.4	According to their own claims, did all of them have direct knowledge, or none of them, or only some?”	While some such as Mahāvīra the Ñātika ([mn14:17.2]()) and Pūraṇa Kassapa ([an9.38:2.1]()) claimed to have direct knowledge, others such as Ajita Kesakambala denied that such knowledge was possible ([dn2:23.2]()).
dn16:5.26.5	“Enough, Subhadda, let that be.	The Buddha responded the same way when asked this question by the brahmin Piṅgalakoccha ([mn30:2.6]()), and to a similar question at [an9.38:3.2]().
dn16:5.26.7	I shall teach you the Dhamma.	NA
dn16:5.26.8	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
dn16:5.26.9	“Yes, sir,” Subhadda replied.	NA
dn16:5.26.10	The Buddha said this:	NA
dn16:5.27.1	“Subhadda, in whatever teaching and training the noble eightfold path is not found, there is no ascetic found, no second ascetic, no third ascetic, and no fourth ascetic.	The four ascetics are defined at [an4.241:1.1]() as those on the four paths.
dn16:5.27.2	In whatever teaching and training the noble eightfold path is found, there is an ascetic found, a second ascetic, a third ascetic, and a fourth ascetic.	While many aspects of the eightfold path are shared with others, some details may be missing (such as not-self or Nibbāna), while others are added (such as the belief in the efficacy of rituals, an eternal soul, or a creator god).
dn16:5.27.3	In this teaching and training the noble eightfold path is found. Only here is there an ascetic, here a second ascetic, here a third ascetic, and here a fourth ascetic. Other sects are empty of ascetics.	NA
dn16:5.27.4	Were these mendicants to practice well, the world would not be empty of perfected ones.	The Buddha points to the mendicants who have gathered there.
dn16:5.27.5	I was twenty-nine years of age, Subhadda,	This is the only place in the early texts where the Buddha identifies his age when going forth.
dn16:5.27.6	when I went forth to discover what is skillful.	Detailed in such suttas as [mn36]().
dn16:5.27.7	It’s been over fifty years	NA
dn16:5.27.8	since I went forth.	NA
dn16:5.27.9	Teacher of the references <j>for the systematic teaching:	This verse appears to be corrupt. The sense can be restored through two extra lines in the Sanskrit: “Ethics, immersion, conduct, and knowledge, and unification of mind have been developed by me, teacher of the references for the noble teaching.” | For _padesavattī_, the Sanskrit has _pradeśavaktā_, where _vaktā_ means “speaker” and _pradeśa_ has the sense “pointing out”. I think it means, “I am the one who taught the four great references (_mahāpadesa_)”.
dn16:5.27.10	outside of here there is no ascetic,	NA
dn16:5.27.11	no second ascetic,	NA
dn16:5.27.12	no third ascetic,	NA
dn16:5.27.13	and no fourth ascetic.	NA
dn16:5.27.14	Other sects are empty of ascetics.	NA
dn16:5.27.15	Were these mendicants to practice well, the world would not be empty of perfected ones.”	NA
dn16:5.28.1	When he had spoken, Subhadda said to the Buddha,	NA
dn16:5.28.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent!	NA
dn16:5.28.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
dn16:5.28.4	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
dn16:5.28.5	Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”	NA
dn16:5.29.1	“Subhadda, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.	NA
dn16:5.29.2	However, I have recognized individual differences in this matter.”	NA
dn16:5.29.3	“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.”	NA
dn16:5.29.4	Then the Buddha said to Ānanda,	NA
dn16:5.29.5	“Well then, Ānanda, give Subhadda the going forth.”	NA
dn16:5.29.6	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
dn16:5.30.1	Then Subhadda said to Ānanda,	NA
dn16:5.30.2	“You’re so fortunate, Reverand Ānanda, so very fortunate,	NA
dn16:5.30.3	to be anointed here in the Teacher’s presence as his pupil!”	NA
dn16:5.30.4	And the wanderer Subhadda received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	NA
dn16:5.30.5	Not long after his ordination, Venerable Subhadda, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
dn16:5.30.6	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	NA
dn16:5.30.7	And Venerable Subhadda became one of the perfected.	NA
dn16:5.30.8	He was the last personal disciple of the Buddha.	The commentary says this line was added at the Council.
dn16:5.30.9	The fifth recitation section.	NA
dn16:6.1.0	35. The Buddha’s Last Words	NA
dn16:6.1.1	Then the Buddha addressed Venerable Ānanda:	NA
dn16:6.1.2	“Now, Ānanda, some of you might think:	NA
dn16:6.1.3	‘The teacher’s dispensation has passed. Now we have no Teacher.’	NA
dn16:6.1.4	But you should not see it like this.	NA
dn16:6.1.5	The teaching and training that I have taught and pointed out for you shall be your Teacher after my passing.	This is similar to the idea of the Four Great references, and sets the scene for the First Council at which the teachings were recited. | _Paññatto_ here means “pointed out” rather than “laid down”, as can be seen from [dn9:33.21](), where the same phrase refers to the four noble truths.
dn16:6.2.1	After my passing, mendicants ought not address each other as ‘reverend’, as they do today.	_Āvuso_ is from the root _āyu_ (“age”) and thus has a respectful sense and does not mean “friend” as it is often translated. Like _bhante_, it is an indeclinable vocative of address that may be used with or without the name (see eg. [mn5:31.2]()).
dn16:6.2.2	A more senior mendicant ought to address a more junior mendicant by name or clan, or by saying ‘reverend’.	NA
dn16:6.2.3	A more junior mendicant ought to address a more senior mendicant using ‘sir’ or ‘venerable’.	I render _bhante_ as “sir” when it stands alone and “honorable” when it prefixes a name. | Unlike _bhante_, _āyasmā_ (“venerable”) is declinable, so it is used in parts of speech other than direct address. It is from the same root as _āvuso_ but with a slightly more respectful tone, perhaps because it sounds more Sanskritic.
dn16:6.3.1	If it wishes, after my passing the Saṅgha may abolish the lesser and minor training rules.	These are not defined here, and the senior monks at the First Council were unable to agree on them ([pli-tv-kd21:1.9.3]()). Nonetheless, the Pali Vinaya consistently labels the Pācittiya rules as “lesser” (_khuddaka_; [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc92:2.2.22](), [pli-tv-bi-vb-pc96:2.2.22](), [pli-tv-pvr1.1:219.3]()), which would make the Pātidesanīyas “minor” (_anukhuddaka_). The Sekhiya rules are also “minor”, but they were not at this point reckoned among the training rules for recitation.
dn16:6.4.1	After my passing, give the divine punishment to the mendicant Channa.”	“Divine punishment” is _brahmadaṇḍa_. Channa features often in the Vinaya as a monk who refuses correction and acts disrespectfully. The Sangha had already imposed an act of “ejection” (_ukkhepanīyakamma_) on him due to his persistent bad behavior, but that was still not enough ([pli-tv-kd1:25.1.1]()). The _brahmadaṇḍa_ was imposed at the First Council ([pli-tv-kd1:1.12.1]()), upon which Channa finally saw the error of his ways. _Brahmadaṇḍa_ is encountered in a different sense at [dn3:1.23.21]().
dn16:6.4.2	“But sir, what is the divine punishment?”	NA
dn16:6.4.3	“Channa may say what he likes,	NA
dn16:6.4.4	but the mendicants should not correct, advise, or instruct him.”	_Vattabba_ in such contexts means “advise, correct” rather than more generally “speak to”. Thus the _brahmadaṇḍa_ is not the “silent treatment”.
dn16:6.5.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,	NA
dn16:6.5.2	“Perhaps even a single mendicant has doubt or uncertainty regarding the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the path, or the practice. So ask, mendicants! Don’t regret it later, thinking:	NA
dn16:6.5.3	‘We were in the Teacher’s presence and we weren’t able to ask the Buddha a question.’”	NA
dn16:6.5.4	When this was said, the mendicants kept silent.	NA
dn16:6.6.1	For a second time,	NA
dn16:6.6.2	and a third time the Buddha addressed the mendicants:	NA
dn16:6.6.3	“Perhaps even a single mendicant has doubt or uncertainty regarding the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the path, or the practice. So ask, mendicants! Don’t regret it later, thinking:	NA
dn16:6.6.4	‘We were in the Teacher’s presence and we weren’t able to ask the Buddha a question.’”	NA
dn16:6.6.5	For a third time, the mendicants kept silent.	NA
dn16:6.6.6	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,	NA
dn16:6.6.7	“Mendicants, perhaps you don’t ask out of respect for the Teacher. So let a friend tell a friend.”	NA
dn16:6.6.8	When this was said, the mendicants kept silent.	NA
dn16:6.6.9	Then Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,	NA
dn16:6.6.10	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! I am quite confident that there is not even a single mendicant in this Saṅgha who has doubt or uncertainty regarding the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the path, or the practice.”	NA
dn16:6.6.11	“Ānanda, you speak out of faith. But the Realized One knows that there is not even a single mendicant in this Saṅgha who has doubt or uncertainty regarding the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the path, or the practice.	NA
dn16:6.6.12	Even the last of these five hundred mendicants is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.”	NA
dn16:6.7.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:	NA
dn16:6.7.2	“Come now, mendicants, I say to you all:	NA
dn16:6.7.3	‘Conditions fall apart. Persist with diligence.’”	NA
dn16:6.7.4	These were the Realized One’s last words.	The commentary says this line was added at the Council.
dn16:6.8.0	36. Fully Quenched	NA
dn16:6.8.1	Then the Buddha entered the first absorption. Emerging from that, he entered the second absorption. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the third absorption, the fourth absorption, the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Then he entered the cessation of perception and feeling.	Even on his deathbed, the Buddha retains mastery over his mind.
dn16:6.8.2	Then Venerable Ānanda said to Venerable Anuruddha,	NA
dn16:6.8.3	“Honorable Anuruddha, has the Buddha become fully quenched?”	Ānanda’s question is prompted by the fact that it is very difficult to tell the difference between one who is dead and who has attained cessation ([mn43:25.1]()). Anuruddha can answer due to his mastery of psychic powers. | Note that Ānanda and Anuruddha have immediately adopted the forms of address recommended by the Buddha above.
dn16:6.8.4	“No, Reverend Ānanda. He has entered the cessation of perception and feeling.”	NA
dn16:6.9.1	Then the Buddha emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling and entered the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the dimension of nothingness, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of infinite space, the fourth absorption, the third absorption, the second absorption, and the first absorption. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the second absorption and the third absorption. Then he entered the fourth absorption. Emerging from that the Buddha immediately became fully extinguished.	NA
dn16:6.10.1	When the Buddha was fully quenched, along with the full extinguishment there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky.	NA
dn16:6.10.2	When the Buddha was fully quenched, the divinity Sahampati recited this verse:	NA
dn16:6.10.3	“All creatures in this world	Each of these characters reveal something of themselves in their verses. Sahampati, as a royal deity, emphasizes the universal nature of the teaching and the grandeur of the Buddha.

dn16:6.10.9	When the Buddha was fully quenched, Sakka, lord of gods, recited this verse:	NA
dn16:6.10.10	“Oh! Conditions are impermanent,	Less creative than Brahmā, Sakka repeats a famous verse spoken by the Buddha at [sn15.20:8.1]() and [dn17:2.17.5]().

dn16:6.10.15	“There was no more breathing	Anuruddha was a reclusive meditator who specialized in mindfulness of breathing. Here he remarks on the fact that, since breathing ceases in the fourth absorption ([sn36.11:2.19]()), the Buddha’s breathing had already stopped before he died.

dn16:6.10.22	was like the extinguishing of a lamp.”	NA
dn16:6.10.23	When the Buddha was fully quenched, Venerable Ānanda recited this verse:	NA
dn16:6.10.24	“Then there was terror!	Ānanda has the most emotional reaction. While Anuruddha speaks only of peace, Ānanda empathizes with those who were distraught.
dn16:6.10.25	Then they had goosebumps!	NA
dn16:6.10.26	When the Buddha, endowed with all fine qualities,	NA

dn16:6.10.28	When the Buddha was fully quenched, some of the mendicants there who were not free of desire, with arms raised, falling down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamented: “Too soon the Blessed One has become fully quenched! Too soon the Holy One has become fully quenched! Too soon the Eye of the World has vanished!”	Text omits “with hair disheveled” (_kese pakiriya_) when describing the shaven-headed monks.
dn16:6.10.29	But the mendicants who were free of desire endured, mindful and aware, thinking,	NA
dn16:6.10.30	“Conditions are impermanent. How could it possibly be otherwise?”	NA
dn16:6.11.1	Then Anuruddha addressed the mendicants:	NA
dn16:6.11.2	“Enough, reverends, do not grieve or lament.	NA
dn16:6.11.3	Did the Buddha not prepare us for this when he explained that	NA
dn16:6.11.4	we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved?	NA
dn16:6.11.5	How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out?	NA
dn16:6.11.6	The deities are complaining.”	NA
dn16:6.11.7	“But sir, what kind of deities are you thinking of?”	NA
dn16:6.11.8	“There are, Ānanda, deities—both in space and on the earth—who are aware of the earth. With hair disheveled and arms raised, they fall down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamenting:	NA
dn16:6.11.9	‘Too soon the Blessed One has become fully quenched! Too soon the Holy One has become fully quenched! Too soon the Eye of the World has vanished!’	NA
dn16:6.11.12	But the deities who are free of desire endure, mindful and aware, thinking:	NA
dn16:6.11.13	‘Conditions are impermanent. How could it possibly be otherwise?’”	NA
dn16:6.11.14	Ānanda and Anuruddha spent the rest of the night talking about Dhamma.	NA
dn16:6.12.1	Then Anuruddha said to Ānanda,	NA
dn16:6.12.2	“Go, Ānanda, into Kusinārā and inform the Mallas:	NA
dn16:6.12.3	‘Vāseṭṭhas, the Buddha has become fully quenched.	NA
dn16:6.12.4	Please come at your convenience.’”	NA
dn16:6.12.5	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Then, in the morning, he robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kusinārā with a companion.	NA
dn16:6.12.6	Now at that time the Mallas of Kusinārā were sitting together at the town hall still on the same business.	“Still on the same business” (_teneva karaṇīyena_) calls back to [dn16:5.20.1](), where they were said to be “on some business” (_kenacideva karaṇīyena_). They had been discussing all night.
dn16:6.12.7	Ānanda went up to them, and announced,	NA
dn16:6.12.8	“Vāseṭṭhas, the Buddha has become fully quenched.	NA
dn16:6.12.9	Please come at your convenience.”	NA
dn16:6.12.10	When they heard what Ānanda had to say, the Mallas, their sons, daughters-in-law, and wives became distraught, saddened, and grief-stricken. And some, with hair disheveled and arms raised, falling down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamented,	NA
dn16:6.12.11	“Too soon the Blessed One has become fully quenched! Too soon the Holy One has become fully quenched! Too soon the Eye of the World has vanished!”	NA
dn16:6.13.0	37. The Rites of Venerating the Buddha’s Corpse	NA
dn16:6.13.1	Then the Mallas ordered their men,	NA
dn16:6.13.2	“So then, my men, collect fragrances and garlands, and all the musical instruments in Kusinārā.”	NA
dn16:6.13.3	Then—taking those fragrances and garlands, all the musical instruments, and five hundred pairs of garments—they went to the Mallian sal grove at Upavattana and approached the Buddha’s corpse. They spent the day honoring, respecting, revering, and venerating the Buddha’s corpse with dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances, and making awnings and setting up pavilions.	An uplifting response to tragedy, full of beauty and celebration.
dn16:6.13.4	Then they thought,	NA
dn16:6.13.5	“It’s too late to cremate the Buddha’s corpse today. Let’s do it tomorrow.”	NA
dn16:6.13.6	But they spent the next day the same way, and so too the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth days.	It seem unlikely that everyone simply forgot. It was probably the custom to wait seven days before the cremation.
dn16:6.14.1	Then on the seventh day they thought,	NA
dn16:6.14.2	“Honoring, respecting, revering, and venerating the Buddha’s corpse with dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances, let us carry it to the south of the town, and cremate it there outside the town.”	NA
dn16:6.14.3	Now at that time eight of the leading Mallas, having bathed their heads and dressed in unworn clothes, said,	“Unworn” is _ahata_, as at [dn14:1.33.9]() and [pli-tv-kd1:1.6.2]().
dn16:6.14.4	“We shall lift the Buddha’s corpse.” But they were unable to do so.	NA
dn16:6.14.5	The Mallas said to Anuruddha,	NA
dn16:6.14.6	“What is the cause, Honorable Anuruddha, what is the reason why these eight Mallian chiefs are unable to lift the Buddha’s corpse?”	NA
dn16:6.14.8	“Vāseṭṭhas, you have one plan, but the deities have a different one.”	NA
dn16:6.15.1	“But sir, what is the deities’ plan?”	NA
dn16:6.15.2	“You plan to	NA
dn16:6.15.3	carry the Buddha’s corpse to the south of the town while venerating it with dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances, and cremate it there outside the town.	NA
dn16:6.15.4	The deities plan to	NA
dn16:6.15.5	carry the Buddha’s corpse to the north of the town while venerating it with heavenly dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances. Then they plan to enter the town by the northern gate, carry it through the center of the town, leave by the eastern gate, and cremate it there at the Mallian shrine named Coronation.”	“Coronation” is _makuṭabandhana_, “the binding of the crown”. The commentary says there was, fittingly, an auspicious decorative royal hall there; perhaps too the name was felt to pun with _muktabandhana_, “freedom from ties”.
dn16:6.15.6	“Sir, let it be as the deities plan.”	NA
dn16:6.16.1	Now at that time the whole of Kusinārā was covered knee-deep with the flowers of the Flame Tree, without gaps even on the filth and rubbish heaps.	I think _sandhi_ here means “covered without gaps”.
dn16:6.16.2	Then the deities and the Mallas of Kusinārā carried the Buddha’s corpse to the north of the town while venerating it with heavenly and human dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances. Then they entered the town by the northern gate, carried it through the center of the town, left by the eastern gate, and deposited the corpse there at the Mallian shrine named Coronation.	NA
dn16:6.17.1	Then the Mallas said to Ānanda,	NA
dn16:6.17.2	“Honorable Ānanda, how do we proceed when it comes to the Realized One’s corpse?”	NA
dn16:6.17.3	“Proceed in the same way as they do for the corpse of a wheel-turning monarch.”	NA
dn16:6.17.4	“But how do they proceed with a wheel-turning monarch’s corpse?”	NA
dn16:6.17.5	“They wrap a wheel-turning monarch’s corpse with unworn cloth, then with uncarded cotton, then again with unworn cloth.	NA
dn16:6.17.6	In this way they wrap the corpse with five hundred double-layers. Then they place it in an iron case filled with oil and close it up with another case. Then, having built a funeral pyre out of all kinds of aromatics, they cremate the corpse.	NA
dn16:6.17.7	They build a monument for the wheel-turning monarch at the crossroads.	NA
dn16:6.17.8	That’s how they proceed with a wheel-turning monarch’s corpse.	NA
dn16:6.17.9	Proceed in the same way with the Realized One’s corpse.	NA
dn16:6.17.10	A monument for the Realized One is to be built at the crossroads.	NA
dn16:6.17.11	When someone there lifts up garlands or fragrance or powder, or bows, or inspires confidence in their heart, that will be for their lasting welfare and happiness.”	NA
dn16:6.18.1	Then the Mallas ordered their men,	NA
dn16:6.18.2	“So then, my men, collect uncarded cotton.”	NA
dn16:6.18.3	So the Mallas wrapped the Buddha’s corpse,	NA
dn16:6.18.4	and placed it in an iron case filled with oil. Then, having built a funeral pyre out of all kinds of aromatics, they lifted the corpse on to the pyre.	NA
dn16:6.19.0	38. Mahākassapa’s Arrival	NA
dn16:6.19.1	Now at that time Venerable Mahākassapa was traveling along the road from Pāvā to Kusinārā together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants.	With the passing of Sāriputta and Moggallāna, Mahākassapa was the most senior of the remaining leading mendicants. As a solitary recluse, it was unusual for him to be travelling with such a large group, or with anyone at all really. He was to cite the events depicted here at the start of the First Council ([pli-tv-kd1:1.1.1]()).
dn16:6.19.2	Then he left the road and sat at the root of a tree.	NA
dn16:6.19.3	Now at that time a certain Ājīvaka ascetic had picked up a Flame Tree flower in Kusinārā and was traveling along the road to Pāvā.	A follower of the Bamboo-staffed Ascetic Gosāla ([dn2:19.1]()). | This may be an inspiration for the so-called “Flower Sermon”, a medieval Zen story that depicts the Buddha holding up a flower and Mahakassapa smiling.
dn16:6.19.4	Mahākassapa saw him coming off in the distance and said to him,	NA
dn16:6.19.5	“Reverend, might you know about our Teacher?”	NA
dn16:6.19.6	“Yes, reverend. Seven days ago the ascetic Gotama was fully quenched.	NA
dn16:6.19.7	From there I picked up this Flame Tree flower.”	NA
dn16:6.19.8	Some of the mendicants there who were not free of desire, with arms raised, falling down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamented,	NA
dn16:6.19.9	“Too soon the Blessed One has become fully quenched! Too soon the Holy One has become fully quenched! Too soon the Eye of the World has vanished!”	NA
dn16:6.19.10	But the mendicants who were free of desire endured, mindful and aware, thinking,	NA
dn16:6.19.11	“Conditions are impermanent. How could it possibly be otherwise?”	NA
dn16:6.20.1	Now at that time a monk named Subhadda, who had gone forth when old, was sitting in that assembly.	NA
dn16:6.20.2	He said to those mendicants,	NA
dn16:6.20.3	“Enough, reverends, do not grieve or lament. We’re well rid of that Great Ascetic. And we are oppressed:	Compare [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc72](). The syntax is clumsy here, perhaps deliberately so.
dn16:6.20.4	‘This is allowable for you; this is not allowable for you.’	NA
dn16:6.20.5	Well, now we shall do what we want and not do what we don’t want.”	NA
dn16:6.20.6	Then Venerable Mahākassapa addressed the mendicants,	NA
dn16:6.20.7	“Enough, reverends, do not grieve or lament.	NA
dn16:6.20.8	Did the Buddha not prepare us for this when he explained that	NA
dn16:6.20.9	we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved?	NA
dn16:6.20.10	How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out, even the Realized One’s body?”	NA
dn16:6.21.1	Now at that time four of the leading Mallas, having bathed their heads and dressed in unworn clothes, said,	NA
dn16:6.21.2	“We shall light the Buddha’s funeral pyre.” But they were unable to do so.	NA
dn16:6.21.3	The Mallas said to Anuruddha,	NA
dn16:6.21.4	“What is the cause, Venerable Anuruddha, what is the reason why these four Mallian chiefs are unable to light the Buddha’s funeral pyre?”	NA
dn16:6.21.6	“Vāseṭṭhas, the deities have a different plan.”	NA
dn16:6.21.7	“But sir, what is the deities’ plan?”	NA
dn16:6.21.8	“The deities’ plan is this:	NA
dn16:6.21.9	Venerable Mahākassapa is traveling along the road from Pāvā to Kusinārā together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants.	NA
dn16:6.21.10	The Buddha’s funeral pyre shall not burn until he bows with his head at the Buddha’s feet.”	NA
dn16:6.21.11	“Sir, let it be as the deities plan.”	NA
dn16:6.22.1	Then Venerable Mahākassapa arrived at the Mallian shrine named Coronation at Kusinārā and approached the Buddha’s funeral pyre. Arranging his robe over one shoulder and raising his joined palms, he respectfully circled the Buddha three times, keeping him on his right, and bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet.	NA
dn16:6.22.2	And the five hundred mendicants did likewise.	NA
dn16:6.22.3	And when Mahākassapa and the five hundred mendicants bowed the Buddha’s funeral pyre burst into flames all by itself.	NA
dn16:6.23.1	And when the Buddha’s corpse was cremated no ash or soot was found from outer or inner skin, flesh, sinews, or synovial fluid.	NA
dn16:6.23.2	Only the relics remained.	Here _sarīrāneva_ is plural and so must mean “relics”, whereas previously it was singular, “corpse”.
dn16:6.23.3	It’s like when ghee or oil blaze and burn, and neither ashes nor soot are found.	NA
dn16:6.23.4	In the same way, when the Buddha’s corpse was cremated no ash or soot was found from outer or inner skin, flesh, sinews, or synovial fluid.	NA
dn16:6.23.5	Only the relics remained.	NA
dn16:6.23.6	And of those five hundred pairs of garments only two were not burnt: the innermost and the outermost.	NA
dn16:6.23.7	But when the Buddha’s corpse was consumed the funeral pyre was extinguished by a stream of water that appeared in the sky,	As when he was born ([dn14:1.28.1]()).

dn16:6.23.10	Then the Mallas made a cage of spears for the Buddha’s relics in the town hall and surrounded it with a buttress of bows. For seven days they honored, respected, revered, and venerated them with dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances.	NA
dn16:6.24.0	39. Distributing the Relics	NA
dn16:6.24.1	King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, heard	Ajātasattu would have learned of the news from spies. It is a 600 km round trip to Rājagaha and back, which a mounted messenger could make in fourteen days.
dn16:6.24.2	that the Buddha had become fully quenched at Kusinārā.	NA
dn16:6.24.3	He sent an envoy to the Mallas of Kusinārā:	NA
dn16:6.24.4	“The Buddha was an aristocrat and so am I. I too deserve a share of the Buddha’s relics. I will build a monument for them and conduct a memorial service.”	A bold move, considering that his designs on the Vajjis were no secret. Perhaps he was seeking a pretext for war. The justification for taking a share of relics is caste, rather than practice of the Dhamma.
dn16:6.24.5	The Licchavis of Vesālī also heard	NA
dn16:6.24.6	that the Buddha had become fully quenched at Kusinārā.	NA
dn16:6.24.7	They sent an envoy to the Mallas of Kusinārā:	NA
dn16:6.24.8	“The Buddha was an aristocrat and so are we. We too deserve a share of the Buddha’s relics. We will build a monument for them and conduct a memorial service.”	NA
dn16:6.24.9	The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu also heard	NA
dn16:6.24.10	that the Buddha had become fully quenched at Kusinārā.	NA
dn16:6.24.11	They sent an envoy to the Mallas of Kusinārā:	NA
dn16:6.24.12	“The Buddha was our foremost relative. We too deserve a share of the Buddha’s relics. We will build a monument for them and conduct a memorial service.”	NA
dn16:6.24.13	The Bulis of Allakappa also heard	Both the tribe and the town are exceedingly obscure, mentioned nowhere else in early texts. They must have been a small clan nearby.
dn16:6.24.14	that the Buddha had become fully quenched at Kusinārā.	NA
dn16:6.24.15	They sent an envoy to the Mallas of Kusinārā:	NA

dn16:6.24.17	The Koliyans of Rāmagāma also heard	The Koliyans were south-eastern neighbors of the Sakyans, and several of their towns and people feature in the early texts.
dn16:6.24.18	that the Buddha had become fully quenched at Kusinārā.	NA
dn16:6.24.19	They sent an envoy to the Mallas of Kusinārā:	NA
dn16:6.24.20	“The Buddha was an aristocrat and so are we. We too deserve a share of the Buddha’s relics. We will build a monument for them and conduct a memorial service.”	NA
dn16:6.24.21	The brahmin of Veṭhadīpa also heard	This brahmin is mentioned nowhere else.
dn16:6.24.22	that the Buddha had become fully quenched at Kusinārā.	NA
dn16:6.24.23	He sent an envoy to the Mallas of Kusinārā:	NA
dn16:6.24.24	“The Buddha was an aristocrat and I am a brahmin. I too deserve a share of the Buddha’s relics. I will build a monument for them and conduct a memorial service.”	NA
dn16:6.24.25	The Mallas of Pāvā also heard	NA
dn16:6.24.26	that the Buddha had become fully quenched at Kusinārā.	NA
dn16:6.24.27	They sent an envoy to the Mallas of Kusinārā:	NA
dn16:6.24.28	“The Buddha was an aristocrat and so are we. We too deserve a share of the Buddha’s relics. We will build a monument for them and conduct a memorial service.”	NA
dn16:6.25.1	When they had spoken, the Mallas of Kusinārā said to those various groups:	NA
dn16:6.25.2	“The Buddha was fully quenched in our village district. We will not give away a share of his relics.”	_Dassāma_ (“we shall give”) is the future second plural of _dadati_.
dn16:6.25.3	Then Doṇa the brahmin said to those various groups:	The brahmin Doṇa appears suddenly in the narrative, a reminder that there were many more people than the ones who are mentioned. The suttas record two encounters with a brahmin of this name: one is the wondrous story of seeing the Buddhas footprints ([an4.36]()), while the other discusses the five kinds of brahmin ([an5.192]()).
dn16:6.25.4	“Hear, sirs, a single word from me.	NA
dn16:6.25.5	Our Buddha’s teaching was acceptance.	NA
dn16:6.25.6	It would not be good to fight over	The fear of war was justified and the resolution achieved by Doṇa probably marks the last time these parties achieved a diplomatic outcome. The relative peace that had lasted most of the Buddha’s life was crumbling. We hear of war or threats of war between the Kosalans and the Magadhans, the Magadhans and the Vajjis, the Sakyans and the Koliyans, the Kosalans and the Mallas, and the Kosalans and the Sakyans. It is probably because of the latter two conflicts that Viḍūḍabha—Pasenadi’s son and the newly crowned king of Kosala—did not send an emissary to the funeral. By sparking conflicts with former allies the Sakyans and Mallas, Viḍūḍabha undid the successes of his father and fatally weakened the Kosalan Empire. When the dust cleared a few decades later, all these lands had been consumed by Magadha.

dn16:6.25.12	“Well then, brahmin, you yourself should fairly divide the Buddha’s relics in eight portions.”	NA
dn16:6.25.13	“Yes, worthy sirs,” replied Doṇa to those various groups. He divided the relics as asked and said to them,	NA
dn16:6.25.14	“Sirs, please give me the urn, and I shall build a monument for it and conduct a memorial service.”	NA
dn16:6.25.15	So they gave Doṇa the urn.	NA
dn16:6.26.1	The Moriyas of Pippalivana heard	The Moriyas were a minor clan of the region, unmentioned outside of this passage, but their obscurity was not to last long. About a century after these events, Chandragupta the Moriyan, having won the Magadhan crown from the Nandas, proceeded to route the Greeks in the west. His empire, which covered most of northern India, was further expanded to the south by his son Bindusara and grandson Ashoka, under whom the Mauryan Empire became the greatest of all Indian empires. Thus Ajātasattu’s expansionist dreams were ultimately fulfilled beyond his imagining.
dn16:6.26.2	that the Buddha had become fully quenched at Kusinārā.	NA
dn16:6.26.3	They sent an envoy to the Mallas of Kusinārā:	NA

dn16:6.27.11	Thus there were eight monuments for the relics, a ninth for the urn, and a tenth for the embers.	NA
dn16:6.27.12	That is how it was in the old days.	The commentary says this line was added at the Third Council, which was held about 150 years after the Buddha under Ashoka. The Buddha’s life was already fading into legend.
dn16:6.28.1	There were eight shares <j>of the Clear-eyed One’s relics.	According to the commentary, the remainder of the text was added by the monks of Sri Lanka. Note, however, that this verse and the next are fairly similar to those in the Sanskrit text. Since that is a northern text, it seems unlikely these verses were composed in Sri Lanka.
dn16:6.28.2	Seven were worshipped in the Black Plum Tree Land.	NA
dn16:6.28.3	But one share of the most excellent of men	NA
dn16:6.28.4	was worshipped in Rāmagāma by a dragon king.	NA
dn16:6.28.5	One tooth is venerated by the gods of the Third Heaven,	The _tidiva_ was the realm of Indra/Sakka ([dn21:1.12.22](), [dn30:2.27.12](), [thag10.1:8.4]()), as it was from the time of the Vedas (Rig Veda 9.113.9, Atharva Veda 10.9.5, 17.1.10). In Buddhist cosmology, this agrees with the fact that Sakka’s realm is the third of the heavens (after the earth gods and the four great kings). Thus the Third Heaven is the heaven of the Thirty-Three. Both ideas spring from an old association of Indra, or divinity generally, with the number three. Agni Purāṇa lists _tridiva_ as a synonym for “heaven”, as does Amarakośa 1.1.11. Kṣīrasvāmin clarifies that three here means “third”, while also adding that some connect it with the Brahmā realm (Amarakośodghāṭana 1.1.6; see [sn7.18:4.2]()).

dn17:1.2.1	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA

dn17:1.3.3.0	1. The Capital City of Kusāvatī	NA
dn17:1.3.4	Once upon a time there was a king named Mahāsudassana whose dominion extended to all four sides, and who achieved stability in the country.	NA
dn17:1.3.5	His capital was this Kusinārā, which at the time was named Kusāvatī.	NA
dn17:1.3.6	It stretched for twelve leagues from east to west, and seven leagues from north to south.	NA
dn17:1.3.7	The royal capital of Kusāvatī was successful, prosperous, populous, full of people, with plenty of food.	NA
dn17:1.3.8	It was just like Āḷakamandā, the royal capital of the gods, which is successful, prosperous, populous, full of spirits, with plenty of food.	NA
dn17:1.3.9	NA	NA
dn17:1.3.10	Kusāvatī was never free of ten sounds by day or night, namely:	NA
dn17:1.3.11	the sound of elephants, horses, chariots, drums, clay drums, arched harps, singing, horns, gongs, and handbells; and the cry, ‘Eat, drink, be merry!’ as the tenth.	NA
dn17:1.4.1	Kusāvatī was encircled by seven ramparts:	From here we leave [dn16]() behind and with it any semblance of realism. Some of these details are shared with [sn22.96](), which however does not mention the name Mahāsudassana.
dn17:1.4.2	one made of gold, one made of silver, one made of beryl, one made of crystal, one made of ruby, one made of emerald, and one made of all precious things.	NA
dn17:1.5.1	It had four gates,	NA
dn17:1.5.2	made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal.	NA
dn17:1.5.3	At each gate there were seven pillars, three fathoms deep and four fathoms high,	Readings vary. The Sanskrit text has _saptapauruṣā ardhacaturthapauruṣāś ca nikhātā_.
dn17:1.5.4	made of gold, silver, beryl, crystal, ruby, emerald, and all precious things.	NA
dn17:1.6.1	It was surrounded by seven rows of palm trees,	NA
dn17:1.6.2	made of gold, silver, beryl, crystal, ruby, emerald, and all precious things.	NA
dn17:1.6.3	The golden palms had trunks of gold, and leaves and fruits of silver.	NA
dn17:1.6.4	The silver palms had trunks of silver, and leaves and fruits of gold.	NA
dn17:1.6.5	The beryl palms had trunks of beryl, and leaves and fruits of crystal.	NA
dn17:1.6.6	The crystal palms had trunks of crystal, and leaves and fruits of beryl.	NA
dn17:1.6.7	The ruby palms had trunks of ruby, and leaves and fruits of emerald.	NA
dn17:1.6.8	The emerald palms had trunks of emerald, and leaves and fruits of ruby.	NA
dn17:1.6.9	The palms of all precious things had trunks of all precious things, and leaves and fruits of all precious things.	NA
dn17:1.6.10	When those rows of palm trees were blown by the wind they sounded graceful, tantalizing, sensuous, lovely, and intoxicating,	NA
dn17:1.6.11	like a quintet made up of skilled musicians who had practiced well and kept excellent rhythm.	NA
dn17:1.6.12	NA	NA
dn17:1.6.13	And any addicts, carousers, or drunkards in Kusāvatī at that time were entertained by that sound.	I think the point is that they listened to the music rather than doing bad things.
dn17:1.7.0.1	2. The Seven Treasures	NA
dn17:1.7.0.2	2.1. The Wheel-Treasure	NA
dn17:1.7.1	King Mahāsudassana possessed seven treasures and four blessings.	NA
dn17:1.7.2	What seven?	NA
dn17:1.7.3	On a fifteenth day sabbath, King Mahāsudassana had bathed his head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbath.	This is specific instance, so I use past tense. Where it is an abstract description of a legendary past, I use the present tense to denote an eternal or mythic present.
dn17:1.7.4	And the heavenly wheel-treasure appeared to him, with a thousand spokes, with rim and hub, complete in every detail.	The wheel is firstly the sun and secondly the wheel of the chariots that drove the Indo-Europeans in their conquests. It is the manifestation of unstoppable power. The solar imagery is reflected in the name Mahāsudassana (“Great Splendor”). The whole story reflects the Indo-European dream of universal domination.
dn17:1.7.5	Seeing this, the king thought,	NA
dn17:1.7.6	‘I have heard that when the heavenly wheel-treasure appears to a king in this way, he becomes a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn17:1.7.7	Am I then a wheel-turning monarch?’	NA
dn17:1.8.1	Then King Mahāsudassana, rising from his seat and arranging his robe over one shoulder, took a ceremonial vase in his left hand and besprinkled the wheel-treasure with his right hand, saying:	Many of the details in this myth echo the Brahmanical horse sacrifice. Since the horse was the primary source of Indo-European dominion, its sacrifice served to authorize the power of a king. It was a costly and dangerous rite that was attempted only by the greatest of sovereigns. | _Bhiṅkāra_ (“ceremonial vase”) and _abbhukkirati_ (“besprinkled”) are elevated terms.
dn17:1.8.2	‘Roll forth, O wheel-treasure! Triumph, O wheel-treasure!’	NA
dn17:1.8.3	Then the wheel-treasure rolled towards the east. And the king followed it together with his army of four divisions. In whatever place the wheel-treasure stood still, there the king came to stay together with his army.	In the horse sacrifice, the horse is released for a year, while the king follows it with his army, claiming any land that it wanders on as his.
dn17:1.9.1	And any opposing rulers of the eastern quarter came to him and said,	NA
dn17:1.9.2	‘Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king, instruct us.’	NA
dn17:1.9.3	The king said,	NA
dn17:1.9.4	‘Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink liquor. Maintain the current level of taxation.’	Read _bhuñjati_ at [mn98:10.30]() with _yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha_ at [dn17:1.9.4](), [dn26:6.7](), and [mn129:35.7](). These have sometimes been rendered “eat”, “enjoy”, or “govern”. But compare the archaic English “use” meaning “the benefit or profit of lands”. Thus _yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha_ means “use as has been used”, i.e. “maintain the current level of taxation”.
dn17:1.9.5	And so the opposing rulers of the eastern quarter became his vassals.	NA
dn17:1.10.1	Then the wheel-treasure, having plunged into the eastern ocean and emerged again, rolled towards the south. …	The Wheel plunges into the seas, while the sacrificial horse is born in the western and eastern seas.
dn17:1.10.2	Having plunged into the southern ocean and emerged again, it rolled towards the west. …	NA
dn17:1.10.3	Having plunged into the western ocean and emerged again, it rolled towards the north, followed by the king together with his army of four divisions.	NA
dn17:1.10.4	In whatever place the wheel-treasure stood still, there the king came to stay together with his army.	NA
dn17:1.10.5	And any opposing rulers of the northern quarter came to him and said,	NA
dn17:1.10.6	‘Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king, instruct us.’	NA
dn17:1.10.7	The king said,	NA
dn17:1.10.8	‘Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink liquor. Maintain the current level of taxation.’	NA
dn17:1.10.9	And so the opposing rulers of the northern quarter became his vassals.	Historically, India has usually been divided into squabbling realms, but from an early age there was a dream of a unified and peaceful continent.
dn17:1.11.1	And then the wheel-treasure, having triumphed over this land surrounded by ocean, returned to the royal capital. There it stood still by the gate to the royal compound at the High Court as if fixed to an axle, illuminating the royal compound.	“At the High Court” is uncertain. Read _aḍḍa_ (variants _attha_, _aṭṭa_) which in Sanskrit has the senses “solve, infer, argue, discern”. The commentary interprets _aḍḍakaraṇa_ as the “place of judgement” i.e. the court, which is clearly the case here (see also [sn3.7:1.5](), [mn89:13.3]()). The affix _-pamukha_ here does not mean “entrance”. Rather, it describes the attributes of a wheel-turning monarch in the sense of “finest” (eg. [dn17:2.5.1]()).
dn17:1.11.2	Such is the wheel-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana.	NA
dn17:1.12.0	2.2. The Elephant-Treasure	NA
dn17:1.12.1	Next, the elephant-treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana.	NA
dn17:1.12.2	It was an all-white sky-walker with psychic power, touching the ground in seven places, a king of elephants named Sabbath.	The white elephant is a symbol of royalty to this day. The description recalls Indra’s elephant Airāvata. | For _sattappatiṭṭho_, the commentary has _susaṇṭhitaaṅgapaccaṅga_ (“well-grounded on each and every limb”), a sense confirmed by the Mūlasarvāstivāda Bhaiṣajyavastu which has _saptāṅgaḥ supratiṣṭhito_ (“well-established on seven limbs”). The subcommentary lists the four feet, trunk, tail, and penis (_varaṅga_).
dn17:1.12.3	Seeing him, the king was impressed,	NA
dn17:1.12.4	‘This would truly be a fine elephant vehicle, if he would submit to taming.’	NA
dn17:1.12.5	Then the elephant-treasure submitted to taming, as if he was a fine thoroughbred elephant that had been tamed for a long time.	NA
dn17:1.12.6	Once it so happened that King Mahāsudassana, testing that same elephant-treasure, mounted him in the morning and traversed the land surrounded by ocean before returning to the royal capital in time for breakfast.	NA
dn17:1.12.7	Such is the elephant-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana.	NA
dn17:1.13.0	2.3. The Horse-Treasure	NA
dn17:1.13.1	Next, the horse-treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana.	NA
dn17:1.13.2	It was an all-white sky-walker with psychic power, with head of black and mane like woven reeds, a royal steed named Thundercloud.	The sacrificial horse is likewise white with black head or forequarters. It is identified with the sun, thus being a “sky-walker”. “Thundercloud” (_valāhaka_; Sanskrit _balāhaka_) is the name of one of the four horses of Kṛṣṇa’s chariot in the Mahābharata. The description here also recalls the Vedic sacred horse _uccaiḥśravas_.
dn17:1.13.3	Seeing him, the king was impressed,	NA
dn17:1.13.4	‘This would truly be a fine horse vehicle, if he would submit to taming.’	NA
dn17:1.13.5	Then the horse-treasure submitted to taming, as if he was a fine thoroughbred horse that had been tamed for a long time.	NA
dn17:1.13.6	Once it so happened that King Mahāsudassana, testing that same horse-treasure, mounted him in the morning and traversed the land surrounded by ocean before returning to the royal capital in time for breakfast.	NA
dn17:1.13.7	Such is the horse-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana.	NA
dn17:1.14.0	2.4. The Jewel-Treasure	NA
dn17:1.14.1	Next, the jewel-treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana.	NA
dn17:1.14.2	It was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed with all good qualities.	NA
dn17:1.14.3	And the radiance of that jewel spread all-round for a league.	NA
dn17:1.14.4	Once it so happened that King Mahāsudassana, testing that same jewel-treasure, mobilized his army of four divisions and, with the jewel hoisted on his banner, set out in the dark of the night.	NA
dn17:1.14.5	Then the villagers around them set off to work, thinking that it was day.	NA
dn17:1.14.6	Such is the jewel-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana.	NA
dn17:1.15.0	2.5. The Woman-Treasure	NA
dn17:1.15.1	Next, the woman-treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana.	NA
dn17:1.15.2	She was attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. She was neither too tall nor too short; neither too thin nor too fat; neither too dark nor too light. She outdid human beauty without reaching heavenly beauty.	NA
dn17:1.15.3	And her touch was like a tuft of cotton-wool or kapok.	NA
dn17:1.15.4	When it was cool her limbs were warm, and when it was warm her limbs were cool.	NA
dn17:1.15.5	The fragrance of sandal floated from her body, and lotus from her mouth.	NA
dn17:1.15.6	She got up before the king and went to bed after him, and was obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely.	NA
dn17:1.15.7	The woman-treasure did not betray the wheel-turning monarch even in thought, still less in deed.	NA
dn17:1.15.8	Such is the woman-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana.	NA
dn17:1.16.0	2.6. The Householder-Treasure	NA
dn17:1.16.1	Next, the householder-treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana.	NA
dn17:1.16.2	The power of clairvoyance manifested in him as a result of past deeds, by which he sees hidden treasure, both owned and ownerless.	NA
dn17:1.16.3	He approached the king and said,	NA
dn17:1.16.4	‘Relax, sire. I will take care of the treasury.’	NA
dn17:1.16.5	Once it so happened that the wheel-turning monarch, testing that same householder-treasure, boarded a boat and sailed to the middle of the Ganges river. Then he said to the householder-treasure,	NA
dn17:1.16.6	‘Householder, I need gold, both coined and uncoined.’	NA
dn17:1.16.7	‘Well then, great king, draw the boat up to one shore.’	NA
dn17:1.16.8	‘It’s right here, householder, that I need gold, both coined and uncoined.’	NA
dn17:1.16.9	Then that householder-treasure, immersing both hands in the water, pulled up a pot full of gold, both coined and uncoined, and said to the king,	NA
dn17:1.16.10	‘Is this sufficient, great king? Has enough been done, great king, enough offered?’	NA
dn17:1.16.11	The king said,	NA
dn17:1.16.12	‘That is sufficient, householder. Enough has been done, enough offered.’	NA
dn17:1.16.13	Such is the householder-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana.	NA
dn17:1.17.0	2.7. The Commander-Treasure	NA
dn17:1.18.1	Next, the commander-treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana.	NA
dn17:1.18.2	He was astute, competent, intelligent, and capable of getting the king to appoint who should be appointed, dismiss who should be dismissed, and retain who should be retained.	The “commander” (_pariṇāyaka_) is mostly found in Buddhist texts of this context, and is not a regular term of governance. This passage shows that he was responsible for management of the realm, while below he appears as commander of the army ([dn17:2.8.2]()). Elsewhere he is said to excel in strategy ([an5.134:2.5]()).
dn17:1.18.3	He approached the king and said,	NA
dn17:1.18.4	‘Relax, sire. I shall issue instructions.’	NA
dn17:1.18.5	Such is the commander-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana.	NA
dn17:1.18.6	These are the seven treasures possessed by King Mahāsudassana.	NA
dn17:1.18.7.0	3. The Four Blessings	NA
dn17:1.18.8	King Mahāsudassana possessed four blessings.	NA
dn17:1.18.9	And what are the four blessings?	NA
dn17:1.18.10	He was attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty, more so than other humans.	NA
dn17:1.18.11	This is the first blessing.	NA
dn17:1.19.1	Furthermore, he was long-lived, more so than other humans.	NA
dn17:1.19.2	This is the second blessing.	NA
dn17:1.20.1	Furthermore, he was rarely ill or unwell, and his stomach digested well, being neither too hot nor too cold, more so than other humans.	NA
dn17:1.20.2	This is the third blessing.	NA
dn17:1.21.1	Furthermore, he was as dear and beloved to the brahmins and householders	NA
dn17:1.21.2	as a father is to his children.	NA
dn17:1.21.3	NA	NA
dn17:1.21.4	And the brahmins and householders were as dear to the king	NA
dn17:1.21.5	as children are to their father.	NA
dn17:1.21.6	NA	NA
dn17:1.21.7	Once it so happened that King Mahāsudassana went with his army of four divisions to visit a park.	NA
dn17:1.21.8	Then the brahmins and householders went up to him and said,	NA
dn17:1.21.9	‘Slow down, Your Majesty, so we may see you longer!’	NA
dn17:1.21.10	And the king addressed his charioteer,	NA
dn17:1.21.11	‘Drive slowly, charioteer, so I can see the brahmins and householders longer!’	NA
dn17:1.21.12	This is the fourth blessing.	NA
dn17:1.21.13	These are the four blessings possessed by King Mahāsudassana.	NA
dn17:1.22.0	4. Lotus Ponds in the Palace of Principle	NA
dn17:1.22.1	Then King Mahāsudassana thought,	NA
dn17:1.22.2	‘Why don’t I have lotus ponds built between the palms, at intervals of a hundred bow lengths?’	NA
dn17:1.22.3	So that’s what he did.	NA
dn17:1.22.4	The lotus ponds were lined with tiles of four colors,	NA
dn17:1.22.5	made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal.	NA
dn17:1.22.6	And four flights of stairs of four colors descended into each lotus pond,	NA
dn17:1.22.7	made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal.	NA
dn17:1.22.8	The golden stairs had posts of gold, and banisters and finials of silver.	NA
dn17:1.22.9	The silver stairs had posts of silver, and banisters and finials of gold.	NA
dn17:1.22.10	The beryl stairs had posts of beryl, and banisters and finials of crystal.	NA
dn17:1.22.11	The crystal stairs had posts of crystal, and banisters and finials of beryl.	NA
dn17:1.22.12	Those lotus ponds were surrounded by two balustrades, made of gold and silver.	NA
dn17:1.22.13	The golden balustrades had posts of gold, and banisters and finials of silver.	NA
dn17:1.22.14	The silver balustrades had posts of silver, and banisters and finials of gold.	NA
dn17:1.23.1	Then King Mahāsudassana thought,	NA
dn17:1.23.2	‘Why don’t I plant flowers in the lotus ponds such as blue water lilies, and lotuses of pink, yellow, and white, blooming all year round, and accessible to the public?’	NA
dn17:1.23.3	So that’s what he did.	NA
dn17:1.23.4	Then King Mahāsudassana thought,	NA
dn17:1.23.5	‘Why don’t I appoint bath attendants to help bathe the people who come to bathe in the lotus ponds?’	NA
dn17:1.23.6	So that’s what he did.	NA
dn17:1.23.7	Then King Mahāsudassana thought,	NA
dn17:1.23.8	‘Why don’t I set up charities on the banks of the lotus ponds,	NA
dn17:1.23.9	so that those in need of food, drink, clothes, vehicles, beds, women, coined gold, or uncoined gold can get what they need?’	The jarring inclusion of “women” (_itthī_) in this list probably refers to state-sponsored prostitution.
dn17:1.23.10	So that’s what he did.	NA
dn17:1.23.11	NA	NA
dn17:1.24.1	Then the brahmins and householders came to the king bringing abundant wealth and said,	As at [dn5:19.1]().
dn17:1.24.2	‘Sire, this abundant wealth is specially for you alone; may Your Highness accept it!’	NA
dn17:1.24.3	‘There’s enough raised for me through regular taxes. Let this be for you; and here, take even more!’	NA
dn17:1.24.4	When the king turned them down, they withdrew to one side to think up a plan,	NA
dn17:1.24.5	‘It wouldn’t be proper for us to take this abundant wealth back to our own homes.	NA
dn17:1.24.6	Why don’t we build a home for King Mahāsudassana?’	NA
dn17:1.24.7	They went up to the king and said,	NA
dn17:1.24.8	‘We shall have a home built for you, sire!’	NA
dn17:1.24.9	King Mahāsudassana consented with silence.	NA
dn17:1.25.1	And then Sakka, lord of gods, knowing the king’s train of thought, addressed the godling Vissakamma,	NA
dn17:1.25.2	‘Come, dear Vissakamma, build a palace named Principle as a home for King Mahāsudassana.’	The palace is named “Principle” (_dhamma_) in recognition of the king being subject to a higher law. Normally I translate _pāsāda_ as “stilt longhouse” but here something grander is meant.
dn17:1.25.3	‘Yes, lord,’ replied Vissakamma. Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the gods of the thirty-three and appeared in front of King Mahāsudassana.	NA
dn17:1.25.4	Vissakamma said to the king,	NA
dn17:1.25.5	‘I shall build a palace named Principle as a home for you, sire.’	NA
dn17:1.25.6	King Mahāsudassana consented with silence.	NA
dn17:1.25.7	And so that’s what Vissakamma did.	NA
dn17:1.25.8	The Palace of Principle stretched for a league from east to west, and half a league from north to south.	NA
dn17:1.25.9	It was lined with tiles of four colors, three fathoms high,	NA
dn17:1.25.10	made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal.	NA
dn17:1.26.1	It had 84,000 pillars of four colors,	NA
dn17:1.26.2	made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal.	NA
dn17:1.26.3	It was covered with panels of four colors,	NA
dn17:1.26.4	made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal.	NA
dn17:1.26.5	It had twenty-four staircases of four colors,	NA
dn17:1.26.6	made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal.	NA
dn17:1.26.7	The golden stairs had posts of gold, and banisters and finials of silver.	NA
dn17:1.26.8	The silver stairs had posts of silver, and banisters and finials of gold.	NA
dn17:1.26.9	The beryl stairs had posts of beryl, and banisters and finials of crystal.	NA
dn17:1.26.10	The crystal stairs had posts of crystal, and banisters and finials of beryl.	NA
dn17:1.26.11	It had 84,000 chambers of four colors,	For _kūṭāgāra_ as “chamber” see [mn37:8.10]().
dn17:1.26.12	made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal.	NA
dn17:1.26.13	In each chamber a couch was spread: in the golden chamber a couch of silver; in the silver chamber a couch of gold; in the beryl chamber a couch of ivory; in the crystal chamber a couch of hardwood.	NA
dn17:1.26.14	At the door of the golden chamber stood a palm tree of silver, with trunk of silver, and leaves and fruits of gold.	NA
dn17:1.26.15	At the door of the silver chamber stood a palm tree of gold, with trunk of gold, and leaves and fruits of silver.	NA
dn17:1.26.16	At the door of the beryl chamber stood a palm tree of crystal, with trunk of crystal, and leaves and fruits of beryl.	NA
dn17:1.26.17	At the door of the crystal chamber stood a palm tree of beryl, with trunk of beryl, and leaves and fruits of crystal.	NA
dn17:1.27.1	Then King Mahāsudassana thought,	NA
dn17:1.27.2	‘Why don’t I build a grove of golden palm trees at the door to the great foyer, where I can sit for the day?’	NA
dn17:1.27.3	So that’s what he did.	NA
dn17:1.28.1	The Palace of Principle was surrounded by two balustrades, made of gold and silver.	NA
dn17:1.28.2	The golden balustrades had posts of gold, and banisters and finials of silver.	NA
dn17:1.28.3	The silver balustrades had posts of silver, and banisters and finials of gold.	NA
dn17:1.29.1	The Palace of Principle was surrounded by two nets of bells,	NA
dn17:1.29.2	made of gold and silver.	NA
dn17:1.29.3	The golden net had bells of silver, and the silver net had bells of gold.	NA
dn17:1.29.4	When those nets of bells were blown by the wind they sounded graceful, tantalizing, sensuous, lovely, and intoxicating,	NA
dn17:1.29.5	like a quintet made up of skilled musicians who had practiced well and kept excellent rhythm.	NA
dn17:1.29.6	NA	NA
dn17:1.29.7	And any addicts, carousers, or drunkards in Kusāvatī at that time were entertained by that sound.	NA
dn17:1.29.8	When it was finished, the palace was hard to look at, dazzling to the eyes.	NA
dn17:1.29.9	It was like how in the last month of the rainy season, in autumn, when the heavens are clear and cloudless, as the sun is rising to the firmament, it is hard to look at, dazzling to the eyes.	NA
dn17:1.29.10	NA	NA
dn17:1.30.1	Then King Mahāsudassana thought,	NA
dn17:1.30.2	‘Why don’t I build a lotus pond named Principle in front of the palace?’	NA
dn17:1.30.3	So that’s what he did.	NA
dn17:1.30.4	The Lotus Pond of Principle stretched for a league from east to west, and half a league from north to south.	NA
dn17:1.30.5	It was lined with tiles of four colors,	NA
dn17:1.30.6	made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal.	NA
dn17:1.31.1	It had twenty-four staircases of four colors,	NA
dn17:1.31.2	made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal.	NA
dn17:1.31.3	The golden stairs had posts of gold, and banisters and finials of silver.	NA
dn17:1.31.4	The silver stairs had posts of silver, and banisters and finials of gold.	NA
dn17:1.31.5	The beryl stairs had posts of beryl, and banisters and finials of crystal.	NA
dn17:1.31.6	The crystal stairs had posts of crystal, and banisters and finials of beryl.	NA
dn17:1.31.7	It was surrounded by two balustrades, made of gold and silver.	NA
dn17:1.31.8	The golden balustrades had posts of gold, and banisters and finials of silver.	NA
dn17:1.31.9	The silver balustrades had posts of silver, and banisters and finials of gold.	NA
dn17:1.32.1	It was surrounded by seven rows of palm trees,	NA
dn17:1.32.2	made of gold, silver, beryl, crystal, ruby, emerald, and all precious things.	NA
dn17:1.32.3	The golden palms had trunks of gold, and leaves and fruits of silver.	NA
dn17:1.32.4	The silver palms had trunks of silver, and leaves and fruits of gold.	NA
dn17:1.32.5	The beryl palms had trunks of beryl, and leaves and fruits of crystal.	NA
dn17:1.32.6	The crystal palms had trunks of crystal, and leaves and fruits of beryl.	NA
dn17:1.32.7	The ruby palms had trunks of ruby, and leaves and fruits of emerald.	NA
dn17:1.32.8	The emerald palms had trunks of emerald, and leaves and fruits of ruby.	NA
dn17:1.32.9	The palms of all precious things had trunks of all precious things, and leaves and fruits of all precious things.	NA
dn17:1.32.10	When those rows of palm trees were blown by the wind they sounded graceful, tantalizing, sensuous, lovely, and intoxicating,	NA
dn17:1.32.11	like a quintet made up of skilled musicians who had practiced well and kept excellent rhythm.	NA
dn17:1.32.12	NA	NA
dn17:1.32.13	And any addicts, carousers, or drunkards in Kusāvatī at that time were entertained by that sound.	NA
dn17:1.33.1	When the palace and its lotus pond were finished, King Mahāsudassana served those who were deemed true ascetics and brahmins with all they desired. Then he ascended the Palace of Principle.	NA
dn17:1.33.2	The first recitation section.	NA
dn17:2.1.0	5. Attaining Absorption	NA
dn17:2.1.1	Then King Mahāsudassana thought,	NA
dn17:2.1.2	‘Of what deed of mine is this the fruit and result, that I am now so mighty and powerful?’	NA
dn17:2.1.3	Then King Mahāsudassana thought,	NA
dn17:2.1.4	‘It is the fruit and result of three kinds of deeds:	Thus denying the doctrine of Pūraṇa Kassapa at [dn2:17.5](). This is the recognition, at least partially, of right view.
dn17:2.1.5	giving, self-control, and restraint.’	NA
dn17:2.2.1	Then he went to the great foyer, stood at the door, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	The _mahāviyūha_ must have been some kind of structure at the entrance to the palace, a “foyer”.
dn17:2.2.2	‘Stop here, sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts—	These are the three factors of right thought. The king skillfully uses a transition in physical space to set up his intention to meditate.
dn17:2.2.3	no further!’	NA
dn17:2.3.1	Then he entered the great foyer and sat on the golden couch. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, he entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	Here as in [dn1](), _jhāna_ is not a uniquely Buddhist practice.
dn17:2.3.2	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, he entered and remained in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
dn17:2.3.3	And with the fading away of rapture, he entered and remained in the third absorption, where he meditated with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA
dn17:2.3.4	With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, he entered and remained in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
dn17:2.4.1	Then King Mahāsudassana left the great foyer and entered the golden chamber, where he sat on the golden couch.	NA
dn17:2.4.2	He meditated spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way he spread a heart full of love above, below, across, everywhere, all around, to everyone in the world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	NA
dn17:2.4.3	He meditated spreading a heart full of compassion …	NA
dn17:2.4.4	He meditated spreading a heart full of rejoicing …	NA
dn17:2.4.5	He meditated spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, he spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	NA
dn17:2.5.0	6. Of All Cities	NA
dn17:2.5.1	King Mahāsudassana had 84,000 cities, with the royal capital of Kusāvatī foremost.	NA
dn17:2.5.2	He had 84,000 palaces, with the Palace of Principle foremost.	NA
dn17:2.5.3	He had 84,000 chambers, with the great foyer foremost.	NA
dn17:2.5.4	He had 84,000 couches made of gold, silver, ivory, and hardwood. They were spread with woollen covers—shag-piled, pure white, or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red pillows at both ends.	This segment breaks the expected pattern of “foremost” things.
dn17:2.5.5	He had 84,000 bull elephants with gold adornments and banners, covered with snow gold netting, with the royal bull elephant named Sabbath foremost.	NA
dn17:2.5.6	He had 84,000 horses with gold adornments and banners, covered with snow gold netting, with the royal steed named Thundercloud foremost.	NA
dn17:2.5.7	He had 84,000 chariots upholstered with the hide of lions, tigers, and leopards, and cream rugs, with gold adornments and banners, covered with snow gold netting, with the chariot named Triumph foremost.	Not the British car of the same name. The chariot is the source of victory in battle.
dn17:2.5.8	He had 84,000 jewels, with the jewel-treasure foremost.	NA
dn17:2.5.9	He had 84,000 women, with Queen Subhaddā foremost.	NA
dn17:2.5.10	He had 84,000 householders, with the householder-treasure foremost.	NA
dn17:2.5.11	He had 84,000 aristocrat vassals, with the commander-treasure foremost.	NA
dn17:2.5.12	He had 84,000 milk-cows with silken reins and bronze pails.	Read _dukūlasandanāni_, where _dukūla_ is “fine cloth, silk” and _sandana_ is “cord, tether”.
dn17:2.5.13	He had 8,400,000,000 fine cloths of linen, cotton, silk, and wool.	NA
dn17:2.5.14	He had 84,000 servings of food, which were presented to him as offerings in the morning and evening.	NA
dn17:2.6.1	Now at that time his 84,000 royal elephants came to attend on him in the morning and evening.	NA
dn17:2.6.2	Then King Mahāsudassana thought,	NA
dn17:2.6.3	‘What if instead half of the elephants took turns to attend on me at the end of each century?’	An odd detail. Maybe the sound of the elephants disturbed his meditation?
dn17:2.6.4	He instructed the commander-treasure to do this, and so it was done.	NA
dn17:2.6.5	NA	NA
dn17:2.6.6	NA	NA
dn17:2.6.7	NA	NA
dn17:2.7.0	7. The Visit of Queen Subhaddā	NA
dn17:2.7.1	Then, after many years, many hundred years, many thousand years had passed, Queen Subhaddā thought,	NA
dn17:2.7.2	‘It is long since I have seen the king. Why don’t I go to see him?’	NA
dn17:2.7.3	So the queen addressed the ladies of the harem,	NA
dn17:2.7.4	‘Come, bathe your heads and dress in yellow.	NA
dn17:2.7.5	It is long since we saw the king, and we shall go to see him.’	NA
dn17:2.7.6	‘Yes, ma’am,’ replied the ladies of the harem. They did as she asked and returned to the queen.	NA
dn17:2.8.1	Then the queen addressed the commander-treasure,	NA
dn17:2.8.2	‘Dear commander-treasure, please ready the army of four divisions. It is long since we saw the king, and we shall go to see him.’	NA
dn17:2.8.3	‘Yes, my queen,’ he replied, and did as he was asked. He informed the queen,	NA
dn17:2.8.4	‘My queen, the army of four divisions is ready,	NA
dn17:2.8.5	please go at your convenience.’	NA
dn17:2.8.6	Then Queen Subhaddā together with the ladies of the harem went with the army to the Palace of Principle. She ascended the palace and went to the great foyer,	NA
dn17:2.8.7	where she stood leaning against a door-post.	Like Ānanda at [dn16:5.13.1]().
dn17:2.8.8	Hearing them, the king thought,	NA
dn17:2.8.9	‘What’s that, it sounds like a big crowd!’ Coming out of the foyer he saw Queen Subhaddā leaning against a door-post and said to her,	NA
dn17:2.8.10	‘Please stay there, my queen, don’t enter in here.’	He makes it clear that this will not be an intimate visit.
dn17:2.9.1	Then he addressed a certain man,	NA
dn17:2.9.2	‘Come, worthy man, bring the golden couch from the great foyer and set it up in the golden palm grove.’	NA
dn17:2.9.3	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ that man replied, and did as he was asked.	NA
dn17:2.9.4	The king laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware.	NA
dn17:2.10.1	Then Queen Subhaddā thought,	NA
dn17:2.10.2	‘The king’s faculties are so very clear, and the complexion of his skin is pure and bright. Let him not pass away!’ She said to him,	The aorist is not past tense, as it is governed by _mā_.
dn17:2.10.3	‘Sire, you have 84,000 cities, with the royal capital of Kusāvatī foremost.	NA
dn17:2.10.4	Arouse desire for these! Take an interest in life!’	“Desire” is _chanda_, the first of the four bases of psychic power, which in [dn16:3.3.1]() are said to lead to long life. By urging him to live long, she inverts the Mahāparinibbānasutta where Ānanda fails to do the same.
dn17:2.10.5	And she likewise urged the king to live on by taking an interest in all his possessions as described above.	NA

dn17:2.11.3	And yet in my final hour, your words are unwelcome, undesirable, disagreeable, and unpleasant!’	Implying that Ānanda was right to not beg the Buddha to live long.
dn17:2.11.4	‘Then how exactly, Your Majesty, am I to speak to you?’	NA
dn17:2.11.5	‘Like this, my queen:	NA

dn17:2.13.0	8. Rebirth in the Realm of Divinity	NA
dn17:2.13.1	Not long after that, King Mahāsudassana passed away.	NA
dn17:2.13.2	And the feeling he had close to death was like a householder or their child falling asleep after eating a delectable meal.	This contrasts with the Buddha’s last meal at [dn16:4.20.1](), which caused sickness and distress. The Buddha was rejecting existence entirely, whereas Mahāsudassana was continuing in a pleasant form of conditioned existence.
dn17:2.13.3	When he passed away King Mahāsudassana was reborn in a good place, a realm of divinity.	NA
dn17:2.13.4	Ānanda, King Mahāsudassana played children’s games for 84,000 years.	NA
dn17:2.13.5	He ruled as viceroy for 84,000 years.	NA
dn17:2.13.6	He ruled as king for 84,000 years.	NA
dn17:2.13.7	He led the spiritual life as a layman in the Palace of Principle for 84,000 years.	NA
dn17:2.13.8	And having developed the four divine meditations, when his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in a good place, a realm of divinity.	NA
dn17:2.14.1	Now, Ānanda, you might think:	NA
dn17:2.14.2	‘Surely King Mahāsudassana must have been someone else at that time?’	NA
dn17:2.14.3	But you should not see it like that. I myself was King Mahāsudassana at that time.	After [dn5:21.16](), this is the second Jātaka in the Dīghanikāya.
dn17:2.14.4	Mine were the 84,000 cities, with the royal capital of Kusāvatī foremost. And mine were all the other possessions.	NA
dn17:2.15.1	Of those 84,000 cities, I only stayed in one, the capital Kusāvatī.	NA
dn17:2.15.2	Of those 84,000 mansions, I only dwelt in one, the Palace of Principle.	NA
dn17:2.15.3	Of those 84,000 chambers, I only dwelt in the great foyer.	NA
dn17:2.15.4	Of those 84,000 couches, I only used one, made of gold or silver or ivory or heartwood.	NA
dn17:2.15.5	Of those 84,000 bull elephants, I only rode one, the royal bull elephant named Sabbath.	NA
dn17:2.15.6	Of those 84,000 horses, I only rode one, the royal horse named Thundercloud.	NA
dn17:2.15.7	Of those 84,000 chariots, I only rode one, the chariot named Triumph.	NA
dn17:2.15.8	Of those 84,000 women, I was only served by one, a maiden of the aristocratic or peasant classes.	Accepting the Mahāsaṅgīti’s reading of _vessinī_. I believe the variant _velāmikā_ is a ghost word contaminated from [an9.20:4.1]().
dn17:2.15.9	Of those 8,400,000,000 cloths, I only wore one pair, made of fine linen, cotton, silk, or wool.	NA
dn17:2.15.10	Of those 84,000 servings of food, I only had one, eating at most a cup of rice with suitable sauce.	NA
dn17:2.16.1	See, Ānanda! All those conditioned phenomena have passed, ceased, and perished.	NA
dn17:2.16.2	So impermanent are conditions,	NA
dn17:2.16.3	so unstable are conditions,	NA
dn17:2.16.4	so unreliable are conditions.	NA
dn17:2.16.5	This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions.	NA
dn17:2.17.1	Six times, Ānanda, I recall having laid down my body at this place. And the seventh time was as a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king, at which time my dominion extended to all four sides, I achieved stability in the country, and I possessed the seven treasures.	NA
dn17:2.17.2	But Ānanda, I do not see any place in this world with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans where the Realized One would lay down his body for the eighth time.”	NA
dn17:2.17.3	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
dn17:2.17.4	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	NA
dn17:2.17.5	“Oh! Conditions are impermanent,	NA
dn17:2.17.6	their nature is to rise and fall;	NA
dn17:2.17.7	having arisen, they cease;	NA
dn17:2.17.8	their stilling is such bliss.”	NA
dn18:0.1	Long Discourses 18	NA
dn18:0.2	With Janavasabha	NA
dn18:1.0	1. Declaring the Rebirths of People From Ñātika and Elsewhere	NA
dn18:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
dn18:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying at Ñātika in the brick house.	This picks up from the events of [dn16:2.5.1](), which however discusses only the Ñātikans (who are reckoned among the Vajjis). Like [dn17](), it bears many signs of a late sutta. The overall theme is the presence of a cosmic order where the liberating teaching of the Buddha is reconciled with the requirements of worldly power.
dn18:1.3	Now at that time the Buddha was explaining the rebirths of devotees all over the nations; the Kāsis and Kosalans, Vajjis and Mallas, Cetīs and Vacchas, Kurus and Pañcālas, Macchas and Sūrasenas:	This list of ten nations is unique. The omission of the Aṅgas and Magadhans is noted below. The more famous list of “sixteen nations” adds Avanti and Assaka in the south, and Gandhāra and Kamboja in the north-west (eg. [an3.70:28.3]()). The Buddha did not visit these lands, which explains why they are omitted.
dn18:1.4	“This one was reborn here, while that one was reborn there.	NA
dn18:1.5	Over fifty devotees in Ñātika have passed away having ended the five lower fetters. They’ve been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.	“Devotees” is _paricāraka_, which normally means “servant”. It is not in the relevant passages of DN 16. This sense is found  in only a couple of other places, both late ([snp5.18:1.2](), [pli-tv-kd1:22.14.8]()).
dn18:1.6	More than ninety devotees in Ñātika have passed away having ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. They’re once-returners, who will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.	NA
dn18:1.7	More than five hundred devotees in Ñātika have passed away having ended three fetters. They’re stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.”	NA
dn18:2.1	When the devotees of Ñātika heard about the Buddha’s	NA
dn18:2.2	NA	NA
dn18:2.3	NA	NA
dn18:2.4	NA	NA
dn18:2.5	NA	NA
dn18:2.6	NA	NA
dn18:2.7	answers to those questions, they became uplifted and overjoyed, full of rapture and happiness.	NA
dn18:3.1	Venerable Ānanda heard of the Buddha’s statements and the Ñātikans’ happiness.	NA
dn18:3.2	NA	NA
dn18:3.3	NA	NA
dn18:3.4	NA	NA
dn18:3.5	NA	NA
dn18:3.6	NA	NA
dn18:3.7	NA	NA
dn18:4.0	2. Ānanda’s Suggestion	NA
dn18:4.1	Then Venerable Ānanda thought,	NA
dn18:4.2	“But there were also Magadhan devotees—many, and of long standing too—who have passed away.	Bearing in mind that none of the nations were actually mentioned in the relevant Mahāparinibbānasutta passage, this whole introduction is framed to emphasize the importance of Magadha to Buddhism, especially given the problematic character of Ajātasattu. In the decades following the Buddha’s death, the Buddhist community adapted to a new political landscape which for a time saw the entirety of Buddhism contained within the sprawling Magadhan empire.
dn18:4.3	You’d think that Aṅga and Magadha were empty of devotees who have passed away!	NA
dn18:4.4	But they too had confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and had fulfilled their ethics.	NA
dn18:4.5	The Buddha hasn’t declared their passing.	NA
dn18:4.6	It would be good to do so, for many people would gain confidence, and so be reborn in a good place.	NA
dn18:4.7	That King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was a just and principled king who benefited the brahmins and householders, and people of town and country.	As we known from [dn2](), Bimbisāra had recently been murdered by Ajātasattu.
dn18:4.8	People still sing his praises:	NA
dn18:4.9	‘That just and principled king, who made us so happy, has passed away. Life was good under his dominion.’	A not-so-subtle hint of the changes under Ajātasattu. The passing of Bimbisāra signifies the crumbling of the social order that prevailed in the Buddha’s lifetime, bringing with it the immediate threat of war and chaos. This sutta establishes a timeless order that persists while worldly conditions fluctuate.
dn18:4.10	He too had confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and had fulfilled his ethics.	NA
dn18:4.11	People say:	NA
dn18:4.12	‘Until his dying day, King Bimbisāra sang the Buddha’s praises!’	Elsewhere the suttas say that Bimbisāra went for refuge ([dn4:6.33]()), while the Vinaya says he was in fact a stream-enterer ([pli-tv-kd1:22.9.1]()), which is confirmed below. The Jains, however, claim him as one of their own but say he went to hell for committing suicide. Like his son Ajātasattu, it is likely that he frequented several teachers in his realm.
dn18:4.13	The Buddha hasn’t declared his passing.	NA
dn18:4.14	It would be good to do so, for many people would gain confidence, and so be reborn in a good place.	NA
dn18:4.15	Besides, the Buddha was awakened in Magadha;	Near the town of  Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjarā River at the place known today as Bodhgaya.
dn18:4.16	so why hasn’t he declared the rebirth of the Magadhan devotees?	NA
dn18:4.17	If he fails to do so, they will be dejected.”	NA
dn18:4.18	NA	NA
dn18:5.1	After pondering the fate of the Magadhan devotees alone in private, Ānanda rose at the crack of dawn and went to see the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told the Buddha of his concerns, finishing by saying,	NA
dn18:5.2	NA	NA
dn18:5.3	NA	NA
dn18:5.4	NA	NA
dn18:5.5	NA	NA
dn18:5.6	NA	NA
dn18:5.7	NA	NA
dn18:5.8	NA	NA
dn18:5.9	NA	NA
dn18:5.10	NA	NA
dn18:5.11	NA	NA
dn18:5.12	NA	NA
dn18:5.13	NA	NA
dn18:5.14	NA	NA
dn18:5.15	NA	NA

dn18:6.5	NA	NA
dn18:6.6	NA	NA
dn18:6.7	NA	NA
dn18:6.8	NA	NA
dn18:6.9	“Why hasn’t the Buddha declared the rebirth of the Magadhan devotees? If he fails to do so, they will be dejected.”	NA
dn18:6.10	Then Ānanda, after making this suggestion regarding the Magadhan devotees, got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	“Suggestion” is _parikathaṁ_, which elsewhere occurs in the Vinaya ([pli-tv-kd7:1.5.16]()) and the Abhidhamma Vibhaṅga ([vb17:43.2]()) in the sense of “hint”.
dn18:7.1	Soon after Ānanda had left, the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Ñātika for alms.	NA
dn18:7.2	He wandered for alms in Ñātika. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he washed his feet and entered the brick house. He paid attention, applied the mind, and concentrated wholeheartedly on the fate of Magadhan devotees, and sat on the seat spread out, thinking,	Normally _aṭṭhiṁ katvā manasikatvā sabbaṁ cetasā samannāharitvā_ describes listening to Dhamma. This whole process seems unusually laborious.
dn18:7.3	“I shall know their destiny, where they are reborn in the next life.”	NA
dn18:7.4	And he saw where they had been reborn.	NA
dn18:7.5	NA	NA
dn18:7.6	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat. Emerging from the brick house, he sat on the seat spread out in the shade of the porch.	NA
dn18:8.1	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
dn18:8.2	“Sir, you look so serene; your face seems to shine owing to the clarity of your faculties.	NA
dn18:8.3	Have you been abiding in a peaceful meditation today, sir?”	NA
dn18:9.1	The Buddha then recounted what had happened since speaking to Ānanda, revealing that he had seen the destiny of the Magadhan devotees. He continued:	NA
dn18:9.2	NA	NA
dn18:9.3	NA	NA
dn18:9.4.0	3. Janavasabha the Spirit	NA
dn18:9.5	“Then, Ānanda, a vanished spirit called out:	NA
dn18:9.6	‘I am Janavasabha, Blessed One!	NA
dn18:9.7	I am Janavasabha, Holy One!’	NA
dn18:9.8	Ānanda, do you recall having previously heard such a name as Janavasabha?”	_Nāmadheyyaṁ_ means “name (borne by someone or something)”, not “one who bears the name” ([mn50:22.1]()).
dn18:9.9	“No, worthy sir. But when I heard the word, I got goosebumps!	NA
dn18:9.10	I thought,	NA
dn18:9.11	‘This must be no ordinary spirit to bear such an exalted name as Janavasabha.’”	_Janavasabha_ is “chief of men”, spelled _janesabha_ at [dn20:10.10]() and [dn32:10.9](). The synonym _narāsabha_ is an occasional poetic epithet of the Buddha ([snp3.11:6.2](), [snp5.1:21.3](), [sn11.3:14.2]()). In Sanskrit we find _puruṣaṛṣabha_ in the same sense.
dn18:10.1	“After making himself heard while vanished, Ānanda, a very beautiful spirit appeared in front of me.	_Uḷāravaṇṇa_ describes beautiful people at [mn96:7.8]().
dn18:10.2	And for a second time he called out:	NA
dn18:10.3	‘I am Bimbisāra, Blessed One!	NA
dn18:10.4	I am Bimbisāra, Holy One!	NA
dn18:10.5	This is the seventh time I am reborn in the company of the Great King Vessavaṇa. When I pass away from here, I can become a king of men.	Read _ito_. I think this implies what is stated more explicitly in Anuruddha’s partly parallel verses at [thag16.9:23.1](): after each of seven rebirths under Vessavaṇa he can become a king of men. This explains the name Janavasabha.
dn18:10.6	Seven from here, seven from there—	NA
dn18:10.7	fourteen transmigrations in all.	It is rare to see _saṁsāra_ used as a countable noun, but see [thag2.48:2.2]().
dn18:10.8	I remember these lives	NA
dn18:10.9	where I lived before.	NA
dn18:10.10	For a long time I’ve known that I won’t be reborn in the underworld, but that I still hope to become a once-returner.’	As a stream-enterer he is freed from any lower rebirths, yet he still aspires to a higher realization.
dn18:10.11	‘It’s incredible and amazing that you, the venerable spirit Janavasabha, should say:	NA
dn18:10.12	“For a long time I’ve been aware that I won’t be reborn in the underworld” and also “But I still hope to become a once-returner.” But from what source do you know that you’ve achieved such a high distinction?’	In this idiom, the verb for “aware” varies between _sañjānāti_, _jānāti_, _pajānāti_, and _sampajānāti_.
dn18:11.1	‘None other than the Blessed One’s instruction! None other than the Holy One’s instruction!	Compare [sn1.50:5.1]() and [sn2.24:6.1]().
dn18:11.2	From the day I had absolute devotion to the Buddha I have known that I won’t be reborn in the underworld, but that I still hope to become a once-returner.	NA
dn18:11.3	Just now, sir, I had been sent out by the great king Vessavaṇa to the great king Virūḷhaka’s presence on some business, and on the way I saw the Buddha giving his attention to the fate of the Magadhan devotees.	NA
dn18:11.4	NA	NA
dn18:11.5	But it comes as no surprise that I have heard and learned the fate of the Magadhan devotees in the presence of the great king Vessavaṇa as he was speaking to his assembly.	NA
dn18:11.6	NA	NA
dn18:11.7	It occurred to me,	NA
dn18:11.8	“I shall see the Buddha and inform him of this.”	NA
dn18:11.9	These are the two reasons I’ve come to see the Buddha.	NA
dn18:12.0	4. The Council of the Gods	NA
dn18:12.1	Sir, it was more than a few days ago—on the fifteenth day sabbath on the full moon day at the entry to the rainy season—when all the gods of the thirty-three were sitting together in the Hall of Justice.	It is not just the Vajjis and the Buddhist Saṅgha who meet frequently in a hall to discuss business, but the gods as well. Here we get a rare glimpse into how the heavens work, or more to the point, how depictions of heavenly proceedings act as a template for how things should be on earth.
dn18:12.2	A large assembly of gods was sitting all around, and the four great kings were seated at the four quarters.	The thirty-three and the Four Great Kings are both present; the heavenly realms are not shut off from one another.
dn18:12.3	The Great King Dhataraṭṭha was seated to the east, facing west, in front of his gods.	NA
dn18:12.4	The Great King Virūḷhaka was seated to the south, facing north, in front of his gods.	NA
dn18:12.5	The Great King Virūpakkha was seated to the west, facing east, in front of his gods.	NA
dn18:12.6	The Great King Vessavaṇa was seated to the north, facing south, in front of his gods.	NA
dn18:12.7	When the gods of the thirty-three have a gathering like this, that is how they are seated.	NA
dn18:12.8	After that come our seats.	NA
dn18:12.9	Sir, those gods who had been recently reborn in the company of the thirty-three after leading the spiritual life under the Buddha outshone the other gods in beauty and glory.	NA
dn18:12.10	The gods of the thirty-three became uplifted and overjoyed at that, full of rapture and happiness, saying,	NA
dn18:12.11	“The heavenly hosts swell, while the titan hosts dwindle!”	NA
dn18:13.1	Seeing the joy of those gods, Sakka, lord of gods, celebrated with these verses:	NA
dn18:13.2	“The gods rejoice—	NA
dn18:13.3	the thirty-three with their Lord—	NA
dn18:13.4	revering the Realized One,	NA
dn18:13.5	and the natural excellence of the teaching;	NA
dn18:13.6	and seeing the new gods,	NA
dn18:13.7	so beautiful and glorious,	NA
dn18:13.8	who have come here after leading	NA
dn18:13.9	the spiritual life under the Buddha!	NA
dn18:13.10	They outshine the others	NA
dn18:13.11	in beauty, glory, and lifespan.	NA
dn18:13.12	Here are the distinguished disciples	NA
dn18:13.13	of he whose wisdom is vast.	NA
dn18:13.14	Seeing this, they delight—	NA
dn18:13.15	the thirty-three with their Lord—	NA
dn18:13.16	revering the Realized One,	NA
dn18:13.17	and the natural excellence of the teaching.”	NA
dn18:13.18	The gods of the thirty-three became even more uplifted and overjoyed at that, saying:	NA
dn18:13.19	“The heavenly hosts swell, while the titan hosts dwindle!”	NA
dn18:14.1	Then the gods of the thirty-three, having considered and deliberated on the matter for which they were seated together in the Hall of Justice, advised and instructed the four great kings on the subject.	NA
dn18:14.2	Each one, having been advised, stood at his own seat without departing.	For _vipakkamati_ compare [mn127:11.1]().
dn18:14.3	The Kings were instructed,	NA
dn18:14.4	and heeded good advice.	NA
dn18:14.5	With clear and peaceful minds,	NA
dn18:14.6	they stood by their own seats.	NA
dn18:15.1	Then in the northern quarter a magnificent light arose and radiance appeared, surpassing the glory of the gods.	Compare [dn11:80.12]().
dn18:15.2	Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the thirty-three,	NA
dn18:15.3	“As indicated by the signs—light arising and radiance appearing—The Divinity will appear. For this is the precursor for the appearance of the Divinity, namely light arising and radiance appearing.”	NA
dn18:15.4	As indicated by the signs,	NA
dn18:15.5	The Divinity will appear.	NA
dn18:15.6	For this is the sign of the Divinity:	NA
dn18:15.7	a light vast and great.	NA
dn18:16.0	5. On Sanaṅkumāra	NA
dn18:16.1	Then the gods of the thirty-three sat in their own seats, saying,	NA
dn18:16.2	“We shall find out what has caused that light, and only when we have realized it shall we go to it.”	For _vipāko bhavissati_ in discerning the results of signs, compare [dn1:1.24.2]().
dn18:16.3	And the four great kings did likewise.	NA
dn18:16.4	NA	NA
dn18:16.5	Hearing that, the gods of the thirty-three agreed in unison,	NA
dn18:16.6	“We shall find out what has caused that light, and only when we have realized it shall we go to it.”	NA
dn18:17.1	When the divinity Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the thirty-three, he does so after manifesting in a solid life-form.	See [an3.127:2.3]().
dn18:17.2	For a Divinity’s normal appearance is imperceptible in the visual range of the gods of the thirty-three.	This phrase is also at [dn19:16.8](), but apart from that the words _pakativaṇṇa_ (“normal appearance”), _anabhisambhavanīya_ (“imperceptible”), and _cakkhupatha_ (“visual range”) are all unique in the early texts.
dn18:17.3	When the divinity Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the thirty-three, he outshines the other gods in beauty and glory,	NA
dn18:17.4	as a golden statue outshines the human form.	For the unique term “human form” (_mānusaṁ viggahaṁ_) compare the Vinaya phrase _manussaviggahaṁ_ ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.49.1]()).
dn18:17.5	NA	NA
dn18:17.6	When the divinity Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the thirty-three, not a single god in that assembly greets him by bowing down or rising up or inviting him to a seat.	NA
dn18:17.7	They all sit silently on their couches with their joined palms raised, thinking,	NA
dn18:17.8	“Now the divinity Sanaṅkumāra will sit on the couch of whatever god he chooses.”	NA
dn18:17.9	And the god on whose couch the Divinity sits is overjoyed and brimming with happiness,	NA
dn18:18.1	like a king on the day of his coronation.	NA
dn18:18.2	NA	NA
dn18:18.3	Then the divinity Sanaṅkumāra manifested in a solid life-form, taking on the appearance of the youth Pañcasikha, and appeared to the gods of the thirty-three.	Also appearing in [dn21:1.8.3](), [dn20:10.11](), and [sn35.119](), Pañcasikha (“Five-Crest”) was a handsome and virile deity of the _gandhabbas_.
dn18:18.4	Rising into the air, he sat cross-legged in the sky,	NA
dn18:18.5	like a strong man might sit cross-legged on a well-appointed couch or on level ground.	NA
dn18:18.6	Seeing the joy of those gods, the divinity Sanaṅkumāra celebrated with these verses:	NA
dn18:18.7	“The gods rejoice—	NA
dn18:18.8	the thirty-three with their Lord—	NA
dn18:18.9	revering the Realized One,	NA
dn18:18.10	and the natural excellence of the teaching;	NA
dn18:18.11	and seeing the new gods,	NA
dn18:18.12	so beautiful and glorious,	NA
dn18:18.13	who have come here after leading	NA
dn18:18.14	the spiritual life under the Buddha!	NA
dn18:18.15	They outshine the others	NA
dn18:18.16	in beauty, glory, and lifespan.	NA
dn18:18.17	Here are the distinguished disciples	NA
dn18:18.18	of he whose wisdom is vast.	NA
dn18:18.19	Seeing this, they delight—	NA
dn18:18.20	the thirty-three with their Lord—	NA
dn18:18.21	revering the Realized One,	NA
dn18:18.22	and the natural excellence of the teaching!”	NA
dn18:19.1	That is the topic on which the divinity Sanaṅkumāra spoke.	_Bhāsittha_ is 3rd singular aorist middle voice.
dn18:19.2	And while he was speaking on that topic, his voice had eight qualities: it was clear, comprehensible, charming, audible, lucid, undistorted, deep, and resonant.	Compare [mn91:21.4]().
dn18:19.3	He makes sure his voice is intelligible as far as the assembly goes, but the sound doesn’t extend outside the assembly.	NA
dn18:19.4	When someone has a voice like this, they’re said to have the voice of the Divinity.	NA
dn18:20.1	Then the divinity Sanaṅkumāra, having manifested thirty-three life-forms, sat down on the couches of each of the gods of the thirty-three and addressed them,	NA
dn18:20.2	“What do the good gods of the thirty-three think? How the Buddha has acted for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!	Everything Sanaṅkumāra says is just a bit off. Here he adopts an idiom commonly used by the Buddha, but in third person rather than the Buddha’s second person; and he asks only rhetorically, where the Buddha engages with his audience. If it were only this one example it would mean nothing, but similar changes happen throughout. I believe this is a subtle literary device that tells two narratives to two audiences. To potential converts it sounds like Sanaṅkumāra is giving a ringing and learned endorsement of Buddhism, while to knowledgeable Buddhists he appears as less than well versed in the teachings. I note these eccentric wordings as we proceed.
dn18:20.3	For consider those who have gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and have fulfilled their ethics. When their bodies break up, after death, some are reborn in the company of the gods who control what is imagined by others, some with the gods who love to imagine, some with the joyful gods, some with the gods of Yama, some with the gods of the thirty-three, and some with the gods of the four great kings.	The sutta began by recounting those who have achieved various stages of awakening. But escape from rebirth threatens the gods; this potentially fraught relationship is played out in [mn49](). Sanaṅkumāra is preempting such arguments by pointing out that many of the Buddha’s followers are reborn among the gods and do not escape transmigration, at least not for now. This is no trivial metaphysical argument. In order for Buddhism to prevail, it must show that its radical soteriology is compatible with worldly prosperity, lest it face opposition from kings and other temporal powers. The gods act as proxies to demonstrate the appropriate behavior for terrestrial kings. This is why the leading character is Bimbisāra/Janavasabha, who straddles the two realms.
dn18:20.4	And at the very least they swell the hosts of the centaurs.”	NA
dn18:21.1	That is the topic on which the divinity Sanaṅkumāra spoke.	NA
dn18:21.2	And hearing the sound of the Divinity speaking on that topic, the gods fancied,	NA
dn18:21.3	“The one sitting on my couch is the only one speaking.”	NA
dn18:21.4	When one is speaking,	NA
dn18:21.5	all the forms speak.	NA
dn18:21.6	When one sits in silence,	NA
dn18:21.7	they all remain silent.	NA
dn18:21.8	But those gods imagine—	NA
dn18:21.9	the thirty-three with their Lord—	NA
dn18:21.10	that the one on their seat	NA
dn18:21.11	is the only one to speak.	NA
dn18:22.1	Next the divinity Sanaṅkumāra merged into one corporeal form. Then he sat on the couch of Sakka, lord of gods, and addressed the gods of the thirty-three:	Sanaṅkumāra begins sharing the Buddha’s teaching with the gods, starting with the bases of psychic power that featured prominently in DN 16. Here, however, he focuses on the worldly dimensions of psychic powers, ignoring the liberating dimension that was central to the Buddha. This sets the pattern for the teachings to follow, except for the very last.
dn18:22.2.0	6. Developing the Bases of Psychic Power	NA
dn18:22.3	“What do the good gods of the thirty-three think? How well described by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—are the four bases of psychic power! They are taught for the amplification, burgeoning, and transformation of psychic power.	_Yāva supaññattā_, which is also at [mn51:4.3](), is a variation of the common exclamation _yāva subhāsita_. The phrase _iddhipahutāya iddhivisavitāya iddhivikubbanatāya_ is unique. The Paṭisambhidāmagga draws on this passage to explain _vikubbana_ both as a general term for development of psychic powers ([ps3.2:4.3]()) and as specific kind of psychic power, namely the transformation of one’s apparent form as demonstrated by Sanaṅkumāra ([ps3.2:15.1]()).
dn18:22.4	What four?	NA
dn18:22.5	It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort.	NA
dn18:22.6	They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy, and active effort.	NA
dn18:22.7	They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to mental development, and active effort.	NA
dn18:22.8	They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to inquiry, and active effort.	NA
dn18:22.9	These are the four bases of psychic power taught by the Buddha for the amplification, burgeoning, and transformation of psychic power.	NA
dn18:22.10	All the ascetics and brahmins in the past,	NA
dn18:22.11	future,	NA
dn18:22.12	or present who wield the many kinds of psychic power do so by developing and cultivating these four bases of psychic power.	NA
dn18:22.13	Gentlemen, do you see such psychic might and power in me?”	NA
dn18:22.14	“Yes, Great Divinity.”	NA
dn18:22.15	“I too became so mighty and powerful by developing and cultivating these four bases of psychic power.”	NA
dn18:23.1	That is the topic on which the divinity Sanaṅkumāra spoke.	NA
dn18:23.2	And having spoken about that, he addressed the gods of the thirty-three:	NA
dn18:23.3.0	7. The Three Openings	NA
dn18:23.4	“What do the good gods of the thirty-three think? How well understood by the Buddha are the three opportunities for achieving happiness!	These “three opportunities” are not found elsewhere.
dn18:23.5	What three?	NA
dn18:23.6	First, take someone who lives mixed up with sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities.	This unique term is the reverse of the phrase that begins the first _jhāna_. The passage, however, speaks only of lifestyle rather than deep meditation.
dn18:23.7	After some time they hear the teaching of the noble ones, rationally apply the mind to how it applies to them, and practice accordingly.	NA
dn18:23.8	They live aloof from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities.	“Aloof” (_asaṁsaṭṭha_) is a synonym of “secluded” (_vivicca_). The _jhāna_ formulas are extremely stable and it is rare to find them played with like this.
dn18:23.9	That gives rise to pleasure, and more than pleasure, happiness,	Since _jhāna_ arises from pleasure, it cannot be meant here.
dn18:23.10	like the joy that’s born from gladness.	NA
dn18:23.11	NA	NA
dn18:23.12	This is the first opportunity for achieving happiness.	NA
dn18:24.1	Next, take someone whose coarse physical, verbal, and mental processes have not died down.	“Coarse physical, verbal, and mental processes” (_oḷārikā kāyasaṅkhārā …vacīsaṅkhārā … cittasaṅkhārā_) is another unique term. They are probably to be identified with the three “processes” of [mn44:14.2]().
dn18:24.2	After some time they hear the teaching of the noble ones, rationally apply the mind to how it applies to them, and practice accordingly.	NA
dn18:24.3	Their coarse physical, verbal, and mental processes die down.	NA
dn18:24.4	That gives rise to pleasure, and more than pleasure, happiness,	NA
dn18:24.5	like the joy that’s born from gladness.	NA
dn18:24.6	NA	NA
dn18:24.7	This is the second opportunity for achieving happiness.	NA
dn18:25.1	Next, take someone who doesn’t truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful,	This builds off [dn1:2.24.1](), but the full phrase is only here and [dn19:7.2]().
dn18:25.2	what is blameworthy and what is blameless, what should be cultivated and what should not be cultivated, what is inferior and what is superior, and what is on the side of dark and the side of bright.	NA
dn18:25.3	After some time they hear the teaching of the noble ones, rationally apply the mind to how it applies to them, and practice accordingly.	NA
dn18:25.4	They truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful, and so on.	NA
dn18:25.5	NA	NA
dn18:25.6	Knowing and seeing like this, ignorance is given up and knowledge arises.	NA
dn18:25.7	That gives rise to pleasure, and more than pleasure, happiness,	NA
dn18:25.8	like the joy that’s born from gladness.	NA
dn18:25.9	NA	NA
dn18:25.10	This is the third opportunity for achieving happiness.	NA
dn18:25.11	These are the three opportunities for achieving happiness that have been understood by the Buddha.”	NA
dn18:26.1	That is the topic on which the divinity Sanaṅkumāra spoke.	NA
dn18:26.2	And having spoken about that, he addressed the gods of the thirty-three:	NA
dn18:26.3.0	8. Mindfulness Meditation	NA
dn18:26.4	“What do the good gods of the thirty-three think? How well described by the Buddha are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation! They are taught for achieving what is skillful.	Normally _satipaṭṭhāna_ is taught “in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment” (eg. [dn22:1.7]()). Here, in yet another unique phrasing, a more humble goal is sought.
dn18:26.5	What four?	NA
dn18:26.6	It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body internally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
dn18:26.7	As they meditate in this way, they become rightly immersed in that, and rightly serene.	NA
dn18:26.8	Then they give rise to knowledge and vision of other people’s bodies externally.	Again the liberating dimension is ignored in favor of worldly psychic abilities. This is another unique formulation.
dn18:26.9	They meditate observing an aspect of feelings internally …	NA
dn18:26.10	Then they give rise to knowledge and vision of other people’s feelings externally.	NA
dn18:26.11	They meditate observing an aspect of the mind internally …	NA
dn18:26.12	Then they give rise to knowledge and vision of other people’s minds externally.	NA
dn18:26.13	They meditate observing an aspect of principles internally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
dn18:26.14	As they meditate in this way, they become rightly immersed in that, and rightly serene.	NA
dn18:26.15	Then they give rise to knowledge and vision of other people’s principles externally.	NA
dn18:26.16	These are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation taught by the Buddha for achieving what is skillful.”	NA
dn18:27.1	That is the topic on which the divinity Sanaṅkumāra spoke.	NA
dn18:27.2	And having spoken about that, he addressed the gods of the thirty-three:	NA
dn18:27.3.0	9. Seven Prerequisites of Immersion	NA
dn18:27.4	“What do the good gods of the thirty-three think? How well described by the Buddha are the seven prerequisites of immersion for the development and fulfillment of right immersion!	Also found at [an7.45:1.1](). At [mn44:12.4]() the four right efforts are said to be the “prerequisites of immersion”. Here at last Sanaṅkumāra introduces the liberating dimension of the path as a whole.
dn18:27.5	What seven?	NA
dn18:27.6	Right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness.	NA
dn18:27.7	Unification of mind with these seven factors as prerequisites is what is called noble right immersion ‘with its vital conditions’ and also ‘with its prerequisites’.	NA
dn18:27.8	Right view gives rise to right thought. Right thought gives rise to right speech. Right speech gives rise to right action. Right action gives rise to right livelihood. Right livelihood gives rise to right effort. Right effort gives rise to right mindfulness. Right mindfulness gives rise to right immersion. Right immersion gives rise to right knowledge. Right knowledge gives rise to right freedom.	Also at [sn45.1](), etc.
dn18:27.9	If anything should be rightly described as	NA
dn18:27.10	‘a teaching that’s well explained by the Buddha, apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves; and the doors to freedom from death are flung open,’ it’s this.	To the standard passage on the qualities of the Dhamma, Sanaṅkumāra clumsily tacks on the line spoken by the Buddha when he was persuaded by Brahmā to teach ([sn6.1:10.1](), [dn14:3.7.13](), [mn26:21.6](), [mn85:45.6]()).
dn18:27.11	For the teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves—and the doors to freedom from death are flung open.	NA
dn18:27.12	Whoever has experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and has the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones; and whoever is spontaneously reborn, and is trained in the teaching; more than 2,400,000 such Magadhan devotees have passed away having ended three fetters. They’re stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.	Finally the question is answered, although the number of deaths is obviously exaggerated. We cannot estimate the population size at the time with any confidence. But we know that Pāṭaliputta under Ashoka covered about 25 km², which suggests a population somewhere around 250,000. Probably there were a few million people in the whole of Magadha.
dn18:27.13	And there are once-returners here, too.	NA
dn18:27.14	And as for the rest of folk,	The commentary identifies these as non-returners, but this is unlikely as _puññābhāga_ (“share of merit”) indicates those who do good for the sake of a good rebirth rather than liberation ([an6.63:30.2]()). There would have been countless more of such good folk than stream-enterers, whereas the number of non-returners, as indicated by the count of the Ñātikans, would have been small, not “countless”. This verse is also at [sn6.13:7.1](), where the commentary says nothing of non-returners.
dn18:27.15	who I think have shared in merit—	NA
dn18:27.16	I couldn’t even number them,	NA
dn18:27.17	for fear of speaking falsely.”	NA
dn18:28.1	That is the topic on which the divinity Sanaṅkumāra spoke. And while he was speaking on that topic, this thought came to the great king Vessavaṇa,	NA
dn18:28.2	“Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! That there should be such a magnificent Teacher, and such a magnificent exposition of the teaching! And that such achievements of high distinction should be made known!”	NA
dn18:28.3	And then the divinity Sanaṅkumāra, knowing the great king Vessavaṇa’s train of thought, said to him,	NA
dn18:28.4	“What does Great King Vessavaṇa think? In the past, too, there was such a magnificent Teacher, and such a magnificent exposition of the teaching! And such achievements of high distinction were made known!	Sanaṅkumāra lives longer than the lesser gods so he has a broader perspective. He emphasizes the long-term stability of cosmic order, which prevails through the crises that afflict the short-lived kingdoms of men.
dn18:28.5	In the future, too, there will be such a magnificent Teacher, and such a magnificent exposition of the teaching! And such achievements of high distinction will be made known!”	NA
dn18:29.1	That, sir, is the topic on which the divinity Sanaṅkumāra spoke to the gods of the thirty-three. And the great king Vessavaṇa, having heard and learned it in the presence of the Divinity as he was speaking on that topic, informed his own assembly.’”	Astonishingly, this sutta traces its textual lineage directly to Brahmā, exactly like the Brahmanical texts (eg. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.5.4). Of course, Brahmā gets his teaching from the Buddha, but this is clearly copying the Brahmanical model.
dn18:29.2	And the spirit Janavasabha, having heard and learned it in the presence of the great king Vessavaṇa as he was speaking on that topic to his own assembly, informed the Buddha.	NA
dn18:29.3	And the Buddha, having heard and learned it in the presence of the spirit Janavasabha, and also from his own direct knowledge, informed Venerable Ānanda. And Venerable Ānanda, having heard and learned it in the presence of the Buddha, informed the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.	Here Ānanda plays a key role as the linchpin of the oral tradition. It is likely that not just the Mahāparinibbānasutta itself, but all these suttas of this cycle were composed by Ānanda or his students.
dn18:29.4	And that’s how this spiritual life has become successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.	With this unique ending, there is no claim that this sutta was heard by the mendicants in the usual way. Rather it makes its purpose explicit, to act as a means to widely propagate the Dhamma. The Mahāparinibbānasutta also speaks of the spread of the Dhamma, and the Janavasabhasutta indicates some of the means by which that was achieved in the decades following the Buddha’s death; in particular, by allying itself with the ascendant power of Magadha.
dn19:0.1	Long Discourses 19	NA
dn19:0.2	The Great Steward	NA
dn19:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
dn19:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.	NA
dn19:1.3	Then, late at night, the centaur Pañcasikha, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	We were introduced to Pañcasikha in [dn18](), which is similar to the current sutta in many other details as well. Thus this sutta can be considered as a distant cousin to the Mahāparinibbāna cycle.
dn19:1.4	“Sir, I would tell you of what I heard and learned directly from the gods of the thirty-three.”	NA
dn19:1.5	“Tell me, Pañcasikha,” said the Buddha.	NA

dn19:2.1	“Sir, it was more than a few days ago—on the fifteenth day sabbath on the full moon day at the invitation to admonish held at the end of the rainy season—when all the gods of the thirty-three were sitting together in the Hall of Justice.	The council of gods described by Janavasabha at [dn18:12.1](), while otherwise similar, took place at the entry to a rainy season, whereas this one is at the end of a rainy season. This cannot have been the Buddha’s last rains, for he was already in Vajji by then.
dn19:2.2	A large assembly of gods was sitting all around, and the four great kings were seated at the four quarters.	NA
dn19:2.3	The Great King Dhataraṭṭha was seated to the east, facing west, in front of his gods.	NA
dn19:2.4	The Great King Virūḷhaka was seated to the south, facing north, in front of his gods.	NA
dn19:2.5	The Great King Virūpakkha was seated to the west, facing east, in front of his gods.	NA
dn19:2.6	The Great King Vessavaṇa was seated to the north, facing south, in front of his gods.	NA
dn19:2.7	When the gods of the thirty-three have a gathering like this, that is how they are seated.	NA

dn19:3.3	‘The heavenly hosts swell, while the titan hosts dwindle!’	NA
dn19:3.4	Seeing the joy of those gods, Sakka, lord of gods, celebrated with these verses:	NA

dn19:4.1	Seeing the joy of those gods, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed them,	NA
dn19:4.2	‘Gentlemen, would you like to hear eight genuine praises of the Buddha?’	For “genuine praise” (_yathābhucce vaṇṇe_), see [dn1:1.28.1]().
dn19:4.3	‘Indeed we would, sir.’	NA
dn19:4.4	Then Sakka proffered these eight genuine praises of the Buddha:	This set of eight is not found elsewhere. | “Proffered” is _payirudāhāsi_, a unique term in early texts.
dn19:5.1	‘What do the good gods of the thirty-three think?	Sakka adopts the same rhetorical style as Sanaṅkumāra ([dn18:20.2]()).
dn19:5.2	How the Buddha has acted for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!	NA
dn19:5.3	I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who has such sympathy for the world, apart from the Buddha.	NA
dn19:6.1	Also, the Buddha has explained the teaching well—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.	NA
dn19:6.2	I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who explains such a relevant teaching, apart from the Buddha.	NA
dn19:7.1	Also, the Buddha has well described what is skillful and what is unskillful,	Compare [dn18:25.1]().
dn19:7.2	what is blameworthy and what is blameless, what should be cultivated and what should not be cultivated, what is inferior and what is superior, and what is on the side of dark and the side of bright.	NA
dn19:7.3	I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who so clearly describes all these things, apart from the Buddha.	NA
dn19:8.1	Also, the Buddha has well described the practice that leads to extinguishment for his disciples. And extinguishment converges with the practice,	_Paṭipadā_ is instrumental.
dn19:8.2	as the waters of the Ganges come together and converge with the waters of the Yamuna.	I don’t think this idea is found elsewhere in quite this way. Normally it is said that the path leads to Nibbāna like the rivers lead to the ocean (eg. [sn45.114:1.1]()).
dn19:8.3	NA	NA
dn19:8.4	I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who so clearly describes the practice that leads to extinguishment for his disciples, apart from the Buddha.	NA
dn19:9.1	Also, possessions and popularity have accrued to the Buddha, so much that you’d think it would thrill even the aristocrats. But he takes his food free of vanity.	This item is unique.
dn19:9.2	I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who takes their food so free of vanity, apart from the Buddha.	NA
dn19:10.1	Also, the Buddha has gained companions, both trainees who are practicing, and those with defilements ended who have completed their journey.	Another unique item.
dn19:10.2	The Buddha is committed to the joy of solitude, but doesn’t send them away.	This is normally true, but in some cases the Buddha left a badly-behaved community ([mn48]()), dismissed misbehaving monks (eg. [an8.10:2.2]()), or even dismissed a large community ([mn67]()). | The “joy of solitude” is _ekārāmataṁ _.
dn19:10.3	I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, so committed to the joy of solitude, apart from the Buddha.	NA
dn19:11.1	Also, the Buddha does as he says, and says as he does, thus: he does as he says, and says as he does.	Also at [dn29:29.5](), [an4.23:4.1](), and [iti112:5.1]().
dn19:11.2	I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who so practices in line with the teaching, apart from the Buddha.	NA
dn19:12.1	Also, the Buddha has gone beyond doubt and got rid of indecision. He has achieved all he wished for regarding the fundamental purpose of the spiritual life.	_Pariyositasaṅkappo_ (“achieved all he wished for”) is a synonym of the more common _paripuṇṇasaṅkappo_ (eg. [mn29:2.5]()).
dn19:12.2	I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who has achieved these things, apart from the Buddha.’	NA
dn19:12.3	These are the eight genuine praises of the Buddha proffered by Sakka.	NA
dn19:12.4	Hearing them, the gods of the thirty-three became even more uplifted and overjoyed.	NA
dn19:13.1	Then some gods thought,	NA

dn19:13.3	That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!’	NA
dn19:13.4	Other gods thought,	NA
dn19:13.5	‘Let alone four fully awakened Buddhas; if only three fully awakened Buddhas,	NA
dn19:13.6	NA	NA
dn19:13.7	NA	NA
dn19:13.8	or two fully awakened Buddhas might arise in the world and teach the Dhamma, just like the Blessed One!	NA
dn19:13.9	That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!’	NA
dn19:14.1	When they said this, Sakka said,	NA
dn19:14.2	‘It is impossible, gentlemen, for two perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas to arise in the same solar system at the same time.	This impossibility is also at [an1.277:1.1]() and [mn115:14.1](). | “In one solar system” (_ekissā lokadhātuyā_): a single _lokadhātu_ encompasses a single terrestrial world with a single moon and sun.
dn19:14.3	May that Blessed One be healthy and well, and remain with us for a long time!	It is not common to wish for the Buddha’s long life, but we do find this sentiment expressed in a conversation between Sāriputta and Ānanda ([sn21.2:3.5]()).
dn19:14.4	That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!’	NA
dn19:14.5	Then the gods of the thirty-three, having considered and deliberated on the matter for which they were seated together in the Hall of Justice, advised and instructed the four great kings on the subject.	NA
dn19:14.6	Each one, having been advised, stood at his own seat without departing.	NA
dn19:14.7	The Kings were instructed,	NA
dn19:14.8	and heeded good advice.	NA
dn19:14.9	With clear and peaceful minds,	NA
dn19:14.10	they stood by their own seats.	NA
dn19:15.1	Then in the northern quarter a magnificent light arose and radiance appeared, surpassing the glory of the gods.	NA
dn19:15.2	Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the thirty-three,	NA
dn19:15.3	‘As indicated by the signs—light arising and radiance appearing—the Divinity will appear. For this is the precursor for the appearance of the Divinity, namely light arising and radiance appearing.’	NA
dn19:15.4	NA	NA
dn19:15.5	As indicated by the signs,	NA
dn19:15.6	the Divinity will appear.	NA
dn19:15.7	For this is the sign of the Divinity:	NA
dn19:15.8	a light vast and great.	NA
dn19:16.0	3. On Sanaṅkumāra	NA
dn19:16.1	Then the gods of the thirty-three sat in their own seats, saying,	NA
dn19:16.2	‘We shall find out what has caused that light, and only when we have realized it shall we go to it.’	NA
dn19:16.3	And the four great kings did likewise.	NA
dn19:16.4	NA	NA
dn19:16.5	Hearing that, the gods of the thirty-three agreed in unison,	NA
dn19:16.6	‘We shall find out what has caused that light, and only when we have realized it shall we go to it.’	NA
dn19:16.7	When the divinity Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the thirty-three, he does so after manifesting in a solid corporeal form.	NA
dn19:16.8	For a Divinity’s normal appearance is imperceptible in the visual range of the gods of the thirty-three.	NA
dn19:16.9	When the divinity Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the thirty-three, he outshines the other gods in beauty and glory,	NA
dn19:16.10	as a golden statue outshines the human form.	NA
dn19:16.11	NA	NA
dn19:16.12	When the divinity Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the thirty-three, not a single god in that assembly greets him by bowing down or rising up or inviting him to a seat.	NA
dn19:16.13	They all sit silently on their couches with their joined palms raised, thinking,	NA
dn19:16.14	‘Now the divinity Sanaṅkumāra will sit on the couch of whatever god he chooses.’	NA
dn19:16.15	And the god on whose couch the Divinity sits is overjoyed and brimming with happiness,	NA
dn19:17.1	like a king on the day of his coronation.	NA
dn19:17.2	NA	NA
dn19:17.3	Seeing the joy of those gods, the divinity Sanaṅkumāra celebrated with these verses:	NA
dn19:17.4	‘The gods rejoice—	NA
dn19:17.5	the thirty-three with their Lord—	NA
dn19:17.6	revering the Realized One,	NA
dn19:17.7	and the natural excellence of the teaching;	NA
dn19:17.8	and seeing the new gods,	NA
dn19:17.9	so beautiful and glorious,	NA
dn19:17.10	who have come here after leading	NA
dn19:17.11	the spiritual life under the Buddha!	NA
dn19:17.12	They outshine the others	NA
dn19:17.13	in beauty, glory, and lifespan.	NA
dn19:17.14	Here are the distinguished disciples	NA
dn19:17.15	of he whose wisdom is vast.	NA
dn19:17.16	Seeing this, they delight—	NA
dn19:17.17	the thirty-three with their Lord—	NA
dn19:17.18	revering the Realized One,	NA
dn19:17.19	and the natural excellence of the teaching!’	NA
dn19:18.1	That is the topic on which the divinity Sanaṅkumāra spoke.	NA
dn19:18.2	And while he was speaking on that topic, his voice had eight qualities: it was clear, comprehensible, charming, audible, lucid, undistorted, deep, and resonant.	NA
dn19:18.3	He makes sure his voice is intelligible as far as the assembly goes, but the sound doesn’t extend outside the assembly.	NA
dn19:18.4	When someone has a voice like this, they’re said to have the voice of the Divinity.	NA
dn19:19.1	Then the gods of the thirty-three said to the divinity Sanaṅkumāra,	NA
dn19:19.2	‘Good, Great Divinity! Having appraised this, we rejoice.	“Having appraised” (_saṅkhāya_) is glossed by the commentary with “having known” (_jānitvā_). Compare the discussion on “judgmentalism” at [dn1:1.3.1]().
dn19:19.3	And there are the eight genuine praises of the Buddha spoken by Sakka—	NA
dn19:19.4	having appraised them, too, we rejoice.’	NA
dn19:19.5.0	4. Eight Genuine Praises	NA
dn19:19.6	Then the Divinity said to Sakka,	NA
dn19:19.7	‘It would be good, lord of gods, if I could also hear the eight genuine praises of the Buddha.’	NA
dn19:19.8	Saying, ‘Yes, Great Divinity,’ Sakka repeated the eight genuine praises for him.	NA

dn19:28.2	Hearing them, the divinity Sanaṅkumāra was uplifted and overjoyed, full of rapture and happiness.	NA
dn19:28.3	Then the divinity Sanaṅkumāra manifested in a solid corporeal form, taking on the appearance of the youth Pañcasikha, and appeared to the gods of the thirty-three.	NA
dn19:28.4	Rising into the air, he sat cross-legged in the sky,	NA
dn19:28.5	like a strong man might sit cross-legged on a well-appointed couch or on level ground.	NA
dn19:28.6	There he addressed the gods of the thirty-three:	NA
dn19:28.7.0	5. The Story of the Steward	NA
dn19:28.8	‘What do the gods of the thirty-three think about the extent of the Buddha’s great wisdom?	NA
dn19:29.1	Once upon a time, there was a king named Disampati.	Disampati means “head of the directions”, i.e. king of all the land. He and his story are found nowhere else in the early texts.
dn19:29.2	He had a brahmin high priest named the Steward.	“Steward” is Govinda, literally “lord of cows”. The “high priest” (_purohita_) was a hereditary office, a learned ritualist and adviser attached to a specific family. For royal families the post could be highly contested. The closeness of the role is shown in that aristocratic families could be referred to by the lineage of the high priest.
dn19:29.3	Disampati’s son was the prince named Reṇu,	While the current sutta does not explicitly identify their realm, Dīpavaṁsa iii 40 records Disampati and Reṇu as kings of Kāsi. This fits with the geographical layout depicted in this sutta, with Kāsi at the center. The story, then, depicts the establishment of Brahmanical kings across India from Kāsi.
dn19:29.4	while the Steward’s son was the student named Jotipāla.	Jotipāla means “guardian of the sacred flame”, i.e. someone who maintains the Vedic fire ritual (see below at [dn19:47.26]()). There was another Jotipāla in the time of Buddha Kassapa at [mn81:6.2](), and another who was a religious founder of the past ([an6.54:18.1](), [an7.73:2.5]()). Despite the popularity of the name in Pali, it does not seem to appear in Sanskrit sources. Given that it appears in Pali only in legendary contexts, it is probably a vocational epithet.
dn19:29.5	There were Reṇu the prince, Jotipāla the student, and six other aristocrats; these eight became friends.	NA
dn19:29.6	In due course the brahmin Steward passed away.	NA
dn19:29.7	At his passing, King Disampati lamented,	NA
dn19:29.8	“At a time when I have relinquished all my duties to the brahmin Steward and amuse myself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, he passes away!”	The king’s only care, it seems, is not for the passing of his friend, but that he no longer gets to indulge in whatever he wants.
dn19:29.9	When he said this, Prince Reṇu said to him,	NA
dn19:29.10	“Sire, don’t lament too much at the Steward’s passing.	NA
dn19:29.11	He has a son named Jotipāla, who is even more astute and expert than his father.	NA
dn19:29.12	He should manage the affairs that were managed by his father.”	NA
dn19:29.13	“Is that so, my prince?”	NA
dn19:29.14	“That is so, sire.”	NA
dn19:30.0	6. The Story of the Great Steward	NA
dn19:30.1	So King Disampati addressed one of his men,	NA
dn19:30.2	“Please, worthy man, go to the student Jotipāla, and say to him,	NA
dn19:30.3	‘Best wishes, Jotipāla! You are summoned by King Disampati; he wants to see you.’”	NA
dn19:30.4	“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied that man, and did as he was asked.	NA
dn19:30.5	NA	NA
dn19:30.6	Then Jotipāla went to the king and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
dn19:30.7	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and the king said to him,	NA
dn19:30.8	“May you, Jotipāla, manage my affairs—please don’t turn me down!	NA
dn19:30.9	I shall appoint you to your father’s position, and anoint you as Steward.”	This shows that Govinda is an office rather than a personal name.
dn19:30.10	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Jotipāla.	NA
dn19:31.1	So the king anointed him as Steward and appointed him to his father’s position.	NA
dn19:31.2	After his appointment, the Steward Jotipāla managed both the affairs that his father had managed, and other affairs that his father had not managed.	Following the Mahāsaṅgīti reading rather than the PTS (_nānusāsi … nānusāsati_). It seems required by the context that he does more than his father.
dn19:31.3	He organized both the works that his father had organized, and other works that his father had not organized.	NA
dn19:31.4	When people noticed this they said,	NA
dn19:31.5	“The brahmin is indeed a Steward, a Great Steward!”	NA
dn19:31.6	And that’s how the student Jotipāla came to be known as the Great Steward.	NA
dn19:32.0	6.1. Dividing the Realm	NA
dn19:32.1	Then the Great Steward went to the six aristocrats and said,	NA
dn19:32.2	“King Disampati is old, elderly and senior, advanced in years, and has reached the final stage of life. Who knows how long he has to live?	NA
dn19:32.3	It’s likely that when he passes away the king-makers will anoint Prince Reṇu as king.	NA
dn19:32.4	Come, sirs, go to Prince Reṇu and say,	NA
dn19:32.5	‘Prince Reṇu, we are your friends, dear, beloved, and cherished. We have shared your joys and sorrows.	NA
dn19:32.6	King Disampati is old, elderly and senior, advanced in years, and has reached the final stage of life. Who knows how long he has to live?	NA
dn19:32.7	It’s likely that when he passes away the king-makers will anoint you as king.	NA
dn19:32.8	If you should gain kingship, share it with us.’”	NA
dn19:33.1	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied the six aristocrats. They went to Prince Reṇu and put the proposal to him.	NA
dn19:33.2	NA	NA
dn19:33.3	NA	NA
dn19:33.4	NA	NA
dn19:33.5	NA	NA
dn19:33.6	NA	NA
dn19:33.7	The prince replied, “Who else, sirs, in my realm ought to prosper if not you?	Following PTS reading _sukhaṁ edheyyātha_.
dn19:33.8	If I gain kingship, I will share it with you all.”	NA
dn19:34.1	In due course King Disampati passed away.	NA
dn19:34.2	At his passing, the king-makers anointed Prince Reṇu as king.	NA
dn19:34.3	But after being anointed, King Reṇu amused himself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	NA
dn19:34.4	Then the Great Steward went to the six aristocrats and said,	NA
dn19:34.5	“King Disampati has passed away.	NA
dn19:34.6	But after being anointed, King Reṇu amused himself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	NA
dn19:34.7	Who knows the intoxicating power of sensual pleasures?	NA
dn19:34.8	Come, sirs, go to Prince Reṇu and say,	NA
dn19:34.9	‘Worthy sir, King Disampati has passed away, and you have been anointed as king. Do you remember what you said?’”	NA
dn19:34.10	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied the six aristocrats. They went to King Reṇu and said,	NA
dn19:34.11	“Worthy sir, King Disampati has passed away, and you have been anointed as king. Do you remember what you said?”	NA
dn19:34.12	“I remember, sirs.	NA
dn19:34.13	Who is able to neatly divide into seven equal parts this great land, so broad in the north and narrow as the front of a cart in the south?”	The meaning of _sakaṭamukhaṁ_ (“front of a cart”) is clarified by comparison with the parallels. T 8 is identical (<span lang='lzh'>其界廣闊。正南南隅，其界狹略，猶如車形</span>), while DA 3 expresses a similar idea more briefly (<span lang='lzh'>此閻浮提地， 內廣外狹</span>). The Mahāvastu (Mvu 85.17) confirms this sense with _dakṣiṇena saṁkṣiptā śakaṭamukhasaṁsthitaṁ_. These appear to demonstrate a knowledge of the shape of the Indian subcontinent. Below it says that each of the kingdoms is shaped like the front of a cart, just as India is as a whole.
dn19:34.14	“Who else, sir, if not the Great Steward?”	NA
dn19:35.1	So King Reṇu addressed one of his men,	NA
dn19:35.2	“Please, worthy man, go to the brahmin Great Steward and say that	NA
dn19:35.3	King Reṇu summons him.”	NA
dn19:35.4	“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied that man, and did as he was asked.	NA
dn19:35.5	NA	NA
dn19:35.6	Then the Great Steward went to the king and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
dn19:35.7	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and the king said to him,	NA
dn19:35.8	“Come, let the good Steward neatly divide into seven equal parts this great land, so broad in the north and narrow as the front of a cart in the south.”	NA
dn19:35.9	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied the Great Steward, and did as he was asked.	NA
dn19:36.1	All were arranged like the fronts of carts,	Neither Rhys Davids nor Walshe translate this line, but it receives an extensive discussion in the commentary. It says that six kingdoms were arranged around Reṇu’s kingdom in the middle, like an umbrella (_vitānasadisaṁ_).
dn19:36.2	and right in the middle was King Reṇu’s nation.	The verses tell the realms starting with the rising sun at Kaliṅga in the east and proceeding clockwise (_padakkhiṇā_) until the circle is complete with Aṅga on the Kaliṅga border. Thus the original center was probably the last place on the list, Kāsi, which is indeed geographically central.
dn19:36.3	Dantapura for the Kaliṅgas;	Kaliṅga was a coastal realm in modern Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. There is no consensus on the exact location of Dantapura.
dn19:36.4	Potana for the Assakas;	Assaka stretched from Kaliṅga’s western border across the interior. Potana is modern Bodhan in Telangana state.
dn19:36.5	Māhissatī for the Avantis;	_Mahesaya_ of the Pali editions is a variant spelling for _māhissatī_; Mahāvastu has _māhiṣmatī_. It is in present-day Madhya Pradesh, on the banks of Narmada River, and is perhaps to be identified with modern Maheshwar.
dn19:36.6	Roruka for the Sovīras;	Sovīra was on the lower Indus, and Roruka is identified with modern Rohri in Sindh province, Pakistan. It is implausible that they received Aryan culture from Kāsi.
dn19:36.7	Mithilā for the Videhas;	Mithilā was the capital of Videha, to the north east of the Vajjian federation, nestled against the Himalayas. Mithilā was a dominant kingdom before the Buddha, its king Janaka featuring prominently in early Upaniṣads. It features rarely in the suttas ([mn91](), [thig6.2](), [thig13.4]()) and had apparently declined in importance. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.4.1.10–19 depicts its origins in terms of the spread of fire-worship from the west by its founding king Māthava Videgha with his priest Gotama Rāhūgaṇa.
dn19:36.8	Campā was laid out for the Aṅgas;	Campā is modern Champapuri near Bhagalpur in Bihar state, not far from West Bengal. Aṅga lay between the Chandan river to the west and the Rajmahal hills to the east. In the centuries before the Buddha it expanded its dominion to the sea on the south-east and Magadha in the west. But with the Kaliṅgas pushing back from the coast and the rise of Bimbisāra in Magadha, they were pushed back to their ancestral lands and fell under Magadhan dominion.
dn19:36.9	and Varanasi for the Kāsis:	Varanasi, one of the oldest cities in the world, was the capital of the Kāsī kingdom. It lost its status as an independent kingdom shortly before the Buddha, when it was taken over by Kosala. It appears in countless Buddhist stories of the past as the dominant city of the region in what appears to be a timeless and ageless past. However, despite its great antiquity, it is a historical settlement, of which the discovered remains date back to perhaps 1200 BCE; it was a capital city from perhaps 800 BCE.
dn19:36.10	these were laid out by the Steward.	NA
dn19:36.11	Then those six aristocrats were delighted with their respective gains, having achieved all they wished for,	NA
dn19:36.12	“We have received exactly what we wanted, what we wished for, what we desired, what we yearned for.”	NA
dn19:36.13	Sattabhū and Brahmadatta,	The names of the aristocrat kings—most of which are difficult to identify from other sources—are listed in an abruptly-inserted verse. The names are missing from the parallels in Mahāvastu and DA 3, but T 8 appears to have the same list of names in the same order, except with Reṇu at the start. Rhys Davids proposes to assign each one to a kingdom as listed in the same order. This seems to work for the first four names, as [ja424](), invoking this sutta, identifies Bharata as king of Sovīra. But it falls apart with Reṇu, who as we have seen, belongs in Kāsi rather than Videha.
dn19:36.14	Vessabhū and Bharata,	“Bharata” is the name of an individual king, while they are collectively known as “Bhāratas” (with a long initial _ā_ due to secondary derivation). [ja424](), invoking this sutta, identifies Bharata as king of Sovīra.
dn19:36.15	Reṇu and the two Dhataraṭṭhas:	NA
dn19:36.16	these were the seven Bhāratas.	Here _bhāratā_ means “kings of India” or perhaps, if read together with the preceding verses, “kingdoms of India”. India was called Bhārata after the legendary King Bharata of Hastināpura (Delhi), founder of the Lunar dynasty, conqueror of India, and sire of the warring tribes of the Mahābharata. His story is told in the Saṁbhavapara of the Mahābhārata. The name represents the success of Vedic culture across the subcontinent.
dn19:36.17	The first recitation section is finished.	NA
dn19:37.0	6.2. A Good Reputation	NA
dn19:37.1	Then the six aristocrats approached the Great Steward and said,	NA
dn19:37.2	“Steward, just as you are King Reṇu’s friend, dear, beloved, and cherished,	NA
dn19:37.3	you are also our friend.	NA
dn19:37.4	Would you manage our affairs? Please don’t turn us down!”	NA
dn19:37.5	“Yes, worthy sirs,” replied the Great Steward.	NA
dn19:37.6	Then the Great Steward managed the realms of the seven kings. And he taught seven well-to-do brahmins, and seven hundred bathed initiates to recite the hymns.	NA
dn19:38.1	After some time he got this good reputation,	NA
dn19:38.2	“The Great Steward sees the Divinity in person! The Great Steward discusses, converses, and consults with the Divinity in person!”	In spiritual circles, such rumors spread like wildfire in an Australian summer.
dn19:38.3	The Great Steward thought,	NA
dn19:38.4	“I have the reputation	NA
dn19:38.5	of seeing the Divinity in person, and discussing with him in person.	NA
dn19:38.6	But I don’t.	NA
dn19:38.7	I have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior, the tutors of tutors, said:	NA
dn19:38.8	‘Whoever goes on retreat for the four months of the rainy season and practices the absorption on compassion sees the Divinity and discusses with him.’	The ancient Brahmanical teachers are invoked to justify the Buddhist rains retreat. | Compassion is one of the “meditations of Brahmā” (_brahmavihāra_). Normally the suttas speak of the absorptions (_jhāna_) and of the meditation on compassion (_karuṇā_), but the idea of an “absorption on compassion” is unique to this sutta.
dn19:38.9	Why don’t I do that?”	NA
dn19:39.1	So the Great Steward went to King Reṇu and told him of the situation, saying,	NA
dn19:39.2	NA	NA

dn19:39.4	NA	NA
dn19:39.5	NA	NA

dn19:39.8	No one should approach me, except for the one who serves my meal.”	NA
dn19:39.9	“Please do so, Steward, at your convenience.”	NA
dn19:40.1	Then the Great Steward went to the six aristocrats to put the same proposal, and received the same reply.	NA

dn19:41.9	And they too said,	NA
dn19:41.10	“Please do so, Steward, at your convenience.”	NA
dn19:42.1	Then the Great Steward went to his forty equal wives to put the same proposal to them, and received the same reply.	NA

dn19:43.2	And no one approached him except the one who served his meals.	NA
dn19:43.3	But then, when the four months had passed, the Great Steward became dissatisfied and anxious,	NA
dn19:43.4	“I have heard that brahmins of the past said that	NA
dn19:43.5	whoever goes on retreat for the four months of the rainy season and practices the absorption on compassion sees the Divinity and discusses with him.	NA

dn19:44.0	6.3. A Discussion With the Divinity	NA
dn19:44.1	And then the divinity Sanaṅkumāra, knowing the Great Steward’s train of thought, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared in the Great Steward’s presence.	NA
dn19:44.2	At that, the Great Steward became frightened, scared, his hair standing on end, as he had never seen such a sight before.	NA
dn19:44.3	So he addressed the divinity Sanaṅkumāra in verse:	NA
dn19:44.4	“Who might you be, sir,	NA
dn19:44.5	so beautiful, glorious, majestic?	NA
dn19:44.6	Not knowing, I ask—	NA
dn19:44.7	how am I to know who you are?”	NA
dn19:44.8	“In the realm of divinity they know me	NA
dn19:44.9	as ‘The Eternal Youth’.	NA
dn19:44.10	All the gods know me thus,	NA
dn19:44.11	and so you should know me, Steward.”	NA
dn19:44.12	“A Divinity deserves a seat and water,	NA
dn19:44.13	foot-salve, and sweet cakes.	NA
dn19:44.14	Sir, I ask you to please accept	NA
dn19:44.15	these gifts of hospitality.”	NA
dn19:44.16	“I accept the gifts of hospitality	NA
dn19:44.17	of which you speak.	NA
dn19:44.18	I grant you the opportunity	NA
dn19:44.19	to ask whatever you desire—	NA
dn19:44.20	about welfare and benefit in this life,	NA
dn19:44.21	or happiness in lives to come.”	NA
dn19:45.1	Then the Great Steward thought,	NA
dn19:45.2	“the divinity Sanaṅkumāra has granted me an opportunity.	NA
dn19:45.3	Should I ask him about what is beneficial for this life or lives to come?”	NA
dn19:45.4	Then he thought,	NA
dn19:45.5	“I’m skilled in what is beneficial for this life, and others even ask me about it.	NA
dn19:45.6	Why don’t I ask the Divinity about the benefit that specifically applies to lives to come?”	NA
dn19:45.7	So he addressed the divinity Sanaṅkumāra in verse:	NA
dn19:45.8	“I’m in doubt, so I ask the Divinity—<j>who is free of doubt—	NA
dn19:45.9	about things one may learn from another.	NA
dn19:45.10	Standing on what, training in what	NA
dn19:45.11	may a mortal reach the deathless realm of divinity?”	“Deathless” from a Brahmanical perspective, but very much within the realm of _saṁsāra_ from a Buddhist perspective.
dn19:45.12	“He among mankind, O brahmin, has given up possessiveness,	_Brahme_ is the normal vocative for _brahmā_. However in verse it is sometimes used as vocative for _brāhmaṇa_ (eg. [snp5.1:7.3](), [snp5.19:3.4]()).
dn19:45.13	at one, compassionate,	NA
dn19:45.14	free of putrefaction, and refraining from sex.	NA
dn19:45.15	Standing on that, training in that	NA
dn19:45.16	a mortal may reach the deathless realm of divinity.”	NA
dn19:46.1	“Sir, I understand what ‘giving up possessiveness’ means.	These factors are explained as a summary of the Gradual Training.
dn19:46.2	It’s when someone gives up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
dn19:46.3	That’s how I understand ‘giving up possessiveness’.	NA
dn19:46.4	Sir, I understand what ‘at one’ means.	“At one” (_ekodibhūta_ or more commonly _ekodibhāva_) normally describes deep meditation, and is part of the formula for the second _jhāna_. Here it is explained as equivalent to “seclusion” (_viveka_).
dn19:46.5	It’s when someone frequents a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.	NA
dn19:46.6	That’s how I understand ‘at one’.	NA
dn19:46.7	Sir, I understand what ‘compassionate’ means.	NA
dn19:46.8	It’s when someone meditates spreading a heart full of compassion to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of compassion to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	NA
dn19:46.9	That’s how I understand ‘compassionate’.	NA
dn19:46.10	But I don’t understand what you say about putrefaction.	“Putrefaction” (_āmagandha_) is the smell of (moral) decay or corruption ([an3.128](), [snp2.2]()).
dn19:46.11	What among mankind, O the Divinity, is putrefaction?	NA
dn19:46.12	I don’t understand, so tell me, attentive one:	NA
dn19:46.13	wrapped in what do people stink,	NA
dn19:46.14	headed for hell, shut out of the realm of divinity?”	NA
dn19:46.15	“Anger, lies, fraud, and deceit,	NA
dn19:46.16	miserliness, vanity, jealousy,	NA
dn19:46.17	desire, stinginess, harassing others,	“Desire” is (_icchā_). PTS reads _vicikicchā_ (“doubt”), but this must be incorrect as the commentary explains it as “craving” (_taṇhā_).
dn19:46.18	greed, hate, vanity, and delusion—	NA
dn19:46.19	those bound to such things <j>are not devoid of putrefaction;	NA
dn19:46.20	they’re headed for hell, <j>shut out of the realm of divinity.”	NA
dn19:46.21	“As I understand what you say about putrefaction, it’s not easy to quell while living at home.	“Easy to quell” (_sunimmadaya_) is unique to this passage.
dn19:46.22	I shall go forth from the lay life to homelessness!”	NA
dn19:46.23	“Please do so, Steward, at your convenience.”	NA
dn19:47.0	6.4. Informing King Reṇu	NA
dn19:47.1	So the Great Steward went to King Reṇu and said,	NA
dn19:47.2	“Worthy sir, please now find another high priest to manage the affairs of state for you.	NA
dn19:47.3	I wish to go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
dn19:47.4	As I understand what the Divinity says about putrefaction, it’s not easy to quell while living at home.	NA
dn19:47.5	I shall go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
dn19:47.6	I announce to King Reṇu,	NA
dn19:47.7	the lord of the land:	NA
dn19:47.8	you must learn how to rule,	NA
dn19:47.9	for I no longer care for my ministry.”	NA
dn19:47.10	“If you’re lacking any pleasures,	NA
dn19:47.11	I’ll supply them for you.	NA
dn19:47.12	I’ll protect you from any harm,	NA
dn19:47.13	for I command the nation’s army.	NA
dn19:47.14	You are my father, I am your son!	As noted in the comment to [dn16:5.19.2](), kingly clans adopted the lineage name of the high priest (_purohita_) during initiation.
dn19:47.15	O Steward, please don’t leave!”	NA
dn19:47.16	“I’m lacking no pleasures,	NA
dn19:47.17	and no-one is harming me.	NA
dn19:47.18	I’ve heard a non-human voice,	NA
dn19:47.19	so I no longer care for lay life.”	NA
dn19:47.20	“What was that non-human like?	NA
dn19:47.21	What did he say to you,	NA
dn19:47.22	hearing which you would abandon	NA
dn19:47.23	our house and all our people?”	NA
dn19:47.24	“Before entering this retreat,	NA
dn19:47.25	I only liked to sacrifice.	NA
dn19:47.26	I kindled the sacred flame,	NA
dn19:47.27	strewn about with kusa grass.	NA
dn19:47.28	But then the Divinity the Eternal Youth	NA
dn19:47.29	appeared to me from the realm of divinity.	NA
dn19:47.30	He answered my question,	NA
dn19:47.31	hearing which I no longer care for lay life.”	NA
dn19:47.32	“I have faith, O Steward,	NA
dn19:47.33	in that of which you speak.	NA
dn19:47.34	Having heard a non-human voice,	NA
dn19:47.35	what else could you do?	NA
dn19:47.36	We will follow your example,	NA

dn19:47.38	Like a gem of beryl—	NA

dn19:47.42	If the Steward is going forth from the lay life to homelessness, we shall do so too. Your destiny shall be ours.”	NA
dn19:47.43	NA	NA
dn19:48.0	6.5. Informing the Six Aristocrats	NA
dn19:48.1	Then the Great Steward went to the six aristocrats and said,	NA
dn19:48.2	“Good fellows, please now find another high priest to manage the affairs of state for you.	NA
dn19:48.3	I wish to go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
dn19:48.4	As I understand what the Divinity says about putrefaction, it’s not easy to quell while living at home.	NA
dn19:48.5	I shall go forth from the lay life to homelessness!”	NA
dn19:49.1	Then the six aristocrats withdrew to one side and thought up a plan,	NA
dn19:49.2	“These brahmins are greedy for wealth.	NA
dn19:49.3	Why don’t we try to persuade him with wealth?”	NA
dn19:49.4	They returned to the Great Steward and said,	NA
dn19:49.5	“In these seven kingdoms there is abundant wealth. We’ll get you as much as you want.”	NA
dn19:49.6	“Enough, sirs. I already have abundant wealth, owing to my lords.	NA
dn19:49.7	Giving up all that, I shall go forth.”	NA
dn19:49.8	NA	NA
dn19:49.9	NA	NA
dn19:49.10	Then the six aristocrats withdrew to one side and thought up a plan,	NA
dn19:49.11	“These brahmins are greedy for women.	NA
dn19:49.12	Why don’t we try to persuade him with women?”	NA
dn19:49.13	They returned to the Great Steward and said,	NA
dn19:49.14	“In these seven kingdoms there are many women. We’ll get you as many as you want.”	NA
dn19:49.15	“Enough, sirs. I already have forty equal wives.	NA

dn19:57.0	6.7. Informing the Wives	NA
dn19:57.1	Then the Great Steward went to his forty equal wives and said,	NA
dn19:57.2	“Ladies, please do whatever you wish, whether returning to your own families, or finding another husband.	NA
dn19:57.3	I wish to go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA

dn19:57.7	If you are going forth from the lay life to homelessness, we shall do so too. Your destiny shall be ours.”	It is regarded as normal that woman should renounce.
dn19:58.0	6.8. The Great Steward Goes Forth	NA
dn19:58.1	When a week had passed, the Great Steward shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
dn19:58.2	And when he had gone forth, the seven anointed aristocrat kings, the seven brahmins with seven hundred initiates, the forty equal wives, and many thousands of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and many harem women shaved off their hair and beards, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.	Compare with the mass renunciation under Vipassī ([dn14:2.16.6]()).
dn19:58.3	Escorted by that assembly, the Great Steward wandered on tour among the villages, towns, and capital cities.	NA
dn19:58.4	And at that time, whenever he arrived at a village or town, he was like a king to kings, like the Divinity to brahmins, like a deity to householders.	NA
dn19:58.5	And whenever people sneezed or tripped over	NA
dn19:58.6	they’d say:	NA
dn19:58.7	“Homage to the Great Steward! Homage to the high priest for the seven!”	NA
dn19:59.1	And the Great Steward meditated spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, he spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	His meditation expands from compassion to include all four of the _brahmavihāras_.
dn19:59.2	He meditated spreading a heart full of compassion …	NA
dn19:59.3	rejoicing …	NA
dn19:59.4	equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, he spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	NA
dn19:59.5	And he taught his disciples the path to rebirth in the company of Divinity.	NA
dn19:60.1	Those of his disciples who completely understood the Great Steward’s instructions,	NA
dn19:60.2	at the breaking up of the body, after death, were reborn in the realm of divinity.	NA
dn19:60.3	Of those disciples who only partly understood the Great Steward’s instructions, some were reborn in the company of the gods who control what is imagined by others,	NA
dn19:60.4	while some were reborn in the company of the gods who love to imagine,	NA
dn19:60.5	or the joyful gods,	NA
dn19:60.6	or the gods of Yama,	NA
dn19:60.7	or the gods of the thirty-three,	NA
dn19:60.8	or the gods of the four great kings.	NA
dn19:60.9	And at the very least they swelled the hosts of the centaurs.	NA
dn19:60.10	And so the going forth of all those gentlemen was not in vain, was not wasted, but was fruitful and fertile.’	NA
dn19:60.11	Do you remember this, Blessed One?”	NA
dn19:61.1	“I remember, Pañcasikha.	NA
dn19:61.2	I myself was the brahmin Great Steward at that time.	This is the third and final Jātaka in the Dīghanikāya, after [dn5]() and [dn17]().
dn19:61.3	And I taught those disciples the path to rebirth in the company of Divinity.	NA
dn19:61.4	But that spiritual path of mine doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the realm of divinity.	According to the doctrine of the “perfections” (_pāramī_), which emerged around two to four centuries after the Buddha’s passing, the practices he undertook in past lives laid the foundation for awakening in this life. Here, however, the Buddha states that his former practices did not lead to awakening. Rather, since they were based on the wrong view of eternal bliss in the Brahmā realm, they only led to a good rebirth so long as that kamma lasted. It is the eightfold path, which the Buddha discovered in his final life, which leads to awakening. The same saying in a similar context is found at [mn83:21.7]().
dn19:61.5	But this spiritual path does lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.	NA
dn19:61.6	And what is the spiritual path that leads to extinguishment?	NA
dn19:61.7	It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:	NA
dn19:61.8	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.	NA
dn19:61.9	This is the spiritual path that leads to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.	NA
dn19:62.1	Those of my disciples who completely understand my instructions realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.	NA
dn19:62.2	Of those disciples who only partly understand my instructions, some, with the ending of the five lower fetters, become reborn spontaneously. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.	NA
dn19:62.3	Some, with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, become once-returners. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.	NA
dn19:62.4	And some, with the ending of three fetters, become stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.	NA
dn19:62.5	And so the going forth of all those gentlemen was not in vain, was not wasted, but was fruitful and fertile.”	NA
dn19:62.6	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
dn19:62.7	Delighted, the centaur Pañcasikha approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.	NA
dn20:0.1	Long Discourses 20	NA
dn20:0.2	The Great Congregation	NA
dn20:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
dn20:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, in the Great Wood near Kapilavatthu, together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants, all of whom were perfected ones.	NA
dn20:1.3	And most of the deities from ten solar systems had gathered to see the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants.	This discourse gives an extensive account of divine beings. Some are familiar from elsewhere in the Pali texts, others found in various Brahmanical sources, while still others occur only here. For the names we can compare the edition of the Sanskrit text by Waldschmidt and Sander and available on SuttaCentral as [SF 140](https://suttacentral.net/sf140/san/waldschmidt-sander).
dn20:2.1	Then four deities of the Pure Abodes, aware of what was happening, thought:	The Pure Abodes are inhabited entirely by non-returners.
dn20:2.2	NA	NA
dn20:2.3	NA	NA
dn20:2.4	“Why don’t we go to the Buddha and each recite a verse in his presence?”	NA
dn20:3.1	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from the Pure Abodes and reappeared in front of the Buddha.	NA
dn20:3.2	They bowed to the Buddha and stood to one side.	NA
dn20:3.3	Standing to one side, one deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence:	NA
dn20:3.4	“There’s a great congregation in the woods,	“Great congregation” is _mahāsamaya_.
dn20:3.5	where heavenly hosts have assembled.	NA
dn20:3.6	We’ve come to this righteous congregation	NA
dn20:3.7	to see the invincible Saṅgha!”	NA
dn20:3.8	Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence:	NA
dn20:3.9	“The mendicants there are immersed in samādhi,	NA
dn20:3.10	they’ve straightened their own minds.	NA
dn20:3.11	Like a charioteer holding the reins,	NA
dn20:3.12	the astute ones protect their senses.”	NA
dn20:3.13	Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence:	NA
dn20:3.14	“They snapped the post and snapped the cross-bar,	NA
dn20:3.15	unstirred, they tore out Indra’s pillar.	A village ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:3.8]()) or royal compound ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.56.1]()) was marked with a “boundary-post” (_indakhīla_). It symbolized a fixed and immovable point, either in a good sense ([sn56.39:4.1]()) or, as here, an obstacle. The Sanskrit _indrakīla_ is a two-foot long iron bolt securing a fort, presumably fixed in the ground (Arthaśāstra 2.3.26), or else a mountain in the Himalayas. The warrior Arjuna, journeying beyond the Gandhamādana, is stopped at the Indrakīla mountain by Sakra/Indra disguised as a brahmin ascetic, at whose urging Arjuna undertakes asceticism in order to gain the power he would need (Mahābhārata 3.3.37). The symbolic sense of “stopping” relates to the Pali sense of immovability, and suggests that the underlying metaphor is the irresistible power represented by Indra. | For Mahāsaṅgīti’s _ūhacca manejā_ read _ūhacca-m-anejā_.

dn20:4.3	The Buddhas of the past had, and the Buddhas of the future will have, gatherings of deities that are at most like the gathering for me now.	This recalls [dn14:1.10.1](), where the relative sizes of the mendicant congregations of different Buddhas are tallied. That sutta, in another point of similarity, also featured a conversation with deities of the Pure Abodes.

These verses offer succor, surrounding them with powerful, albeit invisible, allies.

It is likely the Sanskrit _gandharva_ stems from the same root as the Greek _kentauro_, and the ultimate origin of the idea comes from the proto-Indo-Europeans, who rode the horse, creating a potent entity that was invincible in battle.

Although a god of wealth (_dhanada_), the name Kuvera is explained by lexicographers as “deformed”.

dn20:9.47	stood there dazzling	NA
dn20:9.48	in the wood at Kapilavatthu.	NA
dn20:10.1	Their deceitful heathens came,	These deities are called _dāsa_, which normally means “slave” in Pali. But here, it seems, we have a singular instance of the old Vedic meaning, an uncivilized foe. The _dāsas_ Vṛtra, Namuci, and Vṛṣaśipra are described as “deceivers” (_māyin_, Rig Veda 1.53.7; 2.11.10; 7.99.4; 10.73.7). This epithet is also used of the closely related _dasyu_ (Rig Veda 1.33.10; 4.16.9; 8.14.14; 10.73.5; see note on [dn5:11.5]()). Such beings are said to be “godless” since they oppose the Vedic deities (Rig Veda 2.19.7; 3.31.19; 7.1.10; 10.11.6; 10.138.4, etc.), so we can translate as “heathen”.
dn20:10.2	so treacherous and crafty—	NA
dn20:10.3	the deceivers Kuṭeṇḍu, Viṭeṇḍu,	I am not able to identify any of these names with confidence, but perhaps _kuṭeṇḍu_ and _viṭeṇḍu_ could be traced to _indu_ (“moon”), thus “crooked moon” and “defective moon”. Compare _khaṇḍendu_, a later term for Śiva as the crescent moon.
dn20:10.4	with Viṭucca and Viṭuṭa.	The Sanskrit names are _kiṭi_, _vikiṭi_, _bhṛgu_, and _bhṛkuṭi_. Only _bhṛgu_ is attested in the Vedas, but he was a sage, not a “crafty heathen”.
dn20:10.5	And Candana and Kāmaseṭṭha,	Candana appears in [mn134:6.4](), [sn2.15](), and [sn40.11:1.1](), and together with Kāmaseṭṭha in [dn32:10.4](). _Candana_ means “sandalwood”, although the name of the god might also relate to its root “shining”. | _Kāmaseṭṭha_ means “Chief of Sex”, i.e. “Eros”; he does not seem to appear in a Brahmanical context.
dn20:10.6	Kinnughaṇḍu and Nighaṇḍu,	NA
dn20:10.7	Panāda and Opamañña,	Panāda (“roarer”) was the name of an ancient king who performed the horse sacrifice ([thag2.22:1.1](), [dn26:26.1]()). In [ja265]() he is said to have been the son of Vessavaṇa (Kuvera). | Opamañña is a descendant of the ascended sage Upamanyu (“zealous one”; see note on [mn99:10.3]()).
dn20:10.8	and Mātali, the god’s charioteer.	Mātali is the charioteer of Sakka (i.e. Indra; [sn11.6:1.5](), [mn83:14.1](), etc.), a role he plays throughout Brahmanical literature as well. He appears here as one of the centaur lords, and is father to the centaur Sikhaṇḍī, Pañcasikha’s rival in love [dn21:1.6.8]().
dn20:10.9	Cittasena the centaur came too,	The _gandharva_ Citrasena (“Brightspear”) appears in the Sanskrit Purāṇas as a friend of Arjuna in various adventures.
dn20:10.10	and the kings Nala and Janesabha.	_Nala_ means “reed”. There was a King Nala of Vidarbha whose love for his Queen Damayantī is celebrated in the Mahābharata. | Janesabha is an alternate spelling of Janavasabha ([dn18]()).
dn20:10.11	Pañcasikha came too, with	In [dn21]() we shall learn of how the centaur Pañcasikha (“Fivecrest”) wooed Timbaru’s daughter Suriyavaccasā (“Sunshine”).
dn20:10.12	Timbaru and Suriyavaccasā.	NA

dn20:10.16	to the meeting of mendicants in the wood.	NA
dn20:11.1	Then came the dragons of Nābhasa lake,	Read _nābhasa_, which means “celestial, heavenly”. The commentary says this was the name of a lake, which agrees with the legend that a Nābhasa was a son of Nala (“reed”) and father of Puṇḍarīka (“lotus”). The Sanskrit here, however, has _sahabhuṁ nāgo_.
dn20:11.2	and those from Vesālī with those from Takkasilā.	_Vesālā_ is from the adjectival form _vesāla_ (“of Vesālī”). | Pali _taccha_ can represent Sanskrit _takṣa_, and the Sanskrit does indeed have _takṣakaḥ_ here, so Tacchaka is probably “of Takṣasilā”. This famous city, normally spelled Takkasilā in Pali, is Taxila in West Pakistan, an ancient center of learning.
dn20:11.3	The Kambalas and Assataras came	These _nāgas_ are frequently mentioned together in Sanskrit literature such as the Mahābhārata (1.31.1a, 2.9.9a, 5.101.9c), where they are also said to come from Pāyāga (3.83.72a: _prayāgaṁ sapratiṣṭhānaṁ kambalāśvatarau_).
dn20:11.4	and those from Payāga with their kin.	Payāga (modern Prayagraj, formerly Allahabad) is the sacred ford at the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamunā beside Kosambī (see [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.18]()).
dn20:11.5	Those from Yamunā, and the Dhataraṭṭha	The Dhataraṭṭha and Erāvaṇa _nāgas_ also appear frequently in Sanskrit literature, and often in association with other deities in our text as part of a loose cluster of divinities (eg. Harivamśa 3.112–117). Erāvaṇa also appears at [snp2.14:5.1](). Here he is a _nāga_ as in “dragon”, but later tradition saw him as a _nāga_ as in “elephant”, in which role he became the mighty mount of Indra/Sakka.
dn20:11.6	dragons came, so glorious.	NA
dn20:11.7	And Erāvaṇa the great dragon	NA
dn20:11.8	also came to the meeting in the wood.	NA
dn20:11.9	Those who seize the dragon kings by force—	Here we see the eternal mythic struggle between birds and snakes, the creatures of the sky and the underworld.
dn20:11.10	Heavenly, twice-born birds with piercing vision—	Birds are called “twice-born”, once from the mother, once from the egg. “Twice-born” is also an epithet of brahmins ([thig15.1:31.3]()).
dn20:11.11	swoop down to the wood from the sky;	NA
dn20:11.12	their name is ‘Rainbow Phoenix’.	The _supaṇṇā_ (Sanskrit _suparṇa_, “brightwing”) or _garuḷā_ (Sanskrit _garuḍā_, “devourer”) is the great eagle, king of birds, and later the vehicle of Viṣṇu. He has been falsely compared with the loathsome harpy; but his golden wings, closeness to the sun, and role as bearer of the nectar of immortality show that he is the Indian phoenix, the golden eagle of the sun. Unlike the western phoenix, he is not said to combust himself and be reborn anew. However this motif is merely the surface expression of the sun’s fiery immortality. As the brother of the Dawn (Aruṇa), his golden wings at sunset “devour” the sun, and he disappears only to be reborn the next day.
dn20:11.13	But the dragon kings remained fearless,	NA
dn20:11.14	for the Buddha kept them safe from the phoenixes.	NA
dn20:11.15	Inviting each other with gentle words,	_Upavhayati_ occurs only here and [sn7.9:4.3]() in Pali. It is  Vedic term for invoking or calling up blessings in a whisper.
dn20:11.16	the dragons and phoenixes <j>took the Buddha as refuge.	The Buddha reconciles even such inveterate enemies. In the Buddhist view, all of these beings have their place in the great pattern of nature.
dn20:12.1	Defeated by Vajirahattha,	_Vajirahattha_ (“thunderbolt-in-hand”) is a synonym of _vajirapāṇi_ ([dn3:1.21.3](), [mn35:14.1]()). It is a frequent epithet of Sakka in the Vedas (eg. Rig Veda 1.173.10a _indro vajrahastaḥ_), an identification confirmed by the commentary here.
dn20:12.2	the titans live in the ocean.	NA
dn20:12.3	They’re brothers of Vāsava,	Vāsava is another epithet of Sakka (see below, [dn20:14.9]()), meaning “endowed with wealth” (_vasu_; see for example Rig Veda 1.9.9a _indraṁ vasupatiṁ_ “Indra, lord of wealth”). The Buddhist explanation of his name [sn11.13:9.1](), rather, plays on the word _āvasatha_ and calls him the “giver of a guesthouse”. Later Brahmanical texts enumerated eight Vasus, with Indra as their lord, who are reckoned among the thirty-three. | Sakka’s wife is the demon (_asura_) princess Sujā, daughter of Vepacitti, hence they are his “brothers”, technically in-laws ([sn11.12:6.1]()).
dn20:12.4	powerful and glorious.	NA
dn20:12.5	There’s the terrifying Kālakañjas,	The Kālakañja is the lowest class of titans ([dn24:1.7.19]()). Legend has it that they tried to build a fire altar of bricks (i.e. a mountain) to ascend to the heavens and contest with the gods (Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 1.1.2.4–6, alluded to at Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.1.2.13). Three are mentioned as being godlike at Atharvaveda 6.80.2. The Mahābhārata (eg. 4.44.9) says they are Dānavas, an association supported in the next line. They seem to be associated with the ferocious Kālakeyas, children of Kālā. But a common Sanskrit spelling is _kālakhañja_, where _khañja_ means “lame”. This calls to mind the lame smith-god Hephaestus, who also ascended to heaven. _Kāla_ (“black”) then would be the black metal iron (cf. English “blacksmith”), yielding the sense “iron-lamed”.
dn20:12.6	the Dānava and Ghasa titans,	The Dānavas are a prominent group of _asuras_ otherwise unattested in early Pali. The name stems from “rivers, waters” after their mother Danū. | Ghasa (“devourer”) is occasionally mentioned as the name of a _rakṣasa_ (Rāmāyaṇa 5.22.36a _praghasā nāma rākṣasī_). The commentary treats them as a single class of arrow-wielding _asuras_.
dn20:12.7	Vepacitti and Sucitti,	Vepacitti means “wise thinker”, Sucitti means “good thinker”. Vepacitti was the lord of the _asuras_ and Sakka’s counterpart. Their relationship was complicated ([sn11.23]()). Brahmanical literature regards him as the eldest son of Danū and hence chief of the Dānavas. The Sanskrit form is _vipracitti_, but in Buddhist texts it is incorrectly Sanskritized to _vemacitra_. Vepacitti’s fame matches Sucitti’s obscurity, for he does not seem to appear elsewhere.
dn20:12.8	Pahārāda with Namuci,	Pahārāda the ocean-loving _asura_ lord appears in [an8.19](). His name (Sanskrit _prahlāda_) means “mirth”. Later Brahmanical legends say he was a righteous son of the wicked Hiraṇyakaśipu, who hated him for his devotion to Viṣṇu. | The story goes that when Namuci stole the soma from Indra, Indra’s vengeance was frustrated by his vow not to harm him with anything wet or dry, in the dark or the light (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 12.7.3.1). Indra’s ingenious solution was to dismember him with foam (Rig Veda 8.14.13) at dawn. Namuci’s name is explained as _na-muci_, “not letting go” (the waters). In Buddhism, Namuci is a name of Māra, although here Māra appears separately below..
dn20:12.9	and Bali’s hundred sons,	According to legend, Bali was the grandson of Pahārāda and son of Virocana. His hundred sons were dread warriors (Bhāgavata Purāṇa 8.10.30). The word _bali_ also refers to a kind of sacrificial offering, but the roots of the term are obscure.
dn20:12.10	all named after Virocana.	_Virocana_ was their grandfather. He was another adversary of Indra, despite which they were both said to have sought knowledge from Prajāpatī, but Virocana misunderstood since he saw only the surface meaning (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.7.2–8.5). Here he is associated with Rāhu, while Gaṇeśa Purāṇa 2.29 says he was granted a crown by the sun which he then lost. These details hint at a connection with the eclipse, in which case _virocana_ would be the rays that emanate during a solar eclipse.
dn20:12.11	Bali’s army armed themselves	NA
dn20:12.12	and went to the auspicious Rāhu, saying:	Rāhu is the mighty _asura_ who “seizes” the moon ([sn2.9]()) or the sun ([sn2.10]()) to create an eclipse. He is the son of Vepacitti. It is strange to see him described as “auspicious” (_bhadda_), as he is a black planet and a force of darkness.
dn20:12.13	‘Now is the time, sir,	NA
dn20:12.14	for the meeting of mendicants in the wood.’	NA
dn20:13.1	The gods of water and earth,	NA
dn20:13.2	and fire and wind came there.	These four are normally treated in the suttas as physical properties. Each of them is worshiped in the Rig Veda as a deity, and the Upanishads list them together along with other elements (eg. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.5). I am not aware of any earlier contexts that group the four together systematically as deities in this way.
dn20:13.3	The gods of Varuṇa and Varuṇa’s offsping,	Varuṇa is invoked frequently in the Vedas, and in the suttas he is associated with other leading deities such as Indra and Soma ([dn13:25.2](), [dn32:10.2](), [sn11.3:5.1]()). As one of the twelve children of Aditi he stood for a calendar month, and grew a wide and sometimes baffling array of associations—the oceans, water, the sky (at night), and justice. Vedic Varuṇa was the god of command, the king of tough rule. He was identified with the aristocrats, while his partner Mitra was the brahmins (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 4.1.4).
dn20:13.4	and Soma together with Yasa.	_Soma_ is the divine nectar that filled the ancient proto-Indo-Europeans with vitality. Its biological identity is disputed, but may have been ephedra. It is associated with the moon, hence the connection with Varuṇa as the night sky. | _Yasa_ means “fame, glory”; so far as I know it is not personified in early Brahmanical texts, and rarely later. The connection between these two is illuminated by such passages as Rig Veda 7.85.3. To uphold Indra and Varuṇa in battle, there is an offering of Soma, which is described as _svayaśasaḥ_, “Self-Glorious”, i.e. the state of being high on speed, if speed were a god.
dn20:13.5	A host of the gods of love	In the Vedas, Mitra (“friend”) is almost always paired with Varuṇa, and the appearance of Mettā (“friendliness”) here echoes that closeness. He was the god of alliances. | _Karuṇā_ in the sense of “compassion” does not occur at all in pre-Buddhist Sanskrit. It is probably introduced here as companion to Mettā by association with Mitra. The Sanskrit here, however, is _maitrī varuṇikā_. From a Buddhist point of view, these are deities reborn due to the development of _jhāna_ based on love and compassion.

dn20:14.1	The Vishnu and Sahalī gods,	Veṇhu (variant _veṇḍu_) is the Pali spelling of Sanskrit _viṣṇu_, who appears only here and at [sn2.12](). In the Rig Veda he was a solar god who made three great strides (said to encompass the earth, the sky, and the heavens). | A deity named Sahalī (“with plow”) appears at [sn2.30:3.1]() where he praises Makkhali Gosāla, but I cannot trace him anywhere else.
dn20:14.2	and the unequaled pair of twins.	_Yama_ often refers to a god who guards the paths to the land of the dead ([sn1.33:10.3](), [mn130:5.1]()), lord of the Yāma gods. Here, however, it refers to “twins” who in the Vedas are often identified with the Aśvins (the twin horses yoked to the chariot). In the Vedas, it seems _asama_ (“unequalled”) is used as an epithet only, although the commentary says it is a name. | In Pali these lines lack a verb, while the Sanskrit supplies _āgataś_ (“come”) instead of _asamā_, so perhaps we should read “the pair of Twins came”.

The Buddha reforms it to _Purindada_ (“Firstgiver”) at [sn11.12:2.1](). But Indra’s generosity is long renowned, eg. Rig Veda 1.10.6c: “He is the able one, and he will be able for us—Indra who distributes the goods” (_sa śakra uta naḥ śakad indro vasu dayamānaḥ_).

dn20:16.5	Then came the gods of Mercury,	_Hari_ means “yellow, green” and is the astrological color of the planet _budha_ (“Mercury”). It came to have the general meaning of “sacred, holy” and was an epithet for various deities, which in the Rig Veda included Indra and Vishnu. However the astrological connection is suggested by the references to Mars and Venus below.
dn20:16.6	and those who live on Mars.	“Dwellers in the Red Place (= planet)”, i.e. “Martians”.

dn20:17.1	The gods of Venus, the newborn Sun, <j>and the Dawn	The deities seem to represent the three main lights that announce a new day: the morning star, the newborn sun, and the aura of the dawn. | _Sukka_ (“Bright”) is the name of the planet Venus, the morning star. | _Aruṇa_ is the dawn, a major Vedic deity signifying the arising of consciousness and order. | _Karambha_ means “porridge”, which was offered to the sun under the name Pūṣan (Rig Veda 3.52.7, 6.56.1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 4.2.5.22; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 6.8.18; Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 3.10.6). Hence he became known as _karambhād_, “porridge-eater”. Apparently the sun lost its teeth and could only eat porridge (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.7.4.8). Being toothless like a baby, and lacking the risen sun’s “teeth” (i.e. “rays”), he probably represents the “newborn sun”. Compare for example Rig Veda 10.35, where Pūṣan  is invoked, along with many other deities, in a hymn to the dawn.
dn20:17.2	came along with those from Saturn.	Mahāsaṅgīti has _veghanasā_, for which the Buddha Jayanthi variant _vekhanasa_ is preferable. We meet a wanderer of that name in [mn80](), and in Sanskrit _vaikhānasa_ is a general term for ascetics; but this meaning seems unlikely in context. The astrologer Varāhamitra names it a constellation (Bṛhat-saṁhitā 47.62), but that is much later. The Sanskrit here is _nīlakavāsinī_ (“Dwellers in the Blue”), which pairs well with _lohitavāsino_ above. _Nīlavāsa_ is a name for Saturn, whose color is blue.
dn20:17.3	And the gods of the white globe came	_Odātagayha_ is probably “white planet”, i.e. the sun. Sanskrit has _avadātakeśā_ (“white-haired”). Compare the description of solar gods Sūrya at Rig Veda 1.50.8 as _śociṣkeśaṁ vicakṣaṇa_ (“flame-haired, brilliant”) and Varuṇa at Rig Veda 8.41.9 as _śvetā vicakṣaṇā_ (“white, brilliant”).
dn20:17.4	leading the brilliant gods.	Sanskrit has _pītakavāsinī_, “dwellers in the yellow”, either Mercury or Jupiter.
dn20:17.5	The Sadāmattas and Hāragajas,	The _sadāmatta_ (“everdrunk”) gods appear in some later Buddhist texts, alongside the _māyādharas_ (or _mālādharas_), but they don’t seem to appear in a Vedic context. | I cannot find any reference to the _hāragaja_ gods.  Sanskrit has _hāritakā_, perhaps “sons of Harītī” (the _yakkhinī_; but see below, [dn20:20.12]()).
dn20:17.6	and assorted glorious ones;	“Assorted” is _missaka_, not elsewhere attested as a name of gods.
dn20:17.7	Pajjuna came thundering,	Pajjuna (Sanskrit _parjanya_) is a Vedic god of thunderstorms closely associated with Indra/Sakka. His daughters appear in [sn1.39]() and [sn1.40](). Sanskrit has instead _śuddhakā rucikā_ (“pure, bright”).

dn20:17.14	to the meeting of mendicants in the wood.	NA
dn20:18.1	The Khemiyas from the realms of Tusita and Yama,	The gods of Tusita and Yama are normal parts of the Buddhist cosmology. Neither _khemiya_ nor the Sanskrit _kṣemaka_ appear to be the names of gods elsewhere, and the commentary explains that they dwell in both the Tusita and Yama realms.
dn20:18.2	and the glorious Kaṭṭhakas came;	The commentary acknowledges the variant readings _kaṭṭhakā_ (from “stick” or “plowed”) and _kathakā_ (“reciters”), while Sanskrit has _kṛṣṇuktāś_ (“reciters of the black”). Perhaps related to Sanskrit _kāṭhaka_, a recension of the Black Yajur Veda taught by the sage Kaṭha.
dn20:18.3	the Lambītakas, Lāmaseṭṭhas,	Perhaps from _lamba_ (“hang, droop”) in reference to deities of the sunset (cp. Mahābhārata 4.31.4c _sūrye vilambati_). Sanskrit has _lumbinī lumbinīśreṣṭhā_, which is perhaps normalized to mean “of Lumbinī”.
dn20:18.4	those called the Shining, <j>and the gods of Granted Wishes.	“Shining” (_joti_) is used widely of many gods, including the Sun and Indra. | The commentary derives _āsavā_ from _āsa_ (“wish”) not _āsava_ (“defilement”), explaining that they achieved their status due to desire (_chandavasena_). This agrees with the Sanskrit _svāśiṣā_ (“well-wish, prayer”), i.e. words of wishing or blessing uttered over the sacrifice (see Rig Veda 10.44.5; cp. 8.44.23). This is a case where using the Pali in a translation would be actively misleading.

dn20:19.5	‘They who have shed rebirth, the kindly ones,	_Pavuṭṭha_ (“shed”), from _pavasati_ (“stay away”), seems to be unique in the Pali in this sense. Commentary glosses _vigata_, “disappeared”. | The first part of this verse, according to the commentary, addresses the Saṅgha as a group in the singular, but I translate in plural for clarity.

dn20:20.1	Subrahmā and Paramatta came,	Subrahmā appears as a godling at [sn2.17](), but given his company this is likely the “independent divinity” of [sn6.6]()–8. | Paramatta appears only here in Pali. In Brahmanical texts it is a common term for the highest conception of Brahmā as the “supreme soul” (_paramātman_) of the cosmos. This term came into common usage later, but is found occasionally in earlier texts such as Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 2.9.1.
dn20:20.2	with sons of those powerful ones.	NA
dn20:20.3	Sanaṅkumāra and Tissa	Sanaṅkumāra makes regular guest appearances in the suttas ([dn3](), [dn18](), [dn19](), [dn27](), [sn6.11](), [an11.10]()). | Tissa is a common name, meaning “born under the star Sirius”. Perhaps this is the former monk of that name who was reborn in the Brahmā realm ([an6.34]()).
dn20:20.4	also came to the meeting in the wood.	NA
dn20:20.5	Of a thousand realms of divinity,	NA

dn20:20.8	his formidable body so glorious.	NA
dn20:20.9	Ten Gods Almighty came there,	“God Almighty” (_issara_) is a Brahmā god to whom the creation of the world is falsely attributed ([dn24:2.14.3](), [mn101:22.5](), [an3.61:1.6]()).

dn21:0.1	Long Discourses 21	NA
dn21:0.2	Sakka’s Questions	NA
dn21:1.1.1	So I have heard.	This late sutta exhibits considerable literary sophistication. The A-plot concerns Sakka’s rejection of his violent past and embrace of the Dhamma, while the B-plot concerns Pañcasikkha’s more modest growth from a libertine to a married man. | This discourse is quoted by name and a passage discussed at [sn22.4](). In addition, the dialogue at [mn37]() picks up directly where this leaves off and may be considered a sequel. A Sanskrit parallel published by Ernst Waldschmidt in 1979 is available on SuttaCentral as [SF 241](https://suttacentral.net/sf241/san/waldschmidt). A different discourse of the same name is found at [sn35.118]().
dn21:1.1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans, where east of Rājagaha there is a brahmin village named Ambasaṇḍā, north of which, on Mount Vediyaka, is Indra’s hill cave.	Rhys Davids follows the commentary in translating this “the cave of Indra’s Sāl Tree”. However the Sanskrit  _yāvacchailaguhāyām_ supports “hill cave”.
dn21:1.1.3	Now at that time Sakka, the lord of gods, grew eager to see the Buddha.	NA
dn21:1.1.4	He thought,	NA
dn21:1.1.5	“Where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”	NA
dn21:1.1.6	Seeing that the Buddha was at Indra’s hill cave,	NA
dn21:1.1.7	he addressed the gods of the thirty-three,	NA
dn21:1.1.8	“Good fellows, the Buddha is staying in the land of the Magadhans at Indra’s hill cave.	NA
dn21:1.1.9	What if we were to go and see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”	NA
dn21:1.1.10	“Yes, lord,” replied the gods.	NA
dn21:1.2.1	Then Sakka addressed the centaur Pañcasikha,	Introduced in a minor role in [dn18](), [dn19](), and [dn20](), Pañcasikha gets his moment to shine in this sutta. Outside of the Dīghanikāya, he appears only in [sn35.119](). His name means “Fivecrest”, evidently in reference to his impressive hairdo; a nymph or group of nymphs bore the synonymous name Pañcacūḍā, “Five Topknots”. The centaur (_gandhabba_) was a wild rogue of music, dancing, and sex. He must be tamed, and here this is achieved through the power of love and filial respect. A less diplomatic approach is taken in Atharvaveda 4.37.7, where the _gandharva_ with his “egg-crest” (_śikhaṇḍino_) is threatened with castration.
dn21:1.2.2	“Dear Pañcasikha, the Buddha is staying in the land of the Magadhans at Indra’s hill cave.	NA
dn21:1.2.3	What if we were to go and see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”	NA
dn21:1.2.4	“Yes, lord,” replied the centaur Pañcasikha. Taking his arched harp made from the pale timber of wood-apple, he went as Sakka’s attendant.	The “arched harp” (_vīṇa_) was a multi-stringed instrument held in the lap, with the strings attached across a curved open arch or bow. It is not the modern Indian instrument called veena, which is a lute or stick zither. _Gandhabbas_ are closely associated with music. Māra’s harp is described in the same way ([sn4.23:10.7]()), and tradition says they were in fact the same instrument.
dn21:1.2.5	Then Sakka went at the head of a retinue consisting of the gods of the thirty-three and the godling centaur Pañcasikha.	In the Buddhist hierarchy of divinity, _gandhabbas_ occupy a more humble place than the gods of the thirty-three, yet here Pañcasikha appears with them in a position of honor. In [dn19:28.3]() we saw that the even more exalted Brahmā takes the form of Pañcasikha. This fluidity is characteristic of old Vedic cosmology, where there is no clear hierarchy of divinity. The formalized hierarchies in Buddhism and Hinduism are a later conception.
dn21:1.2.6	As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the heaven of the gods of the thirty-three and landed on Mount Vediyaka north of Ambasaṇḍā.	NA
dn21:1.3.1	Now at that time a dazzling light appeared over Mount Vediyaka and Ambasaṇḍā, as happens through the glory of the gods.	NA
dn21:1.3.2	People in the villages round about, terrified, shocked, and awestruck, said,	NA
dn21:1.3.3	“Mount Vediyaka must be on fire today, blazing and burning!	NA
dn21:1.3.4	Oh why has such a dazzling light appeared over Mount Vediyaka and Ambasaṇḍā?”	NA
dn21:1.3.5	NA	NA
dn21:1.4.1	Then Sakka addressed the centaur Pañcasikha,	NA
dn21:1.4.2	“My dear Pañcasikha, it is hard for one like me to get near the Realized Ones while they are on retreat practicing absorption, enjoying absorption.	We will learn later of how Sakka’s appearance could be too disturbing for the Buddha while on retreat ([dn21:1.10.13]()). Pañcasikha, on the other hand, would appear alone, without a retinue. Note, however, that on subsequent occasions Sakka showed no such reticence, either because he was already a stream-enterer or because the Buddha was not in solitary retreat.
dn21:1.4.3	But if you were to charm the Buddha first, then I could go to see him.”	NA
dn21:1.4.4	“Yes, lord,” replied the centaur Pañcasikha. Taking his arched harp made from the pale timber of wood-apple, he went to Indra’s hill cave. When he had drawn near, he stood to one side, thinking,	NA
dn21:1.4.5	“This is neither too far nor too near; and he’ll hear my voice.”	NA
dn21:1.4.6	NA	NA
dn21:1.4.7.0	1. Pañcasikha’s Song	NA
dn21:1.4.8	Standing to one side, Pañcasikha played his arched harp, and sang these verses on the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the perfected ones, and sensual love.	The idea that the Buddha would be wooed by a love song seems like an absurd conceit, until you take into account the centaurs’ dangerous reputation as inveterate lechers. Pañcasikha wants to show that he is maturing and finally seeking a commitment in a respectable marriage.
dn21:1.5.1	“O Bhaddā Suriyavaccasā, my Darling Sunshine,	Suriyavaccasā (“Sunshine”) accords with the Vedic conception of the wife as the Sun (Sūryā, Rig Veda 10.85) who takes as husband Soma, the moon. She appears in Atharvaveda 8.10.27, which invokes the _gandharvas_ with their female counterpart the “nymphs” (Pali _accharā_, Sanskrit _apsaras_).
dn21:1.5.2	I pay homage to your father Timbaru,	In Sanskrit literature, Timbaru (Sanskrit _tumburu_) was an elder _gandharva_ musician in the courts of Indra and Kuvera. According to Rāmāyaṇa 3.4, he was cursed with a monstrous form by Kuvera due to an inappropriate lust for the nymph Rambhā. Upon his defeat at the hands of Rāma he was restored to his former status. Pañcasikha would have wanted to avoid a similar fate. Rather than Suriyavaccasā, the Sanskrit literature mentions his daughters Manuvantī and Sukeśī (Vāyupurāṇa 69.49 = Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa 2.7.13).
dn21:1.5.3	through whom was born a lady so fine,	NA
dn21:1.5.4	to fill me with a joy I never knew.	NA
dn21:1.5.5	As sweet as a breeze to one who’s sweating,	NA
dn21:1.5.6	or when thirsty, a sweet and cooling drink,	NA
dn21:1.5.7	so dear are you, Aṅgīrasi, to me—	_Aṅgīrasi_ means “shining one” and is etymologically linked with _agni_ (“fire”). Suriyavaccasā earned the name due to both her radiant nature and her family connections: her father Timbaru was a son of Kaśyapa, who was (according to certain lineages) brother of Aṅgīras, from whom the Aṅgīrasas were descended. In the Arthavaveda—the only early non-Buddhist source for a nymph named Suriyavaccasā—_aṅgīrasi_ is associated with witchcraft (Atharvaveda 12.5.52). _Aṅgīrasa_ is also a patronymic of the Buddha ([dn32:3.14]()).
dn21:1.5.8	just like the teaching is to all the saints!	“Saints” is _arahantā_, which I normally translate as “perfected ones”.
dn21:1.5.9	Like a cure when you’re struck by fever dire,	NA
dn21:1.5.10	or food to ease the hunger pain,	NA
dn21:1.5.11	come on, Bhaddā, please put out my fire,	_Parinibbāpaya_, “please quench me”. Pañcasikha subverts imagery employed by the Buddha—quenching thirst, cooling breezes, extinguished flames—to erotic effect.

dn21:1.5.16	that’s how I would plunge into your breast.	NA
dn21:1.5.17	Like elephants bursting bonds in rutting season,	Pañcasikha is showing off his literary skill. The same image, the elephant, illustrates opposing qualities, peaceful and violent. In these two sides of sensual desire, he reveals, unconsciously perhaps, the rapacious side of his own nature. For Pañcasikha, the elephant bursting its bonds illustrates his crazed devotion, whereas later it illustrates breaking free of desire ([dn21:1.12.45]()).

dn21:1.6.1	When Pañcasikha had spoken, the Buddha said to him,	NA
dn21:1.6.2	“Pañcasikha, the sound of your strings blends well with the sound of your singing,	If Pañcasikha was seeking the Buddha’s approval for his love-match, he was doomed to disappointment, as the Buddha and his mendicants do not involve themselves in arranging marriages. The Buddha sidesteps the issue by politely complementing Pañcasikha on his musicianship.
dn21:1.6.3	so that neither overpowers the other.	NA
dn21:1.6.4	But when did you compose these verses on the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the perfected ones, and sensual love?”	“When did you compose” is also at [mn56:30.1]().
dn21:1.6.5	“This one time, sir, when you were first awakened, you were staying in Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.	NA
dn21:1.6.6	And at that time I was in love with the lady named Bhaddā Suriyavaccasā, ‘Darling Sunshine’, the daughter of the centaur king Timbaru.	NA
dn21:1.6.7	But the sister desired another.	“Sister” (_bhaginī_) is a respectful term of address, but is normally used in a chaste sense. When Raṭṭhapāla calls his wives “sister”, they faint in shock ([mn82:23.4]()).
dn21:1.6.8	It was the one named Sikhaṇḍī, the son of Mātali the charioteer, who she loved.	Sikhaṇḍī (“egg-crested”) is the term for the centaur as seductive threat to women in Atharvaveda 4.37.7. It is also a poetic term for a peacock.
dn21:1.6.9	Since I couldn’t win that sister by any means,	NA
dn21:1.6.10	I took my arched harp to Timbaru’s home, where I played those verses.	NA

dn21:1.7.8	NA	NA
dn21:1.7.9	NA	NA
dn21:1.7.10	When I finished, Suriyavaccasā said to me,	NA
dn21:1.7.11	‘Good fellow, I have not personally seen the Buddha. But I did hear about him when I went to dance for the gods of the thirty-three in the Hall of Justice.	NA
dn21:1.7.12	Since you extol the Buddha, let us meet up today.’	NA
dn21:1.7.13	And that’s when I met up with that sister.	NA
dn21:1.7.14	But we have not met since.”	NA
dn21:1.8.0	2. The Approach of Sakka	NA
dn21:1.8.1	Then Sakka, lord of gods, thought,	NA
dn21:1.8.2	“Pañcasikha is exchanging pleasantries with the Buddha.”	NA
dn21:1.8.3	So he addressed Pañcasikha,	NA
dn21:1.8.4	“My dear Pañcasikha, please bow to the Buddha for me, saying:	NA
dn21:1.8.5	‘Sir, Sakka, lord of gods, with his ministers and retinue, bows with his head at your feet.’”	NA
dn21:1.8.6	“Yes, lord,” replied Pañcasikha. He bowed to the Buddha and said,	NA
dn21:1.8.7	“Sir, Sakka, lord of gods, with his ministers and retinue, bows with his head at your feet.”	NA
dn21:1.8.8	“So may Sakka with his ministers and retinue be happy, Pañcasikha,” said the Buddha,	NA
dn21:1.8.9	“for all want to be happy—whether gods, humans, titans, dragons, centaurs, or any of the other diverse creatures there may be.”	NA
dn21:1.8.10	For that is how the Realized Ones salute such illustrious spirits.	NA
dn21:1.8.11	And being saluted by the Buddha, Sakka entered Indra’s hill cave, bowed to the Buddha, and stood to one side.	NA
dn21:1.8.12	And the gods of the thirty-three did likewise,	NA
dn21:1.8.13	as did Pañcasikha.	NA
dn21:1.9.1	And at that time the uneven places were evened out, the cramped places were opened up, the darkness vanished in the cave and light appeared, as happens through the glory of the gods.	NA
dn21:1.9.2	Then the Buddha said to Sakka,	NA
dn21:1.9.3	“It’s incredible and amazing that you, the venerable Kosiya, who has so many duties and so much to do, should come here.”	It is rare for the Buddha to address a deity as “venerable” (_āyasmā_), a term usually reserved for monks. Moggallāna addresses Sakka as “the venerable Kosiya” at [mn37:10.6](); Mahākassapa calls him Kosiya without honorific at [ud3.7:3.12](). | The word _kosiya_ is explained by the commentaries as “owl”, which, if correct, would have been the totem for a clan of that name. It is, however, a patronymic: Rig Veda 1.10.11 has _indra kauśika_ which means “Indra, son of Kuśika (or Kuśa)”. _Kuśa_ grass is critical to the performance of Vedic rites, and the label probably initially implied “Brahmanized”, i.e. a king whose reign was authorized according to Vedic ritual. Kosiya is said to be a low class family name ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:2.1.18]()).
dn21:1.9.4	“For a long time I’ve wanted to come and see the Buddha, but I wasn’t able, being prevented by my many duties and responsibilities for the gods of the thirty-three.	NA
dn21:1.9.5	This one time, sir, the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the frankincense-tree hut.	NA
dn21:1.9.6	Then I went to Sāvatthī to see the Buddha.	NA
dn21:1.10.1	But at that time the Buddha was sitting immersed in some kind of meditation. And a divine maiden of Great King Vessavaṇa named Bhūjati was attending on the Buddha, standing there paying homage to him with joined palms.	A _paricārikā_ is a maid attending on a nymph ([mn37:8.12]()). | Bhūjati (variant _bhuñjatī_) does not seem to appear elsewhere.
dn21:1.10.2	So I said to her,	NA
dn21:1.10.3	‘Sister, please bow to the Buddha for me, saying:	NA
dn21:1.10.4	“Sir, Sakka, lord of gods, with his ministers and retinue, bows with his head at your feet.”’	NA
dn21:1.10.5	When I said this, she said to me,	NA
dn21:1.10.6	‘It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha,	NA
dn21:1.10.7	as he’s in retreat.’	NA
dn21:1.10.8	‘Well then, sister, please convey my message when the Buddha emerges from that immersion.’	NA
dn21:1.10.9	NA	NA
dn21:1.10.10	I hope that sister bowed to you?	NA
dn21:1.10.11	Do you remember what she said?”	NA
dn21:1.10.12	“She did bow, lord of gods, and I remember what she said.	NA
dn21:1.10.13	I also remember that it was the sound of your chariot wheels that pulled me out of that immersion.”	Sakka pointedly ignores this, but perhaps his shame at disturbing the Buddha’s meditation explains his oblique method of gaining an audience.
dn21:1.11.1	“Sir, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the gods who were reborn in the host of the thirty-three before me:	NA
dn21:1.11.2	‘When a Realized One arises in the world, perfected and fully awakened, the heavenly hosts swell, while the titan hosts dwindle.’	NA
dn21:1.11.3	And I have seen this with my own eyes.	NA
dn21:1.11.4.0	2.1. The Story of Gopikā	NA
dn21:1.11.5	Right here in Kapilavatthu there was a Sakyan lady named Gopikā who had confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and had fulfilled her ethics.	This implies she was a stream-enterer.
dn21:1.11.6	Losing her attachment to femininity, she developed masculinity. When her body broke up, after death, she was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	In Buddhism, sex is mutable between lives and even within one life ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.6.1]()). Later Buddhists sometimes held that the status of a male was preferable. Here this is not stated outright, but the narrative implies that she thought her station was improved when becoming a male. Notably, it is not the Buddha who says this, but Sakka, relaying the story of another deity. That the proponent was a woman, at least formerly, is a trope of Indian literature: a woman is the ideal misogynist (see eg. [ja61]() or Śivapurāna chapter 4). Here, though, the situation is nuanced, because despite her (presumed) inferior status, she has better rebirth than the monks she served.
dn21:1.11.7	In the company of the gods of the thirty-three she became one of my sons.	NA
dn21:1.11.8	There they knew him as	NA
dn21:1.11.9	the godling Gopaka.	NA
dn21:1.11.10	Meanwhile three others, mendicants who had led the spiritual life under the Buddha, were reborn in the inferior centaur realm.	The realm of centaurs is “inferior” because the centaurs are known for their ribald sexuality.
dn21:1.11.11	There they amused themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, and became my servants and attendants.	NA
dn21:1.11.12	At that, Gopaka scolded them,	NA
dn21:1.11.13	‘Where on earth were you at, good fellows, when you heard the Buddha’s teaching!	_Kutomukhā_, which occurs only in this sutta, contrasts with _sammukhā_ (“in the presence of”, “from the mouth of”). The commentary explains it as a rhetorical question, “Were you distracted or falling asleep?” Alternatively, it might mean “From whom did you learn the Buddha’s teaching?” It recurs later in the verses. This is not the only such case: _duddiṭṭharūpaṁ_ and _kāyaṁ brahmapurohitaṁ_ are other examples of terms found nowhere else in the Pali canon, yet found here both in prose and in verse. Clearly one has been copied from the other; it seems to me that the rarity of these terms and the greater coherence of the verses suggests that the prose is a (somewhat altered) summary of the verses.
dn21:1.11.14	For while I was still a woman I had confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and had fulfilled my ethics. I lost my attachment to femininity and developed masculinity. When my body broke up, after death, I was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. In the company of the gods of the thirty-three I became one of Sakka’s sons.	NA
dn21:1.11.15	Here they know me as	NA
dn21:1.11.16	the godling Gopaka.	NA
dn21:1.11.17	But you, having led the spiritual life under the Buddha, were reborn in the inferior centaur realm.	NA
dn21:1.11.18	It is a sad sight indeed to see fellow practitioners reborn in the inferior centaur realm.’	NA
dn21:1.11.19	When scolded by Gopaka, two of those gods regained their memory right away. They went to the host of the priests of Divinity, but one god remained attached to sensual pleasures.	The commentary explains the verb “gained” (_paṭilabhiṁsu_) as serving dual roles here: “gaining” of “absorption mindfulness” (_jhānasatiṁ_), upon which they “gain” rebirth in the Brahmā realm. However, the verses below speak of “recollecting” (_anussaraṁ_) the Buddha’s teachings at this juncture. Compare [pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.1.20](), where the king “remembered” his long-forgotten promise (_vissaritvā cirena satiṁ paṭilabhitvā_). [an4.191:2.24]() speaks of the “arising of memory” (_satuppādo_) in a deity when reminded of Dhamma passages they once recited as a monk. | The phrase _kāyaṁ brahmapurohitaṁ_ is syntactically incongruous; I think it was clumsily copied from the verses below, where the required verb (_ajjhagaṁsu_) is present. The commentary explains it as “a Minister of Brahmā’s body” (_brahmapurohitasarīraṁ_), but in such contexts _kāya_ usually means “host”.

dn21:1.12.50	the heroes desireless, practicing purity.	NA
dn21:1.12.51	Seeing them, Vāsava was struck with urgency;	Normally rebirth is described as passing away in one realm then being reborn in another. Yet here the gods of the thirty-three—in their traditional abode on Mount Meru—were watching them literally fly from one realm to another.
dn21:1.12.52	the master of gods in the midst of the group said,	NA
dn21:1.12.53	“These were born in the lesser centaur realm,	NA

dn21:1.12.56	Gopaka addressed Vāsava,	NA
dn21:1.12.57	“There is a Buddha, a lord of men, in the world.	The truncated _janind’_ is not vocative _janinda_ for Sakka, but nominative _janindo_ for the Buddha.
dn21:1.12.58	Known as the Sakyan Sage, <j>he’s mastered the senses.	“Sakyan Sage” (_sakyamuni_) became a favorite epithet of the Buddha, but in early texts it appears only here and the Ratanasutta ([snp2.1:4.2]()).
dn21:1.12.59	Those sons of his lost their memory;	“Sons” in a spiritual sense.
dn21:1.12.60	but when scolded by me they gained it back.	NA
dn21:1.12.61	Of the three, there is one who remains	NA

dn21:1.12.64	serene, spurn even the gods.	NA
dn21:1.12.65	Such is the explanation of the teaching here:	The commentary says, “In this dispensation the explanation of the teaching is such that because of it, disciples become endowed with such qualities” (_ettha sāsane evarūpā dhammappakāsanā, yāya sāvakā etehi guṇehi samannāgatā honti_). This explains the feminine _etādisī_; _pakasanā_, which is normally neuter, is feminine here. This use is fairly common in later texts (it occurs at the conclusion of the Ṭīkā for this sutta).
dn21:1.12.66	not a single disciple doubts that.	_Kiṅkaṅkhati_ is a unique term for “doubt”.

dn21:1.12.70	they understood the teaching here;	NA
dn21:1.12.71	two of them distinguished	NA
dn21:1.12.72	in the host of the priests of Divinity.”’	The end point of Gopaka’s speech is hard to determine, as there is no _-ti_ to mark it. Various editions and translations either ignore the issue or end it in different places. The next line marks the beginning of Sakka’s direct speech to the Buddha, and I think it makes the best sense to assume that up to here he has been relating the story he was told.
dn21:1.12.73	We have come here, dear sir,	NA
dn21:1.12.74	to realize this same teaching.	NA
dn21:1.12.75	If the Buddha would give me a chance,	NA
dn21:1.12.76	I would ask a question, dear sir.”	NA
dn21:1.13.1	Then the Buddha thought,	NA
dn21:1.13.2	“For a long time now this spirit has led a pure life. Any question he asks me will be beneficial, not unbeneficial.	NA
dn21:1.13.3	And he will quickly understand any answer I give to his question.”	NA
dn21:1.13.4	So the Buddha addressed Sakka in verse:	NA
dn21:1.13.5	“Ask me your question, Vāsava,	NA
dn21:1.13.6	whatever you want.	NA
dn21:1.13.7	I’ll solve each and every	NA
dn21:1.13.8	question you have.”	NA
dn21:1.13.9	The first recitation section is finished.	NA
dn21:2.1.1	Having been granted an opportunity by the Buddha, Sakka asked the first question.	NA
dn21:2.1.2	“Good fellow, what fetters bind the gods, humans, titans, dragons, centaurs—and any of the other diverse creatures—	NA
dn21:2.1.3	so that, though they wish to be free of enmity, violence, hostility, and hate, they still have enmity, violence, hostility, and hate?”	This question hints at Sakka’s own evolution from the battlegod of the Vedas to an acolyte of peace.
dn21:2.1.4	Such was Sakka’s question to the Buddha.	NA
dn21:2.1.5	And the Buddha answered him:	NA
dn21:2.1.6	“Lord of gods, the fetters of jealousy and stinginess bind the gods, humans, titans, dragons, centaurs—and any of the other diverse creatures—	Jealousy is wanting what others have, while stinginess is not wanting to share what you have.
dn21:2.1.7	so that, though they wish to be free of enmity, violence, hostility, and hate, they still have enmity, violence, hostility, and hate.”	NA
dn21:2.1.8	Such was the Buddha’s answer to Sakka.	NA
dn21:2.1.9	Delighted, Sakka approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, saying,	NA
dn21:2.1.10	“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!	NA
dn21:2.1.11	Hearing the Buddha’s answer, I’ve gone beyond doubt and got rid of indecision.”	NA
dn21:2.2.1	And then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, Sakka asked another question:	NA
dn21:2.2.2	“But good fellow, what is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of jealousy and stinginess?	Compare with such contexts as the side branch of dependent origination at [dn15:9.1](), the origins of disputes at [snp4.11](), and the analysis of proliferation at [mn18](). Note the constructive use of the “yes, and” method of questioning. Sakka finds wisdom due to his curiosity, neither being too-easily sated with a simple answer, nor quibbling that the answer is inadequate, but building on the foundations of understanding.
dn21:2.2.3	When what exists is there jealousy and stinginess?	NA
dn21:2.2.4	When what doesn’t exist is there no jealousy and stinginess?”	NA
dn21:2.2.5	“The liked and the disliked, lord of gods, are the source of jealousy and stinginess.	NA
dn21:2.2.6	When the liked and the disliked exist there is jealousy and stinginess.	NA
dn21:2.2.7	When the liked and the disliked don’t exist there is no jealousy and stinginess.”	NA
dn21:2.2.8	“But good fellow, what is the source of what is liked and disliked?”	NA

Again the sequence departs from [mn18:16.1](), which says that thoughts—which are normal and morally neutral psychological processes—give rise to “proliferation” (_papañca_), which is when craving and delusion cause thought to spin out of control. “Proliferation” then solidifies into “judgments” that fuel an individual’s delusion of “self” persisting through time.

dn21:2.5.15	When the Buddha said this, Sakka said to him:	NA
dn21:2.5.16	“Sir, this is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement:	Sakka switches his term of address for the Buddha from _mārisa_ to the more respectful _bhante_ here, then back to _mārisa_ below. This passage is found at [mn114:24.5](), where _bhante_ is used, suggesting it was imported from there.
dn21:2.5.17	You should not cultivate the kind of sight known by the eye which causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline.	For a more detailed analysis of this, see [mn152]().

dn21:2.5.26	Hearing the Buddha’s answer, I’ve gone beyond doubt and got rid of indecision.”	NA
dn21:2.6.1	And then Sakka asked another question:	NA
dn21:2.6.2	“Good fellow, do all ascetics and brahmins have a single doctrine, ethics, desire, and attachment?”	The Pali _ekanta_ (“single”) here is a little tricky; it could mean either “the same” or “of one goal”. The Sanskrit has just _eka_ (_ekakāmā ekacchandāḥ_, “one desire, one wish”), while the commentary explains the first and last terms as “one goal” and the middle terms as “one”.
dn21:2.6.3	“No, lord of gods, they do not.”	NA
dn21:2.6.4	“Why not?”	NA
dn21:2.6.5	“The world has many and diverse elements.	NA
dn21:2.6.6	Whatever element sentient beings insist on in this world of many and diverse elements, they obstinately stick to it, insisting that:	The Buddha points out that spiritual teachers, when faced with a world of experiential diversity, tend to prioritize their own experience or doctrine, dismissing others as less real or meaningful.
dn21:2.6.7	‘This is the only truth, anything else is futile.’	NA
dn21:2.6.8	That’s why not all ascetics and brahmins have a single doctrine, ethics, desire, and attachment.”	NA
dn21:2.6.9	“Good fellow, have all ascetics and brahmins reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal?”	NA
dn21:2.6.10	“No, lord of gods, they have not.”	NA
dn21:2.6.11	“Why not?”	NA
dn21:2.6.12	“Those mendicants who are freed through the ending of craving have reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal.	NA
dn21:2.6.13	That’s why not all ascetics and brahmins have reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal.”	NA
dn21:2.6.14	Such was the Buddha’s answer to Sakka.	NA
dn21:2.6.15	Delighted, Sakka approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, saying,	NA
dn21:2.6.16	“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!	NA
dn21:2.6.17	Hearing the Buddha’s answer, I’ve gone beyond doubt and got rid of indecision.”	This is the final substantive question of the series. It is picked up in [mn37:2.2]() where Sakka, in a subsequent visit, inquires further as to the nature of those who have realized the ultimate goal.
dn21:2.6.18	And then Sakka, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, said to him,	NA
dn21:2.7.1	“Turbulence, sir, is a disease, a boil, a dart. Turbulence drags a person to be reborn in life after life.	“Turbulence” is _ejā_, from a root meaning “motion, agitation”, and hence the opposite of the “imperturbable” (_aneja_) peace of the Buddha ([sn35.90]()).
dn21:2.7.2	That’s why a person finds themselves in states high and low.	NA
dn21:2.7.3	Elsewhere, among other ascetics and brahmins, I wasn’t even given a chance to ask these questions that the Buddha has answered.	NA

dn21:2.7.9	“Well, speak then, lord of gods.”	NA
dn21:2.7.10	“Sir, I approached those who I imagined were ascetics and brahmins living in the wilderness, in remote lodgings. But they were stumped by my question, and they even questioned me in return:	NA
dn21:2.7.11	‘What is the venerable’s name?’	NA

dn21:2.7.14	So they asked me another question:	NA
dn21:2.7.15	‘But lord of gods, what deed brought you to this position?’	NA
dn21:2.7.16	So I taught them the Dhamma as I had learned and memorized it.	NA

dn21:2.7.19	Invariably, they become my disciples, I don’t become theirs.	NA

dn21:2.7.21.0	2.5. On Feeling Happy	NA
dn21:2.7.22	“Lord of gods, do you recall ever feeling such joy and happiness before?”	NA
dn21:2.7.23	“I do, sir.”	NA
dn21:2.7.24	“But how?”	NA
dn21:2.7.25	“Once upon a time, sir, a battle was fought between the gods and the titans.	NA
dn21:2.7.26	In that battle the gods won and the titans lost.	NA
dn21:2.7.27	It occurred to me as victor,	NA
dn21:2.7.28	‘Now the gods shall enjoy both the nectar of the gods and the nectar of the titans.’	“Nectar” is _ojā_, in Vedic texts called _soma_ or _amṛta_ (“ambrosia” of immortality). The battle over nectar by gods (_deva_) and demons (_asura_) is a very ancient element of Indo-European mythology.
dn21:2.7.29	But sir, that joy and happiness is in the sphere of the rod and the sword. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.	NA
dn21:2.7.30	But the joy and happiness I feel listening to the Buddha’s teaching is not in the sphere of the rod and the sword. It does lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.”	Here Sakka makes a clean break from the violent delights he enjoyed in former (Vedic) times.
dn21:2.8.1	“But lord of gods, what reason do you see for speaking of such joy and happiness?”	NA
dn21:2.8.2	“I see six reasons to speak of such joy and happiness, sir.	NA

dn21:2.8.4	remaining in the godly form,	NA

dn21:2.8.15	I shall practice systematically,	“According to method” (_ñāyena_) recalls _ñāyapaṭipanno_ as a description of the noble ones. It means practicing according with the noble eightfold path, a “method” that yields definite results.
dn21:2.8.16	aware and mindful.	NA
dn21:2.8.17	This is the third reason.	NA
dn21:2.8.18	And if awakening should arise	NA
dn21:2.8.19	as I practice systematically,	NA
dn21:2.8.20	I shall live as one who understands,	NA
dn21:2.8.21	and my end shall come right there.	This refers to the possibility of achieving perfection (_arahattā_).
dn21:2.8.22	This is the fourth reason.	NA
dn21:2.8.23	When I fall from the human realm,	NA
dn21:2.8.24	leaving behind the human life,	NA
dn21:2.8.25	I shall become a god again,	NA
dn21:2.8.26	supreme in the heaven realm.	That is, after passing away as Sakka and being reborn as a human, he will subsequently return to the heaven realm.

dn21:2.8.32	This is the sixth reason.	NA
dn21:2.8.33	Seeing these six reasons I speak of such joy and happiness.	NA
dn21:2.9.1	My wishes unfulfilled,	NA
dn21:2.9.2	doubting and indecisive,	NA
dn21:2.9.3	I wandered for such a long time,	NA
dn21:2.9.4	in search of the Realized One.	NA
dn21:2.9.5	I imagined that ascetics	NA
dn21:2.9.6	living in seclusion	NA
dn21:2.9.7	must surely be awakened,	NA
dn21:2.9.8	so I went to sit near them.	NA
dn21:2.9.9	‘How is there success?	NA
dn21:2.9.10	How is there failure?’	NA
dn21:2.9.11	But they were stumped by such questions	NA
dn21:2.9.12	about the path and practice.	NA
dn21:2.9.13	And when they found out that I	NA
dn21:2.9.14	was Sakka, come from the gods,	NA
dn21:2.9.15	they questioned me instead about	NA
dn21:2.9.16	the deed that brought me to this state.	NA
dn21:2.9.17	I taught them the Dhamma	NA
dn21:2.9.18	as I had learned it among men.	NA
dn21:2.9.19	They were delighted with that, saying:	NA
dn21:2.9.20	‘We’ve seen Vāsava!’	NA
dn21:2.9.21	Now since I’ve seen the Buddha,	NA
dn21:2.9.22	who helps us overcome doubt,	NA
dn21:2.9.23	today, free of fear,	NA
dn21:2.9.24	I pay homage to the awakened one.	NA
dn21:2.9.25	Destroyer of the dart of craving,	NA
dn21:2.9.26	the Buddha is unrivaled.	NA
dn21:2.9.27	I bow to the great hero,	NA
dn21:2.9.28	the Buddha, kinsman of the Sun.	NA
dn21:2.9.29	In the same way that Divinity ought be revered	_Karomasi_ is middle imperative 1st plural, “we should do”, glossed by the commentary as “we should pay homage” (_namakkāraṁ karoma_).
dn21:2.9.30	by we gods, dear sir,	_Samaṁ_ is an indeclinable in the sense “likewise”.
dn21:2.9.31	today we shall revere you—	NA
dn21:2.9.32	come, let us revere you ourselves!	_Sāmaṁ_ is an indeclinable in the sense “oneself, personally, one’s own”.
dn21:2.9.33	You alone are the Awakened!	NA
dn21:2.9.34	You are the Teacher supreme!	NA
dn21:2.9.35	In the world with its gods,	NA
dn21:2.9.36	you have no rival.”	NA
dn21:2.10.1	Then Sakka addressed the centaur Pañcasikha,	NA
dn21:2.10.2	“Dear Pañcasikha, you were very helpful to me, since you first charmed the Buddha,	NA
dn21:2.10.3	after which I went to see him.	NA
dn21:2.10.4	I shall appoint you to your father’s position—you shall be king of the centaurs. And I give you Bhaddā Suriyavaccasā, for she loves you very much.”	A _gandharva_ wedding must be a mutual love match.
dn21:2.10.5	Then Sakka, touching the ground with his hand, expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times:	“Touching the ground with his hand” is a unique gesture in the early Pali, immortalized in later legend when the Buddha touches the ground to invoke the Earth Goddess as witness of his striving.
dn21:2.10.6	“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	NA
dn21:2.10.7	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	NA
dn21:2.10.8	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!”	NA
dn21:2.10.9	And while this discourse was being spoken, the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in Sakka, lord of gods:	NA
dn21:2.10.10	“Everything that has a beginning has an end.”	NA
dn21:2.10.11	And also for another 80,000 deities.	Sakka is also said to have been accompanied by 80,000 deities at [sn40.10:4.4](). This is one of many indications that this is a late discourse, several of which have been touched on above: late or unique terminology; fancy literary styles; adoption of doctrinal passages from elsewhere in a sometimes clumsy fashion; and so on. In determining whether a sutta is late or early, we do not rely on a single definitive reason, but on a cluster of independent criteria which taken together are most easily explained in terms of historical development.
dn21:2.10.12	Such were the questions Sakka was invited to ask, and which were answered by the Buddha.	NA
dn21:2.10.13	And that’s why the name of this discussion is “Sakka’s Questions”.	NA
dn22:0.1	Long Discourses 22	NA
dn22:0.2	The Longer Discourse on Mindfulness Meditation	NA
dn22:1.1	So I have heard.	This discourse is copied from [mn10](). The section on the four noble truths has been expanded with material mostly drawn from [mn141](). These discourses are the most influential texts for modern Theravada meditation, prompting countless modern commentaries. Comparative study of the several parallel versions reveals that this discourse, while comprised almost entirely of early material, was compiled in this form as one of the latest texts in the Pali suttas. | While mindfulness is always useful ([sn46.53:15.4]()), the “establishment of mindfulness” (_satipaṭṭhāna_) refers especially to a conscious development of contemplative practices based on mindfulness, i.e. “mindfulness meditation”.
dn22:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma.	NA
dn22:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
dn22:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
dn22:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
dn22:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
dn22:1.7	“Mendicants, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment.	The phrase _ekāyano maggo_ (“path to convergence”) is given multiple meanings in commentaries and ancient translations. Outside of _satipaṭṭhāna_, it is used in only one context in Pali, where it means to “come together with” ([mn12:37.5]()). At [sn47.18:3.4]() the phrase is spoken by Brahmā, which suggests it was a Brahmanical term. At Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.11—a passage full of details shared with the suttas—it means a place where things unite or converge. Thus _satipaṭṭhāna_ leads to everything “coming together as one”. In other words, as seventh factor of the noble eightfold path, it leads to _samādhi_, the eighth factor ([sn45.1:3.9](); see also [mn44:12.3]()).
dn22:1.8	What four?	NA
dn22:1.9	It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	The idiom _kāye kāyānupassī_, literally “observes a body in the body” refers to focusing on a specific aspect of embodied experience, such as the breath, the postures, etc. | “Keen” (or “ardent”, _ātāpī_) implies effort, while “aware” (_sampajāno_) is the wisdom of understanding situation and context. | “Covetousness and displeasure” (_abhijjhādomanassaṁ_) are the strong forms of desire and aversion that are overcome by sense restraint in preparation for meditation.
dn22:1.10	They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	“Feelings” (_vedanā_) are the basic tones of pleasant, painful, or neutral, not the complexes we call “emotions”.
dn22:1.11	They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	“Mind” (_citta_) is simple awareness. In meditation contexts, “mind” is often similar in meaning to _samādhi_.
dn22:1.12	They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	“Principles” (_dhammā_) are the natural “systems” of cause and effect that underlie the “teachings”. The renderings “mind objects” or “mental qualities” are incorrect, as many of the things spoken of in this section are neither mind objects nor mental qualities. “Phenomena” is a possible translation, but the emphasis is not on the “appearance” of things, but on the “principles” governing their conditional relations.

dn22:2.0.1	1. Observing the Body	NA
dn22:2.0.2	1.1. Mindfulness of Breathing	NA
dn22:2.1	And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the body?	NA
dn22:2.2	It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in their presence.	The context here—a mendicant gone to the forest—establishes that this practice takes place in the wider context of the Gradual Training. Indeed, this whole sutta can be understood as an expansion of this phrase, mentioned briefly at [dn2:67.3]().
dn22:2.3	Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.	The most fundamental meditation instruction in Buddhism. Notice how the Buddha phrases it: not “concentrate on the breath” as an object, but rather “breathing” as an activity to which one brings mindfulness.
dn22:2.4	Breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’	The stages of breath meditation are not meant to be done deliberately, but to be observed and understood as the natural process of deepening meditation. When starting out, the breath is somewhat rough and coarse.
dn22:2.5	When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ Breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’	Over time, the breath becomes more subtle and soft.
dn22:2.6	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the whole body.’	Contextually the idiom “whole body” (_sabbakāya_) here refers to the breath, marking the fuller and more continuous awareness that arises with tranquility. Some practitioners, however, interpret it as the “whole physical body”, broadening awareness to encompass the movement and settling of energies throughout the body.
dn22:2.7	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the physical process.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the physical process.’	The “physical process” (_kāyasaṅkhāraṁ_) is the breath ([sn41.6:1.8]()).
dn22:2.8	It’s like a deft carpenter or carpenter’s apprentice. When making a deep cut they know: ‘I’m making a deep cut,’ and when making a shallow cut they know: ‘I’m making a shallow cut.’	Text has “long” and “short”, but “deep” and “shallow” or “heavy” and “light” are more idiomatic for describing the breath in English.
dn22:2.9	NA	NA
dn22:2.10	NA	NA
dn22:2.11	And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally.	“Internally” is one’s own body, “externally” the bodies of others, or external physical phenomena. This distinction is applied broadly in Buddhist meditation, but it is more relevant in some contexts than others. In the case of the breath, one is focusing on one’s own breath, but when contemplating, say, a dead body, or the material elements, there is more of an external dimension. Starting with “me” in here and the “world” out there, this practice dissolves this distinction so that we see we are of the same nature as everything else.
dn22:2.12	They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish.	This is the _vipassanā_ (“insight” or “discernment”) dimension of meditation, observing not just the rise and fall of phenomena, but also their conditioned “nature” as being “liable” (_-dhamma_) to impermanence. The meaning of this passage is explained at ([sn47.42]()). Apart from these passages, _vipassanā_ in _satipaṭṭhāna_ pertains specially to the observation of principles.
dn22:2.13	Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.	Mindfulness meditation leads to a range of knowledges as detailed by Anuruddha at [sn52.6]() and [sn52.11]()–24. An arahant is “independent” of any attachment (eg. [mn143]()), but _satipaṭṭhāna_ is also taught to give up dependency on views of the past and future ([dn29:40.1]()).

dn22:3.0	1.2. The Postures	NA
dn22:3.1	Furthermore, when a mendicant is walking they know: ‘I am walking.’ When standing they know: ‘I am standing.’ When sitting they know: ‘I am sitting.’ And when lying down they know: ‘I am lying down.’	In early Pali, this practice is found only in the two Satipaṭṭhānasuttas and the closely related Kāyagatāsatisutta ([mn119]()). It is practiced by developing a reflexive awareness of one’s posture and activity as it proceeds, often assisted by moving slowly and carefully.

dn22:4.0	1.3. Situational Awareness	NA
dn22:4.1	Furthermore, a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl, and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.	“Situational awareness” (_sampajañña_) understands the context and purpose of activities. The main examples here illustrate the activities of daily monastic life: leaving the monastery on almsround, restraint while in the town, care wearing the robes, then mindfully eating and going to the toilet.

dn22:5.0	1.4. Focusing on the Repulsive	NA
dn22:5.1	Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth.	This practice is intended to counter sexual desire and obsession. The primary focus is on one’s own body, rather than another’s body, although that can be brought in also. By focusing on aspects of our body that we normally prefer to ignore, we move towards a healthy sense of acceptance and neutrality towards our body.
dn22:5.2	‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’	Thirty-one parts are mentioned in early texts, later expanded to thirty-two with the addition of the “brain” (_matthaluṅga_).
dn22:5.3	It’s as if there were a bag with openings at both ends, filled with various kinds of grains, such as fine rice, wheat, mung beans, peas, sesame, and ordinary rice. And someone with clear eyes were to open it and examine the contents: ‘These grains are fine rice, these are wheat, these are mung beans, these are peas, these are sesame, and these are ordinary rice.’	The “bag with openings at both ends” is the body. Not all the varieties of grains and beans can be positively identified.

dn22:6.1	Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, whatever its placement or posture, according to the elements:	While meditation on the elements is commonly taught in early texts, this phrase is found only in the two Satipaṭṭhānasuttas and the Kāyagatāsatisutta. Detailed instructions are found in such suttas as [mn28]() and [mn140](). This meditation works in any posture, whereas breath meditation is best done sitting, to allow the breath to become still.
dn22:6.2	‘In this body there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.’	The “elements” are the four states of matter as represented by their primary material example and their dominant property: earth as a solid with the property of resisting or upholding; water as a liquid with the property of binding; air as a gas with the property of movement; and fire (“heat” or “energy”) as plasma with the property of transformation.
dn22:6.3	It’s as if a deft butcher or butcher’s apprentice were to kill a cow and sit down at the crossroads with the meat cut into chops.	This gruesome image shows that butchery of cows was a normal feature of ancient Indian life.

dn22:7.1	Furthermore, suppose a mendicant were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground. And it had been dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering.	Cremation was expensive and not available to everyone. Bodies might be left in the charnel ground for a variety of reasons, such as local customs, lack of funds, or in cases of inauspicious death such as murder or execution. This is still seen in some places today, and monastics occasionally take the opportunity to practice meditation beside a corpse. However the wording of the Pali sounds like an imaginative exercise.
dn22:7.2	They’d compare it with their own body:	The observed corpse is not gendered. The purpose is not to become repulsed by an objectified other, but to understand the mortality of one’s own body.

dn22:11.1	And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of feelings?	Literally “a feeling among the feelings”; the practice shows that the meditator contemplates specific feelings as they occur.
dn22:11.2	It’s when a mendicant who feels a pleasant feeling knows: ‘I feel a pleasant feeling.’	Pali employs direct quotes to indicate reflexive awareness: you feel the feeling and you know that you feel the feeling. It does not mean that you have to literally say “I feel a pleasant feeling”, although some adopt that as a meditation method.
dn22:11.3	When they feel a painful feeling, they know: ‘I feel a painful feeling.’	NA
dn22:11.4	When they feel a neutral feeling, they know: ‘I feel a neutral feeling.’	NA
dn22:11.5	When they feel a pleasant feeling of the flesh, they know: ‘I feel a pleasant feeling of the flesh.’	Feelings “of the flesh” (_sāmisa_)  are associated with the body and sensual desires ([sn36.31:4.1]()).
dn22:11.6	When they feel a pleasant feeling not of the flesh, they know: ‘I feel a pleasant feeling not of the flesh.’	Feelings “not of the flesh” (_nirāmisa_) are associated with renunciation and especially with the _jhānas_ and liberation ([sn36.31:5.1]()).
dn22:11.7	When they feel a painful feeling of the flesh, they know: ‘I feel a painful feeling of the flesh.’	NA
dn22:11.8	When they feel a painful feeling not of the flesh, they know: ‘I feel a painful feeling not of the flesh.’	This would include the feelings of loss, doubt, and dejection that can occur during the spiritual path (see [mn44:28.6]()).
dn22:11.9	When they feel a neutral feeling of the flesh, they know: ‘I feel a neutral feeling of the flesh.’	NA

dn22:12.1	And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the mind?	NA
dn22:12.2	It’s when a mendicant understands mind with greed as ‘mind with greed,’	In Buddhist theory, awareness of the presence or absence of qualities such as greed is explained on three levels. There is the simple happenstance of whether greed is present at that time or not. Then there is the mind freed of greed through the power of absorption. Finally there is the liberation from greed which comes with full awakening.

dn22:12.9	and scattered mind as ‘scattered mind.’	NA
dn22:12.10	They know expansive mind as ‘expansive mind,’	The following terms “expansive” (_mahaggata_), “supreme” (_anuttara_), “immersed” (_samāhita_), and “freed” (_vimutta_) all refer to states of absorption and/or awakening.
dn22:12.11	and unexpansive mind as ‘unexpansive mind.’	NA

dn22:13.1	And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of principles?	NA
dn22:13.2	It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the five hindrances.	The Satipaṭṭhānavibhaṅga of the Pali Abhidhamma only mentions the hindrances and awakening factors in this section ([Vb 7](https://suttacentral.net/vb7)). This, together with a range of other evidence, suggests that this was the original content of the observation of principles.
dn22:13.3	And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of principles with respect to the five hindrances?	NA
dn22:13.4	It’s when a mendicant who has sensual desire in them understands: ‘I have sensual desire in me.’ When they don’t have sensual desire in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have sensual desire in me.’ They understand how sensual desire arises; how, when it’s already arisen, it’s given up; and how, once it’s given up, it doesn’t arise again in the future.	Here causality is introduced. In the contemplation of mind, the meditator was aware of the presence or absence of desire in the mind. Now they look deeper, investigating the cause of desire and understanding how to be free of it forever. This contemplation of the “principles” of cause and effect is the distinctive feature of this section.
dn22:13.5	When they have ill will in them, they understand: ‘I have ill will in me.’ When they don’t have ill will in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have ill will in me.’ They understand how ill will arises; how, when it’s already arisen, it’s given up; and how, once it’s given up, it doesn’t arise again in the future.	NA
dn22:13.6	When they have dullness and drowsiness in them, they understand: ‘I have dullness and drowsiness in me.’ When they don’t have dullness and drowsiness in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have dullness and drowsiness in me.’ They understand how dullness and drowsiness arise; how, when they’ve already arisen, they’re given up; and how, once they’re given up, they don’t arise again in the future.	The Buddhist schools debated whether this included physical tiredness or not. The Theravada argued that it was purely a mental laziness, as even the Buddha got sleepy.
dn22:13.7	When they have restlessness and remorse in them, they understand: ‘I have restlessness and remorse in me.’ When they don’t have restlessness and remorse in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have restlessness and remorse in me.’ They understand how restlessness and remorse arise; how, when they’ve already arisen, they’re given up; and how, once they’re given up, they don’t arise again in the future.	NA
dn22:13.8	When they have doubt in them, they understand: ‘I have doubt in me.’ When they don’t have doubt in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have doubt in me.’ They understand how doubt arises; how, when it’s already arisen, it’s given up; and how, once it’s given up, it doesn’t arise again in the future.

dn22:14.4	Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.	“Form” (_rūpa_) is one’s own body and the external material world experienced through the senses. More subtly, it represents the “appearance” of physical phenomena, even when experienced solely in the mind as color, visions, etc.
dn22:14.5	Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling.	NA
dn22:14.6	Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is the ending of perception.	“Perception” (_saññā_) is the recognition or interpretation of experience in terms of meaningful wholes. We see, for example, “color” yet we perceive a “person”. In the Vinaya we find many examples where a person perceived things in one way, yet they turned out to be something else.
dn22:14.7	Such are choices, such is the origin of choices, such is the ending of choices.	In the five aggregates, _saṅkhārā_ is a synonym for “volition” (_cetanā_). The traditions later used it as a catch-all category for everything that does not fit in the other aggregates. In the suttas, however, the purpose of the aggregates is not to classify everything that exists, but to contemplate aspects of experience that we tend to identify as a “self”.

dn22:16.11	They meditate observing the principles as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish.	NA
dn22:16.12	Or mindfulness is established that principles exist, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.	NA
dn22:16.13	That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the seven awakening factors.	NA
dn22:16.14	NA	NA
dn22:17.0	4.5. The Truths	NA
dn22:17.1	Furthermore, a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the four noble truths.	Due to their development of the two wings of _samatha_ and _vipassanā_ meditation as described in this sutta, practised in the context of the teaching and training as a whole, the meditator realizes the four noble truths at the moment of stream-entry.
dn22:17.2	And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of principles with respect to the four noble truths?	NA
dn22:17.3	It’s when a mendicant truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’	NA
dn22:17.4	The first recitation section is finished.	NA
dn22:18.0	4.5.1. The Truth of Suffering	NA
dn22:18.1	And what is the noble truth of suffering?	The sutta now proceeds in analytical fashion, digging deeper into the details of the four noble truths. The fundamental definitions were taught in the Buddha’s first sermon ([sn56.11:4.1]()).
dn22:18.2	Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; association with the disliked is suffering; separation from the liked is suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering.	NA
dn22:18.3	And what is rebirth?	NA
dn22:18.4	The rebirth, inception, conception, reincarnation, manifestation of the sets of phenomena, and acquisition of the sense fields of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.	As at [dn15.4.3](), _jāti_ is invariably defined as the rebirth of beings, not as simple arising. The same applies to old age and death.
dn22:18.5	This is called rebirth.	NA
dn22:18.6	And what is old age?	NA
dn22:18.7	The old age, decrepitude, broken teeth, grey hair, wrinkly skin, diminished vitality, and failing faculties of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.	NA
dn22:18.8	This is called old age.	NA
dn22:18.9	And what is death?	NA
dn22:18.10	The passing away, passing on, disintegration, demise, mortality, death, decease, breaking up of the aggregates, laying to rest of the corpse, and cutting off of the life faculty of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.	NA
dn22:18.11	This is called death.	NA
dn22:18.12	And what is sorrow?	NA
dn22:18.13	The sorrow, sorrowing, state of sorrow, inner sorrow, inner deep sorrow in someone who has undergone misfortune, who has experienced suffering.	In this and following definitions we mainly find mere verbal variations of the basic term.
dn22:18.14	This is called sorrow.	NA
dn22:18.15	And what is lamentation?	NA
dn22:18.16	The wail, lament, wailing, lamenting, state of wailing and lamentation in someone who has undergone misfortune, who has experienced suffering.	NA
dn22:18.17	This is called lamentation.	NA
dn22:18.18	And what is pain?	NA
dn22:18.19	Physical pain, physical unpleasantness, the painful, unpleasant feeling that’s born from physical contact.	_Dukkha_ (“pain”, “suffering”) is here restricted to physical pain. Elsewhere it may be any kind of painful feeling, while in the four noble truths it is suffering of any sort, including subtle forms of existential suffering.
dn22:18.20	This is called pain.	NA
dn22:18.21	And what is sadness?	_Domanassa_ normally means “sadness”, but sometimes it contrasts with desire, in which case it is a form of aversion.
dn22:18.22	Mental pain, mental displeasure, the painful, unpleasant feeling that’s born from mental contact.	NA
dn22:18.23	This is called sadness.	NA
dn22:18.24	And what is distress?	NA
dn22:18.25	The stress, distress, state of stress and distress in someone who has undergone misfortune, who has experienced suffering.	NA
dn22:18.26	This is called distress.	NA
dn22:18.27	And what is meant by ‘association with the disliked is suffering’?	NA
dn22:18.28	There are sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and ideas, which are unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable. And there are those who want to harm, injure, disturb, and threaten you. The coming together with these, the joining, inclusion, mixing with them:	NA
dn22:18.29	this is what is meant by ‘association with the disliked is suffering’.	NA
dn22:18.30	And what is meant by ‘separation from the liked is suffering’?	NA
dn22:18.31	There are sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and ideas, which are likable, desirable, and agreeable. And there are those who want to help, benefit, comfort, and protect you: mother and father, brother and sister, friends and colleagues, relatives and kin. The division from these, the disconnection, segregation, and parting from them:	_Piya_ often refers to those who are dear and beloved, but as shown here it can also mean simply anything that is liked.
dn22:18.32	this is what is meant by ‘separation from the liked is suffering’.	NA
dn22:18.33	And what is meant by ‘not getting what you wish for is suffering’?	NA
dn22:18.34	In sentient beings who are liable to be reborn, such a wish arises:	NA
dn22:18.35	‘Oh, if only we were not liable to be reborn! If only rebirth would not come to us!’	This is an example of “painful feeling not of the flesh”. The Buddha is here denying the efficacy of prayer, invocation, or magic spells.
dn22:18.36	But you can’t get that by wishing.	NA
dn22:18.37	This is what is meant by ‘not getting what you wish for is suffering.’	NA
dn22:18.38	In sentient beings who are liable to grow old …	NA

dn22:18.46	But you can’t get that by wishing.	NA
dn22:18.47	This is what is meant by ‘not getting what you wish for is suffering.’	NA
dn22:18.48	And what is meant by ‘in brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering’?	NA
dn22:18.49	They are the grasping aggregates that consist of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.	NA
dn22:18.50	This is what is meant by ‘in brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering’.	NA
dn22:18.51	This is called the noble truth of suffering.	NA
dn22:19.0	4.5.2. The Origin of Suffering	NA
dn22:19.1	And what is the noble truth of the origin of suffering?	NA
dn22:19.2	It’s the craving that leads to future lives, mixed up with relishing and greed, taking pleasure wherever it lands. That is,	NA
dn22:19.3	craving for sensual pleasures, craving for continued existence, and craving to end existence.	NA
dn22:19.4	But where does that craving arise and where does it settle?	NA
dn22:19.5	Whatever in the world seems nice and pleasant, it is there that craving arises and settles.	NA
dn22:19.6	And what in the world seems nice and pleasant?	NA
dn22:19.7	The eye in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles.	The following list of properties that relate to the senses gradually moves from the more basic to the more sophisticated.

dn22:19.18	ideas in the world seem nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles.	NA

dn22:19.36	feeling born of mind contact in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles.	NA
dn22:19.37	Perception of sights …	“Perception” interprets the “light” that is seen, organizing it in meaningful wholes. For example, the eye sees the color white, while perception recognizes that it is “white”, and further, that that white color is in fact a “wall”.
dn22:19.38	perception of sounds …	NA
dn22:19.39	perception of smells …	NA
dn22:19.40	perception of tastes …	NA
dn22:19.41	perception of touches …	NA
dn22:19.42	perception of ideas in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles.	NA
dn22:19.43	Intention regarding sights …	To continue the example, once the light has been interpreted by perception as a “wall”, we then make the choice to walk around it rather than through it. Choices therefore depend on perceptions.

dn22:19.46	intention regarding tastes …	NA

dn22:20.1	And what is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering?	NA

dn22:21.0	4.5.4. The Path	NA
dn22:21.1	And what is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering?	NA
dn22:21.2	It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:	NA
dn22:21.3	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.	Mindfulness is not a path in and of itself, but rather is the seventh factor of the eightfold path.
dn22:21.4	And what is right view?	NA
dn22:21.5	Knowing about suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.	The fourth noble truth is the path, while the first path factor is the noble truths. These two teachings are different perspectives on the same _dhamma_.
dn22:21.6	This is called right view.	NA
dn22:21.7	And what is right thought?	NA
dn22:21.8	Thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness.	_Saṅkappa_ is normally a synonym of _vitakka_ in the suttas, hence the rendering “right thought”. It is, however, not just verbalized thought, but the direction in which one applies the mind. This factor is the emotional counterpart of right view, ensuring that the path is motivated by love and compassion.
dn22:21.9	This is called right thought.	NA
dn22:21.10	And what is right speech?	NA
dn22:21.11	The refraining from lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, and talking nonsense.	NA
dn22:21.12	This is called right speech.	NA
dn22:21.13	And what is right action?	NA
dn22:21.14	Refraining from killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct.	The first three of the five precepts. “Sexual misconduct” is the betrayal of trust in a sexual relationship.
dn22:21.15	This is called right action.	NA
dn22:21.16	And what is right livelihood?	NA
dn22:21.17	It’s when a noble disciple gives up wrong livelihood and earns a living by right livelihood.	Defined for a monastic in the long section on ethics in the Sāmaññaphalasutta ([dn2:56.1]()) and for a lay person as trade in weapons, living creatures, meat, intoxicants, and poisons ([an5.177:1.3]()).
dn22:21.18	This is called right livelihood.	NA
dn22:21.19	And what is right effort?	NA
dn22:21.20	It’s when a mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise.	NA
dn22:21.21	They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up.	NA
dn22:21.22	They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities arise.	NA
dn22:21.23	They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are completed by development.	NA
dn22:21.24	This is called right effort.	NA
dn22:21.25	And what is right mindfulness?	NA
dn22:21.26	It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
dn22:21.27	They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
dn22:21.28	They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
dn22:21.29	They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
dn22:21.30	This is called right mindfulness.	NA
dn22:21.31	And what is right immersion?	NA
dn22:21.32	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
dn22:21.33	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
dn22:21.34	And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA
dn22:21.35	Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
dn22:21.36	This is called right immersion.	NA
dn22:21.37	This is called the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.	NA
dn22:21.38	And so they meditate observing an aspect of principles internally, externally, and both internally and externally.	NA
dn22:21.39	They meditate observing the principles as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish.	NA
dn22:21.40	Or mindfulness is established that principles exist, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.	NA
dn22:21.41	That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the four noble truths.	NA

dn22:22.25	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.”	NA

dn23:0.1	Long Discourses 23	NA
dn23:0.2	With Pāyāsi	NA
dn23:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
dn23:1.2	At one time Venerable Kassapa the Prince was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a Kosalan citadel named Setavyā.	Kumārakassapa was ordained at twenty ([pli-tv-kd1:75.1.1]()). He features in the Vammikasutta ([mn23]()), and his verses are collected in the Theragāthā ([thag2.41]()). He was declared the foremost of those with brilliant speech ([an1.217]()), apparently on the basis of this discourse. | The Pāyāsisuta is the only major Buddhist text that has a Jain parallel, Paesi-kahāṇayaṁ, a similar dialogue between Paesi and Keśin in Setavyā.
dn23:1.3	He stayed in the grove of Indian Rosewood to the north of Setavyā.	Setavyā was north-east of Sāvatthī.
dn23:1.4	Now at that time the chieftain Pāyāsi was living in Setavyā. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.	Pāyāsi  was a _khattiya_ yet he receives a _brahmadeyya_. The sense of _brahmadeyya_ as a donation to brahmins is well attested in inscriptions, so I think this is likely a mistake in the text, rather than evidence that the practice was not for brahmins only.
dn23:2.0	1. On Pāyāsi	NA
dn23:2.1	Now at that time Pāyāsi had the following harmful misconception:	NA
dn23:2.2	“There is no afterlife. No beings are reborn spontaneously. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds.”	This is wrong view per [mn117:5.1]().
dn23:2.3	The brahmins and householders of Setavyā heard,	NA
dn23:2.4	“It seems the ascetic Kassapa the Prince—a disciple of the ascetic Gotama—is staying in the grove of Indian Rosewood to the north of Setavyā.	NA
dn23:2.5	He has this good reputation:	NA
dn23:2.6	‘He is astute, competent, intelligent, learned, a brilliant speaker, eloquent, mature, a perfected one.’	NA
dn23:2.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	NA
dn23:2.8	Then, having departed Setavyā, they formed into companies and headed north to the grove.	NA
dn23:3.1	Now at that time the chieftain Pāyāsi had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap.	NA
dn23:3.2	He saw the brahmins and householders heading north towards the grove,	NA

This idiom recurs at [an6.38:1.5]() where, as here, it refers to a well-known view and cannot mean that they have never heard of it.

dn23:5.11	“They are in the other world, worthy Kassapa, and they are gods, not humans.”	While the world “down here” is bogged down in its messy and ephemeral issues, the heavenly bodies proceed in their serene, glorious, stately indifference. Ignoring gravity, self-luminous, and apparently eternal, they operate according to what appears to be an entirely different set of rules, a “meta-physics”. What Newton did in physics the Buddha did in spirituality: show that the heavens, despite appearances, operate with the same set of conditioned rules as apply down here.
dn23:5.12	“By this method it ought to be proven that	Kassapa’s argument here doesn’t directly establish his conclusion. It is possible that gods exist on an entirely separate plane that has nothing to do with kamma and rebirth.

Bhṛgu saw men cutting other men to pieces and eating them, and other sights both horrifying and beautiful, all the while wondering if what he saw was real, before his breath was returned to him.

dn23:7.19	By this method, too, it ought to be proven that	Kassapa, however, has not established the existence of an afterlife, he has merely refuted Pāyāsi’s argument.

His arguments, however, become more persuasive if they are understood as building on the initial agreement on the divinity of the sun and moon. He knows that Pāyāsi accepts some form of other world, even if he says otherwise, so the argument hinges on whether Pāyāsi’s methods are sufficient to *disprove* the kind of other world that Kassapa proposes, i.e. one driven by kamma.

See for example Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.1.18, which says one might become a brahmin or king in a dream.
dn23:15.3	“I do, sir.”	NA

dn23:15.5	“I was.”	NA
dn23:15.6	“But did they see your soul entering or leaving?”	Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.19 describes the soul returning to the body like a tired hawk returning to the nest.

dn23:16.12	So long as they are alive, they’re lighter, softer, more flexible.	NA

These changes are too small to be detected by Pāyāsi’s methods, though.

dn23:19.3	Once upon a time, a certain horn blower took his horn and traveled to a borderland,	Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.8 employs the same metaphor in the search for the soul.

dn23:19.13	Then they lay the horn bent over, they lay it on its side, they lay it on its other side; they stood it upright, they stood it upside down; they struck it with fists, stones, rods, and swords; and they gave it a good shake, saying,	NA
dn23:19.14	‘Speak, good horn! Speak, good horn!’	NA
dn23:19.15	But still the horn made no sound.	NA
dn23:19.16	So the horn blower thought,	NA
dn23:19.17	‘How foolish are these borderland folk! For how can they seek the sound of a horn so irrationally?’	NA
dn23:19.18	And as they looked on, he picked up the horn, sounded it three times, and took it away with him.	NA
dn23:19.19	Then the people of the borderland thought,	NA
dn23:19.20	‘So, it seems, when what is called a horn is accompanied by a person, effort, and wind, it makes a sound. But when these things are absent it makes no sound.’	NA
dn23:19.21	In the same way, so long as this body is full of life and warmth and consciousness it walks back and forth, stands, sits, and lies down. It sees sights with the eye, hears sounds with the ear, smells odors with the nose, tastes flavors with the tongue, feels touches with the body, and knows ideas with the mind.	NA

dn23:21.1	“Well then, chieftain, I shall give you a simile.	NA
dn23:21.2	For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.	NA
dn23:21.3	Once upon a time, a certain fire-worshiping matted-hair ascetic settled in a leaf hut in a wilderness region.	Such “matted-hair ascetics” are apparently the “forest hermits” (_vānaprastha_) whose lifestyle Kauṭilya describes as “celibacy, sleeping on the ground, wearing matted hair and antelope skin, offering daily fire sacrifice, bathing, venerating gods, ancestors, and guests, and eating forest produce” (Arthaśāstra 1.3.11, Olivelle’s translation).
dn23:21.4	Then a caravan came out from a certain country.	NA
dn23:21.5	It stayed for one night not far from that ascetic’s hermitage, and then moved on.	NA
dn23:21.6	The ascetic thought,	NA
dn23:21.7	‘Why don’t I go to that caravan’s campsite? Hopefully I’ll find something useful there.’	NA
dn23:21.8	So he went, and he saw a little baby boy abandoned there.	NA
dn23:21.9	When he saw this he thought,	NA
dn23:21.10	‘It’s not proper for me to look on while a human being dies.	NA
dn23:21.11	Why don’t I bring this boy back to my hermitage, nurse him, provide for him, and raise him?’	NA
dn23:21.12	So that’s what he did.	NA
dn23:21.13	When the boy was ten or twelve years old, the ascetic had some business come up in the country.	NA
dn23:21.14	So he said to the boy,	NA
dn23:21.15	‘My dear, I wish to go to the country.	NA
dn23:21.16	Serve the sacred flame.	NA
dn23:21.17	Do not extinguish it.	NA
dn23:21.18	But if you should extinguish it, here is the hatchet, the firewood, and the bundle of drill-sticks. Light the fire and serve it.’	NA
dn23:21.19	And having instructed the boy, the ascetic went to the country.	NA
dn23:21.20	But the boy was so engrossed in his play, the fire went out.	NA
dn23:21.21	He thought,	NA
dn23:21.22	‘My father told me to serve the sacred flame.	NA

dn23:21.25	NA	NA
dn23:21.26	Why don’t I light it again and serve it?’	NA

dn23:21.28	‘Hopefully I’ll get a fire!’	NA
dn23:21.29	But he still got no fire.	NA
dn23:21.30	He split the bundle of drill-sticks into two, three, four, five, ten, or a hundred parts. He chopped them into splinters, pounded them in a mortar, and swept them away in a strong wind, thinking,	NA
dn23:21.31	‘Hopefully I’ll get a fire!’	NA
dn23:21.32	But he still got no fire.	NA
dn23:21.33	Then the matted-hair ascetic, having concluded his business in the country, returned to his own hermitage, and said to the boy,	NA
dn23:21.34	‘I trust, my dear, that the fire didn’t go out?’	NA
dn23:21.35	And the boy told him what had happened.	NA

dn23:21.49	So while the boy looked on, he took a bundle of fire-sticks, lit the fire, and said,	NA
dn23:21.50	‘Dear boy, this is how to light a fire.	NA
dn23:21.51	Not the foolish and incompetent way you sought it so irrationally.’	NA
dn23:21.52	In the same way, chieftain, being foolish and incompetent, you seek the other world irrationally.	Accept PTS reading _gavesasi_.

dn23:23.3	Once upon a time, a large caravan of a thousand wagons traveled from a country in the east to the west.	Although this became the first story of the Jātaka collection ([ja1]()), here it is not a Jātaka, as it is not framed as a past life of the Buddha.

dn23:23.12	One caravan leader, having prepared much grass, wood, and water, started the caravan.	NA
dn23:23.13	After two or three days’ journey he saw a dark man with red eyes coming the other way in a donkey cart with muddy wheels.

dn23:27.2	For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.	NA
dn23:27.3	Once upon a time, two gamblers were playing with seed dice.	NA
dn23:27.4	One gambler, every time they took a bad hand, swallowed the losing seed.	The ancient Indian game of dice involved casting _vibhītaka_ seeds (also known as “bedda nuts”, from Terminalia bellirica) in a hollow, from which the players would take a handful. A number divisible by four was “perfect” (_kaṭa_), so the fifth seed meant a “losing” hand (_kali_; cf. _apaṇṇaka_ in [mn60]() and notes).
dn23:27.5	The second gambler saw him, and said,	NA
dn23:27.6	‘Well, my friend, you’ve won it all! Give me the seed dice, I will roll them.’	_Pajohissāmi_ is related to Sanskrit _juhoti_, usually used in the sense “to offer as libation”, a meaning accepted by the commentary here. More likely it simply means to “roll out” (like pouring a sacrifice) by analogy.
dn23:27.7	‘Yes, my friend,’ the gambler replied, and gave them.	NA
dn23:27.8	Then the gambler soaked the seed dice in poison and said to the other,	NA
dn23:27.9	‘Come, my friend, let’s play seed dice.’	NA
dn23:27.10	‘Yes, my friend,’ the other gambler replied.	NA
dn23:27.11	And for a second time the gamblers played with seed dice.	NA
dn23:27.12	And for the second time, every time they took a bad hand, that gambler swallowed the losing seed.	NA
dn23:27.13	The second gambler saw him, and said,	NA
dn23:27.14	‘The man swallows the dice without realizing	NA
dn23:27.15	they’re smeared with burning poison.	NA
dn23:27.16	Swallow, you damn cheat, swallow!	NA
dn23:27.17	Soon you’ll know the bitter fruit!’	NA

dn23:29.6	‘Yes, my friend,’ the other replied.	NA
dn23:29.7	They went to that country, and to a certain deserted village. There they saw a pile of abandoned sunn hemp. Seeing it, one friend said to the other,	_Gāmapaṭṭaṁ_ (variants _-padaṁ_, _-paddhanaṁ_, _-patthaṁ_, _pajjaṁ_) is explained by the commentary as an abandoned village site.
dn23:29.8	‘This is a pile of abandoned sunn hemp. Well then, my friend, you make up a bundle of hemp, and I’ll make one too. Let’s both take a bundle of hemp and go on.’	NA
dn23:29.9	‘Yes, my friend,’ he said. Carrying their bundles of hemp they went to another deserted village.	NA

dn23:32.0	5. On the Student Uttara	NA
dn23:32.1	Then the chieftain Pāyāsi set up an offering for ascetics and brahmins, for paupers, vagrants, supplicants, and beggars.	NA
dn23:32.2	At that offering such food as rough gruel with false black pepper was given, and rough clothes with knotted fringes.	_Bilaṅga_ is allowed with other medicinal fruits at [pli-tv-kd6:6.1.4](). It is Sanskrit _viḍaṅga_, identified as *embelia ribes* or “false black pepper”. | For _guḷavālakāni_, _guḷa_ is “ball”, _vāla_ is “tail”; compare _macchavāḷaka_ (“fish-tailed”) at [pli-tv-kd15:29.4.2]().
dn23:32.3	Now, it was a student named Uttara who organized that offering.	NA
dn23:32.4	When the offering was over he referred to it like this,	NA
dn23:32.5	“Through this offering may I be together with the chieftain Pāyāsi in this world, but not in the next.”	NA
dn23:32.6	Pāyāsi heard of this,	NA
dn23:32.7	NA	NA
dn23:32.8	NA	NA
dn23:32.9	so he summoned Uttara and said,	NA

dn23:32.11	NA	NA
dn23:32.12	“Yes, sir.”	NA
dn23:32.13	“But why?	NA
dn23:32.14	NA	NA
dn23:32.15	Don’t we who seek merit expect some result from the offering?”	NA
dn23:32.16	“At your offering such food as rough gruel with false black pepper was given, which you wouldn’t even want to touch with your foot, much less eat. And also rough clothes with knotted fringes, which you also wouldn’t want to touch with your foot, much less wear.	NA
dn23:32.17	Sir, you’re dear and beloved to me. But how can I reconcile one so dear with something so disagreeable?”	NA
dn23:32.18	“Well then, dear Uttara, set up an offering with the same kind of food that I eat,	NA
dn23:32.19	and the same kind of clothes that I wear.”	NA
dn23:32.20	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Uttara, and did so.	NA
dn23:32.21	NA	NA
dn23:32.22	So the chieftain Pāyāsi gave gifts carelessly, thoughtlessly, not with his own hands, giving the dregs. When his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in company with the gods of the four great kings, in an empty palace of sirisa wood.	Cp. [an5.147](), [an9.20]().
dn23:32.23	But the student Uttara who organized the offering gave gifts carefully, thoughtfully, with his own hands, not giving the dregs. When his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in company with the gods of the thirty-three.	NA
dn23:33.0	6. The Godling Pāyāsi	NA
dn23:33.1	Now at that time Venerable Gavampati would often go to that empty sirisa palace for the day’s meditation.	_Divāvihāra_ is the “day’s meditation”, while _divāseyya_ is “siesta”.
dn23:33.2	Then the godling Pāyāsi went up to him, bowed, and stood to one side. Gavampati said to him,	NA
dn23:33.3	“Who are you, reverend?”	NA
dn23:33.4	“Sir, I am the chieftain Pāyāsi.”	NA
dn23:33.5	“Didn’t you have the view that	NA
dn23:33.6	there is no afterlife, no beings are reborn spontaneously, and there’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds?”	NA
dn23:33.7	“It’s true, sir, I did have such a view.	NA
dn23:33.8	NA	NA
dn23:33.9	But Master Kassapa the Prince dissuaded me from that harmful misconception.”	NA
dn23:33.10	“But the student named Uttara who organized that offering for you—where has he been reborn?”	NA

dn24:0.2	About Pāṭikaputta	NA
dn24:1.0	1. The Story of Sunakkhatta	NA
dn24:1.1.1	So I have heard.	NA
dn24:1.1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Mallas, near the Mallian town named Anupiya.	This late sutta satirizes the failings of Sunakkhatta in a fashion so broad that it borders on slapstick. The town of Anupiya is mentioned only here.
dn24:1.1.3	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Anupiya for alms.	NA
dn24:1.1.4	Then it occurred to him,	NA
dn24:1.1.5	“It’s too early to wander for alms in Anupiya.	NA
dn24:1.1.6	Why don’t I go to visit the wanderer of the Bhaggava clan in his monastery?”	The Bhaggava clan was descended from the ancient sage Bhagu (Sanskrit Bhṛgu). They received the gift of fire conveyed by Mātariśvan the wind from the god Agni (eg. Rig Veda 1.60.1). In Pali they appear as potters (eg. [mn81:19.3](), [mn140:1.3](), [sn1.50:11.2](), [sn2.24:12.2]()). Archaeologists refer to the strata around the Buddha’s time as the Northern Black Polished Ware culture on account of the distinctive highly glazed polish that was achieved on the pottery of the time. This, together with the production of iron, marked a significant advance in the mastery of fire. Thus potters were no mere humble craftsmen, but leading technological innovators.
dn24:1.2.1	So that’s what he did.	NA
dn24:1.2.2	Then the wanderer of the Bhaggava clan said to the Buddha,	NA
dn24:1.2.3	“Let the Blessed One come, sir!	NA
dn24:1.2.4	Welcome to the Blessed One, sir!	NA
dn24:1.2.5	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.	NA
dn24:1.2.6	Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”	NA
dn24:1.2.7	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,	NA
dn24:1.2.8	while the wanderer of the Bhaggava clan took a low seat, sat to one side,	NA
dn24:1.2.9	and said to the Buddha,	NA
dn24:1.2.10	“Sir, a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and said:	Sunakkhatta’s dismal spiritual career began when he met the Buddha in [mn105](). In [dn6:5.3]() we learn that, after being ordained three years, he spoke of his limited success in meditation. The current sutta and [mn12]() deal with Sunakkhatta’s bitter criticisms of the Buddha shortly after his disrobal.
dn24:1.2.11	‘Now, Bhaggava, I have rejected the Buddha.	NA
dn24:1.2.12	Now I no longer live dedicated to him.’	NA
dn24:1.2.13	Sir, is what Sunakkhatta said true?”	NA
dn24:1.2.14	“Indeed it is, Bhaggava.	NA
dn24:1.3.1	A few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me, bowed, sat down to one side, and said:	NA
dn24:1.3.2	‘Now I reject the Buddha!	NA
dn24:1.3.3	Now I shall no longer live dedicated to you.’	NA
dn24:1.3.4	When Sunakkhatta said this, I said to him,	NA
dn24:1.3.5	‘But Sunakkhatta, did I ever say to you:	NA
dn24:1.3.6	“Come, live dedicated to me”?’	A candidate for ordination is expected to go for refuge to the Buddha, and may be said to live dedicated (_uddissa_) to him ([pli-tv-kd1:23.4.1]()). Moreover, a noble disciple is unable to dedicate themselves to another teacher ([an1.276:1.1]()). But when the Buddha called candidates to go forth, he spoke of practice rather than personal devotion: “Come, monk. The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” ([pli-tv-kd1:6.32.3]())
dn24:1.3.7	‘No, sir.’	NA
dn24:1.3.8	‘Or did you ever say to me:	NA
dn24:1.3.9	“Sir, I shall live dedicated to the Buddha”?’	NA
dn24:1.3.10	‘No, sir.’	NA
dn24:1.3.11	‘So it seems that I did not ask you to	NA

dn24:1.5.18	See how far you have strayed, you silly man!	NA
dn24:1.6.1	In many ways, Sunakkhatta, you have praised me like this in the Vajjian capital:	NA
dn24:1.6.2	“That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.”	NA

dn24:1.6.4	In many ways you have praised the teaching like this in the Vajjian capital:	NA

dn24:1.6.6	NA	NA
dn24:1.6.7	In many ways you have praised the Saṅgha like this in the Vajjian capital:	NA
dn24:1.6.8	“The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”	NA
dn24:1.6.9	NA	NA
dn24:1.6.10	I declare this to you, Sunakkhatta, I announce this to you!	NA
dn24:1.6.11	There will be those who say that Sunakkhatta was unable to lead the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama. That’s why he resigned the training and returned to a lesser life.	NA
dn24:1.6.12	That’s what they’ll say.’	NA
dn24:1.6.13	Though I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this, he still left this teaching and training, like someone on the highway to hell.	NA
dn24:1.7.0	2. On the Aristocrat of Kuru	NA
dn24:1.7.1	Bhaggava, this one time I was staying in the land of the Kurus where they have a town named Uttarakā.	There are at least eight spellings for this tribe, including _thulu_, _bumu_ and _khulu_. Below we meet a member of the ruling clan of the tribe named _korakhattiya_. I propose that _kora_ is “of Kuru” by way of secondary derivation; cp. Koravya as a regular name for the kings of Kuru. Thus _korakhattiya_ is not a personal name, but rather “the aristocrat of Kuru”. The name of the city _uttarakā_ means “northern”, and Kuru is indeed northern. Occam’s razor would urge us not to assume the existence of an otherwise unknown tribe on such a dubious term when it can be explained more parsimoniously as an ancient misspelling of Kuru. The Chinese at DA 15 (T 1, 67a15) has <span lang='lzh'>白土</span> (“white clay”), which does not seem to clear it up.
dn24:1.7.2	Then I robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, entered Uttarakā for alms with Sunakkhatta the Licchavi as my second monk.	NA
dn24:1.7.3	Now at that time a naked ascetic who was an aristocrat of Kuru had taken a vow to behave like a dog. When food is tossed on the ground, he gets down on all fours, eating and devouring it just with his mouth.	This practice is further described, along with the “cow vow”, at [mn57]().
dn24:1.7.4	Sunakkhatta saw him doing this	NA
dn24:1.7.5	and thought,	NA
dn24:1.7.6	‘That ascetic is a holy man!’	“Holy man” is _sādhurūpo_ (cp. [dhp263](), [an6.54:26.1]()).
dn24:1.7.7	Then, knowing Sunakkhatta’s train of thought, I said to him,	NA
dn24:1.7.8	‘Don’t you claim to be an ascetic who follows the Sakyan, you silly man?’	NA
dn24:1.7.9	‘But why does the Buddha say this to me?’	NA
dn24:1.7.10	NA	NA
dn24:1.7.11	‘When you saw that naked ascetic of Kuru, didn’t you think,	NA
dn24:1.7.12	“That ascetic is a holy man!”?’	NA
dn24:1.7.13	‘Yes, sir.	NA
dn24:1.7.14	But sir, are you jealous of the perfected ones?’	NA
dn24:1.7.15	‘I’m not jealous of the perfected ones, you silly man.	NA
dn24:1.7.16	Rather, you should give up this harmful misconception that has arisen in you.	NA
dn24:1.7.17	Don’t create lasting harm and suffering for yourself!	NA
dn24:1.7.18	That naked ascetic the aristocrat of Kuru, who you imagine to be a holy man, will die of flatulence in seven days.	_Alasaka_ is otherwise unknown in early Pali. Sanskrit medical texts describe it as flatulent indigestion. This agrees with the subcommentary’s _ajīraṇena āmarogena_ (“indigestion”). | In this sutta, the Buddha is depicted as making specific predictions about the future, whereas normally he does not and probably cannot. Rather, he makes conditional predictions that if such courses are pursued, such results will follow.
dn24:1.7.19	And when he dies, he’ll be reborn in the very lowest rank of titans, named the Kālakañjas.	The terrifying Kālakañjas are mentioned at [dn20:12.5]().
dn24:1.7.20	And they’ll throw him in the charnel ground on a clump of vetiver.	NA
dn24:1.7.21	If you wish, Sunakkhatta, go to the aristocrat of Kuru and ask him	NA
dn24:1.7.22	whether he knows his own destiny.	NA
dn24:1.7.23	It’s possible that he will answer:	NA
dn24:1.7.24	“Reverend Sunakkhatta, I know my own destiny.	NA
dn24:1.7.25	I’ve been reborn in the very lowest rank of titans, named the Kālakañjas.”’	NA
dn24:1.8.1	So, Bhaggava, Sunakkhatta went to see the aristocrat of Kuru and said to him,	NA
dn24:1.8.2	‘Reverend aristocrat of Kuru, the ascetic Gotama has declared	NA
dn24:1.8.3	that you will die of flatulence in seven days.	NA
dn24:1.8.4	And when you die, you’ll be reborn in the very lowest rank of titans, named the Kālakañjas.	NA
dn24:1.8.5	And when you die, they’ll throw you in the charnel ground on a clump of vetiver.	NA
dn24:1.8.6	But by eating just a little food and drinking just a little water,	NA
dn24:1.8.7	you’ll prove what the ascetic Gotama says to be false.’	NA
dn24:1.8.8	Then Sunakkhatta counted up the days until the seventh day, as happens when you have no faith in the Realized One.	NA
dn24:1.8.9	But on the seventh day, the naked ascetic who was an aristocrat of Kuru died of flatulence.	NA
dn24:1.8.10	And when he passed away, he was reborn in the very lowest rank of titans, named the Kālakañjas.	NA
dn24:1.8.11	And when he passed away, they threw him in the charnel ground on a clump of vetiver.	NA
dn24:1.9.1	Sunakkhatta the Licchavi heard about this.	NA
dn24:1.9.2	NA	NA
dn24:1.9.3	So he went to see the aristocrat of Kuru in the charnel ground on the clump of vetiver. There he struck him with his fist three times,	NA
dn24:1.9.4	‘Reverend aristocrat of Kuru, do you know your destiny?’	NA
dn24:1.9.5	Then the aristocrat of Kuru got up, rubbing his back with his hands, and said,	This whole passage is unprecedented in early Buddhism. If Sunakkhatta was indeed able to revive the dead with three punches, it would explain why he thought so little of the Buddha’s powers. But the ease with which this information is obtained contrasts with the elaborate failures of Pāyāsi ([dn23]()).
dn24:1.9.6	‘Reverend Sunakkhatta, I know my own destiny.	NA
dn24:1.9.7	I’ve been reborn in the very lowest rank of titans, named the Kālakañjas.’ After speaking, he fell flat right there.	NA
dn24:1.10.1	Then Sunakkhatta came to me, bowed, and sat down to one side. I said to him,	NA
dn24:1.10.2	‘What do you think, Sunakkhatta?	NA
dn24:1.10.3	Did the prediction I made about the aristocrat of Kuru turn out to be correct, or not?’	NA
dn24:1.10.4	‘It turned out to be correct.’	NA
dn24:1.10.5	‘What do you think, Sunakkhatta?	NA
dn24:1.10.6	If that is so, has a superhuman demonstration of psychic power been performed or not?’	NA
dn24:1.10.7	‘Clearly, sir, a superhuman demonstration of psychic power has been performed.’	NA
dn24:1.10.8	‘Though I performed such a superhuman demonstration of psychic power you say this:	NA
dn24:1.10.9	“But sir, the Buddha never performs any superhuman demonstrations of psychic power for me.”	NA
dn24:1.10.10	See how far you have strayed!’	NA
dn24:1.10.11	Though I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this, he still left this teaching and training, like someone on the highway to hell.	NA
dn24:1.11.0	3. On the Naked Ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka	NA
dn24:1.11.1	This one time, Bhaggava, I was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	NA
dn24:1.11.2	Now at that time the naked ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka was residing in Vesālī. And in the Vajjian capital he had reached the peak of material things and fame.	Spellings for Kaḷāramaṭṭaka vary greatly.
dn24:1.11.3	He had undertaken these seven vows.	In these practices we see some examples of the vows or observances (_vata_) that Buddha rejected as “grasping at precepts and observances”
dn24:1.11.4	‘As long as I live, I will be a naked ascetic, not wearing clothes. As long as I live, I will be chaste, not having sex. As long as I live, I will consume only meat and beer, not eating rice and porridge.	A diet of pure meat is still undertaken today by certain would-be gurus.
dn24:1.11.5	And I will not go past the following tree-shrines near Vesālī: the Udena Shrine to the east, the Gotamaka to the south, the Seven Maidens to the west, and the Many Sons to the north.’	Compare the “vow of restraint in the directions” in the Jain Tattvārthasūtra 7.1.
dn24:1.11.6	And it was due to undertaking these seven vows that he had reached the peak of material things and fame.	NA
dn24:1.12.1	So, Bhaggava, Sunakkhatta went to see Kaḷāramaṭṭaka and asked him a question.	NA
dn24:1.12.2	But when it stumped him,	NA
dn24:1.12.3	he displayed annoyance, hate, and bitterness.	NA
dn24:1.12.4	So Sunakkhatta thought,	NA
dn24:1.12.5	‘I’ve offended the holy man, the perfected one, the ascetic.	_Āsādimhase_ is middle aorist plural. Below Sunakkhatta again refers to himself in plural, but as usual I render with singular.
dn24:1.12.6	I mustn’t create lasting harm and suffering for myself!’	NA
dn24:1.13.1	Then Sunakkhatta came to me, bowed, and sat down to one side. I said to him,	NA
dn24:1.13.2	‘Don’t you claim to be an ascetic who follows the Sakyan, you silly man?’	NA
dn24:1.13.3	‘But why does the Buddha say this to me?’	NA
dn24:1.13.4	NA	NA
dn24:1.13.5	‘Didn’t you go to see the naked ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka and ask him a question?	NA
dn24:1.13.6	But when it stumped him,	NA
dn24:1.13.7	he displayed annoyance, hate, and bitterness.	NA
dn24:1.13.8	Then you thought,	NA
dn24:1.13.9	“I’ve offended the holy man, the perfected one, the ascetic.	NA
dn24:1.13.10	I mustn’t create lasting harm and suffering for myself!”’	NA
dn24:1.13.11	‘Yes, sir.	NA
dn24:1.13.12	But sir, are you jealous of perfected ones?’	NA
dn24:1.13.13	‘I’m not jealous of the perfected ones, you silly man.	NA
dn24:1.13.14	Rather, you should give up this harmful misconception that has arisen in you.	NA
dn24:1.13.15	Don’t create lasting harm and suffering for yourself!	NA
dn24:1.13.16	That naked ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka, who you imagine to be a true holy man,	NA
dn24:1.13.17	will shortly be clothed, living with a partner, eating rice and porridge, having gone past all the shrines near Vesālī. And he will die after losing all his fame.’	NA
dn24:1.13.18	And that’s exactly what happened.	NA
dn24:1.14.1	Sunakkhatta heard about this.	NA
dn24:1.14.2	NA	NA
dn24:1.14.3	He came to me, bowed, and sat down to one side. I said to him,	NA
dn24:1.14.4	‘What do you think, Sunakkhatta?	NA
dn24:1.14.5	Did the declaration I made about Kaḷāramaṭṭaka turn out to be correct, or not?’	NA
dn24:1.14.6	‘It turned out to be correct.’	NA
dn24:1.14.7	‘What do you think, Sunakkhatta?	NA
dn24:1.14.8	If that is so, has a superhuman demonstration of psychic power been performed or not?’	NA
dn24:1.14.9	‘Clearly, sir, a superhuman demonstration of psychic power has been performed.’	NA
dn24:1.14.10	‘Though I perform such a superhuman demonstration of psychic power you say this:	NA
dn24:1.14.11	“But sir, the Buddha never performs any superhuman demonstrations of psychic power for me.”	NA
dn24:1.14.12	See how far you have strayed!’	NA
dn24:1.14.13	Though I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this, he still left this teaching and training, like someone on the highway to hell.	NA
dn24:1.15.0	4. On the Naked Ascetic Pāṭikaputta	NA
dn24:1.15.1	This one time, Bhaggava, I was staying right there near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	NA
dn24:1.15.2	Now at that time the naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta was residing in Vesālī. And in the Vajjian capital he had reached the peak of material things and fame.	The Burmese reading _pāthikaputta_ means “son of a traveler”. However the commentary says Pāṭika (or Pāthika) was the name of his father.
dn24:1.15.3	He was telling a crowd in Vesālī:	NA
dn24:1.15.4	‘Both the ascetic Gotama and I speak from knowledge.	For _ñāṇavādo_ (“one who speaks from knowledge”) see [an9.38:3.3](), [an10.24:2.1](), [mn26:15.7]().
dn24:1.15.5	One who speaks from knowledge ought to display a superhuman demonstration of psychic power to another who speaks from knowledge.	NA
dn24:1.15.6	If the ascetic Gotama meets me half-way,	NA
dn24:1.15.7	there we should both perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power.	NA
dn24:1.15.8	If he performs one demonstration of psychic power, I’ll perform two.	NA
dn24:1.15.9	If he performs two, I’ll perform four.	NA
dn24:1.15.10	If he performs four, I’ll perform eight.	NA
dn24:1.15.11	However many demonstrations of psychic power the ascetic Gotama performs, I’ll perform double.’	NA
dn24:1.16.1	Then Sunakkhatta came to me, bowed, sat down to one side, and told me of all this.	NA
dn24:1.16.2	NA	NA
dn24:1.16.3	NA	NA

dn24:1.16.9	NA	NA
dn24:1.16.10	NA	NA
dn24:1.16.11	NA	NA
dn24:1.16.12	I said to him,	NA
dn24:1.16.13	‘Sunakkhatta, the naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is not capable of meeting me face to face, unless he gives up that statement and that intention, and lets go of that view.	NA
dn24:1.16.14	If he thinks he can	NA
dn24:1.16.15	meet me face to face without giving up those things, his head may explode.’	NA
dn24:1.17.1	‘Careful what you say, Blessed One! Careful what you say, Holy One!’	NA
dn24:1.17.2	‘But why do you say this to me, Sunakkhatta?’	NA
dn24:1.17.3	NA	NA
dn24:1.17.4	‘Sir, the Buddha has categorically asserted that	NA
dn24:1.17.5	Pāṭikaputta is not capable of meeting the Buddha face to face, otherwise	NA
dn24:1.17.6	NA	NA
dn24:1.17.7	his head may explode.	NA
dn24:1.17.8	But Pāṭikaputta might meet the Buddha face to face in disguise, proving the Buddha wrong.’	NA
dn24:1.18.1	‘Sunakkhatta, would the Realized One make an ambiguous statement?’	“Ambiguous” is _dvayagāminī_, literally “two-going”.
dn24:1.18.2	‘But sir, did you make that statement after comprehending Pāṭikaputta’s mind with your mind?	NA
dn24:1.18.3	NA	NA
dn24:1.18.4	NA	NA
dn24:1.18.5	NA	NA
dn24:1.18.6	Or did deities tell you about it?’	NA

dn24:1.18.8	NA	NA
dn24:1.18.9	NA	NA
dn24:1.18.10	‘Both, Sunakkhatta.	NA

dn24:1.18.17	NA	NA
dn24:1.18.18	For Ajita the Licchavi general has recently passed away and been reborn in the host of the thirty-three.	NA
dn24:1.18.19	He came and told me this,	NA
dn24:1.18.20	“The naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is shameless, sir,	NA
dn24:1.18.21	he is a liar.	NA
dn24:1.18.22	For he has declared of me in the Vajjian capital:	NA
dn24:1.18.23	‘Ajita the Licchavi general has been reborn in the Great Hell.’	NA
dn24:1.18.24	But that is not true—	NA
dn24:1.18.25	I have been reborn in the host of the thirty-three.	NA
dn24:1.18.26	The naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is shameless, sir,	NA
dn24:1.18.27	he is a liar.	NA

dn24:1.18.29	NA	NA
dn24:1.18.30	his head may explode.”	NA
dn24:1.18.31	Thus I both made that statement after comprehending Pāṭikaputta’s mind with my mind,	NA
dn24:1.18.32	NA	NA
dn24:1.18.33	NA	NA
dn24:1.18.34	and deities told me about it.	NA

dn24:1.18.38	So Sunakkhatta, I’ll wander for alms in Vesālī. After the meal, on my return from almsround, I’ll go to Pāṭikaputta’s monastery for the day’s meditation.	NA
dn24:1.18.39	Now you may tell him, if you so wish.’	NA
dn24:1.19.0	5. On Demonstrations of Psychic Power	NA
dn24:1.19.1	Then, Bhaggava, I robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.	NA
dn24:1.19.2	After the meal, on my return from almsround, I went to Pāṭikaputta’s monastery for the day’s meditation.	NA
dn24:1.19.3	Then Sunakkhatta rushed into Vesālī to see the very well-known Licchavis and said to them,	NA
dn24:1.19.4	‘Good sirs, after his almsround, the Buddha has gone to Pāṭikaputta’s monastery for the day’s meditation.	NA
dn24:1.19.5	Come forth, good sirs, come forth! There will be a superhuman demonstration of psychic power by the holy ascetics!’	NA
dn24:1.19.6	So the very well-known Licchavis thought,	NA
dn24:1.19.7	‘It seems there will be a superhuman demonstration of psychic power by the holy ascetics!	NA
dn24:1.19.8	Let’s go!’	NA
dn24:1.19.9	Then he went to see the very well-known well-to-do brahmins, rich householders, and ascetics and brahmins who follow various other religions, and said the same thing.	NA
dn24:1.19.10	NA	NA
dn24:1.19.11	NA	NA
dn24:1.19.12	They all said,	NA
dn24:1.19.13	‘It seems there will be a superhuman demonstration of psychic power by the holy ascetics!	NA
dn24:1.19.14	Let’s go!’	NA
dn24:1.19.15	Then all those very well-known people went to Pāṭikaputta’s monastery.	NA
dn24:1.19.16	That assembly was large, Bhaggava; there were many hundreds, many thousands of them.	NA
dn24:1.20.1	Pāṭikaputta heard,	NA
dn24:1.20.2	‘It seems that very well-known Licchavis, well-to-do brahmins, rich householders, and ascetics and brahmins who follow various other religions have come forth.	NA
dn24:1.20.3	And the ascetic Gotama is sitting in my monastery for the day’s meditation.’	NA
dn24:1.20.4	When he heard that, he became frightened, scared, his hair standing on end.	NA
dn24:1.20.5	In fear he went to the Pale-Moon Ebony Trunk Monastery of the wanderers.	NA
dn24:1.20.6	The assembly heard of this,	NA
dn24:1.20.7	NA	NA
dn24:1.20.8	and instructed a man,	NA
dn24:1.20.9	‘Come, my man, go to see Pāṭikaputta at the Pale-Moon Ebony Trunk Monastery and say to him,	NA

dn24:1.21.10	When he had spoken, Pāṭikaputta said: ‘I’m coming, good sir, I’m coming!’ But wriggle as he might, he couldn’t get up from his seat.	NA
dn24:1.21.11	Then that man said to Pāṭikaputta,	NA
dn24:1.21.12	‘What’s up, Reverend Pāṭikaputta? Is your bottom stuck to the bench, or is the bench stuck to your bottom?	NA
dn24:1.21.13	You say “I’m coming, good sir, I’m coming!” But wriggle as you might, you can’t get up from your seat.’	NA
dn24:1.21.14	And as he was speaking, Pāṭikaputta said: ‘I’m coming, good sir, I’m coming!’ But wriggle as he might, he couldn’t get up from his seat.	NA

dn24:1.22.7	When he said this, I said to the assembly,	NA
dn24:1.22.8	‘The naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is not capable of meeting me face to face, unless he gives up that statement and that intention, and lets go of that view.	NA
dn24:1.22.9	If he thinks he can	NA

dn24:1.22.11	The first recitation section is finished.	NA
dn24:2.1.1	Then, Bhaggava, a certain Licchavi minister stood up and said to the assembly,	NA

dn24:2.2.2	Then the minister said to Pāṭikaputta,	NA
dn24:2.2.3	‘What’s up, Reverend Pāṭikaputta? Is your bottom stuck to the bench, or is the bench stuck to your bottom?	NA

dn24:2.2.5	And as he was speaking, Pāṭikaputta said: ‘I’m coming, good sir, I’m coming!’ But wriggle as he might, he couldn’t get up from his seat.	NA
dn24:2.3.1	When the Licchavi minister knew	NA
dn24:2.3.2	that Pāṭikaputta had lost,	NA

dn24:2.3.11	NA	NA
dn24:2.3.12	NA	NA
dn24:2.3.13	NA	NA
dn24:2.4.1	Then, Bhaggava, Jāliya, the pupil of the wood-bowl ascetic, stood up and said to the assembly,	NA
dn24:2.4.2	‘Well then, worthies, wait an hour, I’ll go.	NA
dn24:2.4.3	Hopefully I’ll be able to lead Pāṭikaputta back to the assembly.’	NA
dn24:2.4.4	So Jāliya went to see Pāṭikaputta and said,	NA
dn24:2.4.5	‘Come forth, Reverend Pāṭikaputta! It’s best for you to come forth. All these very well-known people have come forth, and the ascetic Gotama is sitting in your monastery for the day’s meditation.	NA
dn24:2.4.6	You said you’d meet the ascetic Gotama half-way.	NA

dn24:2.4.8	NA	NA
dn24:2.4.9	NA	NA
dn24:2.4.10	The ascetic Gotama has come the first half, and is sitting in your monastery.	NA
dn24:2.4.11	The ascetic Gotama has told the assembly	NA
dn24:2.4.12	that you’re not capable of meeting him face to face.	NA
dn24:2.4.13	NA	NA
dn24:2.4.14	NA	NA
dn24:2.4.15	And he said that even if the Licchavis	NA
dn24:2.4.16	try to bind you with straps and drag you with a pair of oxen, either the straps will break or you will.	NA
dn24:2.4.17	NA	NA
dn24:2.4.18	NA	NA
dn24:2.4.19	NA	NA
dn24:2.4.20	Come forth, Pāṭikaputta! When you come forth we’ll make you win and the ascetic Gotama lose.’	NA
dn24:2.5.1	When he had spoken, Pāṭikaputta said: ‘I’m coming, good sir, I’m coming!’ But wriggle as he might, he couldn’t get up from his seat.	NA
dn24:2.5.2	Then Jāliya said to Pāṭikaputta,	NA
dn24:2.5.3	‘What’s up, Reverend Pāṭikaputta? Is your bottom stuck to the bench, or is the bench stuck to your bottom?	NA
dn24:2.5.4	You say “I’m coming, good sir, I’m coming!” But wriggle as you might, you can’t get up from your seat.’	NA
dn24:2.5.5	And as he was speaking, Pāṭikaputta said: ‘I’m coming, good sir, I’m coming!’ But wriggle as he might, he couldn’t get up from his seat.	NA
dn24:2.6.1	When Jāliya knew	NA
dn24:2.6.2	that Pāṭikaputta had lost, he said to him,	NA
dn24:2.6.3	‘Once upon a time, Reverend Pāṭikaputta, it occurred to a lion, king of beasts,	NA
dn24:2.6.4	“Why don’t I make my lair near a certain forest?	NA
dn24:2.6.5	Towards evening I can emerge from my den, yawn, survey the four quarters, roar my lion’s roar three times, and set out on the hunt.	NA
dn24:2.6.6	Having slain the very best of the deer herd, and eaten the most tender flesh, I could return to my den.”	NA
dn24:2.6.7	And so that’s what he did.	NA
dn24:2.6.8	NA	NA
dn24:2.6.9	NA	NA
dn24:2.6.10	Now, there was an old jackal who had grown fat on the lion’s leavings, becoming arrogant and strong.	NA
dn24:2.6.11	He thought,	NA
dn24:2.6.12	“What does the lion, king of beasts, have that I don’t?	NA
dn24:2.6.13	Why don’t I also make my lair near a certain forest?	NA
dn24:2.6.14	Towards evening I can emerge from my den, yawn, survey the four quarters, roar my lion’s roar three times, and set out on the hunt.	NA
dn24:2.6.15	Having slain the very best of the deer herd, and eaten the most tender flesh, I could return to my den.”	NA
dn24:2.7.1	And so that’s what he did.	NA
dn24:2.7.2	But when he tried to roar a lion’s roar, he only managed to squeal and yelp like a jackal. And what is a pathetic jackal’s squeal next to the roar of a lion?	NA
dn24:2.7.3	In the same way, reverend, while living off the leavings of the Holy One, enjoying the leftovers of the Holy One, you presume to attack the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	_Apadāna_ means “what has been left over, leavings, traces”.
dn24:2.7.4	Who are the pathetic Pāṭikaputtas to attack the Realized Ones, the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas?’	NA
dn24:2.8.1	When Jāliya couldn’t get Pāṭikaputta to shift from his seat even with this simile,	NA
dn24:2.8.2	he said to him:	NA
dn24:2.8.3	‘Seeing himself as equal to the lion,	NA
dn24:2.8.4	the jackal presumed “I’m the king of the beasts!”	NA
dn24:2.8.5	But he actually only managed to yelp,	NA
dn24:2.8.6	and what’s a sad jackal’s squeal to the roar of a lion?	NA

dn24:2.8.8	NA	NA
dn24:2.9.1	When Jāliya couldn’t get Pāṭikaputta to shift from his seat even with this simile,	NA
dn24:2.9.2	he said to him:	NA
dn24:2.9.3	‘Following in the steps of another,	NA
dn24:2.9.4	seeing himself grown fat on scraps,	NA
dn24:2.9.5	until he doesn’t even see himself,	NA
dn24:2.9.6	the jackal presumes he’s a tiger.	NA
dn24:2.9.7	But he actually only managed to yelp,	NA
dn24:2.9.8	and what’s a sad jackal’s squeal to the roar of a lion?	NA

dn24:2.10.5	thriving in the great, empty wood,	NA

dn24:2.10.10	Who are the pathetic Pāṭikaputtas to attack the Realized Ones, the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas?’	NA
dn24:2.11.1	When Jāliya couldn’t get Pāṭikaputta to shift from his seat even with this simile,	NA
dn24:2.11.2	he returned to the assembly and said,	NA
dn24:2.11.3	‘Pāṭikaputta has lost, worthies. He says “I’m coming, good sirs, I’m coming!” But wriggle as he might, he can’t get up from his seat.’	NA
dn24:2.12.1	When he said this, I said to the assembly,	NA
dn24:2.12.2	‘The naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is not capable of meeting me face to face, unless he gives up that statement and that intention, and lets go of that view.	NA
dn24:2.12.3	If he thinks he can	NA
dn24:2.12.4	meet me face to face without giving up those things, his head may explode.	NA
dn24:2.12.5	The good Licchavis might even think,	NA

dn24:2.12.7	Pāṭikaputta is not capable of meeting me face to face, otherwise	NA
dn24:2.12.8	his head may explode.’	NA
dn24:2.13.1	Then, Bhaggava, I educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired that assembly with a Dhamma talk. I released that assembly from the great bondage, and lifted 84,000 beings from the great swamp. Next I entered upon the fire element, rose into the air to the height of seven palm trees, and created a flame another seven palm trees high, blazing and smoking. Finally I landed at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	This kind of elaborate display is commonly depicted in late texts, but is not otherwise found in early Pali.
dn24:2.13.2	Then Sunakkhatta came to me, bowed, and sat down to one side. I said to him,	NA
dn24:2.13.3	‘What do you think, Sunakkhatta?	NA
dn24:2.13.4	Did the declaration I made about Pāṭikaputta turn out to be correct, or not?’	NA
dn24:2.13.5	‘It turned out to be correct.’	NA
dn24:2.13.6	‘What do you think, Sunakkhatta?	NA
dn24:2.13.7	If that is so, has a superhuman demonstration of psychic power been performed or not?’	NA
dn24:2.13.8	‘Clearly, sir, a superhuman demonstration of psychic power has been performed.’	NA
dn24:2.13.9	‘Though I perform such a superhuman demonstration of psychic power you say this:	NA
dn24:2.13.10	“But sir, the Buddha never performs any superhuman demonstrations of psychic power for me.”	NA
dn24:2.13.11	See how far you have strayed!’	NA
dn24:2.13.12	Though I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this, he still left this teaching and training, like someone on the highway to hell.	NA
dn24:2.14.0	6. On Describing the Origin of the World	NA
dn24:2.14.1	Bhaggava, I understand the origin of the world.	NA
dn24:2.14.2	I understand this, and what goes beyond it. Yet since I do not misapprehend that understanding, I have realized quenching within myself. Directly knowing this, the Realized One does not come to ruin.	Compare [dn1:1.36.3](). The following passage is largely adapted from the Brahmajālasutta.
dn24:2.14.3	There are some ascetics and brahmins who describe the origin of the world in their tradition as created by the God Almighty, by the Divinity.	NA
dn24:2.14.4	I go up to them and say,	NA
dn24:2.14.5	‘Is it really true that this is the venerables’ view?’	NA
dn24:2.14.6	And they answer, ‘Yes’.	NA
dn24:2.14.7	I say to them,	NA
dn24:2.14.8	‘But how do you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about as created by the God Almighty, by the Divinity?’	NA
dn24:2.14.9	But they are stumped by my question, and they even question me in return.	NA
dn24:2.14.10	So I answer them,	NA
dn24:2.14.11	‘There comes a time when, reverends, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos contracts.	NA
dn24:2.14.12	As the cosmos contracts, sentient beings are mostly headed for the realm of streaming radiance.	NA
dn24:2.14.13	There they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, wandering in midair, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time.	NA
dn24:2.15.1	There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos expands.	NA
dn24:2.15.2	As it expands an empty mansion of divinity appears.	NA
dn24:2.15.3	Then a certain sentient being—due to the running out of their lifespan or merit—passes away from that host of radiant deities and is reborn in that empty mansion of divinity.	NA
dn24:2.15.4	There they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, wandering in midair, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time.	NA
dn24:2.16.1	But after staying there all alone for a long time, they become dissatisfied and anxious,	NA
dn24:2.16.2	“Oh, if only other beings would come to this place.”	NA
dn24:2.16.3	Then other sentient beings—due to the running out of their lifespan or merit—pass away from that host of radiant deities and are reborn in that mansion of divinity in company with that being.	Text has _suññaṁ_, but this appears to be a mistake, since the mansion is no longer “empty” as Brahmā is already there. Follow [dn1:2.4.3](), which lacks _suññaṁ_.
dn24:2.16.4	There they too are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, wandering in midair, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time.	NA
dn24:2.17.1	Now, the being who was reborn there first thinks,	NA
dn24:2.17.2	“I am the Divinity, the Great Divinity, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power,  God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born. And these beings were created by me.	NA
dn24:2.17.3	Why is that?	NA
dn24:2.17.4	Because first I thought,	NA
dn24:2.17.5	‘Oh, if only other beings would come to this place.’	NA
dn24:2.17.6	Such was my heart’s wish, and then these creatures came to this place.”	NA
dn24:2.17.7	And the beings who were reborn there later also think,	NA
dn24:2.17.8	“This must be the Divinity, the Great Divinity, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born.	NA
dn24:2.17.9	And we were created by him.	NA
dn24:2.17.10	Why is that?	NA
dn24:2.17.11	Because we see that he was reborn here first, and we arrived later.”	NA
dn24:2.17.12	And the being who was reborn first is more long-lived, beautiful, and illustrious than those who arrived later.	NA
dn24:2.17.13	NA	NA
dn24:2.17.14	It’s possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this place.	NA
dn24:2.17.15	Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
dn24:2.17.16	By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind, they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life, but no further.	NA
dn24:2.17.17	They say:	NA
dn24:2.17.18	“He who is the Divinity—the Great Divinity, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born—by he we were created. He is permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity.	NA
dn24:2.17.19	We who were created by that Divinity are impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, liable to pass away, and have come to this place.”	NA
dn24:2.17.20	Is this how you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about as created by the God Almighty, by the Divinity?’	This statement is not explicitly phrased as a question, but the Mahāsaṅgīti edition inconsistently punctuates it as one. It makes more sense in context, especially as a response to the initial question: _Kathaṁvihitakaṁ_ (“How do you describe …”) … _Evaṁvihitakaṁ_ (“Is this how you describe …”).
dn24:2.17.21	They say,	NA
dn24:2.17.22	‘That is what we have heard, Reverend Gotama, just as you say.’	This is adopted from [dn1:2.2.1](). These philosophers belong with the “partial eternalists”.
dn24:2.17.23	Bhaggava, I understand the origin of the world.	NA
dn24:2.17.24	I understand this, and what goes beyond it. Yet since I do not misapprehend that understanding, I have realized quenching within myself. Directly knowing this, the Realized One does not come to ruin.	NA
dn24:2.18.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who describe the origin of the world in their tradition as due to those depraved by play.	NA
dn24:2.18.2	I go up to them and say,	NA
dn24:2.18.3	‘Is it really true that this is the venerables’ view?’	NA

dn24:2.18.5	I say to them,	NA
dn24:2.18.6	‘But how do you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about due to those depraved by play?’	NA
dn24:2.18.7	But they are stumped by my question, and they even question me in return.	NA
dn24:2.18.8	So I answer them,	NA
dn24:2.18.9	‘Reverends, there are gods named “depraved by play”. They spend too much time laughing, playing, and making merry. And in doing so, they lose their mindfulness, and they pass away from that host of gods.	[dn1:2.7.2]().

A “wanderer” may or may not be Brahmanical, but in DN 8 Nigrodha is called _tapabrahmacārī_, which suggests he was a celibate student of a Brahmanical teacher. | The commentary describes _udumbarikā_ (“Fig”) as _devī_ (“Queen”), while DA 8 says she is a “brahmin lady”. She too does not seem to appear elsewhere.
dn25:1.4	Then the householder Sandhāna left Rājagaha in the middle of the day to see the Buddha.	Sandhāna (“Conciliation”) was recognized as an eminent lay follower at ([an6.120-139:1.14]()).
dn25:1.5	Then it occurred to him,	NA
dn25:1.6	“It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha,	NA
dn25:1.7	as he’s in retreat.	NA
dn25:1.8	And it’s the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicants,	NA
dn25:1.9	as they’re in retreat.	NA
dn25:1.10	Why don’t I visit the wanderer Nigrodha at the lady Udumbarikā’s monastery for wanderers?”	NA
dn25:1.11	So he went to the monastery of the wanderers.	NA
dn25:2.1	Now at that time, Nigrodha was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as	NA
dn25:2.2	talk about kings, bandits, and chief ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence.	NA
dn25:3.1	Nigrodha saw Sandhāna coming off in the distance,	NA
dn25:3.2	and hushed his own assembly:	NA
dn25:3.3	“Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound.	NA
dn25:3.4	The householder Sandhāna, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is coming.	NA
dn25:3.5	He is included among the white-clothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing near Rājagaha.	NA
dn25:3.6	Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet.	NA
dn25:3.7	Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”	NA
dn25:3.8	Then those wanderers fell silent.	NA
dn25:4.1	Then Sandhāna went up to the wanderer Nigrodha, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
dn25:4.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Nigrodha,	NA
dn25:4.3	“The way the wanderers make an uproar as they sit together and talk about all kinds of low topics is one thing.	NA
dn25:4.4	NA	NA
dn25:4.5	It’s quite different to the way the Buddha frequents remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest that are quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat.”	NA
dn25:5.1	When Sandhāna said this, Nigrodha said to him,	NA
dn25:5.2	“Surely, householder, you should know better! With whom does the ascetic Gotama converse? With whom does he engage in discussion? With whom does he achieve lucidity of wisdom?	NA
dn25:5.3	Staying in empty huts has destroyed the ascetic Gotama’s wisdom. Not frequenting assemblies, he is unable to hold a discussion.	NA
dn25:5.4	He just lurks on the periphery.	NA
dn25:5.5	He’s just like a one-eyed cow, circling around and lurking on the periphery.	“One-eyed cow” is _gokāṇā_.
dn25:5.6	NA	NA
dn25:5.7	NA	NA
dn25:5.8	NA	NA
dn25:5.9	NA	NA
dn25:5.10	Go on, householder! Were the ascetic Gotama to come to this assembly, I’d sink him with just one question! I’d tie him up like a hollow pot!”	_Orodheyyāma_ normally means “enclose, trap” like ox in a pen ([an6.60:3.1]()), but here it is glossed in the commentary as _vinandheyyāma_ (“twist around”).
dn25:6.1	With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard this discussion between the householder Sandhāna and the wanderer Nigrodha.	NA
dn25:6.2	Then the Buddha descended from Vulture’s Peak Mountain and went to the peacocks’ feeding ground on the bank of the Sumāgadhā, where he walked mindfully in the open air.	NA
dn25:6.3	Nigrodha saw him,	NA
dn25:6.4	and hushed his own assembly:	NA
dn25:6.5	“Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound. The ascetic Gotama is walking mindfully on the bank of the Sumāgadhā.	NA
dn25:6.6	The venerable likes quiet and praises quiet.	NA
dn25:6.7	Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.	NA
dn25:6.8	If he comes, I’ll ask him this question:	NA
dn25:6.9	‘Sir, what teaching do you use to guide your disciples, through which they claim solace in the fundamental purpose of the spiritual life?’”	NA
dn25:6.10	Then those wanderers fell silent.	NA
dn25:7.0	2. Mortification in Disgust of Sin	NA
dn25:7.1	Then the Buddha went up to the wanderer Nigrodha,	NA
dn25:7.2	who said to him,	NA
dn25:7.3	“Let the Blessed One come, sir! Welcome to the Blessed One, sir!	NA
dn25:7.4	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.	NA
dn25:7.5	Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”	NA
dn25:7.6	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,	NA
dn25:7.7	while Nigrodha took a low seat and sat to one side.	NA
dn25:7.8	The Buddha said to him,	NA
dn25:7.9	“Nigrodha, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	This discourse highlights the Buddha’s method of engaging with people of other religions. He is open-hearted and interested in their views. He prefers to build on common ground, but is not afraid to criticize when it is warranted. And his aim is not to win converts, but to help people be free of suffering.
dn25:7.10	Nigrodha said,	NA
dn25:7.11	“Well, sir, I saw you walking mindfully and said:	NA
dn25:7.12	‘If the ascetic Gotama comes, I’ll ask him this question:	NA
dn25:7.13	“Sir, what teaching do you use to guide your disciples, through which they claim solace in the fundamental purpose of the spiritual life?”’	NA
dn25:7.14	This is the conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.”	NA
dn25:7.15	“It’s hard for you to understand this, Nigrodha, since you have a different view, creed, and belief, unless you dedicate yourself to practice with the guidance of tradition.	NA
dn25:7.16	Please ask me a question about the higher disgust of sin in your own tradition:	“Higher disgust of sin” renders _adhijegucche_. The idea is that people are tainted with corruption, somewhat comparable to the notion of “original sin”, although due to their own actions in the past rather than ancestral legacy. In “disgust” at that sin, they practice forms of fervent mortification (_tapas_) to burn out the corruption.
dn25:7.17	‘How are the conditions for the fervent mortification in disgust of sin completed, and how are they incomplete?’”	The phrase _kathaṁ santā_ is unique; it echoes _evaṁ sante_ below.
dn25:7.18	When he said this, those wanderers made an uproar,	NA
dn25:7.19	“Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! The ascetic Gotama has such power and might! For he sets aside his own doctrine and invites discussion on the doctrine of others!”	NA
dn25:8.1	Then Nigrodha, having quieted those wanderers, said to the Buddha,	NA
dn25:8.2	“Sir, we teach fervent mortification in disgust of sin, regarding it as essential and sticking to it.	NA
dn25:8.3	How are the conditions for the fervent mortification in disgust of sin completed, and how are they incomplete?”	NA
dn25:8.4	“Nigrodha, it’s when a mortifier goes naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on their behalf, or an invitation for a meal.	See the passage at [dn8:14.3]() and notes thereto.
dn25:8.5	They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breast-feeding, or who lives with a man; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or beer or wine, and drink no fermented gruel.	NA
dn25:8.6	They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls. They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day.	NA
dn25:8.7	They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals.	NA
dn25:8.8	They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.	NA

dn25:8.10	They tear out their hair and beard, committed to this practice.	NA
dn25:8.11	They constantly stand, refusing seats.	NA
dn25:8.12	They squat, committed to the endeavor of squatting.	NA
dn25:8.13	They lie on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns their bed.	NA
dn25:8.14	They make their bed on a plank, or the bare ground.	NA
dn25:8.15	They lie only on one side.	NA
dn25:8.16	They wear dust and dirt.	NA
dn25:8.17	They stay in the open air.	NA
dn25:8.18	They sleep wherever they lay their mat.	NA
dn25:8.19	They eat unnatural things, committed to the practice of eating unnatural foods.	NA
dn25:8.20	They don’t drink, committed to the practice of not drinking liquids.	NA
dn25:8.21	They’re devoted to ritual bathing three times a day, including the evening.	NA
dn25:8.22	What do you think, Nigrodha?	NA
dn25:8.23	If this is so, is the fervent mortification in disgust of sin complete, or incomplete?”	NA
dn25:8.24	“Clearly, sir, if that is so the fervent mortification in disgust of sin is complete, not incomplete.”	NA

A “fourfold restraint” (_cātuyāma_, or _cāujjāma_ in Jain Ardhamagadhi) is attributed to Jain founder Pārśva in Isibhāsiyāiṁ 31, where it is an abbreviated list: “from refraining from killing to refraining from possessions” (_pāṇātivāta-veramaṇeṇaṁ jāvā pariggaha-veramaṇeṇaṁ_); the missing items are not stealing (_asteya_) and truth (_satya_). The Jain text Uttarādhyayanasūtra 23 shows that Mahāvīra added nakedness to make five. Five are also found in Yogasūtra 2.30 and the Jain Tattvārthasūtra 7: non-harming (_ahiṁsā_), truth (_satya_), no stealing (_asteya_), celibacy (_brahmacarya_), and non-possessiveness (_aparigrahā_). | A different “fourfold restraint” is said to be a Jain practice at [dn2:29.2]().

dn25:16.5	It’s when a mortifier doesn’t kill living creatures, doesn’t get others to kill, and doesn’t approve of killing.	This extends the basic precept. The same analysis is applied to the “ten ways of performing deeds” at [an3.163](). | The distinction between one’s own action and another’s action is noted at Isibhāsiyāiṁ 31.42, although the wording and sense are different.

dn25:20.2	“Obviously, now these wanderers want to listen to what the Buddha says. They’re actively listening and trying to understand!”	NA
dn25:20.3	So he said to the wanderer Nigrodha,	NA
dn25:20.4	“Honorable Nigrodha, remember you said this to me:	NA
dn25:20.5	‘Surely, householder, you should know better! With whom does the ascetic Gotama converse? With whom does he engage in discussion? With whom does he achieve lucidity of wisdom?	NA
dn25:20.6	Staying in empty huts has destroyed the ascetic Gotama’s wisdom. Not frequenting assemblies, he is unable to hold a discussion. He just lurks on the periphery.	NA

dn25:20.11	When he said this, Nigrodha sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.	NA
dn25:21.1	Knowing this, the Buddha said to him,	NA
dn25:21.2	“Is it really true, Nigrodha—are those your words?”	NA
dn25:21.3	“It’s true, sir, those are my words. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me.”	NA

dn25:22.0	5. The Culmination of the Spiritual Path	NA
dn25:22.1	Nigrodha said,	NA
dn25:22.2	“I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to speak in that way.	NA
dn25:22.3	Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.”	NA
dn25:22.4	“Indeed, Nigrodha, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to speak in that way.	NA
dn25:22.5	But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it.	NA
dn25:22.6	For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.	NA

dn25:23.3	But you should not see it like this.	NA
dn25:23.4	Let your tutor remain your tutor.	This passage sets a powerful template for sincere engagement.
dn25:23.5	You might think,	NA
dn25:23.6	‘The ascetic Gotama speaks like this because he wants us to give up our recitation.’	NA
dn25:23.7	But you should not see it like this.	NA

dn25:23.13	You might think,	NA

dn25:23.15	But you should not see it like this.	NA
dn25:23.16	Let those things that are unskillful and considered unskillful in your tradition remain as they are.	NA

dn25:23.21	I do not speak for any of these reasons.	NA
dn25:23.22	Nigrodha, there are things that are unskillful, corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death. I teach Dhamma so that those things may be given up.	NA
dn25:23.23	When you practice accordingly, corrupting qualities will be given up in you and cleansing qualities will grow. You’ll enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom, having realized it with your own insight in this very life.”	NA
dn25:24.1	When this was said, those wanderers sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say, as if their minds were possessed by Māra.	NA
dn25:24.2	Then the Buddha thought,	This whole ending sequence is unique.
dn25:24.3	“All these silly people have been touched by the Wicked One!	NA
dn25:24.4	For not even a single one thinks,	NA
dn25:24.5	‘Come, let us lead the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama for the sake of enlightenment—for what do seven days matter?’”	NA

dn26:0.2	The Wheel-Turning Monarch	NA
dn26:1.0	1. Taking Refuge in Oneself	NA
dn26:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
dn26:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans at Mātulā.	_Mātulā_ means “maternal uncle”. This Magadhan village is mentioned only here and [cp9:39.2]().
dn26:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
dn26:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
dn26:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
dn26:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
dn26:1.7	“Mendicants, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge.	As at [dn16:2.26.1]().
dn26:1.8	And how does a mendicant do this?	NA
dn26:1.9	They meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
dn26:1.10	They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …	NA
dn26:1.11	mind …	NA
dn26:1.12	principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
dn26:1.13	That’s how a mendicant lives as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how they let the teaching be their island and their refuge, with no other refuge.	NA
dn26:1.14	You should roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers.	Two parables on mindfulness expand this idea ([sn47.6](), [sn46.7]()).
dn26:1.15	If you roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers, Māra won’t catch you or get hold of you.	NA
dn26:1.16	It is due to undertaking skillful qualities that merit grows.	_Evamidaṁ_ indicates entailment, as at [sn56.21:1.3](), [mn73:13.2](), [dn16:4.2.4]().
dn26:2.0	2. King Daḷhanemi	NA
dn26:2.1	Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a king named Daḷhanemi who was a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extended to all four sides, he achieved stability in the country, and he possessed the seven treasures.	We have heard the story of the wheel-turning monarch Mahāsudassana in [dn17](). Daḷhanemi appears only here. His name means “Strong-rim”, such being one of the characteristics of the Wheel. His story of renunciation shares much in common with that of Maghadeva ([mn83]()).
dn26:2.2	He had the following seven treasures:	NA
dn26:2.3	the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure.	NA
dn26:2.4	He had over a thousand sons who were valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.	NA
dn26:2.5	After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigned by principle, without rod or sword.	NA
dn26:3.1	Then, after many years, many hundred years, many thousand years had passed, King Daḷhanemi addressed one of his men,	NA
dn26:3.2	‘My good man, when you see that the heavenly wheel-treasure has receded back from its place, please tell me.’	“Receded back” (_osakkitaṁ_): like a woman shrinking away from a man’s unwanted advances ([dn12:16.12]()).
dn26:3.3	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied that man.	NA
dn26:3.4	After many thousand years had passed, that man saw that the heavenly wheel-treasure had receded back from its place. So he went to King Daḷhanemi and said,	NA
dn26:3.5	‘Please sire, you should know that your heavenly wheel-treasure has receded back from its place.’	NA
dn26:3.6	So the king summoned the crown prince and said,	NA
dn26:3.7	‘Dear prince, my heavenly wheel-treasure has receded back from its place.	NA
dn26:3.8	I’ve heard that	NA
dn26:3.9	when this happens to a wheel-turning monarch, he does not have long to live.	NA
dn26:3.10	I have enjoyed human pleasures. Now it is time for me to seek heavenly pleasures.	The same point of view is expressed at [pli-tv-bi-vb-pc21:1.4](), where sex workers teased nuns, suggesting they enjoy themselves while young and ordain when old. The Buddhist position is that Dhamma can be practiced at any age.
dn26:3.11	Come, dear prince, rule this land surrounded by ocean!	NA
dn26:3.12	I shall shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’	NA
dn26:3.13	And so, after carefully instructing the crown prince in kingship, King Daḷhanemi shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.	The signs of the renunciate predate Buddhism.
dn26:3.14	Seven days later the heavenly wheel-treasure vanished.	NA
dn26:4.1	Then a certain man approached the newly anointed aristocrat king and said,	NA
dn26:4.2	‘Please sire, you should know that the heavenly wheel-treasure has vanished.’	NA
dn26:4.3	At that the king was unhappy and experienced unhappiness.	NA
dn26:4.4	He went to the royal seer and said,	The “royal seer” (_rājisi_, Sanskrit _rājarṣi_) is described by Kauṭilya (Arthaśāstra 1.7.1). Such a king should pursue pleasures in moderation, rely on good advice, and work energetically for the welfare and prosperity of his people.
dn26:4.5	‘Please sire, you should know that the heavenly wheel-treasure has vanished.’	NA
dn26:4.6	When he said this, the royal seer said to him,	NA
dn26:4.7	‘Don’t be unhappy at the vanishing of the wheel-treasure. My dear, the wheel-treasure is not inherited from your father.	“Inherited from your father” (_pettikaṁ dāyajjaṁ_) calls back to the four _satipaṭṭhānas_ that for a mendicant are “the domain of your fathers” (_pettike visaye_). In both cases they are to be earned, not conferred by lineage.
dn26:4.8	Come now, my dear, proceed in the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch.	“The noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch” (_ariye cakkavattivatte_; this is locative singular). _Ariya_ (“noble”) qualifies “duty” (_vatta_), as it does in the title below, _cakkavattiariyavatta_, rather than “monarch”. Normally _ariya_ is reserved for those who have attained the Buddhist path, but here we might have a rare use of _ariya_ in reference to Indo-Aryan (Vedic) culture. Compare the use of _ariyaka_ for speakers of Indo-Aryan languages at [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.4.10](). However, the commentary says it simply means “flawless” (_niddoso_).
dn26:4.9	If you do so, it’s possible that—on a fifteenth day sabbath, having bathed your head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbath—the heavenly wheel-treasure will appear to you, with a thousand spokes, with rim and hub, complete in every detail.’	NA
dn26:5.0	2.1. The Noble Duty of a Wheel-Turning Monarch	NA
dn26:5.1	‘But sire, what is the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch?’	NA
dn26:5.2	‘Well then, my dear, relying only on principle—honoring, respecting, and venerating principle, having principle as your flag, banner, and authority—provide just protection and security for your court, troops, aristocrats, vassals, brahmins and householders, people of town and country, ascetics and brahmins, beasts and birds.	_Saṁvidahassu_ is second middle imperative.
dn26:5.3	Do not let injustice prevail in the realm.	_Pavattittha_ is aorist middle. _(A)dhammakāra_ (“(in)justice”) doesn’t seem to occur elsewhere in early Pali. It is found in Ja 513 and Ja 498, both times in the context of just rule.
dn26:5.4	Provide money to the penniless in the realm.	“Provide” (_anuppadeti_) is used elsewhere in the sense of paying back a loan ([an3.20:3.5]()), serving honored guests ([sn7.2:2.6]()), paying wages ([dn31:32.2]()), or a king supplying provisions for essential workers to do their job ([dn5:11.8]()). It is thus more about fulfilling a moral obligation of fairness than offering charity.
dn26:5.5	And there are ascetics and brahmins in the realm who refrain from intoxication and negligence, are settled in patience and sweetness, and who tame, calm, and extinguish themselves. From time to time you should go up to them and ask and learn:	Where the phrase “from time to time go to them” (_te kālena kālaṁ upasaṅkamitvā_) occurs elsewhere in the suttas, it is always followed by “ask and question” (_paripucchati paripañhati_). Here, however, the second verb is “you should learn” (_pariggaṇheyyāsi_).
dn26:5.6	“Sirs, what is skillful? What is unskillful? What is blameworthy? What is blameless? What should be cultivated? What should not be cultivated? Doing what leads to my lasting harm and suffering? Doing what leads to my lasting welfare and happiness?”	NA
dn26:5.7	Having heard them, you should reject what is unskillful and undertake and follow what is skillful.	NA
dn26:5.8	This is the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch.’	NA
dn26:5.9.0	2.2. The Wheel-Treasure Appears	NA
dn26:5.10	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the new king to the royal seer. And he proceeded in the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn26:5.11	While he was proceeding in that duty, on a fifteenth day sabbath, he had bathed his head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbath.	NA
dn26:5.12	And the heavenly wheel-treasure appeared to him, with a thousand spokes, with rim and hub, complete in every detail.	NA
dn26:5.13	Seeing this, the king thought,	NA
dn26:5.14	‘I have heard that when the heavenly wheel-treasure appears to a king in this way, he becomes a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn26:5.15	Am I then a wheel-turning monarch?’	NA
dn26:6.1	Then the anointed king, rising from his seat and arranging his robe over one shoulder, took a ceremonial vase in his left hand and besprinkled the wheel-treasure with his right hand, saying,	NA
dn26:6.2	‘Roll forth, O wheel-treasure! Triumph, O wheel-treasure!’	NA
dn26:6.3	Then the wheel-treasure rolled towards the east. And the king followed it together with his army of four divisions. In whatever place the wheel-treasure stood still, there the king came to stay together with his army.	NA
dn26:6.4	And any opposing rulers of the eastern quarter came to the wheel-turning monarch and said,	NA
dn26:6.5	‘Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king, instruct us.’	NA
dn26:6.6	The wheel-turning monarch said,	NA
dn26:6.7	‘Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink liquor. Maintain the current level of taxation.’	NA
dn26:6.8	And so the opposing rulers of the eastern quarter became his vassals.	NA
dn26:7.1	Then the wheel-treasure, having plunged into the eastern ocean and emerged again, rolled towards the south. …	NA
dn26:7.2	Having plunged into the southern ocean and emerged again, it rolled towards the west. …	NA

dn26:7.7	NA	NA
dn26:7.8	NA	NA
dn26:7.9	Having plunged into the western ocean and emerged again, it rolled towards the north, followed by the king together with his army of four divisions.	NA
dn26:7.10	In whatever place the wheel-treasure stood still, there the king came to stay together with his army.	NA
dn26:7.11	And any opposing rulers of the northern quarter came to the wheel-turning monarch and said,	NA
dn26:7.12	‘Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king, instruct us.’	NA
dn26:7.13	The wheel-turning monarch said,	NA
dn26:7.14	‘Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink liquor. Maintain the current level of taxation.’	NA
dn26:7.15	And so the rulers of the northern quarter became his vassals.	NA
dn26:7.16	And then the wheel-treasure, having triumphed over this land surrounded by ocean, returned to the royal capital. There it stood still by the gate to the royal compound at the High Court as if fixed to an axle, illuminating the royal compound.	NA
dn26:8.0	3. On Subsequent Wheel-Turning Monarchs	NA
dn26:8.1	And for a second time,	NA

dn26:8.3	a fourth,	NA
dn26:8.4	a fifth,	NA
dn26:8.5	a sixth,	NA
dn26:8.6	and a seventh time, a wheel-turning monarch was established in exactly the same way. And after many years the seventh wheel-turning monarch went forth, handing the realm over to the crown prince.	NA
dn26:8.7	NA	NA
dn26:8.8	NA	NA

dn26:8.16	NA	NA
dn26:8.17	NA	NA
dn26:8.18	Seven days later the heavenly wheel-treasure vanished.	NA
dn26:9.1	Then a certain man approached the newly anointed aristocrat king and said,	NA
dn26:9.2	‘Please sire, you should know that the heavenly wheel-treasure has vanished.’	NA
dn26:9.3	At that the king was unhappy and experienced unhappiness.	NA
dn26:9.4	But he didn’t go to the royal seer and ask about the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn26:9.5	He just governed the country according to his own ideas.	“Own ideas” is _sa-mata_.
dn26:9.6	So governed, the country’s people did not prosper like before, as they had when former kings proceeded in the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch.	_Pabbanti_ is unusual and probably unique in early Pali. It is related to Sanskrit _parvati_ (“fill”) and is explained by the commentary as _vaḍḍhanti_ (“grow, prosper”). | I assume _janapadā_ (“countries”) is a misspelling of _jānapadā_ (“people of the country”), as _janapada_ is otherwise in singular.
dn26:9.7	Then the ministers and councillors, the finance ministers, military officers, guardsmen, and professional advisers gathered and said to the king,	“Military officers” (_anīkaṭṭhā_) would have been standing officers in the army. According to both the commentary here and Monier-Williams’ Sanskrit Dictionary (_anīkastha_), it includes elephant officers, who would have stood at the head of the army. | “Professional advisers” (_mantassājīvino_) is explained by the commentary as those who make a living from giving wise advice.
dn26:9.8	‘Sire, when governed according to your own ideas, the country’s people do not prosper like before, as they did when former kings proceeded in the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn26:9.9	In your realm are found ministers and councillors, finance ministers, military officers, guardsmen, and professional advisers—both ourselves and others—who remember the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn26:9.10	Please, Your Majesty, ask us about the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn26:9.11	We will answer you.’	NA
dn26:10.0	4. On the Period of Decline	NA
dn26:10.1	So the anointed king asked the assembled ministers and councillors, finance ministers, military officers, guardsmen, and professional advisers about the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn26:10.2	And they answered him.	NA
dn26:10.3	After listening to them, he provided just protection and security. But he did not provide money to the penniless in the realm.	Ensuring citizens have enough to live on is not merely a matter of kindness and common decency, but is crucial to ensure stability and national unity.
dn26:10.4	And so poverty grew widespread.	NA
dn26:10.5	When poverty was widespread, a certain person stole from others, with the intention to commit theft.	The origins of theft are told at [dn27:19.1](). The myth recounted here overlaps, with points of both similarity and difference.
dn26:10.6	They arrested him	NA
dn26:10.7	and presented him to the king, saying,	NA
dn26:10.8	‘Your Majesty, this person stole from others with the intention to commit theft.’	NA
dn26:10.9	The king said to that person,	NA
dn26:10.10	‘Is it really true, worthy man, that you stole from others with the intention to commit theft?’	The king uses the same procedure as the Buddha. When presented with an alleged wrong-doer, the first thing is to ask them whether they did it.
dn26:10.11	‘It’s true, sire.’	NA
dn26:10.12	‘What was the reason?’	NA
dn26:10.13	‘Sire, I can’t survive.’	NA
dn26:10.14	So the king provided some money to that person, saying,	NA
dn26:10.15	‘With this money, worthy man, keep yourself alive, and provide for your mother and father, partners and children. Work for a living, and establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven.’	Simply providing money is not enough, nor is simply expecting that people can just work for what they want. They need something to get started, together with the support and opportunity to build a life for themselves.
dn26:10.16	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied that man.	NA
dn26:11.1	But then another man stole something from others.	NA
dn26:11.2	They arrested him	NA
dn26:11.3	and presented him to the king, saying,	NA
dn26:11.4	‘Your Majesty, this person stole from others.’	NA
dn26:11.5	The king said to that person,	NA
dn26:11.6	‘Is it really true, worthy man, that you stole from others?’	NA
dn26:11.7	‘It’s true, sire.’	NA
dn26:11.8	‘What was the reason?’	NA
dn26:11.9	‘Sire, I can’t survive.’	NA
dn26:11.10	So the king provided some money to that person, saying,	NA
dn26:11.11	‘With this money, worthy man, keep yourself alive, and provide for your mother and father, partners and children. Work for a living, and establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven.’	NA
dn26:11.12	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied that man.	NA
dn26:12.1	People heard about this:	NA
dn26:12.2	‘It seems the king is providing money to anyone who steals from others!’	Sadly, bad faith actors take advantage of kindness.
dn26:12.3	It occurred to them,	NA
dn26:12.4	‘Why don’t we steal from others?’	NA
dn26:12.5	So then another man stole something from others.	NA
dn26:12.6	They arrested him	NA
dn26:12.7	and presented him to the king, saying,	NA
dn26:12.8	‘Your Majesty, this person stole from others.’	NA
dn26:12.9	The king said to that person,	NA
dn26:12.10	‘Is it really true, worthy man, that you stole from others?’	NA
dn26:12.11	‘It’s true, sire.’	NA
dn26:12.12	‘What was the reason?’	NA
dn26:12.13	‘Sire, I can’t survive.’	NA
dn26:12.14	Then the king thought,	NA
dn26:12.15	‘If I provide money to anyone who steals from others, it will only increase the stealing.	NA
dn26:12.16	I’d better make an end of this person, finish him off, and chop off his head.’	While the king’s concern is legitimate, his overreaction escalates the problems.
dn26:12.17	Then he ordered his men,	NA
dn26:12.18	‘Well then, my men, tie this man’s arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope. Shave his head and march him from street to street and square to square to the beating of a harsh drum. Then take him out the south gate and make an end of him, finish him off, and chop off his head.’	NA
dn26:12.19	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ they replied, and did as he commanded.	NA
dn26:13.1	People heard about this:	NA
dn26:13.2	‘It seems the king is chopping the head off anyone who steals from others!’	NA
dn26:13.3	It occurred to them,	NA
dn26:13.4	‘We’d better have sharp swords made. Then when we steal from others, we’ll make an end of them, finish them off, and chop off their heads.’	The violence of the state leads to an armed and violent citizenry.
dn26:13.5	They had sharp swords made. Then they started to make raids on villages, towns, and cities, and to infest the highways.	NA
dn26:13.6	And they chopped the heads off anyone they stole from.	NA
dn26:14.1	And so, mendicants, from not providing money to the penniless, poverty became widespread. When poverty was widespread, theft became widespread. When theft was widespread, swords became widespread. When swords were widespread, killing living creatures became widespread. And for the sentient beings among whom killing was widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined.	NA
dn26:14.2	Those people lived for 80,000 years, but their children lived for 40,000 years.	Today we can see that, even among developed nations, a degraded and violent culture leads to declining lifespans.
dn26:14.3	Among the humans who lived for 40,000 years, a certain person stole something from others.	NA
dn26:14.4	They arrested him	NA
dn26:14.5	and presented him to the king, saying,	NA
dn26:14.6	‘Your Majesty, this person stole from others.’	NA
dn26:14.7	The king said to that person,	NA
dn26:14.8	‘Is it really true, worthy man, that you stole from others?’	NA
dn26:14.9	‘No, sire,’ he said, deliberately lying.	NA
dn26:15.1	And so, mendicants, from not providing money to the penniless, poverty, theft, swords, and killing became widespread. When killing was widespread, lying became widespread. And for the sentient beings among whom lying was widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined.	NA
dn26:15.2	Those people who lived for 40,000 years had children who lived for 20,000 years.	NA
dn26:15.3	Among the humans who lived for 20,000 years, a certain person stole something from others.	NA
dn26:15.4	Someone else reported this to the king,	NA
dn26:15.5	‘Your Majesty, such-and-such person stole from others,’ he said, going behind his back.	NA
dn26:16.1	And so, mendicants, from not providing money to the penniless, poverty, theft, swords, killing, and lying became widespread. When lying was widespread, backbiting became widespread. And for the sentient beings among whom backbiting was widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined.	NA
dn26:16.2	Those people who lived for 20,000 years had children who lived for 10,000 years.	NA
dn26:17.1	Among the humans who lived for 10,000 years, some were beautiful, some were ugly.	NA
dn26:17.2	And the ugly beings, coveting the beautiful ones, committed adultery with the wives of others.	_Paresaṁ dāresu_: both “others” and “wives” are in plural, so polygyny is assumed. Compare _parassa dāresu_ (“the wives of another”) at [sn55.7:6.3](). Note the significance granted to beauty in influencing human society.
dn26:17.3	And so, mendicants, from not providing money to the penniless, poverty, theft, swords, killing, lying, and backbiting became widespread. When backbiting was widespread, sexual misconduct became widespread. And for the sentient beings among whom sexual misconduct was widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined.	NA
dn26:17.4	Those people who lived for 10,000 years had children who lived for 5,000 years.	NA
dn26:17.5	Among the humans who lived for 5,000 years, two things became widespread:	NA
dn26:17.6	harsh speech and talking nonsense.	At this point, the three factors of wrong action—killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct—are present, as are the four factors of wrong speech—lying, backbiting, harsh speech, and nonsensical speech.
dn26:17.7	For the sentient beings among whom these two things were widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined.	NA
dn26:17.8	Those people who lived for 5,000 years had some children who lived for 2,500 years, while others lived for 2,000 years.	NA
dn26:17.9	Among the humans who lived for 2,500 years, desire and ill will became widespread.	NA
dn26:17.10	For the sentient beings among whom desire and ill will were widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined.	NA
dn26:17.11	Those people who lived for 2,500 years had children who lived for 1,000 years.	NA
dn26:17.12	Among the humans who lived for 1,000 years, wrong view became widespread.	This completes the three factors of unskillful thought: desire, ill will, and wrong views (which are a strong form of delusion). Here wrong view probably means moral nihilism.
dn26:17.13	For the sentient beings among whom wrong view was widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined.	NA
dn26:17.14	Those people who lived for 1,000 years had children who lived for five hundred years.	NA
dn26:17.15	Among the humans who lived for five hundred years, three things became widespread:	NA
dn26:17.16	illicit desire, immoral greed, and wrong custom.	These three terms recur in a similar context at [an3.56:2.1](). The commentaries to the two passages give quite different explanations. | “Illicit desire” (_adhammarāgo_) probably refers to any form of desire that is illegal or transgressive, such as incest, rape, or pedophilia. | “Immoral greed” (_visamalobho_) implies excess and imbalance. Both are, however, explained in the commentary to [an3.56:2.1]() as desire for the belongings of others. | _Micchādhammo_ is hard to pin down. Its opposite, _sammā dhammo_ always means “right teaching”. The commentary here explains it as “men with men and women with women”, but this must be rejected as there is no hint anywhere in early Pali (or elsewhere in early Indian culture) that homosexual relations were considered immoral. The commentary to [an3.56:2.1]() explains it as “indulgence in what is reckoned an inappropriate basis” (_avatthupaṭisevanasaṅkhātena_). This implies intercourse with one of the women mentioned at [mn41:8.4](), which includes those who are “protected by principle” (_dhammarakkhitā_). This sense of _dhamma_ is explained at [pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:4.2.16]() as “religion”. Here I think the sense is similar: customs or beliefs that legitimize immorality.
dn26:17.17	For the sentient beings among whom these three things were widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined.	NA
dn26:17.18	Those people who lived for five hundred years had some children who lived for two hundred and fifty years, while others lived for two hundred years.	NA
dn26:17.19	Among the humans who lived for two hundred and fifty years, these things became widespread:	NA
dn26:17.20	lack of due respect for mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, and failure to honor the elders in the family.	NA
dn26:18.1	And so, mendicants, from not providing money to the penniless, all these things became widespread—poverty,	NA
dn26:18.2	theft,	NA
dn26:18.3	swords,	NA
dn26:18.4	killing,	NA
dn26:18.5	lying,	NA
dn26:18.6	backbiting,	NA
dn26:18.7	sexual misconduct,	NA
dn26:18.8	harsh speech and talking nonsense,	NA
dn26:18.9	desire and ill will,	NA
dn26:18.10	wrong view,	NA
dn26:18.11	illicit desire, immoral greed, and wrong custom,	NA
dn26:18.12	and lack of due respect for mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, and failure to honor the elders in the family.	NA
dn26:18.13	For the sentient beings among whom these things were widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined.	NA
dn26:18.14	Those people who lived for two hundred and fifty years had children who lived for a hundred years.	This brings us to the Buddha’s present.
dn26:19.0	5. When People Live for Ten Years	NA
dn26:19.1	There will come a time, mendicants, when these people will have children who live for ten years.	Here the Buddha paints a devastating picture of societal collapse. Life expectancy as low as thirty years has been recorded in some countries in the 20th century.
dn26:19.2	Among the humans who live for ten years, girls will be marriageable at five.	The age of onset of puberty has been dropping globally over the past century, with isolated cases as young as five.
dn26:19.3	The following flavors will disappear:	NA
dn26:19.4	ghee, butter, oil, honey, molasses, and salt.	NA
dn26:19.5	The best kind of food will be finger millet,	“Finger millet” (_kudrūsaka_; Pahari _kodra_, Garhwal _koda_) is a robust secondary grain in Asia and Africa, growing in places rice cannot. Due to its resilience in the face of global heating, 2023 was declared the International Year of Millets by the UN.
dn26:19.6	just as fine rice with meat is the best kind of food today.	The Buddha’s father gave this luxury food to servants and staff ([an3.39:2.3]()).
dn26:19.7	NA	NA
dn26:19.8	The ten ways of doing skillful deeds will totally disappear, and the ten ways of doing unskillful deeds will explode in popularity.	The narrative above traced the gradual disappearance of these ten factors. | _Atibyādippissanti_ is a unique term. At [an7.66:9.2]() a sign of the end of days is the “erupting” (_ādippanti_) of volcanoes, suggesting “explode” for the intensive form here.
dn26:19.9	Those humans will not even have the word ‘skillful’, still less anyone who does what is skillful.	“Skillful” is _kusala_, otherwise translated as “good” or “wholesome”.
dn26:19.10	And anyone who disrespects mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, and fails to honor the elders in the family will be venerated and praised,	NA
dn26:19.11	just as the opposite is venerated and praised today.	NA
dn26:19.12	NA	NA
dn26:20.1	There’ll be no recognition of the status of mother, aunts, or wives and partners of tutors and respected people.	At [an2.9]() = [iti42]() the world is protected from this by conscience and prudence.
dn26:20.2	The world will become dissolute, like goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and dogs and jackals.	For _sambheda_ in the sense of “dissolving, leaking”, see [dn3:1.15.11](), [an5.103:6.4](), [an10.45:4.1](). The commentary here says “mixedness, breaking of boundaries”.
dn26:20.3	They’ll be full of hostility towards each other, with acute ill will, malevolence, and thoughts of murder.	NA
dn26:20.4	Even a mother will feel like this for her child, and the child for its mother,	NA
dn26:20.5	father for child, child for father,	NA
dn26:20.6	brother for sister, and sister for brother.	NA
dn26:20.7	They’ll be just like a deer hunter when he sees a deer—full of hostility, ill will, malevolence, and thoughts of killing.	NA
dn26:20.8	NA	NA
dn26:20.9	NA	NA
dn26:20.10	NA	NA
dn26:20.11	NA	NA
dn26:21.1	Among the humans who live for ten years, there will be an interregnum of swords lasting seven days.	“Interregnum of swords” is _satthantarakappo_. Seven days seems optimistic.
dn26:21.2	During that time they will see each other as beasts.	Dehumanization of the other is an essential precursor to genocide.
dn26:21.3	Sharp swords will appear in their hands,	NA
dn26:21.4	with which they’ll take each other’s life, crying, ‘It’s a beast! It’s a beast!’	NA
dn26:21.5	But then some of those beings will think,	NA
dn26:21.6	‘Let us neither kill nor be killed! Why don’t we hide in thick grass, thick jungle, thick trees, inaccessible riverlands, or rugged mountains and survive on forest roots and fruits?’	“Let us neither kill nor be killed” (_mā ca mayaṁ kañci, mā ca amhe koci_) is an idiomatic phrase, the Golden Rule framed as a negative: “Let us not do unto others nor let others do unto us.” It is explained by the commentary as, “Let us not take even a single person’s life or let them take ours”.
dn26:21.7	So that’s what they do.	NA
dn26:21.8	When those seven days have passed, having emerged from their hiding places and embraced each other, they will come together and cry in one voice,	_Sabhāgāyissanti_ = _sabhāga_ + _āyissanti_ = “will come together”. | _Samassāsissanti_ = _sama_ + _sāsati_ = “cry in one voice”. The latter term is absent from some manuscripts.
dn26:21.9	‘Fantastic, dear foe, you live! Fantastic, dear foe, you live!’	_Diṭṭhā_ is Sanskrit _diṣṭyā_, “fantastic, how fortunate”, per [dn16:2.24.5]() and [ja81:1.4](). | _Sattā_ is nominative singular for _sattar_ (“enemy”), not plural of _satta_ (“being”), which disagrees with both verb and vocative in number.
dn26:21.10.0	6. The Period of Growth	NA
dn26:21.11	Then those beings will think,	NA
dn26:21.12	‘It’s because we undertook unskillful things that we suffered such an extensive loss of our relatives.	NA
dn26:21.13	We’d better do what’s skillful.	NA
dn26:21.14	What skillful thing should we do?	NA
dn26:21.15	Why don’t we refrain from killing living creatures? Having undertaken this skillful thing we’ll live by it.’	The first precept, and the first of the ten ways of skillful action. The Buddhist ethical principles are not just a part of Buddhist teaching, they are essential for the healthy functioning of human society.
dn26:21.16	So that’s what they do.	NA
dn26:21.17	Because of undertaking this skillful thing, their lifespan and beauty will grow.	NA
dn26:21.18	Those people who live for ten years will have children who live for twenty years.	NA
dn26:22.1	Then those beings will think,	NA
dn26:22.2	‘Because of undertaking this skillful thing, our lifespan and beauty are growing.	NA
dn26:22.3	Why don’t we do even more skillful things?	NA
dn26:22.4	What skillful thing should we do?	NA
dn26:22.5	Why don’t we refrain from stealing …	NA
dn26:22.6	sexual misconduct …	NA
dn26:22.7	lying …	NA
dn26:22.8	backbiting …	NA
dn26:22.9	harsh speech …	NA
dn26:22.10	and talking nonsense.	NA
dn26:22.11	Why don’t we give up covetousness …	NA
dn26:22.12	ill will …	NA
dn26:22.13	wrong view …	NA
dn26:22.14	three things:	NA
dn26:22.15	illicit desire, immoral greed, and wrong custom.	NA
dn26:22.16	Why don’t we pay due respect to mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, honoring the elders in our families? Having undertaken this skillful thing we’ll live by it.’	NA
dn26:22.17	So that’s what they do.	NA
dn26:22.18	Because of undertaking this skillful thing, their lifespan and beauty will grow.	NA
dn26:22.19	Those people who live for twenty years will have children who live for forty years.	NA
dn26:22.20	Those people who live for forty years will have children who live for eighty years,	NA
dn26:22.21	then a hundred and sixty years,	NA
dn26:22.22	three hundred and twenty years,	NA
dn26:22.23	six hundred and forty years,	NA

dn26:22.27	20,000 years,	NA
dn26:23.1	40,000 years,	NA
dn26:23.2	and finally 80,000 years.	NA
dn26:23.3	Among the humans who live for 80,000 years, girls will be marriageable at five hundred.	NA
dn26:23.4.0	7. The Time of King Saṅkha	NA
dn26:23.5	Among the humans who live for 80,000 years, there will be just three afflictions: greed, starvation, and old age.	In the legendary past, too, only these three afflictions prevailed ([snp2.7:29.1]()).
dn26:23.6	The Black Plum Tree Land will be successful and prosperous. The villages, towns, and capital cities will be no more than a chicken’s flight apart.	NA
dn26:23.7	And the land will be so full of humans you’d think they were squashed together, like a thicket of rushes or reeds.	NA
dn26:23.8	The royal capital will be Varanasi, renamed Ketumatī. And it will be successful, prosperous, populous, full of humans, with plenty of food.	Ketumatī means “adorned with flags”.
dn26:23.9	There will be 84,000 cities in the Black Plum Tree Land, with the royal capital of Ketumatī foremost.	NA
dn26:24.1	And in the royal capital of Ketumatī a king named Saṅkha will arise, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion will extend to all four sides, he will achieve stability in the country, and possess the seven treasures.	Saṅkha is “conch shell”.
dn26:24.2	He will have the following seven treasures:	NA
dn26:24.3	the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure.	NA
dn26:24.4	He will have over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.	NA
dn26:24.5	After conquering this land girt by sea, he will reign by principle, without rod or sword.	NA
dn26:25.0	8. The Arising of the Buddha Metteyya	NA
dn26:25.1	And the Blessed One named Metteyya will arise in the world—perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed—	This is the only sutta appearance of the future Buddha Metteyya (Sanskrit Maitreya, meaning “one full of love”). He became a prominent figure in later Buddhism.
dn26:25.2	just as I have arisen today.	Throughout, the Buddha is concerned to emphasize that the future Buddha will offer no more or less than his own teaching and practice. He wanted people to practice now, not to establish a cult of a future savior.
dn26:25.3	He will realize with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and make it known to others, just as I do today.	NA
dn26:25.4	He will teach the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he will reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure,	NA
dn26:25.5	just as I do today.	NA
dn26:25.6	He will lead a Saṅgha of many thousand mendicants, just as I lead a Saṅgha of many hundreds today.	The maximum number of monastics cited in the suttas is 1250 at a single gathering.
dn26:26.1	Then King Saṅkha will have the sacrificial post once built by King Mahāpanāda raised up.	This event is found in Bhaddaji’s verses at [thag2.22](), expanded to a full story at Ja 264. The commentary explains _yūpa_ as “palace”, but Bhaddaji’s verses clearly depict a sacrificial post, to which the animal would be tied for slaughter. Such posts are connected with the horse sacrifice, which establishes imperial power. This is but one aspect of the wheel-turning monarch to draw on imagery from the horse sacrifice. Here, of course, no horses are killed.
dn26:26.2	Having reigned, he will abdicate, offering charity to ascetics and brahmins, paupers, vagrants, supplicants, and beggars. Then, having shaved off his hair and beard and dressed in ocher robes, he will go forth from the lay life to homelessness in the Buddha Metteyya’s presence.	_Ajjhāvasati_ in this sutta means “reign” not “dwell” ([dn26:2.5]()).
dn26:26.3	Soon after going forth, living withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, he will realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He will live having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
dn26:27.1	Mendicants, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge.	NA
dn26:27.2	And how does a mendicant do this?	NA
dn26:27.3	It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
dn26:27.4	They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …	NA
dn26:27.5	mind …	NA
dn26:27.6	principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
dn26:27.7	That’s how a mendicant lives as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how they let the teaching be their island and their refuge, with no other refuge.	NA
dn26:28.0	9. On Long Life and Beauty for Mendicants	NA
dn26:28.1	Mendicants, you should roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers.	NA
dn26:28.2	Doing so, you will grow in lifespan, beauty, happiness, wealth, and power.	NA
dn26:28.3	And what is long life for a mendicant?	NA
dn26:28.4	It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort.	NA
dn26:28.5	They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy, and active effort.	NA
dn26:28.6	They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to mental development, and active effort.	NA
dn26:28.7	They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to inquiry, and active effort.	NA
dn26:28.8	Having developed and cultivated these four bases of psychic power they may, if they wish, live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.	NA
dn26:28.9	This is long life for a mendicant.	NA
dn26:28.10	And what is beauty for a mendicant?	NA
dn26:28.11	It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.	NA
dn26:28.12	This is beauty for a mendicant.	NA
dn26:28.13	And what is happiness for a mendicant?	NA
dn26:28.14	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
dn26:28.15	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption …	NA
dn26:28.16	third absorption …	NA
dn26:28.17	fourth absorption.	NA
dn26:28.18	This is happiness for a mendicant.	NA
dn26:28.19	And what is wealth for a mendicant?	NA
dn26:28.20	It’s when a monk meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	NA
dn26:28.21	They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion …	NA
dn26:28.22	rejoicing …	NA
dn26:28.23	equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	NA
dn26:28.24	This is wealth for a mendicant.	NA
dn26:28.25	And what is power for a mendicant?	NA
dn26:28.26	It’s when a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.	NA
dn26:28.27	This is power for a mendicant.	NA
dn26:28.28	Mendicants, I do not see a single power so hard to defeat as the power of Māra.	NA
dn26:28.29	It is due to undertaking skillful qualities that merit grows.”	NA
dn26:28.30	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
dn26:28.31	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA
dn27:0.1	Long Discourses 27	NA
dn27:0.2	What Came First	NA
dn27:1.1	So I have heard.	This sutta is the closest we come to a Buddhist myth of origins. It draws on features of Vedic mythology, while giving its own spin. Related stories may be found in [dn26]() and [snp2.7](). The Buddha describes a natural process of evolution that requires no metaphysical intervention, yet differs strikingly from Darwinian evolution in prioritizing the role of desire over selection.
dn27:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.	After the Jetavana, this was the best-known monastery in Sāvatthī. It was offered by the lady Visākhā, known as Migāra’s mother.
dn27:1.3	Now at that time Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were living on probation among the mendicants in hopes of being ordained.	We met Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja as the students of Pokkharasāti and Tārukkha respectively in [dn13](), at the end of which they went for refuge. Some time later they must have asked for ordination. The commentary says that probation (_paravasati_) was required, not because they had previously gone forth in other sects  (as the naked ascetic Kassapa at [dn8:24.1]() or the wanderer Subhadda at [dn16:5.29.1]()), nor because they had committed an offence, but because they were not yet the required twenty years of age.
dn27:1.4	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came downstairs from the longhouse and was walking mindfully in the open air, beneath the shade of the longhouse.	NA
dn27:2.1	Vāseṭṭha saw him	Here as in [dn13]() Vāseṭṭha takes the lead.
dn27:2.2	and said to Bhāradvāja,	NA
dn27:2.3	“Reverend Bhāradvāja, the Buddha is walking mindfully in the open air, beneath the shade of the longhouse.	NA
dn27:2.4	Come, reverend, let’s go to the Buddha.	NA
dn27:2.5	Hopefully we’ll get to hear a Dhamma talk from him.”	NA
dn27:2.6	“Yes, reverend,” replied Bhāradvāja.	NA
dn27:2.7	So they went to the Buddha, bowed, and walked beside him.	NA
dn27:3.1	Then the Buddha said to Vāseṭṭha,	NA
dn27:3.2	“Vāseṭṭha, you are both brahmins by birth and family, and have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness from a brahmin family. I hope you don’t have to suffer abuse and insults from the brahmins.”	NA
dn27:3.3	“Actually, sir, the brahmins do insult and abuse us with their typical insults to the fullest extent.”	NA
dn27:3.4	“But how do the brahmins insult you?”	NA
dn27:3.5	“Sir, the brahmins say:	NA
dn27:3.6	‘Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior.	This verse is also at [mn84:9.19]() and [mn93:5.4](). | For “best class” (_seṭṭho vaṇṇo_) see _varṇaśreṣṭhaḥ_ at Mahābhārata 1.24.4c.
dn27:3.7	Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark.	Mahābhārata 12.181.5 says that brahmins are the white class, aristocrats red, peasants yellow, and menials black. Underlying this is an assumption of the superiority of the fair-skinned northerners of Indo-Aryan descent over the dark-skinned natives (see [dn3:1.10.3]()).
dn27:3.8	Only brahmins are purified, not others.	I cannot trace this statement to Brahmanical texts, and indeed they have a strong tendency to push back against the idea that only brahmins can find purity.
dn27:3.9	Only brahmins are the Divinity’s true-born sons, born from his mouth, born of the Divinity, created by the Divinity, heirs of the Divinity.	NA
dn27:3.10	You’ve both abandoned the best class to join an inferior class, namely these shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman.	An allusion to the famous Puruṣasūkta (Rig Veda 10.90.12): “His (the cosmic Man’s) mouth became the brahmin, his arms became the ruler (_rājanya_, an alternate name for the _khattiyas_), his thighs became the peasant (_vaiśya_); the menial (_sūdra_) was born from his feet.” This belongs to the latest portion of the Rig Veda, and probably represents a time when the system of four castes was established in the late Vedic period, some centuries before the Buddha. Apart from this, the Rig Veda hardly mentions any of these as castes, let alone all four together.
dn27:3.11	This is not right, it’s not proper!’	NA
dn27:3.12	That’s how the brahmins insult us.”	NA
dn27:4.1	“Actually, Vāseṭṭha, the brahmins are forgetting their tradition when they say this to you.	NA
dn27:4.2	NA	NA
dn27:4.3	NA	NA
dn27:4.4	NA	NA
dn27:4.5	NA	NA
dn27:4.6	For brahmin women are seen menstruating, being pregnant, giving birth, and breast-feeding.	The Buddha gives a rationalist critique of Vedic myth (see also [mn93:5.9]()), the fairness of which is not easy to assess. Within the Brahmanical world, especially the progressive Kosalan brahmins to whom Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja belonged, there had been a shift towards a more nuanced symbolic understanding of such claims. Yet the subtle distinctions of the philosophers rarely influence the more straightforward beliefs of the common practitioner.
dn27:4.7	Yet even though they’re born from a brahmin womb they say:	NA
dn27:4.8	‘Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior.	NA
dn27:4.9	Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark.	NA
dn27:4.10	Only brahmins are purified, not others.	NA
dn27:4.11	Only brahmins are the Divinity’s true-born sons, born from his mouth, born of the Divinity, created by the Divinity, heirs of the Divinity.’	NA
dn27:4.12	They misrepresent the brahmins, speak falsely, and create much wickedness.	NA
dn27:5.0	1. Purification in the Four Classes	NA
dn27:5.1	Vāseṭṭha, there are these four classes:	NA
dn27:5.2	aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials.	NA
dn27:5.3	Some aristocrats kill living creatures, steal, and commit sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, and nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, with wrong view.	NA
dn27:5.4	These things are unskillful, blameworthy, not to be cultivated, unworthy of the noble ones—and are reckoned as such. They are dark deeds with dark results, criticized by sensible people. Such things are exhibited in some aristocrats.	“Dark” (_kaṇha_) and “bright” (or “light”, _sukka_) are redefined in ethical not racial terms.
dn27:5.5	And they are also seen among some brahmins,	NA
dn27:5.6	peasants,	NA
dn27:5.7	and menials.	NA
dn27:5.8	NA	NA
dn27:5.9	NA	NA
dn27:5.10	NA	NA
dn27:6.1	But some aristocrats refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and committing sexual misconduct. They refrain from speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, and nonsensical. And they’re content, kind-hearted, with right view.	NA
dn27:6.2	These things are skillful, blameless, to be cultivated, worthy of the noble ones—and are reckoned as such. They are bright deeds with bright results, praised by sensible people. Such things are exhibited in some aristocrats.	NA
dn27:6.3	And they are also seen among some brahmins,	NA
dn27:6.4	peasants,	NA
dn27:6.5	and menials.	NA
dn27:6.6	NA	NA
dn27:6.7	NA	NA
dn27:6.8	NA	NA
dn27:7.1	Both these things occur like this, mixed up in these four classes—the dark and the bright, that which is praised and that which is criticized by sensible people. Yet of this the brahmins say:	NA
dn27:7.2	‘Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior.	NA
dn27:7.3	Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark.	NA
dn27:7.4	Only brahmins are purified, not others.	NA
dn27:7.5	Only brahmins are the Divinity’s true-born sons, born from his mouth, born of the Divinity, created by the Divinity, heirs of the Divinity.’	NA
dn27:7.6	Sensible people don’t acknowledge this.	NA
dn27:7.7	Why is that?	NA
dn27:7.8	Because any mendicant from these four classes who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—is said to be foremost by virtue of principle, not against principle.	Vedic theory claimed that the caste system was part of the order of nature (_dhamma_) established by Brahmā, and hence to follow the obligations of caste was a duty (also _dhamma_). The Buddha posited a higher “principle” (_dhamma_) beyond caste. The English word “principle” carries the senses of a fundamental law; a code of conduct; a devotion to right living; a source; and an underlying faculty, all of which are aspects of _dhamma_ in this passage.
dn27:7.9	For principle, Vāseṭṭha, is the best thing for people in both this life and the next.	NA
dn27:7.10	And here’s a way to understand how this is so.	NA
dn27:8.1	King Pasenadi of Kosala knows that	NA
dn27:8.2	the ascetic Gotama has gone forth from the neighboring clan of the Sakyans.	NA
dn27:8.3	And the Sakyans are his vassals.	A great king such as Pasenadi ruled his central realm, while outlying districts pledged allegiance to him, enjoying royal protection while ceding some sovereignty. It is the same relationship described for the kingdoms subsumed under the Wheel-Turning Monarch (eg. [dn17:1.9.5]()). The Buddha described his people as natives among the Kosalans at [snp3.1:18.4]().
dn27:8.4	The Sakyans show deference to King Pasenadi by bowing down, rising up, greeting him with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for him.	NA
dn27:8.5	Now, King Pasenadi shows the same kind of deference to the Realized One. But he doesn’t think: ‘The ascetic Gotama is well-born, I am ill-born.	The Mahāsaṅgīti reading _na naṁ_ yields a better sense than the PTS _nanu_, which would make this a question.
dn27:8.6	He is powerful, I am weak.	NA
dn27:8.7	He is handsome, I am ugly.	NA
dn27:8.8	He is influential, I am insignificant.’	NA
dn27:8.9	Rather, in showing such deference to the Realized One he is only honoring, respecting, and venerating principle.	NA
dn27:8.10	And here’s another way to understand how principle is the best thing for people in both this life and the next.	NA
dn27:9.1	Vāseṭṭha, you have different births, names, clans, and families, yet have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness.	Vāseṭṭha was said to be a high family, while Bhāradvāja was low ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:2.1.18]()).
dn27:9.2	When they ask you what you are, you claim to be ascetics who follow the Sakyan.	NA
dn27:9.3	But only when someone has faith in the Realized One—settled, rooted, and planted deep, strong, not to be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world—is it appropriate for them to say:	NA
dn27:9.4	‘I am the Buddha’s true-born son, born from his mouth, born of principle, created by principle, heir to principle.’	The Buddha adapts the Brahmanical rhetoric of birth from the “mouth of Brahmā”. Having criticized them for taking this literally he employs it in a metaphorical sense.
dn27:9.5	Why is that?	NA
dn27:9.6	For these are terms for the Realized One: ‘the embodiment of principle’, and ‘the embodiment of divinity’, and ‘the manifestation of principle’, and ‘the manifestation of divinity’.	“The embodiment of principle” is _dhammakāya_. This is a term of unique occurrence in the suttas, which was seized on in later days to posit a metaphysical theory of a quasi-eternal Buddha. In the suttas, it means that he, having practiced the Dhamma to its fullest, embodies the qualities of the Dhamma to the highest degree.
dn27:10.1	There comes a time when, Vāseṭṭha, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos contracts.	Here begins the story of origins. The Buddha begins his creation myth with the end of the world. For this passage, compare [dn1:2.2.1]().
dn27:10.2	As the cosmos contracts, sentient beings are mostly headed for the realm of streaming radiance.	NA
dn27:10.3	There they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, wandering in midair, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time.	NA
dn27:10.4	There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos expands.	NA
dn27:10.5	As the cosmos expands, sentient beings mostly pass away from that host of radiant deities and come back to this realm.	In the Brahmajālasutta, beings pass from one Brahmā realm to another, but when they come to this world it is as a human. Here we have a different perspective, where beings apparently still like the Brahmā gods exist in the physical realm.
dn27:10.6	Here they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, wandering in midair, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time.	The role of food is critical throughout this narrative. Food is a fundamental sustenance on which all creatures must rely, and the nature of the food reflects the type of creature that eats it. Taittirīya Upaniṣad 2.5.1 says the highest form of self is made of bliss (_ātmā ānandamaya_).
dn27:11.0	2. The Earth’s Nectar Appears	NA
dn27:11.1	But the single mass of water at that time was utterly dark.	Creation myths often begin with a dark, formless world of water, and describe the emergence of divisions and structures of the world. They do not differentiate the physical, biological, ecological, or social, as such distinctions came later. | Aitareya Upaniṣad 1.3.3 says the Divinity “brooded over the waters” and created food.
dn27:11.2	The moon and sun were not found, nor were stars and constellations, day and night, months and fortnights, years and seasons, or male and female. Beings were simply known as ‘beings’.	Throughout, the discourse has a special interest in tracing the origins of language and how different usages came about. Here the term “beings” is presented as a natural choice: they are “beings” because they are alive. Later, words are selected to convey a certain political or moral stance.
dn27:11.3	After a very long period had passed, the earth’s nectar curdled in the water.	The reading and sense of _samatani_ is obscure. I think it is connected with _santānaka_ in the next line, in the sense of “networks” or tendrils appearing in the water as it curdles. The Sanskrit at SF 277 and Mūlasarvāstvāda Vinaya 17 has _saṁmūrcchitaḥ saṁtanoti_ (“curdled tendrils”). | _Rasapathavī_ (“earth’s nectar”) is also obscure. We would expect _pathavīrasa_ (cp. _phalarasa_ “fruit juice”, etc.), which is indeed found at [sn5.9:5.3]() in the sense “nutriments in soil”. Since this reading also appears here in the Sanskrit sources, I assume it is the correct sense. For another example of a _tappurisa_ compound with reversed order, see [dn4:6.46]().
dn27:11.4	It appeared just like the curd on top of hot milk-rice as it cools.	NA
dn27:11.5	NA	NA
dn27:11.6	It was beautiful, fragrant, and delicious, like ghee or butter.	NA
dn27:11.7	And it was as sweet as pure dwarf-bee honey.	_Khuddā_ (literally “small one”) is said to be a species of small bee, also known in Sanskrit as _kṣudrā_. The “dwarf bee” (_apis florea_) fits the bill, as it is a small wild honeybee found in India.
dn27:11.8	NA	NA
dn27:11.9	Now, one of those beings was reckless.	NA
dn27:11.10	Thinking, ‘Oh my, what might this be?’ they tasted the earth’s nectar with their finger.	Ghee and honey were among the finest offerings to the gods. The soma was often described as “honeyed”. Our text is suggesting that the Vedic sacrifices led to the corruption of divinity.
dn27:11.11	They enjoyed it, and craving was born in them.	For _acchadesi_ read _assādesi_ (“enjoyed”) after Mu Kd 17’s _āsvādayati_. The commentary explains _acchadesi_ as “becomes suffused”, so if it is a misreading it is an old one.
dn27:11.12	And other beings, following that being’s example, tasted the earth’s nectar with their fingers.	NA
dn27:11.13	They too enjoyed it, and craving was born in them.	NA
dn27:12.0	3. The Moon and Sun Appear	NA
dn27:12.1	Then those beings started to eat the earth’s nectar, breaking it into lumps.	NA
dn27:12.2	But when they did this	NA
dn27:12.3	their luminosity vanished.	NA
dn27:12.4	And with the vanishing of their luminosity the moon and sun appeared,	NA
dn27:12.5	stars and constellations appeared,	NA
dn27:12.6	days and nights were distinguished,	NA
dn27:12.7	and so were months and fortnights,	NA
dn27:12.8	and years and seasons.	NA
dn27:12.9	So far had the world evolved once more.	NA
dn27:13.1	Then those beings eating the earth’s nectar, with that as their food and nourishment, remained for a very long time.	NA
dn27:13.2	But so long as they ate that earth’s nectar, their bodies became more solid and they diverged in appearance;	NA
dn27:13.3	some beautiful, some ugly.	NA
dn27:13.4	And the beautiful beings looked down on the ugly ones:	At [dn26:17.2]() it is the ugly ones who are at fault for jealousy.
dn27:13.5	‘We’re more beautiful, they’re the ugly ones!’	NA
dn27:13.6	And the vanity of the beautiful ones made the earth’s nectar vanish.	NA
dn27:13.7	They gathered together and bemoaned,	NA
dn27:13.8	NA	NA
dn27:13.9	‘Oh, what a taste! Oh, what a taste!’	NA
dn27:13.10	And even today when people get something tasty they say:	NA
dn27:13.11	‘Oh, what a taste! Oh, what a taste!’	NA
dn27:13.12	They’re just remembering an ancient primordial saying, but they don’t understand what it means.	This is another veiled critique of the Vedic tradition. In [dn13:13.1]() the Buddha told Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja the Vedas were recited by people who did not understand them. This problem was well understood within the tradition of the Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads, which constantly emphasized that they are effective for “one who knows this” (_ya evam veda_).
dn27:14.0	4. Ground-Fungus	NA
dn27:14.1	When the earth’s nectar had vanished, ground-fungus appeared to those beings.	“Fungus” is _pappaṭaka_ (Sanskrit _parpaṭaka_). At [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.5](), Moggallāna suggests that, to alleviate famine, the monks might eat the _pappaṭakojaṁ_ (“fungus-nutrition”) under the earth. Given that it is compared to a mushroom, I think it is the fungal mycelia of a mycorrhizal network. Such fungi spread like tendrils underground, sometimes appearing above the surface, sharing nutrients and information between organisms.
dn27:14.2	It appeared just like a mushroom.	NA
dn27:14.3	It was beautiful, fragrant, and delicious, like ghee or butter.	NA
dn27:14.4	And it was as sweet as pure dwarf-bee honey.	NA
dn27:14.5	Then those beings started to eat the ground-fungus.	NA
dn27:14.6	With that as their food and nourishment, they remained for a very long time.	NA
dn27:14.7	But so long as they ate that ground-fungus, their bodies became more solid and they diverged in appearance;	NA
dn27:14.8	some beautiful, some ugly.	NA
dn27:14.9	And the beautiful beings looked down on the ugly ones:	NA
dn27:14.10	‘We’re more beautiful, they’re the ugly ones!’	NA
dn27:14.11	And the vanity of the beautiful ones made the ground-fungus vanish.	NA
dn27:14.12.0	5. Bursting Pods	NA
dn27:14.13	When the ground-fungus had vanished, bursting pods appeared, like the fruit of the kadam tree.	Readings and meaning of _padālatā_ are uncertain. It has usually been understood that the second element is _latā_ (“creeper”). But this leaves _padā_ unexplained, and the commentary’s gloss of _bhaddālatā_ is unconvincing. It also leaves unexplained the connection with _kalambukā_. This is probably the fruit of the kadam tree—fleshy, yellow-orange capsules with about 8000 seeds that split apart when ripe. I think _padālatā_ is related to _padālana_ in the sense of “bursting”: a seed pod that splits open like a fig or pomegranate.
dn27:14.14	They were beautiful, fragrant, and delicious, like ghee or butter.	NA
dn27:14.15	And they were as sweet as pure dwarf-bee honey.	NA
dn27:15.1	Then those beings started to eat the bursting pods.	NA
dn27:15.2	With that as their food and nourishment, they remained for a very long time.	NA
dn27:15.3	But so long as they ate those bursting pods, their bodies became more solid and they diverged in appearance;	NA
dn27:15.4	some beautiful, some ugly.	NA
dn27:15.5	And the beautiful beings looked down on the ugly ones:	NA
dn27:15.6	‘We’re more beautiful, they’re the ugly ones!’	NA
dn27:15.7	And the vanity of the beautiful ones made the bursting pods vanish.	NA
dn27:15.8	They gathered together and bemoaned,	NA
dn27:15.9	‘Oh, what we’ve lost! Oh, what we’ve lost—those bursting pods!’	NA
dn27:15.10	And even today when people experience suffering they say:	NA
dn27:15.11	‘Oh, what we’ve lost! Oh, what we’ve lost!’	NA
dn27:15.12	They’re just remembering an ancient primordial saying, but they don’t understand what it means.	NA
dn27:16.0	6. Ripe Untilled Rice	NA
dn27:16.1	When the bursting pods had vanished, ripe untilled rice appeared to those beings. It had no powder or husk, pure and fragrant, with only the rice-grain.	NA
dn27:16.2	What they took for supper in the evening, by the morning had grown back and ripened.	NA
dn27:16.3	And what they took for breakfast in the morning had grown back and ripened by the evening,	NA
dn27:16.4	leaving no trace showing.	NA

dn27:16.7	But so long as they ate that ripe untilled rice, their bodies became more solid and they diverged in appearance. And female characteristics appeared on women, while male characteristics appeared on men.	The commentary to [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.6.1]() explains “male characteristics” as “beard and whiskers, etc.” (_massudāṭhikādi_), so this is not just genitals but also secondary sex characteristics.
dn27:16.8	Women spent too much time gazing at men, and men at women.	NA
dn27:16.9	They became lustful, and their bodies burned with fever.	NA
dn27:16.10	Due to this fever they had sex with each other.	NA
dn27:16.11	Those who saw them having sex pelted them with dirt, clods, or cow-dung, saying,	Pali _seṭṭhi_ is explained by the commentary as “ash” (_chārikā_), although this sense does not seem to be attested anywhere else. Mahāvastu has _leṣṭu_ while Mu Kd 17 has _loṣṭa_, both explained as “clod”. Given that it is easier to throw a clod than ash, I think these probably convey the correct sense.
dn27:16.12	‘Get lost, filth! Get lost, filth!	_Nassa_ could mean “die!” or “get lost”. I take the softer meaning, as killing has not yet appeared among these beings. | This behavior looks much like scapegoating rituals, where certain members of the community are deemed to bear the sins of all and are sacrificed to erase the sin. Often the victim was expelled from the community, temporarily or permanently.
dn27:16.13	How on earth can one being do that to another?’	Mob shaming over perceived sexual transgression is the most primitive form of moralizing.
dn27:16.14	And even today people in some countries, when carrying a bride off, pelt her with dirt, clods, or cow-dung.	“Carrying off” (_nibbuyhamānā_) like being swept away by a river. Mu Kd 17 says they throw powder, scent, garlands, and nets, while wishing the bride happiness and well-being.
dn27:16.15	They’re just remembering an ancient primordial saying, but they don’t understand what it means.	NA
dn27:17.0	8. Sexual Intercourse	NA
dn27:17.1	What was deemed as unprincipled at that time, these days is deemed as principled.	“Unprincipled” is _adhamma_. In the past the lovers were spurned, now they are celebrated in marriage.
dn27:17.2	The beings who had sex together weren’t allowed to enter a village or town for one or two months.	NA
dn27:17.3	Ever since they excessively threw themselves into immorality,	NA
dn27:17.4	they started to make buildings to hide their immoral deeds.	The sight of others having sex provokes strong reactions of arousal, jealousy, and disgust, often leading to violence. A culture of sexual modesty regulates these emotions, promoting the growth of larger societal structures.
dn27:17.5	Then one of those beings of idle disposition thought,	NA
dn27:17.6	‘Hey now, why should I be bothered to gather rice in the evening for supper, and in the morning for breakfast?	NA
dn27:17.7	Why don’t I gather rice for supper and breakfast all at once?’	Human society evolves first from greed, second from sexual desire, and third from laziness. The effort to avoid manual labor drives cultural and technological innovation.
dn27:17.8	So that’s what he did.	NA
dn27:17.9	Then one of the other beings approached that being and said,	NA
dn27:17.10	‘Come, good being, we shall go to gather rice.’	NA
dn27:17.11	‘There’s no need, good being! I gathered rice for supper and breakfast all at once.’	NA
dn27:17.12	So that being, following their example, gathered rice for two days all at once, thinking: ‘This seems fine.’	Humans are focused on short term comforts and ignore long term consequences.

dn27:17.15	‘There’s no need, good being! I gathered rice for two days all at once.’	NA
dn27:17.16	So that being, following their example, gathered rice for four days all at once, thinking: ‘This seems fine.’	NA

dn27:17.19	‘There’s no need, good being! I gathered rice for four days all at once.’	NA
dn27:17.20	So that being, following their example, gathered rice for eight days all at once, thinking: ‘This seems fine.’	NA

dn27:17.22	the rice grains became wrapped in powder and husk,	NA
dn27:17.23	it didn’t grow back after reaping, leaving a trace showing, and the rice stood in clumps.	The wild grasses used as grains evolve in adaptation to human needs.

dn27:18.1	Then those beings gathered together and bemoaned,	NA
dn27:18.2	‘Oh, how wicked things have appeared among beings!	The beings tell their story within the story. The oldest myths, such as the Vedas or Gilgamesh, speak of myths that were already ancient for them. And the oldest story of all is the Fall: the death of God, the recession of divinity, how things were better in the old days. The story is a reckoning with the consequences of their actions, yet it is not sufficient for them to change course.

dn27:18.27	We’d better divide up the rice and lay down boundaries.’	Scarcity has arisen because of greed, giving rise to agriculture and land ownership. Up until now, the changes have been driven by individual choice, whereas now they are starting to make agreements among themselves, hoping to mitigate the irresponsibility of individuals.
dn27:18.28	So that’s what they did.	NA
dn27:19.1	Now, one of those beings was reckless. While guarding their own share they took another’s share without it being given, and ate it.	With ownership and inequality come theft.
dn27:19.2	They grabbed the one who had done this and said,	NA
dn27:19.3	‘You have done a bad thing, good being, in that while guarding your own share you took another’s share without it being given, and ate it.	NA
dn27:19.4	Do not do such a thing again.’	NA
dn27:19.5	‘Yes, worthy sirs,’ replied that being.	NA

dn27:20.1	Then those beings gathered together and bemoaned,	NA
dn27:20.2	‘Oh, how wicked things have appeared among beings, in that stealing is found, and blaming and lying and the taking up of rods!	NA
dn27:20.3	Why don’t we elect one being who would rightly accuse those who deserve it, blame those who deserve it, and expel those who deserve it?	“Accuse” is _khīyeyya_. Here the beings are taking charge of their social evolution, deciding among themselves how to manage their society. They are active agents in their own story, not merely passive subjects of evolution. And the primary decision they make is to form a democracy by election (_sammata_). Doing so, they create a two-class system: rulers and subjects.
dn27:20.4	We shall pay them with a share of rice.’	The origin of upper class, white-collar workers who do not have to till the soil. Taxes are not coerced, but voluntarily offered in recognition of services rendered.
dn27:20.5	Then those beings approached the being among them who was most attractive, good-looking, lovely, and illustrious, and said,	The emphasis on appearance reflects a wider acknowledgement of the potency of beauty in shaping human conduct. The Buddha rejected the notion that beauty indicates worth (eg. [sn21.6]()), yet was himself regarded as especially beautiful. Unfair it may be, but beautiful people are listened to.
dn27:20.6	‘Come, good being, rightly accuse those who deserve it, blame those who deserve it, and banish those who deserve it.	The _ehi_ formula echoes the original ordination method ([pli-tv-kd1:6.32.3]()).
dn27:20.7	We shall pay you with a share of rice.’	NA
dn27:20.8	‘Yes, worthy sirs,’ replied that being. They acted accordingly,	NA
dn27:20.9	and were paid with a share of rice.	NA
dn27:21.1	‘Elected by the populace’, Vāseṭṭha, is the meaning of ‘popularly elected’, the first term applied to them.	Note that “popularly elected” (_mahāsammata_) is not a name but a term describing their position. The passage suggests that the prefix _mahā_ does not mean that the elected one is “great”, but that they were elected by the “populace” (_mahājana_). | “Applied to them” (_upanibbattaṁ_) is unique. The Sanskrit texts have _saṁjñodapādi_, “arisen by agreement”. It is distinct from [dn27:11.2]() above, where beings “come to be called” beings (_saṅkhyaṁ gacchanti_). Clearly it cannot mean the first word that appeared. I take it to mean this was a specialized term invented and applied just for them. The commentary says, _na kevalaṁ akkharameva_, “not just a universal term”.
dn27:21.2	‘Lord of the fields’ is the meaning of ‘aristocrat’, the second term applied to them.	“Aristocrat” (_khattiya_; Sanskrit _kṣatriya_) is related to _khatta_ (“authority”, “power”; in eg. Rig Veda 8.25.8 it is an adjective, “powerful”), hence “ruling class”. The sutta, however, relates it to _khetta_, “field”. The two senses possibly stem from the same root _kṣi_ in the sense “owner”, “master” with the “field” being the dominion owned by the chief. In Pali suttas, the primary connotation of the _khattiya_ was of an aristocratic land-owning class, so the connection with “field” is apt. _Khattiyas_ are often said to be a “warrior” caste, but that is not a primary association in the suttas. They are rarely depicted as having anything to do with the military, which had become professionalized by the time of the Buddha. Nonetheless, at [mn96:10.7]() a _khattiya’s_ wealth is said to be the bow and arrow. At [sn3.24](), the Buddha argues that someone from any caste could be as proficient a warrior as someone from the _khattiya_ class.
dn27:21.3	‘They please others with principle’ is the meaning of ‘king’, the third term applied to them.	Modern linguists trace the Proto-Indo-European root of _rāja_ as _*reg_ in the sense “one who leads people in a straight line”, literally “ruler” or “regulator”. The pun _rañjeti_ (“they please”) is meant to emphasize the obligations that a ruler has for their people. As here, _rājā_ and _khattiya_ can have the same meaning, although commonly a _rājā_ is an actual king or chief, while _khattiya_ is the class from which the rulers come.
dn27:21.4	And that, Vāseṭṭha, is how the ancient primordial terms for the circle of aristocrats were created; for those very beings, not others; for those like them, not unlike; by virtue of principle, not against principle.	NA
dn27:21.5	For principle, Vāseṭṭha, is the best thing for people in both this life and the next.	NA
dn27:22.0	11. The Circle of Brahmins	NA
dn27:22.1	Then some of those same beings thought,	NA
dn27:22.2	‘Oh, how wicked things have appeared among beings, in that stealing is found, and blaming and lying and the taking up of rods and banishment!	NA
dn27:22.3	Why don’t we set aside bad, unskillful things?’	Read _bāheyyāma_.
dn27:22.4	So that’s what they did.	NA
dn27:22.5	‘They set aside bad, unskillful things’ is the meaning of ‘brahmin’, the first term applied to them.	_Bāhenti_ (“set aside”) sounds a bit like _brāhmaṇa_. Such puns which don’t quite land are sometimes used to infer a language underlying Pali. _Brāhmaṇa_ is a Sanskrit form, and the colloquial pronunciation may have been closer to _bāhmaṇa_.
dn27:22.6	They built leaf huts in a wilderness region where they meditated pure and bright, without lighting cooking fires or digging the soil. They came down in the morning for breakfast and in the evening for supper to the village, town, or royal capital seeking a meal.	The phrase _jhāyanti vītaṅgārā vītadhūmā pannamusalā_ works at a double level. _Jhāyanti_ is to “meditate” but also is the light of a lamp. _Vītaṅgārā vītadhūmā_ means “without coals and smoke”, implying that they do not light cooking fires; but as meditation it means their minds are free of corruptions. _Pannamusalā_ is “with shovel put down”, i.e.  they do not dig the soil (thus killing the creatures there). Not cooking or digging are also precepts for Buddhist and Jain mendicants.
dn27:22.7	When they had obtained food they continued to meditate in the leaf huts.	NA
dn27:22.8	When people noticed this they said,	NA
dn27:22.9	‘These beings build leaf huts in a wilderness region where they meditate pure and bright, without lighting cooking fires or digging the soil. They come down in the morning for breakfast and in the evening for supper to the village, town, or royal capital seeking a meal.	NA
dn27:22.10	When they have obtained food they continue to meditate in the leaf huts.’	NA
dn27:22.11	‘They meditate’ is the meaning of ‘meditator’, the second term applied to them.	“Meditator” is _jhāyaka_.
dn27:23.1	But some of those beings were unable to keep up with their meditation in the leaf huts in the wilderness. They came down to the neighborhood of a village or town where they dwelt compiling texts.	At [dn3:2.3.11]() the brahmins come down from the forest and set up shrines in the town. Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.10.1–5 compares the forest contemplatives destined for the Brahmā realm with the ritualists who are reborn on the moon before returning to earth. | The “texts” (_ganthe_) were the Vedas.
dn27:23.2	When people noticed this they said,	NA
dn27:23.3	‘These beings were unable to keep up with their meditation in the leaf huts in the wilderness. They came down to the neighborhood of a village or town where they dwelt compiling texts. Now they don’t meditate.’	NA
dn27:23.4	‘Now they don’t meditate’ is the meaning of ‘reciter’, the third term applied to them.	_Ajjhāyaka_ is from _ajjhāyati_ (“to recite”), but here it is punned as the negative of _jhāyaka_ (“meditator”).
dn27:23.5	What was deemed as worse at that time, these days is deemed as best.	NA
dn27:23.6	And that, Vāseṭṭha, is how the ancient primordial terms for the circle of brahmins were created; for those very beings, not others; for those like them, not unlike; by virtue of principle, not against principle.	NA

dn27:24.0	12. The Circle of Peasants	NA
dn27:24.1	Some of those same beings, taking up an active sex life, applied themselves to various jobs.	NA
dn27:24.2	‘Having taken up an active sex life, they apply themselves to various jobs’ is the meaning of ‘peasant’, the term applied to them.	“Various” is _visu_, which loosely echoes _vessa_ (“peasant”). The Sanskrit form is _vaiśya_, from _viś_, to “stay” or “settle” on the land. They were probably originally peasants who over time transitioned into more diverse livelihoods. In [mn96:10.10]() they are said to engage in cattle-rearing and agriculture, and over time trade was added to that.
dn27:24.3	And that, Vāseṭṭha, is how the ancient primordial term for the circle of peasants was created; for those very beings, not others; for those like them, not unlike; by virtue of principle, not against principle.	NA
dn27:24.4	For principle, Vāseṭṭha, is the best thing for people in both this life and the next.	NA

dn27:25.1	The remaining beings lived by venal hunting and minor tasks.	NA
dn27:25.2	‘They live by venal hunting and minor tasks’ is the meaning of ‘menial’, the term applied to them.	_Sudda_ (“menial”) rhymes with _ludda_ (“hunter”) and _khudda_ (“minor”). In [mn96:10.14]() their wealth is said to come from the “scythe and flail”, i.e. seasonal manual labor such as threshing grain ([sn35.248:1.2]()). At [mn96:16.4](), bamboo-workers, chariot-makers, and waste-collectors are cited as other low-class jobs. They may have originated as a distinct branch of Aryan peoples who were assimilated into Vedic culture (Ram Sharan Sharma, *Śudras in Ancient India*, 37).
dn27:25.3	And that, Vāseṭṭha, is how the ancient primordial term for the circle of menials was created; for those very beings, not others; for those like them, not unlike; by virtue of principle, not against principle.	NA

dn27:32.6	That verse was well sung by the Divinity Sanaṅkumāra, not poorly sung; well spoken, not poorly spoken; beneficial, not harmful, and I agree with it.	The Buddha invokes Brahmā to support his contention that his own caste, the _khattiyas_, were superior, a sequence supported by Pañcaviṁśa Brāhmaṇa 13.4.7. Ultimately, however, the Buddha rejected the notion that caste tells us anything intrinsic about the worth of people.

dn28:1.3	Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	NA
dn28:1.4	“Sir, I have such confidence in the Buddha that I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.”	NA

dn28:3.3	the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path.	Also at [dn16:3.50.5](), etc.
dn28:3.4	By these a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.	NA
dn28:3.5	This is unsurpassable when it comes to skillful qualities.	NA
dn28:3.6	The Buddha understands this without exception. There is nothing to be understood beyond this whereby another ascetic or brahmin might be superior in direct knowledge to the Buddha when it comes to skillful qualities.	NA
dn28:4.0	1.2. Describing the Sense Fields	NA
dn28:4.1	And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the description of the sense fields is unsurpassable.	NA
dn28:4.2	There are these six interior and exterior sense fields.	The primary source is the SN 35, the Linked Discourses on the Six Sense Fields.
dn28:4.3	The eye and sights, the ear and sounds, the nose and smells, the tongue and tastes, the body and touches, and the mind and ideas.	NA
dn28:4.4	This is unsurpassable when it comes to describing the sense fields.	NA
dn28:4.5	The Buddha understands this without exception. There is nothing to be understood beyond this whereby another ascetic or brahmin might be superior in direct knowledge to the Buddha when it comes to describing the sense fields.	NA
dn28:5.0	1.3. The Conception of the Embryo	NA
dn28:5.1	And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the conception of the embryo is unsurpassable.	NA
dn28:5.2	There are these four kinds of conception.	NA
dn28:5.3	Firstly, someone is unaware when conceived in their mother’s womb, unaware as they remain there, and unaware as they emerge. This is the first kind of conception.	The Bodhisatta is said elsewhere to be conceived in awareness (eg. [dn16:3.15.1]()), but this systematic analysis is found only here and at [dn33:1.11.176](). It seems like an abrupt shift from central Dhamma topics.
dn28:5.4	Furthermore, someone is aware when conceived in their mother’s womb, but unaware as they remain there, and unaware as they emerge. This is the second kind of conception.	NA
dn28:5.5	Furthermore, someone is aware when conceived in their mother’s womb, aware as they remain there, but unaware as they emerge. This is the third kind of conception.	NA
dn28:5.6	Furthermore, someone is aware when conceived in their mother’s womb, aware as they remain there, and aware as they emerge. This is the fourth kind of conception.	NA
dn28:5.7	This is unsurpassable when it comes to the conception of the embryo.	NA
dn28:6.0	1.4. Ways of Revealing	NA
dn28:6.1	And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the different ways of revealing is unsurpassable.	NA
dn28:6.2	There are these four ways of revealing.	Called “demonstrations of revealing” (_ādesanāpāṭihāriya_) at [an3.60:9.1]().
dn28:6.3	Firstly, someone reveals by means of a sign,	NA
dn28:6.4	‘This is what you’re thinking, such is your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’	NA
dn28:6.5	And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise.	NA
dn28:6.6	This is the first way of revealing.	NA
dn28:6.7	Furthermore, someone reveals after hearing it from humans or non-humans or deities,	NA
dn28:6.8	‘This is what you’re thinking, such is your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’	NA
dn28:6.9	And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise.	NA
dn28:6.10	This is the second way of revealing.	NA
dn28:6.11	Furthermore, someone reveals by hearing the sound of thought spreading as someone thinks and considers,	NA
dn28:6.12	‘This is what you’re thinking, such is your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’	NA
dn28:6.13	And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise.	NA
dn28:6.14	This is the third way of revealing.	NA
dn28:6.15	Furthermore, someone comprehends the mind of a person who has attained the immersion that’s free of placing the mind and keeping it connected. They understand,	NA
dn28:6.16	‘Judging by the way this person’s intentions are directed, immediately after this mind state, they’ll think this thought.’	NA
dn28:6.17	And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise.	NA
dn28:6.18	This is the fourth way of revealing.	NA
dn28:6.19	This is unsurpassable when it comes to the ways of revealing.	NA
dn28:7.0	1.5. Attainments of Vision	NA
dn28:7.1	And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the attainments of vision is unsurpassable.	NA
dn28:7.2	There are these four attainments of vision.	NA
dn28:7.3	Firstly, some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they examine their own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth.	Meditation is described in this way only in [mn136:9.1]() and [dn1:1.31.1]() where, as here, it is pursued by an “ascetic or brahmin”, who in those cases is not Buddhist. Here, however, it sounds like Sāriputta is talking about a Buddhist practice. The _asubha_ contemplation of the parts of the body is described in several places in the canon (eg. [dn22:5.1]()), but never exactly like this.
dn28:7.4	‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’	NA
dn28:7.5	This is the first attainment of vision.	NA
dn28:7.6	Furthermore, some ascetic or brahmin experiences that immersion and examines their own body.	NA
dn28:7.7	‘In this body there is head hair … urine.’	NA
dn28:7.8	Going further, they examine a person’s bones with skin, flesh, and blood.	The remaining practices are unique to this passage. This is perhaps related to the contemplation of death, as it seems to imply looking at another person’s body rather than one’s own.
dn28:7.9	This is the second attainment of vision.	NA
dn28:7.10	Furthermore, some ascetic or brahmin experiences that immersion and examines their own body.	NA
dn28:7.11	‘In this body there is head hair … urine.’	NA
dn28:7.12	Going further, they examine a person’s bones with skin, flesh, and blood.	NA
dn28:7.13	And they understand of a person that their stream of consciousness is consistent on both sides: established in both this world and the next.	This is a unique description of the process of rebirth. Consciousness is a “stream” in that it flows and moves, ever-changing, and is not a static self-same entity. To be “established” (_patiṭṭhita_) is to be attached because of craving. | The phrase “consistent on both sides” (_ubhayato abbocchinnaṁ_) is unique. _Ubhayato_ is used of “both ends” of a pole [ja533:37.4](). I think the sense is that one’s consciousness is consistent with regards to this world and the next. If one is attached to this world, one will be attached to the next, and vice versa in the next section.
dn28:7.14	This is the third attainment of vision.	NA
dn28:7.15	Furthermore, some ascetic or brahmin experiences that immersion and examines their own body.	NA
dn28:7.16	‘In this body there is head hair … urine.’	NA
dn28:7.17	Going further, they examine a person’s bones with skin, flesh, and blood.	NA
dn28:7.18	They understand of a person that their stream of consciousness is consistent on both sides: not established in either this world or the next.	NA
dn28:7.19	This is the fourth attainment of vision.	NA
dn28:7.20	This is unsurpassable when it comes to attainments of vision.	NA
dn28:8.0	1.6. Descriptions of Persons	NA
dn28:8.1	And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the description of persons is unsurpassable.	NA
dn28:8.2	There are these seven persons.	NA
dn28:8.3	One freed both ways, one freed by wisdom, a direct witness, one attained to view, one freed by faith, a follower of teachings, a follower by faith.	As at [an7.14:1.3]().
dn28:8.4	This is unsurpassable when it comes to the description of persons.	NA
dn28:9.0	1.7. Kinds of Striving	NA
dn28:9.1	And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the kinds of striving is unsurpassable.	NA
dn28:9.2	There are these seven awakening factors: the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity.	Normally we would expect the four kinds of right striving here. This is the only place the seven awakening factors are described in this way.
dn28:9.3	This is unsurpassable when it comes to the kinds of striving.	NA
dn28:10.0	1.8. Ways of Practice	NA
dn28:10.1	And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the ways of practice is unsurpassable.	As at [an4.166]().
dn28:10.2	Painful practice with slow insight,	NA
dn28:10.3	painful practice with swift insight,	NA
dn28:10.4	pleasant practice with slow insight, and	NA
dn28:10.5	pleasant practice with swift insight.	NA
dn28:10.6	Of these, the painful practice with slow insight is said to be inferior both ways: because it’s painful and because it’s slow.	NA
dn28:10.7	The painful practice with swift insight is said to be inferior because it’s painful.	NA
dn28:10.8	The pleasant practice with slow insight is said to be inferior because it’s slow.	NA
dn28:10.9	But the pleasant practice with swift insight is said to be superior both ways: because it’s pleasant and because it’s swift.	NA
dn28:10.10	This is unsurpassable when it comes to the ways of practice.	NA
dn28:11.0	1.9. Behavior in Speech	NA
dn28:11.1	And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches behavior in speech is unsurpassable.	NA
dn28:11.2	It’s when someone doesn’t use speech that’s connected with lying, or divisive, or backbiting, or aggressively trying to win.	These descriptions are unique. | _Vebhūtiya_ is only used here and DN 30, where the context shows it is a synonym for _pesuṇiya_.
dn28:11.3	They speak only wise counsel, valuable and timely.	NA
dn28:11.4	This is unsurpassable when it comes to behavior in speech.	NA
dn28:12.1	And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches a person’s ethical behavior is unsurpassable.	The Mahāsaṅgīti omits a heading for this section.
dn28:12.2	It’s when someone is honest and faithful. They don’t use deceit, flattery, hinting, or belittling, and they don’t use material things to chase after other material things. They guard the sense doors and eat in moderation. They’re fair, dedicated to wakefulness, tireless, energetic, and meditative. They have good memory, eloquence, range, retention, and thoughtfulness. They’re not greedy for sensual pleasures. They are mindful and alert.	The sequence from “memory” (_satimā_) to “retention” (_dhitimā_) is related to the good qualities of Ānanda ([an1.220:1.1]()), and pertain to textual fluency. _Satimā_ here is “memory”, not “mindfulness”, which is _sato_ at the end.
dn28:12.3	This is unsurpassable when it comes to a person’s ethical behavior.	NA
dn28:13.0	1.10. Responsiveness to Instruction	NA
dn28:13.1	And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the different degrees of responsiveness to instruction is unsurpassable.	NA
dn28:13.2	There are these four degrees of responsiveness to instruction.	We don’t find this exact passage elsewhere, but it is similar to [an10.46](). When the Buddha speaks of future consequences it is conditional. He is not a fortune-teller, but he understands the results of the practice.
dn28:13.3	The Buddha knows by rationally applying the mind to another individual:	_Paccattaṁ yonisomanasikārā_ occurs at [sn46.8:2.1]() and [mn50:3.1](), where it means “investigate inside oneself”. Here it is applied to another.
dn28:13.4	‘By practicing as instructed this individual will, with the ending of three fetters, become a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.’	NA
dn28:13.5	The Buddha knows by rationally applying the mind to another individual:	NA
dn28:13.6	‘By practicing as instructed this individual will, with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, become a once-returner. They will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.’	NA
dn28:13.7	The Buddha knows by rationally applying the mind to another individual:	NA
dn28:13.8	‘By practicing as instructed this individual will, with the ending of the five lower fetters, be reborn spontaneously. They will be extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.’	NA
dn28:13.9	The Buddha knows by rationally applying the mind to another individual:	NA
dn28:13.10	‘By practicing as instructed this individual will realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’	NA
dn28:13.11	This is unsurpassable when it comes to the different degrees of responsiveness to instruction.	NA
dn28:14.0	1.11. The Knowledge and Freedom of Others	NA
dn28:14.1	And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the knowledge and freedom of other individuals is unsurpassable.	Another unique passage, similar to [mn68:12.4]().
dn28:14.2	The Buddha knows by rationally applying the mind to another individual:	NA
dn28:14.3	‘With the ending of three fetters this individual will become a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.’	NA
dn28:14.4	The Buddha knows by rationally applying the mind to another individual:	NA
dn28:14.5	‘With the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, this individual will become a once-returner. They will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.’	NA
dn28:14.6	The Buddha knows by rationally applying the mind to another individual:	NA
dn28:14.7	‘With the ending of the five lower fetters, this individual will be reborn spontaneously. They will be extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.’	NA
dn28:14.8	The Buddha knows by rationally applying the mind to another individual:	NA
dn28:14.9	‘This individual will realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’	NA
dn28:14.10	This is unsurpassable when it comes to the knowledge and freedom of other individuals.	NA
dn28:15.0	1.12. Eternalism	NA
dn28:15.1	And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches eternalist doctrines is unsurpassable.	NA
dn28:15.2	There are these three eternalist doctrines.	Compare the four kinds of eternalism at [dn1:3.1.1](). The theories based on rationality are omitted.
dn28:15.3	Firstly, some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect many hundreds of thousands of past lives,	NA
dn28:15.4	with features and details.	NA
dn28:15.5	They say,	NA
dn28:15.6	‘I know that in the past the cosmos expanded or contracted.	NA
dn28:15.7	I don’t know whether in the future the cosmos will expand or contract.	According to the PTS edition, the Sinhala-script manuscripts read _na jānāmi_ (“don”t know”) against the Mahāsaṅgīti _jānāmi_. | The means of knowledge given here is solely based on the recollection of past lives, which agrees with the Brahmajālasutta that these are views based on the past. It seems the sectarian here is admitting the limits of their experiential knowledge, but nonetheless inferring eternalism in both past and future.
dn28:15.8	The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. They remain the same for all eternity, while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and rearise.’	NA
dn28:15.9	This is the first eternalist doctrine.	NA
dn28:15.10	Furthermore, some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect their past lives for as many as ten eons of the expansion and contraction of the cosmos,	Some manuscripts read “twenty” here.
dn28:15.11	with features and details.	NA
dn28:15.12	They say,	NA
dn28:15.13	‘I know that in the past the cosmos expanded or contracted.	NA
dn28:15.14	I don’t know whether in the future the cosmos will expand or contract.	NA
dn28:15.15	The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar.	NA
dn28:15.16	They remain the same for all eternity, while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and rearise.’	NA
dn28:15.17	This is the second eternalist doctrine.	NA
dn28:15.18	Furthermore, some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect their past lives for as many as forty eons of the expansion and contraction of the cosmos,	NA
dn28:15.19	with features and details.	NA
dn28:15.20	They say,	NA
dn28:15.21	‘I know that in the past the cosmos expanded or contracted.	NA
dn28:15.22	I don’t know whether in the future the cosmos will expand or contract.	NA
dn28:15.23	The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar.	NA
dn28:15.24	They remain the same for all eternity, while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and rearise.’	NA
dn28:15.25	This is the third eternalist doctrine.	NA
dn28:15.26	This is unsurpassable when it comes to eternalist doctrines.	NA
dn28:16.0	1.13. Recollecting Past Lives	NA
dn28:16.1	And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the knowledge of recollecting past lives is unsurpassable.	NA
dn28:16.2	It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect their many kinds of past lives.	NA
dn28:16.3	That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember:	NA
dn28:16.4	‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	NA
dn28:16.5	Sir, there are gods whose lifespan cannot be reckoned or calculated.	NA
dn28:16.6	Still, no matter what incarnation they have previously been reborn in—whether formed or formless or percipient or non-percipient or neither percipient nor non-percipient—	NA
dn28:16.7	they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	NA
dn28:16.8	This is unsurpassable when it comes to the knowledge of recollecting past lives.	NA
dn28:17.0	1.14. Death and Rebirth	NA
dn28:17.1	And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings is unsurpassable.	NA
dn28:17.2	It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—	NA
dn28:17.3	inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	NA
dn28:17.4	This is unsurpassable when it comes to the knowledge of death and rebirth.	NA
dn28:18.0	1.15. Psychic Powers	NA
dn28:18.1	And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches psychic power is unsurpassable.	NA
dn28:18.2	There are these two kinds of psychic power.	NA
dn28:18.3	There are psychic powers that are accompanied by defilements and attachments, and are said to be ignoble.	“Accompanied by defilements and attachments” (_sāsavā saupadhikā_) is unique, but compare _sāsavā puññabhāgiyā upadhivepakkā_ at [mn117:6.3]() and _sāsavaṁ upādāniyaṁ_ at [sn22.48:2.2]().
dn28:18.4	And there are psychic powers that are free of defilements and attachments, and are said to be noble.	NA
dn28:18.5	What are the psychic powers that are accompanied by defilements and attachments, and are said to be ignoble?	NA
dn28:18.6	It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they wield the many kinds of psychic power:	NA
dn28:18.7	multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the realm of divinity.	NA
dn28:18.8	These are the psychic powers that are accompanied by defilements and attachments, and are said to be ignoble.	NA
dn28:18.9	But what are the psychic powers that are free of defilements and attachments, and are said to be noble?	NA
dn28:18.10	It’s when, if a mendicant wishes: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive,’ that’s what they do.	Also at [mn152:11-15.3](), [an5.144:2.2](), [sn52.1:4.2](), [sn46.54:12.5](), [sn54.8:7.1]().
dn28:18.11	If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.	NA
dn28:18.12	If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.	NA
dn28:18.13	If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive,’ that’s what they do.	NA
dn28:18.14	If they wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.	NA
dn28:18.15	These are the psychic powers that are free of defilements and attachments, and are said to be noble.	NA
dn28:18.16	This is unsurpassable when it comes to psychic powers.	NA
dn28:18.17	The Buddha understands this without exception. There is nothing to be understood beyond this whereby another ascetic or brahmin might be superior in direct knowledge to the Buddha when it comes to psychic powers.	NA
dn28:19.0	1.16. The Four Absorptions	NA
dn28:19.1	The Buddha has achieved what should be achieved by a faithful gentleman by being energetic and strong, by human strength, energy, vigor, and exertion.	NA
dn28:19.2	The Buddha doesn’t indulge in sensual pleasures, which are low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And he doesn’t indulge in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless.	From the first sermon at [sn56.11:2.3]().
dn28:19.3	He gets the four absorptions—blissful meditations in this life that belong to the higher mind—when he wants, without trouble or difficulty.	Here the jhānas stand in the place of the path as a whole. In [dn29:24.5]() the Buddha uses a similar framing.
dn28:19.4.0	1.17. On Being Questioned	NA
dn28:19.5	Sir, if they were to ask me,	NA
dn28:19.6	‘Reverend Sāriputta, is there any other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening?’ I would tell them ‘No.’	NA
dn28:19.7	NA	NA
dn28:19.8	NA	NA
dn28:19.9	But if they were to ask me,	NA
dn28:19.10	‘Reverend Sāriputta, is there any other ascetic or brahmin—whether past or future—whose direct knowledge is equal to the Buddha when it comes to awakening?’ I would tell them ‘Yes.’	NA
dn28:19.11	NA	NA
dn28:19.12	But if they were to ask: ‘Reverend Sāriputta, is there any other ascetic or brahmin at present whose direct knowledge is equal to the Buddha when it comes to awakening?’ I would tell them ‘No.’	NA
dn28:19.13	But if they were to ask me,	NA
dn28:19.14	‘But why does Venerable Sāriputta grant this in respect of some but not others?’ I would answer them like this,	Here _abhi-_ in _abbhanujānāti_ conveys the sense “grant in respect of one”.
dn28:19.15	‘Reverends, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:	NA
dn28:19.16	“The perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas of the past were equal in awakening to myself.”	Here Sāriputta is quoting the Buddha, yet this phrase is not found in the Pali Canon.
dn28:19.17	And I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:	NA
dn28:19.18	“The perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas of the future will be equal in awakening to myself.”	NA
dn28:19.19	And I have also heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:	NA
dn28:19.20	“It’s impossible for two perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas to arise in the same solar system at the same time.”’	At [mn115:14.1]().
dn28:19.21	Answering this way, I trust that I repeated what the Buddha has said, and didn’t misrepresent him with an untruth. I trust my explanation was in line with the teaching, and that there are no legitimate grounds for rebuttal or criticism.”	NA
dn28:19.22	“Indeed, Sāriputta, in answering this way you repeat what I’ve said, and don’t misrepresent me with an untruth. Your explanation is in line with the teaching, and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuttal or criticism.”	NA
dn28:20.0	2. Incredible and Amazing	NA
dn28:20.1	When he had spoken, Venerable Udāyī said to the Buddha,	There are several individuals called Udāyī.
dn28:20.2	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! The Realized One has so few wishes, such contentment, such self-effacement!	NA
dn28:20.3	For even though the Realized One has such power and might, he will not make a display of himself.	NA
dn28:20.4	If the wanderers following other religions were to see even a single one of these qualities in themselves they’d carry around a banner to that effect.	NA
dn28:20.5	It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! The Realized One has so few wishes, such contentment, such self-effacement!	NA
dn28:20.6	For even though the Realized One has such power and might, he will not make a display of himself.”	NA
dn28:20.7	“See, Udāyī, how the Realized One has so few wishes, such contentment, such self-effacement.	NA
dn28:20.8	For even though the Realized One has such power and might, he will not make a display of himself.	NA
dn28:20.9	If the wanderers following other religions were to see even a single one of these qualities in themselves they’d carry around a banner to that effect.	NA
dn28:20.10	See, Udāyī, how the Realized One has so few wishes, such contentment, such self-effacement.	NA
dn28:20.11	For even though the Realized One has such power and might, he will not make a display of himself.”	NA
dn28:21.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta,	NA
dn28:21.2	“So Sāriputta, you should frequently speak this exposition of the teaching to the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.	NA
dn28:21.3	Though there will be some silly people who have doubt or uncertainty regarding the Realized One, when they hear this exposition of the teaching they’ll give up that doubt or uncertainty.”	NA
dn28:21.4	That’s how Venerable Sāriputta declared his confidence in the Buddha’s presence.	NA
dn28:21.5	And that’s why the name of this discussion is “Inspiring Confidence”.	NA
dn29:0.1	Long Discourses 29	NA
dn29:0.2	An Impressive Discourse	NA
dn29:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
dn29:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans in a stilt longhouse in a mango grove belonging to those Sakyans named Vedhaññā.	The Vedhaññās are not mentioned elsewhere; their name means “Marksmen”.
dn29:1.3	Now at that time the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan had recently passed away at Pāvā.	When this event is mentioned at [mn104:2.1](), the Buddha is also in the Sakyan lands, but near the village of Sāma. Both texts tell the story of Cunda conveying the news via Ānanda at Sāma, which was presumably near the Vedhaññā’s mango grove. It does seem strange that two distinct discourses are recorded from the same prompt, but then, why shouldn’t the Buddha give more than one teaching on such an important topic? At [dn33:1.6.1]() the Buddha is at Pāvā in the Mallian lands, and the discourse is spoken by Sāriputta there. Given the evident lateness of DN 33, this is a less convincing framework. A parallel to MN 104 (MA 196 at T i 752c12) says he was in the Vajjian lands at the time; both Sakya and Vajji border on Mallā. Jain tradition holds Mahāvīra died after the Buddha, and it was at a different Pāvā in Magadha near Nāḷandā, perhaps the place known in Pali as Pāvārika’s mango grove ([dn11:1.2]()). The earliest Jain source for Mahāvīra’s death, the Kalpasutra, is, however, much later than the Buddhist sources, and does not say where Pāvā is. But it does say the events were commemorated by the rulers of Kāsī and Kosala, and the Mallians and the Licchavīs. The absence of Magadha and the presence of Malla sit better with the location of Pāvā in Malla rather than Magadha.
dn29:1.4	With his passing the Jain ascetics split, dividing into two factions, arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words:	While this description of the Jains might seem like sheer sectarian calumny, it is a fact that the Jain tradition is split into two sects, the “sky-clad” Digambara, whose male ascetics went naked, and the “white-clad” Śvetāmbara who wear an unstitched cloth. Jain tradition holds that the split occurred about a century later, in the reign of Candragupta Maurya.
dn29:1.5	“You don’t understand this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training? You’re practicing wrong. I’m practicing right. I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!”	NA
dn29:1.6	You’d think there was nothing but slaughter going on among the Jain ascetics.	A slight on the movement whose signature virtue was non-violence.
dn29:1.7	And the Jain Ñātika’s white-clothed lay disciples were disillusioned, dismayed, and disappointed in the Jain ascetics. They were equally disappointed with a teaching and training so poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha, with broken monument and without a refuge.	“With broken monument” (_bhinnathupe_) is used only in this context. When a great teacher or leader died, a “monument” was built to keep their memory alive. The breaking of a monument—whether physical or symbolic—was, in a way, truly killing them.
dn29:2.1	And then, after completing the rainy season residence near Pāvā, the novice Cunda went to see Venerable Ānanda at Sāma village. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	Cunda took the time to complete his rains residence before conveying the news, reminding us of the speed with which news traveled in those days—slowly. | Apart from the events described here, we hear of Sāma only once ([an6.21]()). The topic there is the decline of the Saṅgha, hinting at a connection with these events.

This harsh critique is repeated at [dn33:1.7.4](), but not at [mn104:5.1](), where the Buddha’s response focuses on his own community.

dn29:4.8	In such a case the teacher and the teaching are to blame, but the disciple deserves praise.	The Dhamma is primary, not the teacher. This is applied to Buddhism as well; for example, a student is expected to help a mentor who is falling away from Dhamma ([pli-tv-kd1:25.20.1]()).

dn29:16.8	Uddaka son of Rāma used to say:	One of the Brahmanical sages under whom the Bodhisatta practiced before awakening ([mn26:16.1]()).

dn29:16.11	You can see the blade of a well-sharpened razor, but not the edge.	Sharp razors were known even in Vedic times (Rig Veda 8.4.16).
dn29:16.12	Thus it is said:	NA
dn29:16.13	‘Seeing, one does not see.’	This is a distorted reference to Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.4.7. There, the Self is said to be hidden in a body like a razor in its case. People do not see it (_taṁ na paśyanti_), for they only see the partial and incomplete functions of the Self, such as breathing, speaking, and so on. Seeing only the aspects, they do not see that each aspect is an expression of the one whole. This confirms that Uddaka was a Brahmanical teacher who was familiar with this passage. Similar phrases, but without the razor simile, are found at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.23 and Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.12.1.
dn29:16.14	But that saying of Uddaka’s is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless, as it’s only about a razor.	NA

dn29:17.1	So, Cunda, you should all come together and recite in concert, without disputing, those things I have taught you from my direct knowledge, comparing meaning with meaning and phrasing with phrasing, so that this spiritual path may last for a long time. That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.	“Recite in concert” is _saṅgīti_. Reciting together affirms the mutual teaching and ensures the correctness of the text. The implication is that the entire Buddhist community participates, but in the _saṅgīti_ after the Buddha’s death there were only monks.
dn29:17.2	And what are those things I have taught from my direct knowledge?	NA
dn29:17.3	They are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path.

dn29:18.4	You should neither approve nor dismiss them, but say,	The “meaning” is the _attha_. Here we see the source of the _atthakathā_, which we translate as “commentaries”, but which are literally “discussions on the meaning”. Such discussions are undertaken through a civil and polite inquiry.
dn29:18.5	‘Reverend, if this is the meaning, the phrasing may either be this or that: which is more fitting? And if this is the phrasing, the meaning may be either this or that: which is more fitting?’	Meaning and phrasing are interdependent, so care must be taken with both. Often it happens that when the phrasing slips, a new and unwarranted meaning is imputed.

dn29:18.7	‘This phrasing fits the meaning better than that. And this meaning fits the phrasing better than that.’	NA

dn29:21.6	‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate	NA
dn29:21.7	to see a venerable such as yourself, so well-versed in the meaning and the phrasing, as one of our spiritual companions!’	NA
dn29:22.0	8. The Reasons for Allowing Requisites	NA
dn29:22.1	Cunda, I do not teach you solely for restraining defilements that affect this life.	NA
dn29:22.2	Nor do I teach solely for protecting against defilements that affect lives to come.	NA
dn29:22.3	I teach both for restraining defilements that affect this life and	NA
dn29:22.4	protecting against defilements that affect lives to come.	NA
dn29:22.5	And that’s why I have allowed robes for you that suffice	These are the four basic requisites for monastics, said to overcome defilements by usage ([an6.58:4.1](), [mn2:13.1]()).
dn29:22.6	only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; and for covering up the private parts.	NA
dn29:22.7	I have allowed almsfood for you that suffices	NA
dn29:22.8	only to sustain this body, avoid harm, and support spiritual practice; so that you will put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and will keep on living blamelessly and at ease.	NA
dn29:22.9	I have allowed lodgings for you that suffice	NA
dn29:22.10	only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; to shelter from harsh weather and to enjoy retreat.	NA
dn29:22.11	I have allowed medicines and supplies for the sick for you that suffice	NA
dn29:22.12	only for the sake of warding off the pains of illness and to promote good health.	NA
dn29:23.0	9. Indulgence in Pleasure	NA
dn29:23.1	It’s possible that wanderers of other religions might say,	NA
dn29:23.2	‘The ascetics who follow the Sakyan live indulging in pleasure.’	This repurposes the phrase used right at the beginning of the Buddha’s first teaching, the Dhammacakkappavattasutta ([sn56.11:2.3]()). There he was persuading hard-bitten ascetics that he did not indulge in sensual pleasures. While the affiliation of those five ascetics is not stated explicitly, clearly their practices were similar to the Jains. And given the context, no doubt the Buddha has the Jains in mind here.
dn29:23.3	You should say to them,	NA
dn29:23.4	‘What is that indulgence in pleasure?	NA
dn29:23.5	For there are many different kinds of indulgence in pleasure.’	NA
dn29:23.6	These four kinds of indulgence in pleasure, Cunda, are low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.	NA
dn29:23.7	What four?	NA
dn29:23.8	It’s when some fool makes themselves happy and pleased by killing living creatures.	NA
dn29:23.9	This is the first kind of indulgence in pleasure.	NA
dn29:23.10	Furthermore, someone makes themselves happy and pleased by theft.	NA
dn29:23.11	This is the second kind of indulgence in pleasure.	NA
dn29:23.12	Furthermore, someone makes themselves happy and pleased by lying.	NA
dn29:23.13	This is the third kind of indulgence in pleasure.	NA
dn29:23.14	Furthermore, someone amuses themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	NA
dn29:23.15	This is the fourth kind of indulgence in pleasure.	NA
dn29:23.16	These are the four kinds of indulgence in pleasure that are low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.	NA
dn29:24.1	It’s possible that wanderers of other religions might say,	NA
dn29:24.2	‘The ascetics who follow the Sakyan live indulging in pleasure in these four ways.’	NA
dn29:24.3	They should be told, ‘Not so!’	NA
dn29:24.4	It isn’t right to say that about you; it misrepresents you with an untruth.	NA
dn29:24.5	Cunda, these four kinds of indulgence in pleasure lead solely to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.	Again echoing the first sermon ([sn56.11:3.1]()), here the Buddha places the _jhānas_ where, in the Dhammacakkappavattasutta, he put the middle way. He uses a similar strategy at [dn28:19.2]().
dn29:24.6	What four?	NA
dn29:24.7	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
dn29:24.8	This is the first kind of indulgence in pleasure.	NA
dn29:24.9	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption. It has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	NA
dn29:24.10	This is the second kind of indulgence in pleasure.	NA
dn29:24.11	Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption. They meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	NA
dn29:24.12	This is the third kind of indulgence in pleasure.	NA
dn29:24.13	Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption. It is without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	NA
dn29:24.14	This is the fourth kind of indulgence in pleasure.	NA
dn29:24.15	These are the four kinds of indulgence in pleasure which lead solely to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.	NA
dn29:24.16	It’s possible that wanderers of other religions might say,	NA
dn29:24.17	‘The ascetics who follow the Sakyan live indulging in pleasure in these four ways.’	NA
dn29:24.18	They should be told, ‘Exactly so!’	NA
dn29:24.19	It’s right to say that about you; it doesn’t misrepresent you with an untruth.	NA
dn29:25.0	10. The Benefits of Indulgence in Pleasure	NA
dn29:25.1	It’s possible that wanderers of other religions might say,	NA
dn29:25.2	‘How many fruits and benefits may be expected by those who live indulging in pleasure in these four ways?’	NA
dn29:25.3	You should say to them,	NA
dn29:25.4	‘Four benefits may be expected by those who live indulging in pleasure in these four ways.	NA
dn29:25.5	What four?	NA
dn29:25.6	Firstly, with the ending of three fetters a mendicant becomes a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.	NA
dn29:25.7	This is the first fruit and benefit.	NA
dn29:25.8	Furthermore, a mendicant—with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion—becomes a once-returner. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.	NA
dn29:25.9	This is the second fruit and benefit.	NA
dn29:25.10	Furthermore, with the ending of the five lower fetters, a mendicant is reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.	NA
dn29:25.11	This is the third fruit and benefit.	NA
dn29:25.12	Furthermore, a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.	NA
dn29:25.13	This is the fourth fruit and benefit.	NA
dn29:25.14	These four benefits may be expected by those who live indulging in pleasure in these four ways.’	Some meditation teachers warn of the supposed dangers of becoming attached to the pleasure of meditation. The Buddha’s view was that the pleasure of meditation arises from letting go and leads to Nibbana.
dn29:26.0	11. Things Impossible for the Perfected	NA
dn29:26.1	It’s possible that wanderers of other religions might say,	NA
dn29:26.2	‘The ascetics who follow the Sakyan are fickle.’	At [an8.19:3.1]() the ocean is said to be _ṭhitadhammo_, “naturally stable”. Both places are glossed as _ṭhitasabhāvā_. It seems this is in reference to the fact that the Buddhist Vinaya is gentle and flexible. The Buddha was ready to alter and adjust details when circumstances required, yet the fundamental principles hold firm.
dn29:26.3	You should say to them,	NA
dn29:26.4	‘Reverends, these things have been taught and pointed out for his disciples by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, not to be transgressed so long as life lasts.	NA
dn29:26.5	Suppose there was an Indra’s pillar or an iron pillar with deep foundations, firmly embedded, imperturbable and unshakable.	NA
dn29:26.6	In the same way, these things have been taught and pointed out for his disciples by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, not to be transgressed so long as life lasts.	NA
dn29:26.7	A mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—can’t transgress in nine respects.	As at [an9.7:3.3](), etc.
dn29:26.8	A mendicant with defilements ended can’t deliberately take the life of a living creature, take something with the intention to steal, have sex, tell a deliberate lie, or store up goods for their own enjoyment like they used to as a lay person. And they can’t make decisions prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity, or cowardice.	NA
dn29:26.9	A mendicant who is perfected can’t transgress in these nine respects.’	NA
dn29:27.0	12. Questions and Answers	NA
dn29:27.1	It’s possible that wanderers of other religions might say,	NA
dn29:27.2	‘The ascetic Gotama demonstrates boundless knowledge and vision of the past, but not of the future. What’s up with that?’	NA
dn29:27.3	Those wanderers, like incompetent fools, seem to imagine that one kind of knowledge and vision can be demonstrated by means of another kind of knowledge and vision.	It is possible to remember the past, but knowledge of the future is restricted to inferences in specific contexts and cannot be predicted in general.
dn29:27.4	Regarding the past, the Realized One has knowledge stemming from memory.	NA
dn29:27.5	He recollects as far as he wants.	NA
dn29:27.6	Regarding the future, the Realized One has the knowledge born of awakening:	The Buddha claims no gift of prophecy, unlike some other sages, but he knows that which matters.
dn29:27.7	‘This is my last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.’	NA
dn29:28.1	If a question about the past is untrue, false, and pointless, the Realized One does not reply.	NA
dn29:28.2	If a question about the past is true and correct, but pointless, he does not reply.	NA
dn29:28.3	If a question about the past is true, correct, and beneficial, he knows the right time to reply.	NA
dn29:28.4	And the Realized One replies to questions about the future or the present in the same way.	NA
dn29:28.5	NA	NA
dn29:28.6	NA	NA
dn29:28.7	NA	NA
dn29:28.8	And so the Realized One has speech that’s well-timed, true, meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.	See [an4.23]() and [iti112]().
dn29:29.1	In this world—with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, and explored by the mind, all that has been understood by the Realized One.	NA
dn29:29.2	That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.	NA
dn29:29.3	From the night when the Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening until the night he becomes fully extinguished—in the element of extinguishment with no residue—everything he speaks, says, and expresses is real, not otherwise.	NA
dn29:29.4	That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.	NA
dn29:29.5	The Realized One does as he says, and says as he does.	NA
dn29:29.6	Since this is so, that’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.	NA
dn29:29.7	In this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—the Realized One is the vanquisher, the unvanquished, the universal seer, the wielder of power.	NA
dn29:30.0	13. The Undeclared Points	NA
dn29:30.1	It’s possible that wanderers of other religions might say,	NA
dn29:30.2	‘Is this your view: “A Realized One exists after death. This is the only truth, anything else is futile”?’	Here these questions follow on from the Buddha’s acknowledgment of epistemological limitations. Not everything can be known, and if it is, it is not always useful to speak of it.
dn29:30.3	You should say to them,	NA
dn29:30.4	‘Reverend, this has not been declared by the Buddha.’	NA
dn29:30.5	NA	NA
dn29:30.6	The wanderers might say,	NA
dn29:30.7	‘Then is this your view: “A Realized One doesn’t exist after death. This is the only truth, anything else is futile”?’	NA
dn29:30.8	You should say to them,	NA
dn29:30.9	‘This too has not been declared by the Buddha.’	NA
dn29:30.10	NA	NA
dn29:30.11	The wanderers might say,	NA
dn29:30.12	‘Then is this your view: “A Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death. This is the only truth, anything else is futile”?’	NA
dn29:30.13	You should say to them,	NA
dn29:30.14	‘This too has not been declared by the Buddha.’	NA
dn29:30.15	NA	NA
dn29:30.16	The wanderers might say,	NA
dn29:30.17	‘Then is this your view: “A Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death. This is the only truth, anything else is futile”?’	NA
dn29:30.18	You should say to them,	NA
dn29:30.19	‘This too has not been declared by the Buddha.’	NA
dn29:30.20	NA	NA
dn29:31.1	The wanderers might say,	NA
dn29:31.2	‘But why has this not been declared by the ascetic Gotama?’	NA
dn29:31.3	You should say to them,	NA
dn29:31.4	‘Because it’s not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. That’s why it hasn’t been declared by the Buddha.’	NA
dn29:32.0	14. The Declared Points	NA
dn29:32.1	It’s possible that wanderers of other religions might say,	NA
dn29:32.2	‘But what has been declared by the ascetic Gotama?’	NA
dn29:32.3	You should say to them,	NA
dn29:32.4	‘What has been declared by the Buddha is this: “This is suffering”—“This is the origin of suffering”—“This is the cessation of suffering”—“This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.”’	NA
dn29:33.1	The wanderers might say,	NA
dn29:33.2	‘But why has this been declared by the ascetic Gotama?’	NA
dn29:33.3	You should say to them,	NA
dn29:33.4	‘Because it’s beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. It leads to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. That’s why it has been declared by the Buddha.’	NA
dn29:34.0	15. Views of the Past	NA

dn29:34.6	NA	NA
dn29:34.7	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	NA
dn29:34.8	‘The self and the cosmos are eternal. This is the only truth, anything else is futile.’	NA
dn29:34.9	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	NA

dn29:39.20	Shall I explain them to you in the wrong way?	NA
dn29:40.1	I have taught and pointed out the four kinds of mindfulness meditation for giving up and going beyond all these views of the past and the future.	The Brahmajālasutta describes the path to the end of these views in terms of understanding dependent origination through contemplation of contact in the six senses ([dn1:3.71.12]()). The Buddhist path is integrated, so one part always implies the whole.
dn29:40.2	What four?	NA
dn29:40.3	It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	NA
dn29:40.4	They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …	NA

dn30:1.1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
dn30:1.1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
dn30:1.1.7	“There are thirty-two marks of a great man. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.	This is one of the latest suttas in the Pali Nikāyas. Typically this topic only comes up in relation to the Buddha’s fulfillment of Brahmanical prophecies. Here it is developed with a series of ornate verses, none of which have parallels. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that nowhere in the extensive discussions of the Buddha’s past good deeds is there any mention of the later concepts of the _pāramīs_ (“perfections”) or the Bodhisatta path.
dn30:1.1.8	If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures.	NA

dn30:1.1.10	the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure.	NA

dn30:1.2.1	And what are the thirty-two marks?	The marks are elsewhere listed in [dn14:1.32.7]() and [mn91:9.1](). I discuss the translation of the marks in my comments to DN 14.

dn30:1.2.15	He has delicate skin, so delicate that dust and dirt don’t stick to his body.	NA

dn30:1.2.22	He has the proportional circumference of a banyan tree: the span of his arms equals the height of his body.	NA
dn30:1.2.23	His torso is cylindrical.	NA
dn30:1.2.24	He has ridged taste buds.	NA

dn30:1.3.2	NA	NA
dn30:1.3.3	NA	NA
dn30:1.3.4	Seers who are outsiders remember these marks, but they do not know	NA
dn30:1.3.5	the specific deeds performed in the past to obtain each mark.	The later astrological texts such as the Gārgīyajyotiṣa and Bṛhatsaṁhitā that discuss similar marks are more concerned with how they indicate character and destiny than their moral causes.
dn30:1.4.0	1. Well-Planted Feet	NA
dn30:1.4.1	In some past lives, past existences, past abodes the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He firmly and persistently undertook skillful behaviors such as good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, giving and sharing, taking precepts, observing the sabbath, paying due respect to mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, honoring the elders in the family, and various other things pertaining to skillful behaviors.	The key terms here are _daḷha_ (“firm”) and _avatthita_ (“persistently”), which result in his firm stance.
dn30:1.4.2	Due to performing, accumulating, heaping up, and amassing those deeds, when his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	NA
dn30:1.4.3	There he surpassed the other gods in ten respects: heavenly lifespan, beauty, happiness, glory, sovereignty, sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches.	NA
dn30:1.4.4	When he passed away from there and came back to this place he obtained this mark of a great man:	NA
dn30:1.4.5	he has well-planted feet.	NA
dn30:1.4.6	He places his foot on the ground evenly, raises it evenly, and touches the ground evenly with the whole sole of his foot.	NA
dn30:1.5.1	Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn30:1.5.2	He has the following seven treasures:	NA
dn30:1.5.3	the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure.	NA
dn30:1.5.4	He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.	NA
dn30:1.5.5	After conquering this land girt by sea—free of harassment by bandits, successful and prosperous, safe, blessed, free of pests—he reigns by principle, without rod or sword.	The commentary explain _akhilamanimittamakaṇṭakaṁ_ as “free of bandits” (_niccoraṁ_). Bandits are also regarded as “pests” (_abbuda_, literally “tumor” or “cancer”) at [sn1.77:3.4]().
dn30:1.5.6	And what does he obtain as king?	NA
dn30:1.5.7	He can’t be stopped by any human foe or enemy.	NA
dn30:1.5.8	That’s what he obtains as king.	NA
dn30:1.5.9	But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world.	NA
dn30:1.5.10	And what does he obtain as Buddha?	NA
dn30:1.5.11	He can’t be stopped by any foe or enemy whether internal or external; nor by greed, hate, or delusion; nor by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world.	NA
dn30:1.5.12	That’s what he obtains as Buddha.”	NA
dn30:1.5.13	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
dn30:1.6.1	On this it is said:	NA
dn30:1.6.2	“Truth, principle, self-control, and restraint;	K.R. Norman’s series of five articles on *The Metres of the Lakkhaṇa-suttanta* discusses the verses in detail, and my translation is indebted to him. He notes that the 20 verse passages employ no less than seven distinct metres, all of them either new or updated styles. Such a display of poetic virtuosity is rare in the Pali canon.
dn30:1.6.3	purity, precepts, and observing the sabbath;	NA
dn30:1.6.4	giving, harmlessness, delighting in non-violence—	NA
dn30:1.6.5	firmly undertaking these things, he lived accordingly.	NA
dn30:1.6.6	By means of these deeds he went to heaven,	NA
dn30:1.6.7	where he enjoyed happiness and merriment.	NA
dn30:1.6.8	After passing away from there to here,	NA
dn30:1.6.9	he steps evenly on this rich earth.	NA
dn30:1.6.10	The gathered soothsayers predicted	NA
dn30:1.6.11	that there is no stopping one of such even tread,	NA
dn30:1.6.12	as householder or renunciate.	NA
dn30:1.6.13	That’s the meaning shown by this mark.	NA
dn30:1.6.14	While living at home he cannot be stopped,	NA
dn30:1.6.15	he defeats his foes, and cannot be beaten.	NA
dn30:1.6.16	Due to the fruit of that deed,	NA
dn30:1.6.17	he cannot be stopped by any human.	NA
dn30:1.6.18	But if he chooses the life gone forth,	NA
dn30:1.6.19	seeing clearly, loving renunciation,	NA
dn30:1.6.20	not even the best can ever stop him;	The commentary confirms the Mahāsaṅgīti reading _khambhana_ (“obstacle”) here rather than PTS _gabbha_ (‘womb”).
dn30:1.6.21	this is the nature of the supreme person.”	NA
dn30:1.7.0	2. Wheels on the Feet	NA
dn30:1.7.1	“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being.	NA
dn30:1.7.2	He conveyed happiness to many people, eliminating threats, terror, and danger, providing just protection and security, and giving gifts with all the trimmings.	He “conveyed happiness” (_sukhāvaho_), like a wheeled cart would convey goods. | _Parivāra_ means “surroundings, accompaniments”, and I follow the commentary, which takes it in the sense of the “trimmings” accompanying the food. Given, however, that the kammic result is a large _parivāra_ (“following”), it might mean that he gave not just physical things, but was generous with his followers also, engaging them in such beneficial tasks.
dn30:1.7.3	Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm.	NA
dn30:1.7.4	When he came back to this place he obtained this mark:	NA
dn30:1.7.5	on the soles of his feet there are thousand-spoked wheels, with rims and hubs, complete in every detail and well divided inside.	NA
dn30:1.8.1	Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn30:1.8.2	And what does he obtain as king?	NA
dn30:1.8.3	He has a large following	NA
dn30:1.8.4	of brahmins and householders, people of town and country, finance ministers, military officers, guardsmen, ministers, councillors, rulers, tax beneficiaries, and princes.	NA
dn30:1.8.5	That’s what he obtains as king.	NA
dn30:1.8.6	But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a fully awakened Buddha.	NA
dn30:1.8.7	And what does he obtain as Buddha?	NA
dn30:1.8.8	He has a large following	NA
dn30:1.8.9	of monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, humans, titans, dragons, and centaurs.	NA
dn30:1.8.10	That’s what he obtains as Buddha.”	NA
dn30:1.8.11	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
dn30:1.9.1	On this it is said:	NA
dn30:1.9.2	“In olden days, in past lives,	NA
dn30:1.9.3	he brought happiness to many people,	NA
dn30:1.9.4	ridding them of fear, terror, and danger,	NA
dn30:1.9.5	eagerly guarding and protecting them.	NA
dn30:1.9.6	By means of these deeds he went to heaven,	NA

dn30:1.9.13	that he’d have a following, subduing foes,	NA
dn30:1.9.14	which is why he has wheels all rimmed around.	NA
dn30:1.9.15	If he doesn’t choose the life gone forth,	NA
dn30:1.9.16	he’ll roll the wheel and rule the land.	NA
dn30:1.9.17	The aristocrats will be his vassals,	NA
dn30:1.9.18	flocking to his glory.	NA

dn30:1.9.24	the supreme, honored by gods and humans.”	NA
dn30:1.10.0	3–5. Stretched Heels, Etc.	NA
dn30:1.10.1	“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being.	NA
dn30:1.10.2	He gave up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. He was scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings.	NA
dn30:1.10.3	Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm.	NA
dn30:1.10.4	When he came back to this place he obtained these three marks:	NA
dn30:1.10.5	he has stretched heels, long fingers, and his body is tall and straight-limbed.	Giving up killing results in long life. This seems to be applied by metaphor to having these long and elegant body parts.
dn30:1.11.1	Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn30:1.11.2	And what does he obtain as king?	NA
dn30:1.11.3	He’s long-lived, preserving his life for a long time. No human foe or enemy is able to take his life before his time.	NA
dn30:1.11.4	That’s what he obtains as king.	NA
dn30:1.11.5	And what does he obtain as Buddha?	NA
dn30:1.11.6	He’s long-lived, preserving his life for a long time. No foes or enemies—nor any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or anyone in the world—is able to take his life before his time.	NA
dn30:1.11.7	That’s what he obtains as Buddha.”	NA
dn30:1.11.8	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
dn30:1.12.1	On this it is said:	NA
dn30:1.12.2	“Realizing for himself the horrors of death,	NA
dn30:1.12.3	he refrained from killing other creatures.	NA
dn30:1.12.4	By that good conduct he went to heaven,	NA
dn30:1.12.5	where he enjoyed the fruit of deeds well done.	NA
dn30:1.12.6	Passing away, on his return to here,	NA
dn30:1.12.7	he obtained these three marks:	NA
dn30:1.12.8	his stretched heels are abundant and long,	NA
dn30:1.12.9	and like the Divinity, he’s straight and beautiful, <j>with well-formed limbs.	Whereas in the phrase _brahmujugatto_, _brahm-_ means “extended, tall”, here _brahmāva_ means “like Brahmā”, either as a play on words or by mistaken etymology.
dn30:1.12.10	Fair of arm, youthful, of good posture and breeding,	NA
dn30:1.12.11	his fingers are soft and tender and long.	NA
dn30:1.12.12	By these three marks of an excellent man,	NA
dn30:1.12.13	they indicated that the prince’s life would be long:	NA
dn30:1.12.14	‘As a householder he will live long;	This verse spoken by the soothsayers.
dn30:1.12.15	longer still if he goes forth, due to	NA
dn30:1.12.16	mastery in the development of psychic power.	NA
dn30:1.12.17	Thus this is the sign of long life.’”	NA
dn30:1.13.0	6. Seven Bulging Places	NA
dn30:1.13.1	“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being.	NA
dn30:1.13.2	He was a donor of delicious and tasty cooked and fresh foods, and drinks that were sweet and succulent.	He receives bodily fullness as a result of giving food.
dn30:1.13.3	Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm.	NA
dn30:1.13.4	When he came back to this place he obtained this mark: he has bulging muscles in seven places.	NA
dn30:1.13.5	Both hands, both feet, both shoulders, and his chest are all bulging.	NA
dn30:1.14.1	Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn30:1.14.2	And what does he obtain as king?	NA
dn30:1.14.3	He gets delicious and tasty cooked and fresh foods, and drinks that are sweet and succulent.	NA
dn30:1.14.4	That’s what he obtains as king.	NA
dn30:1.14.5	And what does he obtain as Buddha?	NA

dn30:1.14.7	That’s what he obtains as Buddha.”	NA
dn30:1.14.8	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
dn30:1.15.1	On this it is said:	NA
dn30:1.15.2	“He used to give the very best of flavors—	NA
dn30:1.15.3	scrumptious foods of every kind.	NA
dn30:1.15.4	Because of that good deed,	NA
dn30:1.15.5	he rejoiced long in the Garden of Delight.	_Nandana_, the celestial garden in the realm of the Thirty-Three.
dn30:1.15.6	On returning to here, he is rounded in seven places,	NA
dn30:1.15.7	and tender hands and feet are found.	NA
dn30:1.15.8	The soothsayers expert in signs declared:	NA
dn30:1.15.9	‘He’ll get tasty foods of all sorts	NA
dn30:1.15.10	as a householder, that’s what that means.	NA
dn30:1.15.11	But even if he goes forth he’ll get the same,	NA
dn30:1.15.12	supreme in gaining tasty foods of all sorts,	NA
dn30:1.15.13	cutting all bonds of the lay life.’”	NA
dn30:1.16.0	7–8. Tender and Serried Hands	NA
dn30:1.16.1	“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being.	NA
dn30:1.16.2	He brought people together using the four ways of being inclusive:	NA
dn30:1.16.3	giving, kindly words, taking care, and equality.	NA
dn30:1.16.4	Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm.	NA
dn30:1.16.5	When he came back to this place he obtained these two marks:	NA
dn30:1.16.6	his hands and feet are tender, and they are serried.	“Tender” because he treated people tenderly; “serried” because his fingers and toes are kept gracefully together, not splayed and separated.
dn30:1.17.1	Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn30:1.17.2	And what does he obtain as king?	NA
dn30:1.17.3	His retinue is inclusive, cohesive, and well-managed. This includes brahmins and householders, people of town and country, finance ministers, military officers, guardsmen, ministers, councillors, rulers, tax beneficiaries, and princes.	“Inclusive and well-managed” renders _saṅgahita_. It means “included”, as in those people who, due to the kindly actions, feel that they belong. For the sense “well-managed” see [an8.49:2.3](). Because of acting kindly and inclusively, people are well-disposed and work well together.
dn30:1.17.4	That’s what he obtains as king.	NA
dn30:1.17.5	And what does he obtain as Buddha?	NA
dn30:1.17.6	His retinue is inclusive and well-managed. This includes monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, humans, titans, dragons, and centaurs.	NA
dn30:1.17.7	That’s what he obtains as Buddha.”	NA
dn30:1.17.8	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
dn30:1.18.1	On this it is said:	NA
dn30:1.18.2	“By giving and helping others,	NA
dn30:1.18.3	kindly speech, and equal treatment,	NA
dn30:1.18.4	such action and conduct as brought people together,	NA
dn30:1.18.5	he went to heaven due to his esteemed virtue.	NA
dn30:1.18.6	Passing away, on his return to here,	NA
dn30:1.18.7	the young baby prince obtained	NA
dn30:1.18.8	hands and feet so tender and serried,	NA
dn30:1.18.9	lovely, graceful, and good-looking.	NA
dn30:1.18.10	His retinue is loyal and manageable,	NA
dn30:1.18.11	staying agreeably all over this broad land.	Even though the community is geographically dispersed, it is still coherent.
dn30:1.18.12	Speaking kindly, seeking happiness,	NA
dn30:1.18.13	he implements agreeable qualities.	NA
dn30:1.18.14	But if he gives up all sensual enjoyments,	NA
dn30:1.18.15	as victor he speaks Dhamma to the people.	NA
dn30:1.18.16	Devoted, they respond to his words;	NA
dn30:1.18.17	after listening, they practice in line with the teaching.”	NA
dn30:1.19.0	9–10. Arched Feet and Upright Hair	NA
dn30:1.19.1	“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being.	NA
dn30:1.19.2	His speech was meaningful and principled. He educated many people, bringing welfare and happiness, offering the teaching.	NA
dn30:1.19.3	Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm.	NA
dn30:1.19.4	When he came back to this place he obtained these two marks:	NA
dn30:1.19.5	the tops of his feet are arched and his hairs stand up.	Perhaps the uprightness of these marks relates to his speech being beneficial, leading upwards.
dn30:1.20.1	Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn30:1.20.2	And what does he obtain as king?	NA
dn30:1.20.3	He is the foremost, best, chief, highest, and finest of those who enjoy sensual pleasures.	NA
dn30:1.20.4	That’s what he obtains as king.	NA
dn30:1.20.5	And what does he obtain as Buddha?	NA
dn30:1.20.6	He is the foremost, best, chief, highest, and finest of all sentient beings.	NA

dn30:1.21.10	His hairs stand upright,	NA
dn30:1.21.11	and his ankles stand out well.	NA

dn30:1.21.19	turns into the best of all creatures.	NA

dn30:1.22.1	“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being.	NA

dn30:1.24.1	On this it is said:	NA
dn30:1.24.2	“In professions, knowledge, conduct, and deeds,	NA
dn30:1.24.3	he thought of how they might easily learn.	NA

dn30:1.31.5	When he came back to this place he obtained this mark:	NA
dn30:1.31.6	his private parts are covered in a foreskin.	The penis is the generative organ and hence part-creator of family. Being covered suggests that his sexuality was moderated and contained. His role was more than having children, it was building family.

dn30:2.1.1	“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being.	NA
dn30:2.1.2	Examining the gathered population, he knew what they had in common and what was their own; he knew each person, and he knew the distinctions between people.	NA
dn30:2.1.3	In each case, he made appropriate distinctions between people: ‘This one deserves that; that one deserves this.’	NA
dn30:2.1.4	Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm.	NA
dn30:2.1.5	When he came back to this place he obtained these two marks:	NA
dn30:2.1.6	he has the proportional circumference of a banyan tree; and when standing upright and not bending over, the palms of both hands touch the knees.	The banyan tree is not just proportioned, it offers shelter to many creatures. Touching the knees indicates connecting with the manyfolk, who at [an5.196:3.1]() are likened to caterpillars reaching the knees.
dn30:2.2.1	Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn30:2.2.2	And what does he obtain as king?	NA
dn30:2.2.3	He is rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, lots of money and grain, and a full treasury and storehouses.	NA
dn30:2.2.4	That’s what he obtains as king.	NA
dn30:2.2.5	And what does he obtain as Buddha?	NA
dn30:2.2.6	He is rich, affluent, and wealthy.	NA
dn30:2.2.7	He has these kinds of wealth:	NA

dn30:2.2.9	That’s what he obtains as Buddha.”	NA
dn30:2.2.10	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
dn30:2.3.1	On this it is said:	NA
dn30:2.3.2	“Examining the many people in a community,	NA
dn30:2.3.3	he weighed, evaluated, and judged each case:	NA
dn30:2.3.4	‘This one deserves that.’	NA
dn30:2.3.5	That’s how he used to draw <j>distinctions between people.	NA
dn30:2.3.6	Now standing without bending	NA
dn30:2.3.7	he can touch his knees with both hands.	NA
dn30:2.3.8	With the remaining ripening <j>of the fruit of good deeds,	NA

dn30:2.4.0	17–19. A Lion’s Chest, Etc.	NA
dn30:2.4.1	“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being.	NA
dn30:2.4.2	He wanted what’s best, the welfare, the comfort, and sanctuary of the people, thinking:	NA
dn30:2.4.3	‘How might they flourish in faith, ethics, learning, generosity, teachings, and wisdom; in wealth and grain, fields and land, birds and beasts, children and partners; in bondservants, workers, and staff; in family, friends, and kin?’	NA
dn30:2.4.4	Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm.	NA
dn30:2.4.5	When he came back to this place he obtained these three marks:	NA
dn30:2.4.6	his chest is like that of a lion; he is filled out between the shoulders.; and his torso is cylindrical.	A _khema_ is a sanctuary where animals flourish in peace, without fear of the hunter. Likewise, the Buddha’s body flourishes and has a fullness to it. He is slim but not skinny.
dn30:2.5.1	Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn30:2.5.2	And what does he obtain as king?	NA
dn30:2.5.3	He’s not liable to decline. He doesn’t decline in wealth and grain, fields and land, birds and beasts, children and partners; in bondservants, workers, and staff; in family, friends, and kin. He doesn’t decline in any of his accomplishments.	NA
dn30:2.5.4	That’s what he obtains as king.	NA
dn30:2.5.5	And what does he obtain as Buddha?	NA
dn30:2.5.6	He’s not liable to decline. He doesn’t decline in faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. He doesn’t decline in any of his accomplishments.	Decline in _dhamma_ is missing here, but present both above and below in verse.
dn30:2.5.7	That’s what he obtains as Buddha.”	NA
dn30:2.5.8	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
dn30:2.6.1	On this it is said:	NA
dn30:2.6.2	“His wish was this: ‘How may others not decline	NA
dn30:2.6.3	in faith, ethics, learning, and intelligence,	NA
dn30:2.6.4	in generosity, teachings, and much good else,	NA
dn30:2.6.5	in coin and grain, fields and lands,	NA
dn30:2.6.6	in children, partners, and livestock,	NA
dn30:2.6.7	in family, friends, and kin,	NA
dn30:2.6.8	in strength, and both beauty and happiness?’	NA
dn30:2.6.9	And so he ever desired their success.	NA
dn30:2.6.10	His chest was prominent like that of a lion,	NA
dn30:2.6.11	filled out between the shoulders, <j>and torso cylindrical.	NA
dn30:2.6.12	Due to the well-done deeds of the past,	NA
dn30:2.6.13	he had that portent of non-decline.	NA
dn30:2.6.14	Even as layman he grows in coin and grain,	NA
dn30:2.6.15	in wives, children, and livestock.	NA
dn30:2.6.16	But once gone forth, owning nothing, he attains	NA
dn30:2.6.17	the supreme awakening which may never decline.”	NA
dn30:2.7.0	20. Ridged Taste Buds	NA
dn30:2.7.1	“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being.	NA
dn30:2.7.2	He would never hurt any sentient being with fists, stones, rods, or swords.	NA
dn30:2.7.3	Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm.	NA
dn30:2.7.4	When he came back to this place he obtained this mark: he has ridged taste buds. His raised taste receptors, originating in the throat, disperse evenly.	NA
dn30:2.8.1	Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn30:2.8.2	And what does he obtain as king?	NA
dn30:2.8.3	He is rarely ill or unwell. His stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold.	The “ridged taste buds” are not merely for tasting, but support excellent digestion. Kammically, the rationale is that since he did not kill others, now nothing hurts him when he eats.
dn30:2.8.4	That’s what he obtains as king.	NA
dn30:2.8.5	And what does he obtain as Buddha?	NA
dn30:2.8.6	He is rarely ill or unwell. His stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and fit for meditation.	NA
dn30:2.8.7	That’s what he obtains as Buddha.”	NA
dn30:2.8.8	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
dn30:2.9.1	On this it is said:	NA
dn30:2.9.2	“Not with fist or rod or stone,	NA
dn30:2.9.3	or sword or beating to death,	NA
dn30:2.9.4	or by bondage or threats	NA
dn30:2.9.5	did he ever harm anyone.	NA
dn30:2.9.6	For that very reason he rejoiced in heaven <j>after passing away,	NA
dn30:2.9.7	finding happiness as a fruit of happy deeds.	NA
dn30:2.9.8	With taste receptors prominent <j>and evenly spreading nutrition,	NA
dn30:2.9.9	on his return here he has ridged taste buds.	NA
dn30:2.9.10	That’s why the clever prophets said:	NA
dn30:2.9.11	‘This man will have much happiness	NA
dn30:2.9.12	as householder or renunciate.	NA
dn30:2.9.13	That’s the meaning shown by this mark.’”	NA
dn30:2.10.0	21–22. Indigo Eyes	NA
dn30:2.10.1	“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being.	NA
dn30:2.10.2	When looking at others he didn’t glare, look askance, or avert his eyes. Being straightforward, he reached out to others with straightforward intentions, looking at people with kindly eyes.	NA
dn30:2.10.3	Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm.	NA
dn30:2.10.4	When he came back to this place he obtained these two marks:	NA
dn30:2.10.5	his eyes are indigo, and he has eyelashes like a cow’s.	Dark colored eyes give the impression of wide pupils and an open gaze, while the eyelashes of cows lend them a tenderness.
dn30:2.11.1	Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn30:2.11.2	And what does he obtain as king?	NA
dn30:2.11.3	The people look on him with kindly eyes. He is dear and beloved to the brahmins and householders, people of town and country, finance ministers, military officers, guardsmen, ministers, councillors, rulers, tax beneficiaries, and princes.	NA
dn30:2.11.4	That’s what he obtains as king.	NA
dn30:2.11.5	And what does he obtain as Buddha?	NA
dn30:2.11.6	The people look on him with kindly eyes. He is dear and beloved to the monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, humans, titans, dragons, and centaurs.	NA
dn30:2.11.7	That’s what he obtains as Buddha.”	NA
dn30:2.11.8	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
dn30:2.12.1	On this it is said:	NA
dn30:2.12.2	“With not a glare or glance askance,	NA
dn30:2.12.3	nor averting of the eyes;	NA
dn30:2.12.4	straightforward, he reached out straightforwardly,	NA
dn30:2.12.5	looking at people with kindly eyes.	NA
dn30:2.12.6	In good rebirths he enjoyed the fruit	NA

dn30:2.12.14	Even as a householder he’d be regarded kindly,	NA
dn30:2.12.15	beloved of the people.	NA
dn30:2.12.16	But if he becomes an ascetic, not lay,	NA
dn30:2.12.17	as destroyer of sorrow he’ll be loved by many.”	NA

dn30:2.13.1	“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being.	NA

The commentary says he took the lead in good deeds “unembarrassed, with head held high, his head filled with rapture and joy”.

dn30:2.18.12	‘One like this, with tuft and hair so prominent,	NA
dn30:2.18.13	will have many as his close adherents.	NA
dn30:2.18.14	Even as householder many people will follow him,	NA
dn30:2.18.15	due to the power of deeds in the past.	NA
dn30:2.18.16	But once gone forth, owning nothing,	NA
dn30:2.18.17	as Buddha the people will follow him.’”	NA
dn30:2.19.0	26–27. Forty Gapless Teeth	NA
dn30:2.19.1	“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being.	NA
dn30:2.19.2	He refrained from divisive speech. He didn’t repeat in one place what he heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, he reconciled those who were divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.	NA
dn30:2.19.3	Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm.	NA
dn30:2.19.4	When he came back to this place he obtained these two marks:	NA
dn30:2.19.5	he has forty teeth, and his teeth have no gaps.	The number four connotes “all around, complete, universal”, primarily from the four directions. It is multiplied to eight with the intermediate directions, and ten including above and below. Forty, then, is four times ten, a number of super-inclusiveness or super-universality. The lack of gaps corresponds with the lack of division between his followers.
dn30:2.20.1	Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn30:2.20.2	And what does he obtain as king?	NA
dn30:2.20.3	His retinue cannot be divided. This includes brahmins and householders, people of town and country, finance ministers, military officers, guardsmen, ministers, councillors, rulers, tax beneficiaries, and princes.	NA
dn30:2.20.4	That’s what he obtains as king.	NA
dn30:2.20.5	And what does he obtain as Buddha?	NA
dn30:2.20.6	His retinue cannot be divided. This includes monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, humans, titans, dragons, and centaurs.	NA
dn30:2.20.7	That’s what he obtains as Buddha.”	NA
dn30:2.20.8	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
dn30:2.21.1	On this it is said:	NA
dn30:2.21.2	“He spoke no words divisive causing friends to split,	NA
dn30:2.21.3	creating disputes that foster division,	NA
dn30:2.21.4	acting improperly by fostering quarrels,	NA
dn30:2.21.5	creating division among friends.	NA
dn30:2.21.6	He spoke kind words to foster harmony,	NA

dn30:2.21.8	He eliminated quarrels among the people,	NA
dn30:2.21.9	rejoicing together with the united.	NA
dn30:2.21.10	In good rebirths he enjoyed the fruit	NA
dn30:2.21.11	and result, rejoicing there.	NA

dn30:2.21.13	forty standing prominent in his mouth.	NA
dn30:2.21.14	If he becomes an aristocrat, ruler of the land,	NA
dn30:2.21.15	his assembly will be indivisible.	NA

dn30:2.21.17	his assembly will follow him, unshakable.”	NA

dn30:2.22.1	“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being.	NA
dn30:2.22.2	He refrained from harsh speech. He spoke in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people.	NA
dn30:2.22.3	Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm.	NA
dn30:2.22.4	When he came back to this place he obtained these two marks:	NA
dn30:2.22.5	he has a large tongue, and the voice of the Divinity, like a cuckoo’s call.	NA
dn30:2.23.1	Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn30:2.23.2	And what does he obtain as king?	NA
dn30:2.23.3	He has a persuasive voice. His words are persuasive to brahmins and householders, people of town and country, finance ministers, military officers, guardsmen, ministers, councillors, rulers, tax beneficiaries, and princes.	NA

dn30:2.23.7	That’s what he obtains as Buddha.”	NA
dn30:2.23.8	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
dn30:2.24.1	On this it is said:	NA
dn30:2.24.2	“He never spoke a loud harsh word,	NA
dn30:2.24.3	insulting, quarrelsome,	NA
dn30:2.24.4	causing harm, rude, crushing the people.	NA
dn30:2.24.5	His speech was sweet, helpful, and courteous.	NA
dn30:2.24.6	He uttered words dear to the mind,	NA
dn30:2.24.7	going to the heart, pleasing to the ear.	NA
dn30:2.24.8	He enjoyed the fruit of his good verbal conduct,	NA
dn30:2.24.9	experiencing the fruit of good deeds in heaven.	NA
dn30:2.24.10	Having experienced that fruit,	NA
dn30:2.24.11	on his return to here <j>he acquired the voice of the Divinity.	NA
dn30:2.24.12	His tongue was long and wide,	NA
dn30:2.24.13	and his speech was persuasive.	NA
dn30:2.24.14	Even as householder his speech brings prosperity.	NA
dn30:2.24.15	But if that man goes forth,	NA
dn30:2.24.16	speaking often to the people,	NA
dn30:2.24.17	they’ll be persuaded by his fair words.”	NA
dn30:2.25.0	30. A Lion-Like Jaw	NA
dn30:2.25.1	“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being.	NA
dn30:2.25.2	He refrained from talking nonsense. His words were timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. He said things at the right time which were valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.	NA
dn30:2.25.3	Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm.	NA
dn30:2.25.4	When he came back to this place he obtained this mark:	NA
dn30:2.25.5	his jaw is like that of a lion.	The commentary explains that those who flap their mouths with nonsensical gossip end up with weak or misshapen jaws.
dn30:2.26.1	Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch.	NA
dn30:2.26.2	And what does he obtain as king?	NA
dn30:2.26.3	He can’t be destroyed by any human foe or enemy.	NA
dn30:2.26.4	That’s what he obtains as king.	NA
dn30:2.26.5	And what does he obtain as Buddha?	NA
dn30:2.26.6	He can’t be destroyed by any foe or enemy whether internal or external; nor by greed, hate, or delusion; nor by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world.	NA
dn30:2.26.7	That’s what he obtains as Buddha.”	NA
dn30:2.26.8	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
dn30:2.27.1	On this it is said:	NA
dn30:2.27.2	“Neither nonsensical nor silly,	NA
dn30:2.27.3	his way of speaking was never loose.	NA
dn30:2.27.4	He eliminated what was unbeneficial,	NA
dn30:2.27.5	and spoke for the welfare <j>and happiness of the people.	NA
dn30:2.27.6	So doing he passed from here to be reborn in heaven,	NA
dn30:2.27.7	where he enjoyed the fruit of deeds well done.	NA
dn30:2.27.8	Passing away, on his return to here,	NA
dn30:2.27.9	he gained a jaw like the finest of beasts.	NA
dn30:2.27.10	He became a king so very hard to defeat,	NA
dn30:2.27.11	a mighty lord and ruler of mankind.	NA
dn30:2.27.12	He was equal to the best in the city of the Third Heaven,	NA
dn30:2.27.13	like Indra, the finest of gods.	NA
dn30:2.27.14	One such as that is not easily beaten by centaurs,	NA
dn30:2.27.15	titans, spirits, monsters, or gods.	NA
dn30:2.27.16	If he becomes of such a kind,	NA
dn30:2.27.17	he illuminates the quarters and in-between.”	NA
dn30:2.28.0	31–32. Even and White Teeth	NA
dn30:2.28.1	“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being.	NA
dn30:2.28.2	He gave up wrong livelihood and earned a living by right livelihood. He refrained from falsifying weights, metals, or measures; bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity; mutilation, murder, abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence.	NA
dn30:2.28.3	Due to performing, accumulating, heaping up, and amassing those deeds, when his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	NA
dn30:2.28.4	There he surpassed the other gods in ten respects: heavenly lifespan, beauty, happiness, glory, sovereignty, sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches.	NA
dn30:2.28.5	When he came back to this place he obtained these two marks: his teeth are even and perfectly white.	His teeth are not “crooked” or “stained” by corruption.
dn30:2.29.1	Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures.	NA
dn30:2.29.2	He has the following seven treasures:	NA
dn30:2.29.3	the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure.	NA
dn30:2.29.4	He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.	NA
dn30:2.29.5	After conquering this land girt by sea—free of harassment by bandits, successful and prosperous, safe, blessed, and free of pests—he reigns by principle, without rod or sword.	NA

dn30:2.29.8	That’s what he obtains as king.	NA
dn30:2.30.1	But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world.	NA
dn30:2.30.2	And what does he obtain as Buddha?	NA
dn30:2.30.3	His retinue is pure. This includes monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, humans, titans, dragons, and centaurs.	NA
dn30:2.30.4	That’s what he obtains as Buddha.”	NA
dn30:2.30.5	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
dn30:2.31.1	On this it is said:	NA
dn30:2.31.2	“He abandoned wrong livelihood, and created	NA
dn30:2.31.3	a way of life that’s fair, pure, and just.	NA
dn30:2.31.4	He eliminated what was unbeneficial,	NA
dn30:2.31.5	and lived for the welfare and happiness of the people.	NA
dn30:2.31.6	Having done what’s praised <j>by the clever, the wise, and the good,	NA
dn30:2.31.7	that man experienced the fruit in heaven.	NA
dn30:2.31.8	Equal to the best in the Third Heaven,	NA

dn30:2.31.11	With the remaining ripening <j>of the fruit of good deeds,	NA
dn30:2.31.12	he obtained teeth that are even,	NA
dn30:2.31.13	gleaming, bright, and white.	NA
dn30:2.31.14	Many soothsayers regarded as wise men	NA
dn30:2.31.15	gathered and predicted of him:	NA
dn30:2.31.16	‘With twice-born teeth <j>so even, so white, so clean and bright	NA
dn30:2.31.17	his retinue will be so pure.	NA
dn30:2.31.18	As king, his people will also be pure,	NA
dn30:2.31.19	when he rules having conquered this earth so broad.	NA
dn30:2.31.20	They won’t harm the country,	NA
dn30:2.31.21	but will live for the welfare <j>and happiness of the people.	NA
dn30:2.31.22	But if he goes forth he’ll be an ascetic free of ill,	NA
dn30:2.31.23	his passions quelled, the veil drawn back.	NA
dn30:2.31.24	Rid of stress and weariness,	NA
dn30:2.31.25	he sees this world and the next.	NA
dn30:2.31.26	Those who do his bidding, both lay and renunciate,	NA
dn30:2.31.27	shake off wickedness, impure and blameworthy.	NA
dn30:2.31.28	He’s surrounded by pure people, who dispel	NA
dn30:2.31.29	stains, callousness, sin, and corruptions.’”	NA
dn30:2.31.30	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
dn30:2.31.31	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA
dn31:0.1	Long Discourses 31	NA
dn31:0.2	Advice to Sigālaka	NA
dn31:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
dn31:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
dn31:1.3	Now at that time the householder’s son Sigālaka rose early and left Rājagaha. With his clothes and hair all wet, he raised his joined palms to revere the various quarters—	Sigālaka only appears in this sutta. His name means “little jackal”.
dn31:1.4	east, south, west, north, below, and above.	Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.5.1 recommends offerings to Agni in the east, Indra or Soma in the south, the All-gods in the west, Mitra and Varuṇa in the north, and Bṛhaspati in the middle. The quarters themselves are divine, since one can travel them and never reach the end (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.1.5). Atharva Veda 12.3.7–10 gives a domestic prayer for the quarters; here Yama dwells in the south with the Fathers, while Soma is in the west, and the other directions are not associated with specific deities. Vājasaneyi Saṁhitā 22.24a worships the six directions. Maitrī Upaniṣad 7.1–6 details the spiritual meanings of the six quarters. In Buddhism, the quarters are said to be inhabited by the respective Four Great Kings as per [dn32]().
dn31:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.	NA
dn31:2.2	He saw Sigālaka revering the quarters	NA
dn31:2.3	NA	NA
dn31:2.4	and said to him,	NA
dn31:2.5	“Householder’s son, why are you revering the quarters in this way?”	NA
dn31:2.6	NA	NA
dn31:2.7	“Sir, on his deathbed my father said to me:	NA
dn31:2.8	‘My dear, please revere the quarters.’	Sigālaka followed blindly without considering the meaning as urged by Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1.3.11.
dn31:2.9	Honoring, respecting, and venerating my father’s words, I rose early and left Rājagaha and, with my clothes and hair all wet, raised my joined palms to revere the various quarters—	NA
dn31:2.10	east, south, west, north, below, and above.”	NA
dn31:2.11.0	1. The Six Directions	NA
dn31:2.12	“Householder’s son, that’s not how the six directions should be revered in the training of the Noble One.”	It is unusual to find “six” directions. Normally it is four, then eight (with intermediate directions), then ten (above and below). Praśna Upaniṣad 1.6 lists the six, then the intermediates.
dn31:2.13	“But sir, how should the six directions be revered in the training of the Noble One?	NA
dn31:2.14	Sir, please teach me this.”	NA
dn31:2.15	“Well then, householder’s son, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	NA
dn31:2.16	“Yes, sir,” replied Sigālaka.	NA
dn31:2.17	The Buddha said this:	NA
dn31:3.1	“Householder’s son, a noble disciple gives up four corrupt deeds, doesn’t do bad deeds on four grounds, and avoids six drains on wealth. When they’ve left these fourteen bad things behind they have the six directions covered.	The Buddha outlines the contents of the discourse to follow.
dn31:3.2	They’re practicing to win in both worlds, and they succeed in this world and the next.	NA
dn31:3.3	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	NA
dn31:3.4.0	2. Four Corrupt Deeds	NA
dn31:3.5	What four corrupt deeds have they given up?	The teaching is structured to reinforce memorization. Give the number of items (twice), so you will notice if any are missing; list the items; recapitulate the numbers; then recapitulate the items once more in verse.
dn31:3.6	Killing living creatures, stealing, sexual misconduct, and lying: these are corrupt deeds.	NA
dn31:3.7	These are the four corrupt deeds they’ve given up.”	NA
dn31:3.8	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
dn31:3.9	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	NA
dn31:4.1	“Killing, stealing,	NA
dn31:4.2	telling lies,	NA
dn31:4.3	and committing adultery:	NA
dn31:4.4	astute people don’t praise these things.”	NA
dn31:5.0	3. Four Grounds	NA
dn31:5.1	“On what four grounds do they not do bad deeds?	First we learned what the bad deeds were, now we learn why people do them.
dn31:5.2	One does bad deeds prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity, and cowardice.	NA
dn31:5.3	When a noble disciple is not prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity, and cowardice,	NA
dn31:5.4	they don’t do bad deeds on these four grounds.”	NA
dn31:5.5	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
dn31:5.6	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	NA
dn31:6.1	“If you act against the teaching	NA
dn31:6.2	out of favoritism, hostility, cowardice, or stupidity,	NA
dn31:6.3	your fame shrinks,	NA
dn31:6.4	like the moon in the waning fortnight.	NA
dn31:6.5	If you don’t act against the teaching	NA
dn31:6.6	out of favoritism, hostility, cowardice, and stupidity,	NA
dn31:6.7	your fame swells,	NA
dn31:6.8	like the moon in the waxing fortnight.”	NA
dn31:7.0	4. Six Drains on Wealth	NA
dn31:7.1	“What six drains on wealth do they avoid?	“Drains on wealth” is _apāyamukha_, literally “openings for departure”. This is emphasized here since Sigālaka wants to be a good son and not squander the family fortune.
dn31:7.2	Habitually engaging in the following things is a drain on wealth: consuming beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants; roaming the streets at night; frequenting festivals; gambling; bad friends; laziness.	The most common phrase in Pali for alcoholic beverages lists three items. _Surā_ is brewed from grains with yeast ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:2.1.2]()) _Meraya_ is made from flowers, fruits, or sugars ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51:2.1.4]()). _Madya_ is apparently a catchall. Together they correspond fairly well with the modern classification of alcoholic drinks as “beer, wine, and liquor”. See also Manu 11.94, Arthaśāstra 2.25, Suśrutasaṁhitā 1.45, Amarakośodghāṭana 3.6.
dn31:8.0	5. Six Drawbacks of Drinking	NA
dn31:8.1	There are these six drawbacks of habitually consuming beer, wine, and liquor that cause intoxication.	Now each of the six drains on wealth are expanded and explained.
dn31:8.2	Immediate loss of wealth, promotion of quarrels, susceptibility to illness, disrepute, indecent exposure; and weakened wisdom is the sixth thing.	NA
dn31:8.3	These are the six drawbacks of habitually consuming beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.	NA
dn31:9.0	6. Six Drawbacks of Roaming the Streets at Night	NA
dn31:9.1	There are these six drawbacks of roaming the streets at night.	NA
dn31:9.2	Yourself, your partners and children, and your property are all left unguarded. You’re suspected of bad deeds. Untrue rumors spread about you. You’re at the forefront of many things that entail suffering.	NA
dn31:9.3	These are the six drawbacks of roaming the streets at night.	NA
dn31:10.0	7. Six Drawbacks of Festivals	NA
dn31:10.1	There are these six drawbacks of frequenting festivals.	NA
dn31:10.2	You’re always thinking: ‘Where’s the dancing? Where’s the singing? Where’s the music? Where are the stories? Where’s the applause? Where are the kettledrums?’	NA
dn31:10.3	These are the six drawbacks of frequenting festivals.	NA
dn31:11.0	8. Six Drawbacks of Gambling	NA
dn31:11.1	There are these six drawbacks of habitually gambling.	NA
dn31:11.2	Victory breeds enmity. The loser mourns their money. There is immediate loss of wealth. A gambler’s word carries no weight in public assembly. Friends and colleagues treat them with contempt. And no-one wants to marry a gambler, for they think:	NA
dn31:11.3	‘This individual is a gambler—they’re not able to support a partner.’	NA
dn31:11.4	These are the six drawbacks of habitually gambling.	NA
dn31:12.0	9. Six Drawbacks of Bad Friends	NA
dn31:12.1	There are these six drawbacks of bad friends.	NA
dn31:12.2	You become friends and companions with those who are addicts, carousers, drunkards, frauds, swindlers, and thugs.	NA
dn31:12.3	These are the six drawbacks of bad friends.	NA
dn31:13.0	10. Six Drawbacks of Laziness	NA
dn31:13.1	There are these six drawbacks of habitual laziness.	NA
dn31:13.2	You don’t get your work done because you think: ‘It’s too cold! It’s too hot. It’s too late! It’s too early! I’m too hungry! I’m too full!’	NA
dn31:13.3	By dwelling on so many excuses for not working, you don’t make any more money, and the money you already have runs out.	NA
dn31:13.4	These are the six drawbacks of habitual laziness.”	NA
dn31:13.5	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
dn31:13.6	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	NA
dn31:14.1	“Some are just drinking buddies,	NA
dn31:14.2	some call you their dear, dear friend,	NA
dn31:14.3	but a true friend is one	NA
dn31:14.4	who stands by you in need.	NA
dn31:14.5	Sleeping late, adultery,	NA
dn31:14.6	making enemies, harmfulness,	NA
dn31:14.7	bad friends, and avarice:	NA
dn31:14.8	these six grounds ruin a person.	NA
dn31:14.9	With bad friends, bad comrades,	NA
dn31:14.10	bad behavior and alms-resort,	NA
dn31:14.11	a man falls to ruin	NA
dn31:14.12	in both this world and the next.	NA
dn31:14.13	Dice, women, toddy, song and dance;	_Vārunī_ is said to have been distilled from hogweed with palm sap, “toddy”.
dn31:14.14	sleeping by day and roaming at night;	NA
dn31:14.15	bad friends, and avarice:	NA
dn31:14.16	these six grounds ruin a person.	NA
dn31:14.17	They play dice and drink beer,	NA
dn31:14.18	and consort with women loved by others.	NA
dn31:14.19	Associating with the worse, not the better,	NA
dn31:14.20	they diminish like the waning moon.	NA
dn31:14.21	One who is broke and destitute due to toddy,	Assume _vāruṇī_ is a truncated instrumental.
dn31:14.22	thirsty, drinking in the bar,	NA
dn31:14.23	drowning in debt,	NA
dn31:14.24	will quickly lose their way.	_Kāhiti_ is third person singular future of _karoti_.
dn31:14.25	When you’re in the habit of sleeping late,	NA
dn31:14.26	seeing night as time to rise,	NA
dn31:14.27	and always getting drunk,	NA
dn31:14.28	you can’t keep up the household life.	NA
dn31:14.29	‘Too cold, too hot,	NA
dn31:14.30	too late,’ they say.	NA
dn31:14.31	When the young neglect their work like this,	NA
dn31:14.32	riches pass them by.	The subcommentary explains _atthā_ as _dhanā_ (“riches”).
dn31:14.33	But one who considers heat and cold	NA
dn31:14.34	as no more than blades of grass—	NA
dn31:14.35	he does his duties as a man,	NA
dn31:14.36	and happiness never fails.”	NA
dn31:15.0	11. Fake Friends	NA
dn31:15.1	“Householder’s son, you should recognize these four enemies disguised as friends:	NA
dn31:15.2	the taker, the talker, the flatterer, the spender.	NA
dn31:16.1	You can recognize a fake friend who’s all take on four grounds.	NA
dn31:16.2	Your possessions end up theirs.	NA
dn31:16.3	Giving little, they expect a lot.	NA
dn31:16.4	They do their duty out of fear.	NA
dn31:16.5	They associate for their own advantage.	NA
dn31:16.6	You can recognize a fake friend who’s all take on these four grounds.	NA
dn31:17.1	You can recognize a fake friend who’s all talk on four grounds.	NA
dn31:17.2	They’re hospitable in the past. They’re hospitable in the future. They’re full of meaningless pleasantries. When something needs doing in the present they point to their own misfortune.	NA
dn31:17.3	You can recognize a fake friend who’s all talk on these four grounds.	NA
dn31:18.1	You can recognize a fake friend who’s a flatterer on four grounds.	NA
dn31:18.2	They support you equally in doing bad and doing good. They praise you to your face, and put you down behind your back.	NA
dn31:18.3	You can recognize a fake friend who’s a flatterer on these four grounds.	NA
dn31:19.1	You can recognize a fake friend who’s a spender on four grounds.	NA
dn31:19.2	They accompany you when drinking, roaming the streets at night, frequenting festivals, and gambling.	NA
dn31:19.3	You can recognize a fake friend who’s a spender on these four grounds.”	NA
dn31:19.4	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
dn31:19.5	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	NA
dn31:20.1	“One friend is all take,	NA
dn31:20.2	another all talk;	NA
dn31:20.3	one’s just a flatterer,	NA
dn31:20.4	and one’s a comrade who spends.	NA
dn31:20.5	An astute person understands	NA
dn31:20.6	these four enemies for what they are	NA
dn31:20.7	and keeps them at a distance,	NA
dn31:20.8	as they’d shun a risky road.”	NA
dn31:21.0	12. Good-Hearted Friends	NA
dn31:21.1	“Householder’s son, you should recognize these four good-hearted friends:	NA
dn31:21.2	the helper, the friend in good times and bad, the counselor, and the one who’s sympathetic.	NA
dn31:22.1	You can recognize a good-hearted friend who’s a helper on four grounds.	NA
dn31:22.2	They guard you when you’re negligent. They guard your property when you’re negligent. They keep you safe in times of danger. When something needs doing, they provide you with twice the money you need.	NA
dn31:22.3	You can recognize a good-hearted friend who’s a helper on these four grounds.	NA
dn31:23.1	You can recognize a good-hearted friend who’s the same in good times and bad on four grounds.	NA
dn31:23.2	They tell you secrets. They keep your secrets. They don’t abandon you in times of trouble. They’d even give their life for your welfare.	NA
dn31:23.3	You can recognize a good-hearted friend who’s the same in good times and bad on these four grounds.	NA
dn31:24.1	You can recognize a good-hearted friend who’s a counselor on four grounds.	NA
dn31:24.2	They keep you from doing bad. They support you in doing good. They teach you what you do not know. They explain the path to heaven.	NA
dn31:24.3	You can recognize a good-hearted friend who’s a counselor on these four grounds.	NA
dn31:25.1	You can recognize a good-hearted friend who’s sympathetic on four grounds.	NA
dn31:25.2	They don’t delight in your misfortune. They delight in your good fortune. They keep others from criticizing you. They encourage praise of you.	NA
dn31:25.3	You can recognize a good-hearted friend who’s sympathetic on these four grounds.”	NA
dn31:25.4	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
dn31:25.5	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	NA
dn31:26.1	“A friend who’s a helper,	NA
dn31:26.2	one the same in both pleasure and pain,	NA
dn31:26.3	a friend of good counsel,	NA
dn31:26.4	and one of sympathy;	NA
dn31:26.5	an astute person understands	NA
dn31:26.6	these four friends for what they are	NA
dn31:26.7	and carefully looks after them,	NA
dn31:26.8	like a mother the child at her breast.	NA
dn31:26.9	The astute and virtuous	NA
dn31:26.10	shine like a burning flame.	NA
dn31:26.11	They pick up riches as bees	NA
dn31:26.12	roaming round pick up pollen.	NA
dn31:26.13	And their riches proceed to grow,	NA
dn31:26.14	like a termite mound piling up.	NA
dn31:26.15	In gathering wealth like this,	NA
dn31:26.16	a householder does enough for their family.	NA
dn31:26.17	And they’d hold on to friends	NA
dn31:26.18	by dividing their wealth in four.	NA
dn31:26.19	One portion is to enjoy.	NA
dn31:26.20	Two parts invest in work.	NA
dn31:26.21	And the fourth should be kept	NA
dn31:26.22	for times of trouble.”	NA
dn31:27.0	13. Covering the Six Directions	NA
dn31:27.1	“And how, householder’s son, does a noble disciple cover the six directions?	Having explained the six drains on wealth, the Buddha moves on to the next item in the table of contents.
dn31:27.2	These six directions should be recognized:	NA
dn31:27.3	parents as the east, tutors as the south, partner and children as the west, friends and colleagues as the north, bondservants and workers as beneath, and ascetics and brahmins as above.	Parents are in the east because that is where the sun is born. Tutors are to the south (_dakkhiṇā_) as they are owed an offering (_dakkhiṇā_). Family is one’s legacy, so they lie with the setting sun in the west. Good friends keep you on the upright way to the north. Servants support you and make your life possible, like the earth below. And spiritual teachers lead you to heaven or transcendence above.
dn31:28.1	A child should serve their parents as the eastern quarter in five ways, thinking:	NA
dn31:28.2	‘I will support those who supported me. I’ll do my duty for them. I’ll maintain the family lineage. I’ll take care of the inheritance. When they have passed away, I’ll make an offering on their behalf.’	NA
dn31:28.3	Parents served by the children in these five ways show sympathy to them in five ways.	NA
dn31:28.4	They keep them from doing bad. They support them in doing good. They train them in a profession. They connect them with a suitable partner. They transfer the inheritance in due time.	NA
dn31:28.5	Parents served by their children in these five ways show sympathy to them in these five ways.	NA
dn31:28.6	And that’s how the eastern quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril.	NA
dn31:29.1	A pupil should serve their tutor as the southern quarter in five ways:	NA
dn31:29.2	by rising for them, by serving them, by listening well, by looking after them, and by carefully learning their profession.	NA
dn31:29.3	Tutors served by their pupils in these five ways show sympathy to them in five ways.	NA
dn31:29.4	They make sure they’re well educated and well drilled in memorization. They clearly explain all the knowledge of the profession. They introduce them to their friends and colleagues. They provide protection in every region.	“Protection in every region” (_disāsu parittāṇaṁ_) refers to when the student has completed their studies and goes off to travel, the teacher does what they can to ensure their safety in other regions.
dn31:29.5	Tutors served by their pupils in these five ways show sympathy to them in these five ways.	NA
dn31:29.6	And that’s how the southern quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril.	NA
dn31:30.1	A husband should serve his wife as the western quarter in five ways:	NA
dn31:30.2	by treating her with honor, by not looking down on her, by not being unfaithful, by relinquishing authority to her, and by presenting her with adornments.	Marriage is based on mutual care and respect, not on dominance and obedience.
dn31:30.3	A wife served by her husband in these five ways shows sympathy to him in five ways.	NA
dn31:30.4	She’s well-organized in her work. She manages the domestic help. She’s not unfaithful. She preserves his earnings. She’s deft and tireless in all her duties.	NA
dn31:30.5	A wife served by her husband in these five ways shows sympathy to him in these five ways.	NA
dn31:30.6	And that’s how the western quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril.	NA
dn31:31.1	A gentleman should serve his friends and colleagues as the northern quarter in five ways:	NA
dn31:31.2	giving, kindly words, taking care, equality, and not using tricky words.	NA
dn31:31.3	Friends and colleagues served by a gentleman in these five ways show sympathy to him in five ways.	NA
dn31:31.4	They guard him when they’re negligent. They guard his property when they’re negligent. They keep him safe in times of danger. They don’t abandon him in times of trouble. They honor his descendants.	NA
dn31:31.5	Friends and colleagues served by a gentleman in these five ways show sympathy to him in these five ways.	NA
dn31:31.6	And that’s how the northern quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril.	NA
dn31:32.1	A master should serve their bondservants and workers as the lower quarter in five ways:	NA
dn31:32.2	by organizing work according to ability, by paying food and wages, by nursing them when sick, by sharing special treats, and by giving time off work.	NA
dn31:32.3	Bondservants and workers served by a master in these five ways show sympathy to him in five ways.	NA
dn31:32.4	They get up first, and go to bed last. They don’t steal. They do their work well. And they promote a good reputation.	NA
dn31:32.5	Bondservants and workers served by a master in these five ways show sympathy to him in these five ways.	NA
dn31:32.6	And that’s how the lower quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril.	NA
dn31:33.1	A gentleman should serve ascetics and brahmins as the upper quarter in five ways:	NA
dn31:33.2	by loving deeds of body, speech, and mind, by not turning them away at the gate, and by providing them with material needs.	NA
dn31:33.3	Ascetics and brahmins served by a gentleman in these five ways show sympathy to him in six ways.	NA
dn31:33.4	They keep him from doing bad. They support him in doing good. They think of him with kindly thoughts. They teach him what he does not know. They clarify what he’s already learned. They explain the path to heaven.	NA
dn31:33.5	Ascetics and brahmins served by a gentleman in these five ways show sympathy to him in these six ways.	NA
dn31:33.6	And that’s how the upper quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril.”	NA
dn31:33.7	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
dn31:33.8	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	NA
dn31:34.1	“Parents are the east,	NA
dn31:34.2	tutors the south,	NA
dn31:34.3	wives and child the west,	NA
dn31:34.4	friends and colleagues the north,	NA
dn31:34.5	servants and workers below,	NA
dn31:34.6	and ascetics and brahmins above.	NA
dn31:34.7	By honoring these quarters	NA
dn31:34.8	a householder does enough for their family.	NA
dn31:34.9	The astute and the virtuous,	NA
dn31:34.10	the gentle and the articulate,	NA
dn31:34.11	the humble and the kind:	NA
dn31:34.12	they’re the kind who win glory.	NA
dn31:34.13	The diligent, not lazy,	NA
dn31:34.14	those not disturbed by troubles,	NA
dn31:34.15	those consistent in conduct, the intelligent:	NA
dn31:34.16	they’re the kind who win glory.	NA
dn31:34.17	The inclusive, the makers of friends,	NA
dn31:34.18	the bountiful, those rid of stinginess,	NA
dn31:34.19	those who lead, train, and persuade:	NA
dn31:34.20	they’re the kind who win glory.	NA
dn31:34.21	Giving and kindly words,	NA
dn31:34.22	taking care here,	NA
dn31:34.23	and treating equally in worldly conditions,	NA
dn31:34.24	as befits them in each case;	NA
dn31:34.25	these ways of being inclusive in the world	NA
dn31:34.26	are like a moving chariot’s linchpin.	NA
dn31:34.27	If there were no such ways of being inclusive,	NA
dn31:34.28	neither mother nor father	NA
dn31:34.29	would be respected and honored	NA
dn31:34.30	for what they’ve done for their children.	NA
dn31:34.31	But since these ways of being inclusive do exist,	NA
dn31:34.32	the astute do regard them well,	NA
dn31:34.33	so they achieve greatness	NA
dn31:34.34	and are praised.”	NA
dn31:35.1	When this was said, Sigālaka the householder’s son said to the Buddha,	NA
dn31:35.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent!	NA
dn31:35.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
dn31:35.4	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
dn31:35.5	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	NA
dn32:0.1	Long Discourses 32	NA
dn32:0.2	The Āṭānāṭiya Protection	NA
dn32:1.0	1. The First Recitation Section	NA
dn32:1.1	So I have heard.	This discourse bears similarities to the Mahāsamayasutta ([dn20]()). Thematically, that discourse is about the devotion of the deities, whereas this is about protection for the mendicants. | I believe this is only place in whole canon that lists the _bhāṇavāra_ at the start.
dn32:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.	NA
dn32:1.3	Then, late at night, the four great kings—with large armies of spirits, centaurs, gnomes, and dragons—set guards, troops, and wards at the four quarters and then, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak with their beauty, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.	NA
dn32:1.4	Before sitting down to one side, some spirits bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.	NA
dn32:2.1	Seated to one side, the Great King Vessavaṇa said to the Buddha,	Here Kuvera is called Vessavaṇa, which our text below explains as being derived from the name of his city.
dn32:2.2	“Sir, some high spirits have confidence in the Buddha,	NA
dn32:2.3	some do not.	NA
dn32:2.4	Some middling spirits have confidence in the Buddha,	NA
dn32:2.5	some do not.	NA
dn32:2.6	Some low spirits have confidence in the Buddha,	NA
dn32:2.7	some do not.	NA
dn32:2.8	But mostly the spirits don’t have confidence in the Buddha.	NA
dn32:2.9	Why is that?	NA
dn32:2.10	Because the Buddha teaches them to refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct, and consuming beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.	NA
dn32:2.11	But mostly they don’t refrain from such things.	NA
dn32:2.12	They don’t like that or approve of it.	NA
dn32:2.13	Sir, there are disciples of the Buddha who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest that are quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat.	NA
dn32:2.14	There dwell high spirits who have no confidence in the Buddha’s dispensation.	NA
dn32:2.15	To give them confidence, may the Buddha please learn the Āṭānāṭiya protection for the guarding, protection, safety, and comfort of the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.”	NA
dn32:2.16	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
dn32:3.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, on that occasion Great King Vessavaṇa recited the Āṭānāṭiya protection.	“Protection” is _rakkhā_, which is a synonym of _paritta_.
dn32:3.2	“Hail Vipassī,	For these verses, I lean heavily on the translation by Ānandajoti, *[The Āṭānāṭiya Discourse](https://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/Texts-and-Translations/Safeguard/03-Tatiyakabhanavaram.htm)*. They are commonly recited in Theravada countries today. The recital begins with the seven Buddhas, for which see [dn14]().
dn32:3.3	the glorious Clear-eyed One!	NA
dn32:3.4	Hail Sikhī,	NA
dn32:3.5	sympathetic for all beings!	NA
dn32:3.6	Hail Vessabhū,	NA

dn32:3.8	Hail Kakusandha,	NA
dn32:3.9	crusher of Māra’s army!	NA
dn32:3.10	Hail Koṇāgamana,	NA
dn32:3.11	the brahmin who has lived the life!	NA
dn32:3.12	Hail Kassapa,	NA
dn32:3.13	everywhere free!	NA
dn32:3.14	Hail Aṅgīrasa,	Here Aṅgīrasa is used as a name rather than a descriptive epithet. Aṅgīras was one of the Vedic sages and the Aṅgīrasas are his descendants. Aṅgīras is regarded as the _pravara_ or revered ancestor of the Gotama clan. Both names are associated with light: _aṅgīrasa_ shares a root and is often synonymous with _agni_ (“fire”), while _gotama_ means “light dispelling dark”.
dn32:3.15	the glorious Sakyan!	NA
dn32:3.16	He taught this Dhamma	NA
dn32:3.17	that dispels all suffering.	NA
dn32:3.18	Those in the world who are quenched,	NA
dn32:3.19	truly discerning,	NA
dn32:3.20	not backbiters; such people	NA
dn32:3.21	being great of heart and intrepid,	NA
dn32:3.22	revere that Gotama;	NA
dn32:3.23	he who is helpful to gods and humans,	NA
dn32:3.24	accomplished in knowledge and conduct,	NA
dn32:3.25	great of heart and intrepid.	NA
dn32:4.1	Where rises the sun—	Here begins a series of verses dedicated to the divinities in each of the four quarters, proceeding in the standard way: east, south, west, north.
dn32:4.2	Aditi’s child, the great orb,	NA
dn32:4.3	who in his rising	NA
dn32:4.4	dispels the night,	NA
dn32:4.5	and of whom, when sun has risen,	NA
dn32:4.6	it is said to be the day—	NA
dn32:4.7	there is a deep lake,	NA
dn32:4.8	an ocean of flowing waters.	NA
dn32:4.9	That’s how they understand that lake there,	This is according to the commentary (_taṁ rahadaṁ tattha evaṁ jānanti_).
dn32:4.10	as an ocean of flowing waters.	NA
dn32:4.11	From here that is the eastern quarter,	NA
dn32:4.12	so the people say.	NA
dn32:4.13	That quarter is warded	NA
dn32:4.14	by a great king, glorious,	NA
dn32:4.15	the lord of the centaurs;	NA
dn32:4.16	his name is Dhataraṭṭha.	NA
dn32:4.17	He delights in song and dance,	NA
dn32:4.18	honored by the centaurs.	NA
dn32:4.19	And he has many mighty sons	NA
dn32:4.20	all of one name, so I’ve heard.	NA
dn32:4.21	Eighty, and ten, and one—	NA
dn32:4.22	all of them named Indra.	NA
dn32:4.23	After seeing the Awakened One,	NA
dn32:4.24	the Buddha, kinsman of the Sun,	NA
dn32:4.25	they revere him from afar,	NA
dn32:4.26	the one great of heart and intrepid.	NA
dn32:4.27	Homage to you, O thoroughbred!	NA
dn32:4.28	Homage to you, supreme among men!	NA
dn32:4.29	You examine us skillfully;	This relates back to the basic problem facing the _yakkhas_: shame. They know what they do is wrong, but they like it and hence feel shame when hearing the Dhamma. But the Buddha treats them with respect, without shaming or bias, and thus is able to lead them to the good. The commentary implicitly connects this line with [dn30:2.1.2](), where the Buddha “examines” (_samekkhati_) the population for their individual and shared traits.
dn32:4.30	the non-humans bow to you.	NA
dn32:4.31	We’ve been asked many a time,	NA
dn32:4.32	‘Do you bow to Gotama the victor?’	NA
dn32:4.33	And so we ought to declare:	NA
dn32:4.34	‘We bow to Gotama the victor,	NA
dn32:4.35	accomplished in knowledge and conduct!	NA
dn32:4.36	We bow to Gotama the awakened!’	NA
dn32:5.1	It’s where the departed go, they say,	The south has the shortest and least auspicious description. To the extent that it relates to physical geography, this echoes the perception of northerners at the time that the south of India lay outside the “civilized” realms (_āryāvarta_).
dn32:5.2	who are dividers and backbiters,	NA
dn32:5.3	killers and hunters,	NA
dn32:5.4	bandits and frauds.	NA
dn32:5.5	From here that is the southern quarter,	NA
dn32:5.6	so the people say.	NA
dn32:5.7	That quarter is warded	NA
dn32:5.8	by a great king, glorious,	NA
dn32:5.9	the lord of the gnomes;	NA
dn32:5.10	his name is Virūḷha.	NA
dn32:5.11	He delights in song and dance,	NA
dn32:5.12	honored by the gnomes.	NA

dn32:5.21	Homage to you, O thoroughbred!	NA

dn32:6.1	Where sets the sun—	The description of the west mirrors the east.
dn32:6.2	Aditi’s child, the great orb,	NA
dn32:6.3	who in his setting	NA
dn32:6.4	ends the day,	NA
dn32:6.5	and of whom, when sun has set,	NA
dn32:6.6	it is said to be the night—	NA
dn32:6.7	there is a deep lake in that place,	NA
dn32:6.8	an ocean of flowing waters.	NA
dn32:6.9	That’s how they understand that lake there,	NA
dn32:6.10	as an ocean of flowing waters.	NA
dn32:6.11	From here that is the western quarter,	NA
dn32:6.12	so the people say.	NA
dn32:6.13	That quarter is warded	NA
dn32:6.14	by a great king, glorious,	NA
dn32:6.15	the lord of the dragons;	NA
dn32:6.16	his name is Virūpakkha.	NA
dn32:6.17	He delights in song and dance,	NA
dn32:6.18	honored by the dragons.	NA
dn32:6.19	And he has many mighty sons	NA

dn32:6.36	We bow to Gotama the awakened!’	NA
dn32:7.1	Where the lovely land north of Kuru is,	The description of the north is by far the most elaborate. | The “land north of Kuru” (_uttarakuru_) is mentioned in Sanskrit and Greek literature, where it sometimes appears as an actual country and other times as a place of fantasy. Attempts to locate it in a specific region in or beyond the Himalayas have proven inconclusive.
dn32:7.2	and the beautiful Mount Meru,	Meru is another place that appears sometimes as a physical mountain and other times purely mystical. As home of the gods ([snp3.11:4.3]()), its peak is accessible only by psychic powers ([thig14.1:19.3](), [mn50:30.1]()). It is the center of the world in Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain cosmologies. Today it is sometimes identified with Mount Kailash.

dn32:7.4	are unselfish, without possessions.	This agrees with the description at [an9.21:1.3]().
dn32:7.5	They do not sow the seed,	NA
dn32:7.6	nor do they draw the plough.	NA
dn32:7.7	The rice eaten by people	Due to their lack of selfishness, they live in a kinder state of nature, which we selfish humans have lost ([dn27:16.1]()).
dn32:7.8	ripens in untilled soil,	NA
dn32:7.9	free of powder or husk, pure,	NA
dn32:7.10	fragrant, with only the rice-grain.	NA
dn32:7.11	After cooking in a tandoor oven,	_Tuṇḍikīre_ is explained by the commentary as “firestone”. In the notes to his translation, Walshe suggests a relation with tandoor, which has been found as far back as the Indus Valley Civilization, a millennium before the Buddha.
dn32:7.12	they enjoy eating that food.	NA
dn32:7.13	Having prepared a cow with hooves uncloven,	Cloven and uncloven was an important classification of animals in the Dharmaśāstras.
dn32:7.14	they’re drawn about from place to place.	NA
dn32:7.15	Having prepared a beast with hooves uncloven,	NA
dn32:7.16	they’re drawn about from place to place.	NA
dn32:7.17	Having prepared a woman-drawn carriage,	The commentary says they were mostly carried on the backs of pregnant women(!). But the verb _anuyanti_ indicates, rather, that they were “drawn along after”, which suggests a rickshaw.
dn32:7.18	they’re drawn about from place to place.	NA
dn32:7.19	Having prepared a man-drawn carriage,	NA
dn32:7.20	they’re drawn about from place to place.	NA

dn32:7.26	that king’s servants	NA
dn32:7.27	tour about in every quarter,	NA
dn32:7.28	provided with heavenly vehicles	NA
dn32:7.29	of elephant and of horse.	NA
dn32:7.30	And there are mansions and palanquins	NA
dn32:7.31	for that great and glorious king.	NA
dn32:7.32	And he has cities, too,	NA
dn32:7.33	well-built in the sky:	NA
dn32:7.34	Āṭānāṭā, Kusināṭā, Parakusināṭā,	The discourse is named after the first of these cities. The name is hard to explain, but all the names in this series have the element _nāṭa_, which is probably the name of the people. One meaning of _nāṭa_ is “dance”, and one of the unique features of this discourse is that each of the Four Great Kings is said to delight in song and dance. There is a long history of dancing divinities in India, and images of dancers go back as far as the Indus Valley Civilization. If we take _nāṭa_ in the sense “the people of the dance”, _kusināṭā_ would therefore be “dancers of the grass” after the _kusa_ grass essential to the Vedic rites of kingship. _Parakusināṭā_ is the “further dancers of the grass”, and _parakusiṭanāṭā_ is probably a variation on that. _Nāṭapuriyā_ is the “citadel of the dancers”. Each of these associates the people of the dance with the idea of protection or authority, agreeing with the context, where the cities are said to belong to a great king. Thus the prefix _āṭā-_ probably stems from _tāṇa_ (“shelter, refuge”; the same root as _paritta_), in the sense of the “refuge of the dancers”.
dn32:7.35	Nāṭapuriyā, and Parakusiṭanāṭā.	Adopt the reading _nāṭapuriyā_ found in Sinhalese-script manuscripts against the Mahāsaṅgīti’s _nāṭasuriyā_.
dn32:7.36	To the north is Kapīvanta,	“Abounding in monkeys”.
dn32:7.37	and Janogha lies beyond.	“Flood of folk”.
dn32:7.38	And there’s Navanavutiya, Ambara-ambaravatiya,	_Navanavutiya_ is “the city of the ninety-nine” i.e. three times thirty-three. | _Ambara_ is “sky”.
dn32:7.39	and the royal capital named Āḷakamandā.	Also encountered at [dn17:1.3.8]() and [dn16:5.18.5](). Alakā is the capital of Kuvera in Sanskrit sources.
dn32:7.40	The Great King Kuvera, dear sir,	NA
dn32:7.41	has a capital named Visāṇā,	The city Visāṇa is not encountered elsewhere, but it means “horn”, possibly reinforcing the importance of “song and dance”.
dn32:7.42	which is why the great king	NA
dn32:7.43	is called ‘Vessavaṇa’.	NA
dn32:7.44	These each individually inform the King:	NA
dn32:7.45	Tatolā, Tattalā, Tatotalā,	These three names appear to be purely onomatopoeic, perhaps echoing musical sounds.
dn32:7.46	Ojasi, Tejasi, Tatojasi,	These names suggest a connection with sustenance: “Nutritive”, “Powerful”, “Nourished by That”.
dn32:7.47	Sūra, Rājā, Ariṭṭha, and Nemi.	These are a set of associated solar names. Ariṭṭha and Nemi appear compounded in Sanskrit, Ariṣṭanemi, which evokes the powerful chariot of a conqueror (“indestructible rim”, Rig Veda 1.89.6, 1.180.10, 3.53.17, 10.178.1). It was the name of the 22nd Jain _tīrthaṅkara_, and in Brahmanical texts of several figures, including a dragon (Mahābhārata 1.59.39a, 1114.62a, etc.) and an Asura king (Bhāgavatapurāṇa 8.6.31, 8.10.10). Along with the divine steed Tārkṣya, he is associated with Garuḍa, and was probably originally an epithet for the unstoppable wheel of the Sun, Sūra. This line, then, while a simple list of four names in Pali, appears to be a fragmented memory of a Vedic conception which might be translated: “King Sun, (the wheel) of indestructible rim”.
dn32:7.48	There is a lake there too named Dharaṇī,	_Dharaṇī_ the “bearer” is also a pregnant woman or Mother Earth.
dn32:7.49	whence the clouds rain forth,	NA
dn32:7.50	and the rains disperse.	NA
dn32:7.51	There is a hall there too named Sālavatī,	_Sāla_ means “hall” or “sal tree”, but the commentary says it was surrounded by creepers of that name.
dn32:7.52	where the spirits frequent.	NA
dn32:7.53	There the trees are ever in fruit,	NA
dn32:7.54	with many different flocks of birds.	NA
dn32:7.55	Peacocks and herons call out there,	NA
dn32:7.56	and the sweet cuckoos too.	NA
dn32:7.57	One bird cries out ‘Live, live!’,	NA
dn32:7.58	another ‘Lift up your heart!’	NA
dn32:7.59	There are cocks and kookaburras,	_Kuḷīrakā_ appears to be the name of a crab-eating bird (_kuḷīra_). In honor of my native country, I name it after the kookaburra, which eats crabs and is renowned for its cry.
dn32:7.60	and in the wood the woodpeckers.	In [ja547:426.2]() we find _koṭṭhā pokkharasātakā_, where the _koṭṭha_ is evidently a woodpecker. _Satapatta_ can mean woodpecker or lotus (or crane or peacock), and perhaps there is an association here, the “hundred-leaved [bird] of the lotus pond”.
dn32:7.61	The parrots and mynah cry out there,	NA
dn32:7.62	and the ‘little stick-boy’ birds.	NA
dn32:7.63	Kuvera’s pond of rushes	NA
dn32:7.64	is lovely all the time.	NA
dn32:7.65	From here that is the northern quarter,	NA
dn32:7.66	so the people say.	NA
dn32:7.67	That quarter is warded	NA
dn32:7.68	by a great king, glorious,	NA
dn32:7.69	the lord of spirits;	NA
dn32:7.70	his name is Kuvera.	NA
dn32:7.71	He delights in song and dance,	NA
dn32:7.72	honored by the spirits.	NA
dn32:7.73	And he has many mighty sons	NA
dn32:7.74	all of one name, so I’ve heard.	NA
dn32:7.75	Eighty, and ten, and one—	NA
dn32:7.76	all of them named Indra.	NA
dn32:7.77	After seeing the Awakened One,	NA
dn32:7.78	the Buddha, kinsman of the Sun,	NA
dn32:7.79	they revere him from afar,	NA
dn32:7.80	the one great of heart and intrepid.	NA
dn32:7.81	Homage to you, O thoroughbred!	NA
dn32:7.82	Homage to you, supreme among men!	NA
dn32:7.83	You examine us skillfully;	NA
dn32:7.84	the non-humans bow to you.	NA
dn32:7.85	We’ve been asked many a time,	NA
dn32:7.86	‘Do you bow to Gotama the victor?’	NA
dn32:7.87	And so we ought to declare:	NA
dn32:7.88	‘We bow to Gotama the victor,	NA
dn32:7.89	accomplished in knowledge and conduct!	NA
dn32:7.90	We bow to Gotama the awakened!’	NA
dn32:8.1	This, good fellow, is the Āṭānāṭiya protection for the guarding, protection, safety, and comfort of the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.	NA
dn32:8.2	The monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen should learn this Āṭānāṭiya protection well and completely memorize it.	NA
dn32:8.3	If anyone who does so is approached while walking, standing, sitting, or lying down by any non-human being with malicious intent—including males, females, boys, girls, chief ministers, councillors, and servants among the spirits, centaurs, gnomes, and dragons—	NA
dn32:8.4	that non-human will receive no homage or respect in any village or town.	NA
dn32:8.5	And they will receive no ground or dwelling in my capital of Ālakamandā.	NA
dn32:8.6	Nor will they get to go to the conference of the spirits.	NA
dn32:8.7	In addition, the non-humans would not give or take them in marriage.	NA
dn32:8.8	They’d heap personal abuse on them,	NA
dn32:8.9	drop an empty bowl on their head,	NA
dn32:8.10	and even split their head into seven pieces!	NA
dn32:9.1	For there are, good fellow, non-humans who are fierce, cruel, and violent. They don’t obey the Great Kings or their men or their men’s men.	NA
dn32:9.2	They’re said to be rebelling against the Great Kings.	NA
dn32:9.3	They’re just like the bandits in the king of Magadha’s realm	NA
dn32:9.4	who don’t obey the king, his men, or his men’s men,	NA
dn32:9.5	and are said to be rebelling against the king.	NA

dn32:9.7	NA	NA
dn32:9.8	If any non-human being with malicious intent—including males, females, boys, girls, ministers, councillors, and servants among the spirits, centaurs, gnomes, and dragons—approaches a monk, nun, layman, or laywoman while walking, standing, sitting, or lying down,	NA
dn32:9.9	one ought to yell, cry, and scream to the spirits, great spirits, generals, great generals:	NA
dn32:9.10	‘This spirit’s got me! This spirit’s entered me! This spirit’s annoying me! This spirit’s harassing me! This spirit’s hurting me! This spirit’s harming me! This spirit won’t let me go!’	NA
dn32:10.1	To what spirits, great spirits, generals, great generals?	NA
dn32:10.2	‘Indra, Soma, and Varuṇa,	For these gods, see my comment on [dn13:25.2](). Here I will comment on the names not discussed elsewhere, especially in [dn20]().
dn32:10.3	Bhāradvāja, the Progenitor,	This is presumably Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya, the rishi ancestor of the Bhāradvāja clan, many members of which are encountered in the suttas. It is unusual to find him listed along with the primary Vedic gods. The Bhāradvāja verses are mostly collected in the sixth book of the Rig Veda, where they show a special devotion to the god Pūṣan. See also note on [sn7.1:1.2]().
dn32:10.4	Candana and Kāmaseṭṭha,	NA
dn32:10.5	Kinnughaṇḍu and Nighaṇḍu,	NA

dn32:10.10	Sātāgira, Hemavata,	NA
dn32:10.11	Puṇṇaka, Karatiya, and Guḷa;	These deities appear nowhere else. _Puṇṇaka_ is “full”, _guḷa_ is “lump”, and _karatiya_ is unclear (“bean-like”?).
dn32:10.12	Sivaka and Mucalinda,	The _yakkha_ Sivaka (“blissful, auspicious”) helped Anāthapiṇḍika visit the Buddha ([sn10.8:1.12]()); he is possibly to be identified with Shiva. | The dragon king Mucalinda sheltered the Buddha after his awakening ([ud2.1:2.2]()).
dn32:10.13	Vessāmitta, Yugandhara,	_Yugandhara_ is the tutelary deity of the mountain of that name.
dn32:10.14	Gopāla, Suppagedha,	_Gopāla_ is “cowherd”, an epithet of both Krishna and Shiva.|  _Suppagedha_ (or _supparodha_) is obscure.
dn32:10.15	Hiri, Netti, and Mandiya;	“Shame”, “conduit” (or “craving”), and “stupidity” seem like odd companions.
dn32:10.16	Pañcālacaṇḍa, Āḷavaka,	A saying by Pañcālacaṇḍa at [sn2.7]() is quoted by Udāyī and explained by Ānanda at [an9.42](). He would appear to be the fierce (_caṇḍa_) protector of the Pañcāla clan, but a Pañcālacanda appears as a brahmin teacher (Aitereya Āraṇyaka 3.1.6, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka 7.19, Gopatha Brāhmaṇa 1.1.27n). | Āḷavaka is the tutelary deity of Āḷavī ([sn10.12](), [snp1.10]()).
dn32:10.17	Pajjunna, Sumana, Sumukha,	Pajjuna is Parjanya, the Vedic god of rain, especially the thunderstorm. His daughters appear in [sn1.39]() and [sn1.40](). | _Sumana_ is “Happyheart”, _sumukha_ is “Fairface”.
dn32:10.18	Dadhimukha, Maṇi, Māṇivara, Dīgha,	_Dadhimukha_ is “Milkface”, and in the Mahābhārata is a name of a dragon. | _Maṇi_ is “gem”. | _Māṇivara_ is “fine gem”, although the commentary takes this as two names. | Dīgha is identified by the commentary with Dīgha Parajana of [mn31:21.1]().
dn32:10.19	together with Serīsaka.’	_Serīsaka_ means “of _sirīsa_ wood”, perhaps the tutelary deity of a forest.
dn32:10.20	NA	NA

dn32:11.1	This, good fellow, is the Āṭānāṭiya protection for the guarding, protection, safety, and comfort of the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.	NA
dn32:11.2	Well, now, good fellow, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.”	NA
dn32:11.3	“Please, Great Kings, go at your convenience.”	NA
dn32:11.4	Then the four great kings got up from their seats, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right side, before vanishing right there.	NA
dn32:11.5	And before the other spirits present vanished, some bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right side, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.

dn32:13.5	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
dn32:13.6	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	NA
dn33:0.1	Long Discourses 33	NA
dn33:0.2	Reciting in Concert	NA
dn33:1.1.1	So I have heard.	NA
dn33:1.1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Mallas together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a Mallian town named Pāvā.	This discourse picks up from [dn29:17.1](), where the Buddha urges that the Sangha should gather and recite the Dhamma for the long lasting of the dispensation. There he lists the 37 factors of awakening, a standard early collation of practice-oriented teachings that are primarily collected in the Mahāvagga of the Saṁyutta Nikāya. This discourse is a late one, and appears to be an initial attempt to compile a more thorough list of the Buddha’s teachings. The Sarvāstivāda version of the same discourse formed the basis of one of their seven Abhidhamma books, the Sangītiparyāya.
dn33:1.1.3	There he stayed in Cunda the smith’s mango grove.	At [an10.176]() Cunda asks about the purity of the western brahmins; at [dn16:4.13.5]() = [ud8.5]() he offers the Buddha’s last meal; at [snp1.5]() he asks about a true ascetic.
dn33:1.2.1	Now at that time a new town hall named Ubbhaṭaka had recently been constructed for the Mallas of Pāvā. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all.	The completion of a town hall was celebrated by a talk for the Sakyans [sn35.243:1.2]() and [mn53:2.1](). Such halls were community meeting places that played a central role in civic society and communal decision-making in democratic republics such as the Mallas and the Sakyans. The Buddha’s participation is a sign of his support for their civic and democratic process.
dn33:1.2.2	The Mallas of Pāvā also heard that the Buddha had arrived and was staying in Cunda’s mango grove.	NA
dn33:1.2.3	Then they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
dn33:1.2.4	“Sir, a new town hall named Ubbhaṭaka has recently been constructed for the Mallas of Pāvā. It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all.	NA
dn33:1.2.5	May the Buddha be the first to use it, and only then will the Mallas of Pāvā use it.	NA
dn33:1.2.6	That would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Mallas of Pāvā.”	NA
dn33:1.2.7	The Buddha consented in silence.	NA
dn33:1.3.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, the Mallas got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the new town hall, where they spread carpets all over, prepared seats, set up a water jar, and placed an oil lamp. Then they went back to the Buddha,	NA
dn33:1.3.2	bowed, stood to one side,	NA
dn33:1.3.3	and told him of their preparations, saying,	NA
dn33:1.3.4	NA	NA
dn33:1.3.5	“Please, sir, come at your convenience.”	NA
dn33:1.4.1	Then the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Having washed his feet he entered the town hall and sat against the central column facing east.	NA
dn33:1.4.2	The Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them.	NA
dn33:1.4.3	The Mallas of Pāvā also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Buddha right in front of them.	NA
dn33:1.4.4	The Buddha spent much of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the Mallas with a Dhamma talk. Then he dismissed them,	NA
dn33:1.4.5	“The night is getting late, Vāseṭṭhas.	As at [dn16:5.19.2](), the Mallas are called Vāseṭṭhas after the family lineage of their priest (_purohita_).
dn33:1.4.6	Please go at your convenience.”	NA
dn33:1.4.7	“Yes, sir,” replied the Mallas. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving.	NA
dn33:1.5.1	Soon after they left, the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of mendicants, who were so very silent. He addressed Venerable Sāriputta,	NA
dn33:1.5.2	“Sāriputta, the Saṅgha of mendicants is rid of dullness and drowsiness.	NA
dn33:1.5.3	Give them some Dhamma talk as you feel inspired.	NA
dn33:1.5.4	My back is sore,	NA
dn33:1.5.5	I’ll stretch it.”	The Buddha likewise mentions his bad back and invites another monk to teach in both the other suttas where he is first to teach in a new hall ([mn53:5.3](), [sn35.243:3.4]()), and also on the _uposatha_ at Naḷakapāna ([an10.67](), [an10.68]()). These were all occasions when the community was sitting late into the night.
dn33:1.5.6	“Yes, sir,” Sāriputta replied.	NA
dn33:1.5.7	And then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.	NA
dn33:1.6.1	Now at that time the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan had recently passed away at Pāvā.	As at [dn29:1.3]() and [mn104:2.1](), in both of which the Buddha was in the Sakyan lands at this time. There, the news is conveyed to the Buddha by the novice Cunda. Perhaps he was confused with Cunda the smith.
dn33:1.6.2	With his passing the Jain ascetics split, dividing into two factions, arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words:	NA
dn33:1.6.3	“You don’t understand this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training? You’re practicing wrong. I’m practicing right. I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!”	NA
dn33:1.6.4	You’d think there was nothing but slaughter going on among the Jain ascetics.	NA
dn33:1.6.5	And the Jain Ñātika’s white-clothed lay disciples were disillusioned, dismayed, and disappointed in the Jain ascetics. They were equally disappointed with a teaching and training so poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha, with broken monument and without a refuge.	NA
dn33:1.7.1	Then Sāriputta told the mendicants about these things. He went on to say,	NA
dn33:1.7.2	NA	NA
dn33:1.7.3	NA	NA
dn33:1.7.4	“That’s what happens, reverends, when a teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha.	NA
dn33:1.7.5	But this teaching is well explained and well propounded to us by the Blessed One, emancipating, leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is a fully awakened Buddha.	NA
dn33:1.7.6	You should all recite this in concert, without disputing, so that this spiritual path may last for a long time. That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.	NA
dn33:1.7.7	And what is that teaching?	NA
dn33:1.7.8	NA	NA
dn33:1.7.9.0	1. Ones	NA
dn33:1.7.10	There are teachings grouped by one that have been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	Sāriputta adopts the “Aṅguttara principle” of arranging teachings by number rather than the “Saṁyutta principle” of arrangement by topic. Thus this list of teachings has more in common with the Aṅguttara Nikāya than with the Buddha’s original list of Saṁyutta topics. I note unusual or rare terms, but the references here are meant to be indicative rather than comprehensive.
dn33:1.7.11	You should all recite these in concert, without disputing, so that this spiritual path may last for a long time. That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.	NA
dn33:1.8.1	What are the teachings grouped by one?	NA
dn33:1.8.2	All sentient beings are sustained by food.	[an10.27:10.5](), [an10.28:4.5](), [kp4:1.2](). | Compare Bṛhadāranyaka Upaniṣad 5.12.1, “for all these beings are contained in food”, Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1.11.9, “all these beings live when they partake of food”, Taittirīya Upaniṣad 2.2.1, “any creatures who dwell on earth are produced from food, and by food alone they live.”
dn33:1.8.3	All sentient beings are sustained by conditions.	This phrase is unique, but here _saṅkhārā_ (“conditions”) is a synonym of _āhāra_ (“food, fuel, nutriment”).
dn33:1.8.4	These are the teachings grouped by one that have been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	The paucity of teachings of “one” reflects the fact that the Aṅguttara Nikāya Ones consists mostly of longer teachings that have been split into atoms to artificially create “ones”.
dn33:1.8.5	You should all recite these in concert, without disputing, so that this spiritual path may last for a long time. That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.	NA

Elsewhere found only in Abhidhamma. “Visible and resistant” refers to material phenomena perceivable by the eye. “Invisible and resistant” is a shorthand for material phenomena that are not perceivable by the eye, but which nonetheless impinge on other senses, such as sounds or smells. “Invisible and non-resistant” includes form perceived solely in the mind.

dn33:1.10.121	Immersion with placing the mind and keeping it connected. Immersion without placing the mind, merely keeping it connected. Immersion without placing the mind or keeping it connected.	This threefold presentation of the process of absorption focuses on _vitakka_ (“placing the mind”) and _vicāra_ (“keeping it connected”), looking closely at how they cease (see also [dn34:1.4.7](), [mn128:31.4](), [sn43.3:1.2](), and [an8.63:3.1]()). The standard _jhāna_ formula focuses more on the refinement of feelings, from which perspective the first two stages of immersion here fall under the “rapture and bliss born of seclusion”, while only the third qualifies as “rapture and bliss born of immersion”. Thus Analayo describes the two descriptions' as “complementary perspectives on the same process of deepening concentration” (*Comparative Study*, vol. ii, pg. 739, note 263).

dn33:3.1.103	They settle on that thought, stabilize it, and develop it. As they’ve settled for less and not developed further, their thought leads to rebirth there.	“Settled for less” also occurs at [an8.35:1.9](). Readings vary between _hīne vimuttaṁ_ (“released in what is inferior”, per MS) and _hīne ’dhimuttaṁ_ (“resolved upon what is inferior”). This is an example of an ambiguity between _vi + √muc_ (“release”) and _adhi + √muc_ (“resolve”) that is sometimes seen in Pali texts. The subcommentary reads _vimuttaṁ_ and offers two explanations: “‘Released’ (_vimuttaṁ_) means ‘resolved’ (_adhimuttaṁ_); the meaning is slants, slopes, and inclines. Or else ‘released’ means ‘set free’ (_vissaṭṭhaṁ_).” Given that it is clearly accepted in the commentarial tradition, and that it is the more difficult reading, it seems we must accept _vimuttaṁ_ as the correct reading here. But from context, and from the subcommentary, it has the same sense as _adhimutta_, namely, “resolved upon”. This goes some way to explaining the ambiguity between the two words, as they not only have a similar form, but their meanings can overlap too.

In this sense, mindfulness can be understood as the element of continuity that knits consciousness together in a coherent stream.
