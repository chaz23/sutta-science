cp1:1.1	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	cp1	1	1	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:2.1	“For a hundred thousand eons	cp1	2	1	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:2.2	and four incalculable ages,	cp1	2	2	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:2.3	all my conduct in that period	cp1	2	3	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:2.4	ripens in awakening.	cp1	2	4	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:3.1	Setting aside my conduct	cp1	3	1	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:3.2	in past eons through different lives,	cp1	3	2	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:3.3	I shall speak of my conduct	cp1	3	3	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:3.4	in this eon, hear me.	cp1	3	4	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:4.1	When I lived having plunged	cp1	4	1	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:4.2	into the formidable jungle	cp1	4	2	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:4.3	of empty thickets and glades,	cp1	4	3	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:4.4	my name was Akitti the mortifier.	cp1	4	4	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:5.1	Then, burned by the fires of my mortification,	cp1	5	1	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:5.2	the sovereign of the heaven of the Thirty-three,	cp1	5	2	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:5.3	came to me for alms	cp1	5	3	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:5.4	in the form of a brahmin.	cp1	5	4	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:6.1	I had gathered leaves from the forest	cp1	6	1	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:6.2	without oil or salt,	cp1	6	2	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:6.3	and seeing him standing at my door,	cp1	6	3	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:6.4	I placed them in his pot.	cp1	6	4	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:7.1	After giving him the leaves	cp1	7	1	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:7.2	I turned over my plate,	cp1	7	2	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:7.3	and having given up on seeking more food,	cp1	7	3	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:7.4	I entered my hut of leaves.	cp1	7	4	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:8.1	A second and a third time	cp1	8	1	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:8.2	he came to me.	cp1	8	2	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:8.3	Undisturbed, ungrasping,	cp1	8	3	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:8.4	I gave in just the same way.	cp1	8	4	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:9.1	That is the reason why	cp1	9	1	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:9.2	my body is not discolored.	cp1	9	2	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:9.3	In rapture and bliss free of relishing	cp1	9	3	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:9.4	I spend the day.	cp1	9	4	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:10.1	If even for a month or two	cp1	10	1	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:10.2	I were to find a worthy recipient,	cp1	10	2	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:10.3	undisturbed, unattached,	cp1	10	3	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:10.4	I would give the supreme gift.	cp1	10	4	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:11.1	While giving him that gift	cp1	11	1	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:11.2	I did not wish for fame or profit.	cp1	11	2	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:11.3	Wishing for omniscience	cp1	11	3	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp1:11.4	I performed those deeds.”	cp1	11	4	cp	1	Akitti’s Conduct
cp2:1.1	“Then again when I was	cp2	1	1	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:1.2	a brahmin called Saṅkha,	cp2	1	2	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:1.3	wanting to cross the great ocean,	cp2	1	3	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:1.4	I was on my way to the port.	cp2	1	4	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:2.1	There I saw across the way	cp2	2	1	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:2.2	one self-awakened, undefeated,	cp2	2	2	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:2.3	walking a desert road	cp2	2	3	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:2.4	whose ground was hot and rough.	cp2	2	4	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:3.1	Seeing him across the way,	cp2	3	1	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:3.2	I thought this:	cp2	3	2	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:3.3	‘A field has appeared	cp2	3	3	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:3.4	for a person desiring merit.	cp2	3	4	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:4.1	Now suppose a farmer	cp2	4	1	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:4.2	seeing a fertile field	cp2	4	2	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:4.3	does not sow seed there,	cp2	4	3	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:4.4	then they are not in need of grain.	cp2	4	4	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:5.1	So too, if I, desiring merit,	cp2	5	1	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:5.2	seeing a supreme excellent field,	cp2	5	2	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:5.3	do not render service there,	cp2	5	3	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:5.4	then I am not in need of merit.	cp2	5	4	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:6.1	Or suppose a minister seeking the royal seal	cp2	6	1	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:6.2	of authority over the people of the court,	cp2	6	2	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:6.3	does not give them money and grain,	cp2	6	3	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:6.4	their authority dwindles.	cp2	6	4	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:7.1	So too, if I, desiring merit,	cp2	7	1	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:7.2	seeing an abundantly worthy recipient,	cp2	7	2	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:7.3	do not give gifts to them,	cp2	7	3	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:7.4	I will dwindle in merit.’	cp2	7	4	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:8.1	Reflecting in this way,	cp2	8	1	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:8.2	I took off my sandals	cp2	8	2	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:8.3	and bowed to his feet,	cp2	8	3	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:8.4	giving him an umbrella and sandals.	cp2	8	4	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:9.1	Though I was a hundred times	cp2	9	1	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:9.2	more delicate and dainty than him,	cp2	9	2	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:9.3	fulfilling my generosity,	cp2	9	3	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp2:9.4	I gave like this to him.”	cp2	9	4	cp	2	Saṅkha’s Conduct
cp3:1.1	“Then again when I reigned	cp3	1	1	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:1.3	as the king named Dhanañjaya	cp3	1	3	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:1.4	I was blessed with the ten skillful deeds.	cp3	1	4	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:2.1	From the realm of Kaliṅga	cp3	2	1	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:2.2	brahmins came to me	cp3	2	2	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:2.3	requesting the royal elephant	cp3	2	3	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:2.4	that was lucky and deemed auspicious.	cp3	2	4	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:3.1	‘Our nation is suffering from drought,	cp3	3	1	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:3.2	food is scarce and famine abounds,	cp3	3	2	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct

cp3:3.4	of midnight hue named Añjana.’	cp3	3	4	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:4.1	‘When supplicants come to me	cp3	4	1	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:4.2	it is unbefitting to refuse.	cp3	4	2	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:4.3	Let not my vow be broken,	cp3	4	3	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:4.4	I shall give the mighty elephant.’	cp3	4	4	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:5.1	Taking the elephant by the trunk,	cp3	5	1	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:5.2	and a bejewelled ceremonial vessel,	cp3	5	2	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:5.3	I sprinkled water on the hand,	cp3	5	3	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:5.4	and gave the elephant to the brahmins.	cp3	5	4	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:6.1	When I had given the elephant,	cp3	6	1	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:6.2	my ministers said,	cp3	6	2	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:6.3	‘Why did you give the noble elephant	cp3	6	3	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:6.4	to the supplicants?	cp3	6	4	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:7.1	He was lucky and endowed with the auspicious,	cp3	7	1	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:7.2	supreme victor in battle.	cp3	7	2	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:7.3	Now you have given the elephant,	cp3	7	3	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:7.4	how shall you govern the realm?’	cp3	7	4	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:8.1	‘I would give the entire realm	cp3	8	1	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:8.2	and my physical body as well.	cp3	8	2	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:8.3	Omniscience is precious to me,	cp3	8	3	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp3:8.4	which is why I gave away the elephant.’”	cp3	8	4	cp	3	Kururāja’s Conduct
cp4:1.1	“When I was Lord of the Earth	cp4	1	1	cp	4	Mahāsudassana’s Conduct
cp4:1.2	when I was Lord of the Earth,	cp4	1	2	cp	4	Mahāsudassana’s Conduct
cp4:1.3	my name was Sudassana the Great,	cp4	1	3	cp	4	Mahāsudassana’s Conduct

cp4:3.1	Who needs an umbrella? Who is thirsty?	cp4	3	1	cp	4	Mahāsudassana’s Conduct
cp4:3.3	What person, being naked,	cp4	3	3	cp	4	Mahāsudassana’s Conduct
cp4:3.4	and will put on colorful clothes?	cp4	3	4	cp	4	Mahāsudassana’s Conduct

cp4:4.4	morning and night.	cp4	4	4	cp	4	Mahāsudassana’s Conduct
cp4:5.1	It was not just in ten places,	cp4	5	1	cp	4	Mahāsudassana’s Conduct
cp4:5.2	or even a hundred,	cp4	5	2	cp	4	Mahāsudassana’s Conduct
cp4:5.3	but in many hundreds of places	cp4	5	3	cp	4	Mahāsudassana’s Conduct
cp4:5.4	riches were prepared for supplicants.	cp4	5	4	cp	4	Mahāsudassana’s Conduct
cp4:6.1	By day or by night	cp4	6	1	cp	4	Mahāsudassana’s Conduct
cp4:6.2	if a nomad comes,	cp4	6	2	cp	4	Mahāsudassana’s Conduct

cp4:7.2	for my whole life.	cp4	7	2	cp	4	Mahāsudassana’s Conduct
cp4:7.3	I did not give because I disliked riches,	cp4	7	3	cp	4	Mahāsudassana’s Conduct

cp4:8.2	In order to be free of sickness	cp4	8	2	cp	4	Mahāsudassana’s Conduct

cp4:9.2	in order to fulfill without remainder,	cp4	9	2	cp	4	Mahāsudassana’s Conduct
cp4:9.4	I gave gifts to nomads	cp4	9	4	cp	4	Mahāsudassana’s Conduct

cp5:1.2	high priest for seven kings,	cp5	1	2	cp	5	Mahāgovinda’s Conduct

cp5:1.4	as the brahmin Mahāgovinda.	cp5	1	4	cp	5	Mahāgovinda’s Conduct
cp5:2.1	Then in all seven kingdoms	cp5	2	1	cp	5	Mahāgovinda’s Conduct
cp5:2.2	what I receieved as tribute	cp5	2	2	cp	5	Mahāgovinda’s Conduct

cp8:7.1	Then, stretching out	cp8	7	1	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:7.2	his left and right arms,	cp8	7	2	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:7.3	he raised his joined palms to his head	cp8	7	3	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct

cp8:11.2	when I came here from the longhouse.	cp8	11	2	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:11.3	Understanding my mind,	cp8	11	3	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:11.4	you have come to ask for an eye.	cp8	11	4	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:12.1	Oh! My wish has come true!	cp8	12	1	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:12.2	My intention is fulfilled!	cp8	12	2	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:12.3	Today I shall give to a supplicant	cp8	12	3	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:12.4	a fine gift never before given.’	cp8	12	4	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:13.1	‘Come Sivaka, stand up,	cp8	13	1	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:13.2	do not hesitate or waver.	cp8	13	2	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:13.3	Pluck out even both eyes	cp8	13	3	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:13.4	and give them to the beggar.’	cp8	13	4	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:14.1	And then, urged on by me,	cp8	14	1	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:14.2	Sivaka did as I said.	cp8	14	2	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:14.3	Extracting both eyes,	cp8	14	3	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:14.4	he presented them to the trembling supplicant.	cp8	14	4	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:15.1	‘While planning to give, while giving,	cp8	15	1	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:15.2	and after I had given,	cp8	15	2	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:15.3	my mind did not falter,	cp8	15	3	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:15.4	because it was solely for awakening.	cp8	15	4	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:16.1	It was not because I disliked my eyes,	cp8	16	1	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:16.2	or that I disliked myself,	cp8	16	2	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:16.3	but because omniscience is precious to me,	cp8	16	3	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp8:16.4	that is why I gave away my eyes.’”	cp8	16	4	cp	8	King Sivi’s Conduct
cp9:1.1	“She who was my mother,	cp9	1	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:1.2	the aristocrat lady named Phussatī,	cp9	1	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:1.3	was Sakka’s beloved queen	cp9	1	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:1.4	in past lives.	cp9	1	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:2.1	Knowing that she was at the end of life,	cp9	2	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:2.2	the Lord of Gods said this:	cp9	2	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:2.3	‘I grant you ten favors,	cp9	2	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:2.4	my dear, whatever favor you wish.’	cp9	2	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:3.1	When he said this the queen	cp9	3	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:3.2	replied to Sakka:	cp9	3	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:3.3	‘In what way am I deficient?	cp9	3	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:3.4	How am I displeasing to you?	cp9	3	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:3.5	You send me from this lovely place,	cp9	3	5	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:3.6	like the wind a feeble tree.’	cp9	3	6	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:4.1	When she said this Sakka	cp9	4	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:4.2	replied to her:	cp9	4	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:4.3	‘You have done nothing wrong,	cp9	4	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:4.4	nor are you not beloved to me.	cp9	4	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:5.1	But you life lasts only so long,	cp9	5	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:5.2	your time of death will come.	cp9	5	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:5.3	Accept the ten supreme favors	cp9	5	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:5.4	I offer to you.’	cp9	5	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:6.1	She accepted the offerings of Sakka,	cp9	6	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:6.2	full of joy and happiness.	cp9	6	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:6.3	Having conceived me,	cp9	6	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:6.4	Phussatī was blessed with the ten favors.	cp9	6	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:7.1	Then Phussatī, having passed from there,	cp9	7	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:7.2	was reborn as an aristocrat	cp9	7	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:7.3	in the city of Jetuttara,	cp9	7	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:7.4	where she married Sañjaya.	cp9	7	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:8.1	Once I was conceived in the womb	cp9	8	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:8.2	of my dear mother Phussatī,	cp9	8	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:8.3	because of my power,	cp9	8	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:8.4	my mother always delighted in giving.	cp9	8	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:9.1	She gave to the destitute, the ailing and aging,	cp9	9	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:9.2	to beggars, travelers, and folk,	cp9	9	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:9.3	to ascetics and brahmins, and the dispossessed,	cp9	9	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:9.4	and to those who had nothing.	cp9	9	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:10.1	Having carried me for ten months,	cp9	10	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:10.2	she was proceeding around the city	cp9	10	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:10.3	when Phussatī gave birth to me	cp9	10	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:10.4	in the middle of the peasant’s street.	cp9	10	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:11.1	My name was not from my mother’s side,	cp9	11	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:11.2	nor from my father’s.	cp9	11	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:11.3	I was born there in the peasant’s street,	cp9	11	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:11.4	and that’s why I’m called Vessantara.	cp9	11	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:12.1	When I was a boy	cp9	12	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:12.2	of only eight years old,	cp9	12	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:12.3	sitting in the stilt longhouse,	cp9	12	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:12.4	I thought of giving gifts.	cp9	12	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:13.1	‘I would give my heart and my eyes,	cp9	13	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:13.2	my flesh and blood too.’	cp9	13	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:13.3	I announced that I would give my body,	cp9	13	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:13.4	if anyone asked me.	cp9	13	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:14.1	Reflecting on my state of mind,	cp9	14	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:14.2	so undisturbed and steadfast,	cp9	14	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:14.3	the earth quaked there,	cp9	14	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:14.4	and Mount Sineru, wreathed in forests.	cp9	14	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:15.1	Every fortnight, the fifteenth,	cp9	15	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:15.2	and the sabbath when the moon was full,	cp9	15	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:15.3	I mounted the tusker Paccaya	cp9	15	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:15.4	and went to give gifts.	cp9	15	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:16.1	From the country of Kaliṅga,	cp9	16	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:16.2	the brahmins came to me,	cp9	16	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:16.3	requesting the royal elephant,	cp9	16	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:16.4	that was lucky and deemed as auspicious.	cp9	16	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:17.1	‘Our nation is suffering from drought,	cp9	17	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:17.2	food is scarce and famine abounds,	cp9	17	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:17.3	please give the noble elephant	cp9	17	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:17.4	the all-white supreme elephant.’	cp9	17	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:18.1	‘I give without hesitation	cp9	18	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:18.2	what you ask of me, brahmins.	cp9	18	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:18.3	I do not hide what I have,	cp9	18	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:18.4	for my heart is happy to give.	cp9	18	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:19.1	When supplicants come to me	cp9	19	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:19.2	it is unbefitting to refuse.	cp9	19	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:19.3	Let not my vow be broken,	cp9	19	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:19.4	I shall give the mighty elephant.’	cp9	19	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:20.1	Taking the elephant by the trunk,	cp9	20	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:20.2	and a bejewelled ceremonial vessel,	cp9	20	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:20.3	I sprinkled water on the hand,	cp9	20	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:20.4	and gave the elephant to the brahmins.	cp9	20	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:21.1	Then again when I was giving	cp9	21	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:21.2	the all-white supreme elephant,	cp9	21	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:21.3	the earth quaked again,	cp9	21	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:21.4	and Mount Sineru, wreathed in forests.	cp9	21	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:22.1	At the gift of the tusker,	cp9	22	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:22.2	angry townsfolk gathered	cp9	22	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:22.3	and banished me from my kingdom, saying:	cp9	22	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:22.4	‘Go to Crooked Mountain.’	cp9	22	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:23.1	While they were ejecting me,	cp9	23	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:23.2	I was undisturbed and steadfast,	cp9	23	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:23.3	I asked one favor:	cp9	23	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:23.4	to perform a great offering.	cp9	23	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:24.1	When I asked, all the townsfolk	cp9	24	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:24.2	granted me that one favor.	cp9	24	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:24.3	Sounding the drums,	cp9	24	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:24.4	I gave a great offering.	cp9	24	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:25.1	And as the sound went forth,	cp9	25	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:25.2	there was a great tumult and upset.	cp9	25	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:25.3	They drove me out because of giving,	cp9	25	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:25.4	but I just gave again.	cp9	25	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:26.1	Elephants, horses, chariots,	cp9	26	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:26.2	male and female slaves, cattle, and riches:	cp9	26	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:26.3	after giving this great gift	cp9	26	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:26.4	I then left the city.	cp9	26	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:27.1	After leaving the city,	cp9	27	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:27.2	I turned back to look,	cp9	27	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:27.3	at which the earth quaked,	cp9	27	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:27.4	and Mount Sineru, wreathed in forests.	cp9	27	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:28.1	Having given away my four-horse chariot,	cp9	28	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:28.2	I was standing at the crossroads	cp9	28	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:28.3	alone with no partner,	cp9	28	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:28.4	and I said to Queen Maddi:	cp9	28	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:29.1	‘Maddi, you take Kaṇhā,	cp9	29	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:29.2	for she, as the younger sister, is the lighter.	cp9	29	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:29.3	I shall take Jāli,	cp9	29	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:29.4	for he, as the brother, is heavier.’	cp9	29	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:30.1	Like a pink or white lotus,	cp9	30	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:30.2	Maddi picked up Kaṇhājinā.	cp9	30	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:30.3	Like a golden statue,	cp9	30	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:30.4	I picked up Jāli, the aristocrat.	cp9	30	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:31.1	High-born and delicate,	cp9	31	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:31.2	four aristocrat folk	cp9	31	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:31.3	traveled ground even and uneven,	cp9	31	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:31.4	going to Crooked Mountain.	cp9	31	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:32.1	Whenever people would come along,	cp9	32	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:32.2	coming the other way along the road,	cp9	32	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:32.3	we asked them in the middle of the street,	cp9	32	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:32.4	‘Where is Crooked Mountain?’	cp9	32	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:33.1	Seeing us there,	cp9	33	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:33.2	they spoke to us kindly,	cp9	33	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:33.3	‘It will be hard for you,’ they explained,	cp9	33	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:33.4	‘for Crooked Mountain is far.’	cp9	33	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:34.1	If the children saw fruit	cp9	34	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:34.2	on a tree in the forest,	cp9	34	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:34.3	then for the sake of that fruit,	cp9	34	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:34.4	the children cried.	cp9	34	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:35.1	Seeing the children cry,	cp9	35	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:35.2	the tall, massive trees	cp9	35	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:35.3	bent down of their own accord,	cp9	35	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:35.4	within reach of the children.	cp9	35	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:36.1	Seeing this marvel,	cp9	36	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:36.2	so astonishing and hair-raising,	cp9	36	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:36.3	Maddi, beautiful in every limb,	cp9	36	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:36.4	exclaimed in celebration:	cp9	36	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:37.1	‘Such a marvel in the world,	cp9	37	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:37.2	so astonishing and hair-raising,	cp9	37	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:37.3	due to the power of Vessantara,	cp9	37	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:37.4	the trees bent down of their own accord.’	cp9	37	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:38.1	Native spirits, out of compassion,	cp9	38	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:38.2	shortened the path,	cp9	38	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:38.3	so that on the very day they set out,	cp9	38	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:38.4	they arrived at the kingdom of Ceta.	cp9	38	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:39.1	Sixty thousand kings	cp9	39	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:39.2	were living at Mātula then.	cp9	39	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:39.3	All raised their joined palms,	cp9	39	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:39.4	and approached, weeping.	cp9	39	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:40.1	There they held conversation	cp9	40	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:40.2	with the folks of Ceta and their children.	cp9	40	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:40.3	Then, leaving that place,	cp9	40	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:40.4	they arrived at Crooked Mountain.	cp9	40	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:41.1	The Lord of Gods addressed	cp9	41	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:41.2	Vissakamma of great psychic power:	cp9	41	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:41.3	‘Build a hermitage, well-made and delightful,	cp9	41	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:41.4	with a hall of leaves.	cp9	41	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:42.1	After hearing Sakka’s words,	cp9	42	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:42.2	Vissakamma of great psychic power	cp9	42	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:42.3	built a hermitage, well-made and delightful,	cp9	42	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:42.4	with a hall of leaves.	cp9	42	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:43.1	Having plunged into the forest,	cp9	43	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:43.2	quiet and undisturbed,	cp9	43	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:43.3	we four people	cp9	43	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:43.4	lived there in the mountains.	cp9	43	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:44.1	Myself and Queen Maddī,	cp9	44	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:44.2	with both Jāli and Kaṇhājinā,	cp9	44	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:44.3	dispelling each other’s sorrow	cp9	44	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:44.4	lived then in that hermitage.	cp9	44	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:45.1	While caring for the children,	cp9	45	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:45.2	I was not idle in the hermitage.	cp9	45	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:45.3	Maddī gathered fruit,	cp9	45	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:45.4	and fed three people.	cp9	45	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:46.1	While I was living in the forest,	cp9	46	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:46.2	a traveler came to me	cp9	46	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:46.3	and asked for my children,	cp9	46	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:46.4	both Jāli and Kaṇhājinā.	cp9	46	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:47.1	When I saw the supplicant approaching,	cp9	47	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:47.2	I felt so full of joy.	cp9	47	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:47.3	Taking both my children,	cp9	47	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:47.4	I gave them to the brahmin then.	cp9	47	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:48.1	When I gave away my own children,	cp9	48	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:48.2	to the brahmin Jūjaka,	cp9	48	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:48.3	the earth quaked again,	cp9	48	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:48.4	and Mount Sineru, wreathed in forests.	cp9	48	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:49.1	And then Sakka descended	cp9	49	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:49.2	in the guise of a brahmin.	cp9	49	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:49.3	He asked me for Queen Maddī,	cp9	49	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:49.4	virtuous, and devoted.	cp9	49	4	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:50.1	Taking Maddī by the hand,	cp9	50	1	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:50.2	filling clasped hands with water,	cp9	50	2	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct
cp9:50.3	with a confident heart,	cp9	50	3	cp	9	Vessantara’s Conduct

iti99:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	iti99	1	1	iti	99	The Three Knowledges
iti99:2.1	“Mendicants, I describe a brahmin who is master of the three Vedic knowledges in terms of the teaching, not by mere oral recitation.	iti99	2	1	iti	99	The Three Knowledges
iti99:3.1	How so?	iti99	3	1	iti	99	The Three Knowledges
iti99:3.2	It’s when a mendicant recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	iti99	3	2	iti	99	The Three Knowledges
iti99:3.3	This is the first knowledge they achieved. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	iti99	3	3	iti	99	The Three Knowledges
iti99:4.1	Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, a mendicant sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	iti99	4	1	iti	99	The Three Knowledges
iti99:4.2	This is the second knowledge they achieved. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	iti99	4	2	iti	99	The Three Knowledges
iti99:5.1	Furthermore, a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.	iti99	5	1	iti	99	The Three Knowledges
iti99:5.2	This is the third knowledge which they achieved. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	iti99	5	2	iti	99	The Three Knowledges
iti99:5.3	That’s how I describe a brahmin who is master of the three Vedic knowledges in terms of the teaching, not by mere oral recitation.”	iti99	5	3	iti	99	The Three Knowledges

iti99:6.4	that sage has perfect insight.	iti99	6	4	iti	99	The Three Knowledges
iti99:7.1	Because of these three knowledges	iti99	7	1	iti	99	The Three Knowledges
iti99:7.2	a brahmin is a master of the three knowledges.	iti99	7	2	iti	99	The Three Knowledges

snp1.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans in the Southern Hills near the brahmin village of Ekanāḷa.	snp1.4	1	2	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer
snp1.4:1.3	Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Farmer had harnessed around five hundred plows, it being the season for sowing.	snp1.4	1	3	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer
snp1.4:1.4	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to where Bhāradvāja the Farmer was working.	snp1.4	1	4	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer
snp1.4:1.5	Now at that time Bhāradvāja the Farmer was distributing food.	snp1.4	1	5	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer
snp1.4:1.6	Then the Buddha went to where the distribution was taking place and stood to one side.	snp1.4	1	6	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer
snp1.4:2.1	Bhāradvāja the Farmer saw him standing for alms	snp1.4	2	1	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer

snp1.4:10.1	Then Bhāradvāja the Farmer filled a large bronze dish with milk-rice and presented it to the Buddha:	snp1.4	10	1	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer
snp1.4:10.2	“Eat the milk-rice, Master Gotama,	snp1.4	10	2	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer

snp1.4:11.3	The Buddhas reject things enchanted with spells.	snp1.4	11	3	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer
snp1.4:11.4	Since there is such a principle, brahmin, <j>that’s how they live.	snp1.4	11	4	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer

snp1.4:13.1	“Then, Master Gotama, to whom should I give the milk-rice?”	snp1.4	13	1	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer
snp1.4:13.2	“Brahmin, I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who can properly digest this milk-rice, except for the Realized One or one of his disciples.	snp1.4	13	2	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer
snp1.4:13.3	Well then, brahmin, throw out the milk-rice where there is little that grows, or drop it into water that has no living creatures.”	snp1.4	13	3	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer
snp1.4:14.1	So Bhāradvāja the Farmer dropped the milk-rice in water that had no living creatures.	snp1.4	14	1	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer
snp1.4:14.2	And when the milk-rice was placed in the water, it sizzled and hissed, steaming and fuming.	snp1.4	14	2	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer
snp1.4:14.3	Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day. If you placed it in the water, it would sizzle and hiss, steaming and fuming.	snp1.4	14	3	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer

snp1.4:15.1	Then Bhāradvāja the Farmer, shocked and awestruck,  went up to the Buddha, bowed down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said,	snp1.4	15	1	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer
snp1.4:15.2	“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!	snp1.4	15	2	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer
snp1.4:15.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	snp1.4	15	3	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer
snp1.4:15.4	I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	snp1.4	15	4	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer

snp1.4:16.2	Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	snp1.4	16	2	snp	1.4	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer

snp3.2:25.4	vanished right there.	snp3.2	25	4	snp	3.2	Striving
snp3.3:1.1	So I have heard.	snp3.3	1	1	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	snp3.3	1	2	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	snp3.3	1	3	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:1.4	“Mendicants!”	snp3.3	1	4	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	snp3.3	1	5	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:1.6	The Buddha said this:	snp3.3	1	6	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:2.1	“Mendicants, speech that has four factors is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s blameless and is not criticized by sensible people.	snp3.3	2	1	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:2.2	What four?	snp3.3	2	2	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:2.3	It’s when a mendicant speaks well, not poorly; they speak on the teaching, not against the teaching; they speak pleasantly, not unpleasantly; and they speak truthfully, not falsely.	snp3.3	2	3	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:2.4	Speech with these four factors is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s blameless and is not criticized by sensible people.”	snp3.3	2	4	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:2.5	That is what the Buddha said.	snp3.3	2	5	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:2.6	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	snp3.3	2	6	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:3.1	“Good people say well-spoken words are foremost;	snp3.3	3	1	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:3.2	second, speak on the teaching, not against it;	snp3.3	3	2	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:3.3	third, speak pleasantly, not unpleasantly;	snp3.3	3	3	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:3.4	and fourth, speak truthfully, not falsely.”	snp3.3	3	4	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:4.1	Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,	snp3.3	4	1	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:4.2	“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!”	snp3.3	4	2	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:4.3	“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha.	snp3.3	4	3	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:4.4	Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses:	snp3.3	4	4	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:5.1	“Speak only such words	snp3.3	5	1	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words

snp3.3:7.1	Truth itself is the undying word:	snp3.3	7	1	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:7.2	this is an eternal truth.	snp3.3	7	2	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:7.3	Good people say that the teaching and its meaning	snp3.3	7	3	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:7.4	are grounded in the truth.	snp3.3	7	4	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:8.1	The words spoken by the Buddha	snp3.3	8	1	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:8.2	for finding the sanctuary, extinguishment,	snp3.3	8	2	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:8.3	for the attainment of vision,	snp3.3	8	3	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.3:8.4	this really is the best kind of speech.”	snp3.3	8	4	snp	3.3	Well-Spoken Words
snp3.4:1.1	So I have heard.	snp3.4	1	1	snp	3.4	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake
snp3.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the Kosalan lands on the bank of the Sundarikā river.	snp3.4	1	2	snp	3.4	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake
snp3.4:1.3	Now at that time the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja was serving the sacred flame and performing the fire sacrifice on the bank of the Sundarikā.	snp3.4	1	3	snp	3.4	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake
snp3.4:1.4	Then he looked all around the four quarters, wondering,	snp3.4	1	4	snp	3.4	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake
snp3.4:1.5	“Now who might eat the leftovers of this offering?”	snp3.4	1	5	snp	3.4	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake
snp3.4:1.6	He saw the Buddha meditating at the root of a certain tree with his robe pulled over his head.	snp3.4	1	6	snp	3.4	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake
snp3.4:1.7	Taking the leftovers of the offering in his left hand and a pitcher in the right he approached the Buddha.	snp3.4	1	7	snp	3.4	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake
snp3.4:2.1	When he heard Sundarikabhāradvāja’s footsteps the Buddha uncovered his head.	snp3.4	2	1	snp	3.4	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake
snp3.4:2.2	Sundarikabhāradvāja thought, “This man is shaven, he is shaven!” And he wanted to turn back.	snp3.4	2	2	snp	3.4	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake
snp3.4:2.3	But he thought,	snp3.4	2	3	snp	3.4	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake
snp3.4:2.4	“Even some brahmins are shaven. Why don’t I go to him and ask about his birth?”	snp3.4	2	4	snp	3.4	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake
snp3.4:2.5	Then the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja went up to the Buddha, and said to him,	snp3.4	2	5	snp	3.4	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake
snp3.4:2.6	“Sir, in what caste were you born?”	snp3.4	2	6	snp	3.4	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake
snp3.4:3.1	Then the Buddha addressed Sundarikabhāradvāja in verse:	snp3.4	3	1	snp	3.4	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake
snp3.4:4.1	“I am no brahmin, nor am I a prince,	snp3.4	4	1	snp	3.4	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake

snp3.4:5.3	Since I’m unburdened by youngsters,	snp3.4	5	3	snp	3.4	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake
snp3.4:5.4	it’s inappropriate to ask me about clan.”	snp3.4	5	4	snp	3.4	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake
snp3.4:6.1	“Actually sir, when brahmins meet they politely	snp3.4	6	1	snp	3.4	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake
snp3.4:6.2	ask each other whether they are brahmins.”	snp3.4	6	2	snp	3.4	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake

snp3.6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	snp3.6	1	2	snp	3.6	With Sabhiya
snp3.6:1.3	Now at that time the wanderer Sabhiya had been presented with several questions by a deity who was a former blood relation, saying:	snp3.6	1	3	snp	3.6	With Sabhiya
snp3.6:1.4	“Sabhiya, you should live the spiritual life with whatever ascetic or brahmin answers these questions.”	snp3.6	1	4	snp	3.6	With Sabhiya
snp3.6:2.1	Then Sabhiya, after learning those questions in the presence of that deity, approached those ascetics and brahmins who led an order and a community, and taught a community, who were well-known and famous religious founders, deemed holy by many people. That is,	snp3.6	2	1	snp	3.6	With Sabhiya
snp3.6:2.2	Pūraṇa Kassapa, the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla, Ajita of the hair blanket, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, and the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan.	snp3.6	2	2	snp	3.6	With Sabhiya
snp3.6:2.3	And he asked them those questions,	snp3.6	2	3	snp	3.6	With Sabhiya
snp3.6:2.4	but they were stumped by them.	snp3.6	2	4	snp	3.6	With Sabhiya
snp3.6:2.5	Displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness,	snp3.6	2	5	snp	3.6	With Sabhiya
snp3.6:2.6	they questioned Sabiya in return.	snp3.6	2	6	snp	3.6	With Sabhiya

snp3.6:3.7	Why don’t I return to a lesser life so I can enjoy sensual pleasures?”	snp3.6	3	7	snp	3.6	With Sabhiya

snp3.6:5.5	They displayed annoyance, hate, and bitterness, and even questioned me in return.	snp3.6	5	5	snp	3.6	With Sabhiya
snp3.6:5.6	How can the ascetic Gotama possibly answer my questions,	snp3.6	5	6	snp	3.6	With Sabhiya

snp3.6:52.1	Then the wanderer Sabhiya bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet and said,	snp3.6	52	1	snp	3.6	With Sabhiya
snp3.6:52.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent! …	snp3.6	52	2	snp	3.6	With Sabhiya

snp3.6:54.2	And the wanderer Sabhiya received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	snp3.6	54	2	snp	3.6	With Sabhiya
snp3.6:54.3	And Venerable Sabhiya became one of the perfected.	snp3.6	54	3	snp	3.6	With Sabhiya
snp3.7:1.1	So I have heard.	snp3.7	1	1	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Northern Āpaṇas together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Northern Āpaṇas named Āpaṇa.	snp3.7	1	2	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:1.3	The matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya heard:	snp3.7	1	3	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:1.4	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Āpaṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.	snp3.7	1	4	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:1.5	He has this good reputation:	snp3.7	1	5	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:1.6	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	snp3.7	1	6	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:1.7	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	snp3.7	1	7	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:1.8	He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	snp3.7	1	8	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:1.9	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	snp3.7	1	9	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:2.1	So Keṇiya approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	snp3.7	2	1	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.	snp3.7	2	2	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:2.3	The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk.	snp3.7	2	3	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:2.4	Then he said to the Buddha,	snp3.7	2	4	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:2.5	“Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”	snp3.7	2	5	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:2.6	When he said this, the Buddha said to him,	snp3.7	2	6	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:2.7	“The Saṅgha is large, Keṇiya; there are 1,250 mendicants. And you are devoted to the brahmins.”	snp3.7	2	7	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:3.1	For a second time, Keṇiya asked the Buddha to accept a meal offering.	snp3.7	3	1	snp	3.7	With Sela

snp3.7:3.3	Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”	snp3.7	3	3	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:3.4	And for a second time, the Buddha gave the same reply.	snp3.7	3	4	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:4.1	For a third time, Keṇiya asked the Buddha to accept a meal offering.	snp3.7	4	1	snp	3.7	With Sela

snp3.7:4.4	The Buddha consented with silence.	snp3.7	4	4	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:4.5	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Keṇiya got up from his seat and went to his own hermitage. There he addressed his friends and colleagues, relatives and family members,	snp3.7	4	5	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:4.6	“My friends and colleagues, relatives and family members: please listen!	snp3.7	4	6	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:4.7	The ascetic Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal.	snp3.7	4	7	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:4.8	Please help me with the preparations.”	snp3.7	4	8	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:4.9	“Yes, sir,” they replied. Some dug ovens, some chopped wood, some washed dishes, some set out a water jar, and some spread out seats.	snp3.7	4	9	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:4.10	Meanwhile, Keṇiya set up the pavilion himself.	snp3.7	4	10	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:5.1	Now at that time the brahmin Sela was residing in Āpaṇa. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knew philology and grammar, and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. And he was teaching three hundred students to recite the hymns.	snp3.7	5	1	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:6.1	And at that time Keṇiya was devoted to Sela.	snp3.7	6	1	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:6.2	Then Sela, while going for a walk escorted by the three hundred students, approached Keṇiya’s hermitage.	snp3.7	6	2	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:6.3	He saw the preparations going on,	snp3.7	6	3	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:6.4	and said to Keṇiya,	snp3.7	6	4	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:6.5	“Keṇiya, is your son or daughter being married? Or are you setting up a big sacrifice? Or has King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha been invited for tomorrow’s meal?”	snp3.7	6	5	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:7.1	“There is no marriage, Sela, and the king is not coming.	snp3.7	7	1	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:7.2	Rather, I am setting up a big sacrifice.	snp3.7	7	2	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:7.3	The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Āpaṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.	snp3.7	7	3	snp	3.7	With Sela

snp3.7:7.6	He has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal together with the mendicant Saṅgha.”	snp3.7	7	6	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:7.7	“Mister Keṇiya, did you say ‘the awakened one’?”	snp3.7	7	7	snp	3.7	With Sela

snp3.7:7.10	“I said ‘the awakened one’.”	snp3.7	7	10	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:8.1	Then Sela thought,	snp3.7	8	1	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:8.2	“It’s hard to even find the word ‘awakened one’ in the world.	snp3.7	8	2	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:8.3	The thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.	snp3.7	8	3	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:8.4	If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures.	snp3.7	8	4	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:8.5	He has the following seven treasures:	snp3.7	8	5	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:8.6	the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure.	snp3.7	8	6	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:8.7	He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.	snp3.7	8	7	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:8.8	After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword.	snp3.7	8	8	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:8.9	But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world.	snp3.7	8	9	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:8.10	“But Keṇiya, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”	snp3.7	8	10	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:9.1	When he said this, Keṇiya pointed with his right arm and said,	snp3.7	9	1	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:9.2	“There, Mister Sela, at that line of blue forest.”	snp3.7	9	2	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:9.3	Then Sela, together with his students, approached the Buddha.	snp3.7	9	3	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:9.4	He said to his students,	snp3.7	9	4	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:9.5	“Come quietly, gentlemen, tread gently.	snp3.7	9	5	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:9.6	For the Buddhas are intimidating, like a lion living alone.	snp3.7	9	6	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:9.7	When I’m consulting with the ascetic Gotama, don’t interrupt.	snp3.7	9	7	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:9.8	Wait until I’ve finished speaking.”	snp3.7	9	8	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:10.1	Then Sela went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	snp3.7	10	1	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:10.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.	snp3.7	10	2	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:10.3	and scrutinized the Buddha’s body for the thirty-two marks of a great man.	snp3.7	10	3	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:10.4	He saw all of them except for two,	snp3.7	10	4	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:10.5	which he had doubts about:	snp3.7	10	5	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:10.6	whether the private parts were covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.	snp3.7	10	6	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:11.1	Then it occurred to the Buddha,	snp3.7	11	1	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:11.2	“Sela sees all the marks except for two,	snp3.7	11	2	snp	3.7	With Sela

snp3.7:11.5	The Buddha used his psychic power to will that Sela would see his private parts covered in a foreskin.	snp3.7	11	5	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:11.6	And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue.	snp3.7	11	6	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:12.1	Then Sela thought,	snp3.7	12	1	snp	3.7	With Sela
snp3.7:12.2	“The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks completely, lacking none.	snp3.7	12	2	snp	3.7	With Sela

snp3.9:1.5	Then as the brahmin students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began to discuss the question:	snp3.9	1	5	snp	3.9	With Vāseṭṭha
snp3.9:1.6	“How do you become a brahmin?”	snp3.9	1	6	snp	3.9	With Vāseṭṭha

snp3.10:4.1	Then Kokālika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	snp3.10	4	1	snp	3.10	With Kokālika
snp3.10:4.2	Not long after he left his body erupted with boils the size of mustard seeds.	snp3.10	4	2	snp	3.10	With Kokālika
snp3.10:4.3	The boils grew to the size of mung beans, then chickpeas, then jujube seeds, then jujubes, then myrobalans, then unripe wood apples, then ripe wood apples. Finally they burst open, and pus and blood oozed out.	snp3.10	4	3	snp	3.10	With Kokālika
snp3.10:4.4	Then the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness.	snp3.10	4	4	snp	3.10	With Kokālika

snp3.12:2.1	“Suppose, mendicants, they questioned you thus: ‘There are skillful teachings that are noble, emancipating, and lead to awakening. What is the real reason for listening to such teachings?’ You should answer:	snp3.12	2	1	snp	3.12	3.12 Contemplating Pairs

thag2.1:1.3	The aggregates are reborn	thag2.1	1	3	thag	2.1	Uttara (1st)

thag2.1:2.1	Knowing this danger,	thag2.1	2	1	thag	2.1	Uttara (1st)
thag2.1:2.2	I have no need for another life.	thag2.1	2	2	thag	2.1	Uttara (1st)

thag2.2:1.3	Seeing how this bag of bones is sustained by food,	thag2.2	1	3	thag	2.2	Bhāradvāja the Alms-gatherer

thag2.2:2.2	this homage and veneration in respectable families.	thag2.2	2	2	thag	2.2	Bhāradvāja the Alms-gatherer
thag2.2:2.3	Honor is a subtle dart, hard to extract,	thag2.2	2	3	thag	2.2	Bhāradvāja the Alms-gatherer
thag2.2:2.4	and hard for a sinner to give up.	thag2.2	2	4	thag	2.2	Bhāradvāja the Alms-gatherer

thag2.5:1.3	is looked down upon for being unknown	thag2.5	1	3	thag	2.5	Ajina

thag2.10:2.3	Whoever harbors bad deeds	thag2.10	2	3	thag	2.10	Vasabha

thag2.14:1.3	So too, a person who lives well	thag2.14	1	3	thag	2.14	Somamitta
thag2.14:1.4	sinks by relying on a lazy person.	thag2.14	1	4	thag	2.14	Somamitta
thag2.14:1.5	Hence you should avoid such	thag2.14	1	5	thag	2.14	Somamitta

thag2.15:1.3	people are hurt by people;	thag2.15	1	3	thag	2.15	Sabbamitta
thag2.15:1.4	and people hurt people.	thag2.15	1	4	thag	2.15	Sabbamitta
thag2.15:2.1	So what’s the point of people,	thag2.15	2	1	thag	2.15	Sabbamitta

thag2.24:2.3	I’ll know it with wisdom,	thag2.24	2	3	thag	2.24	Valliya (3rd)

thag2.25:1.2	to shave my head.	thag2.25	1	2	thag	2.25	Vītasoka
thag2.25:1.3	I picked up a mirror	thag2.25	1	3	thag	2.25	Vītasoka
thag2.25:1.4	and examined my body.	thag2.25	1	4	thag	2.25	Vītasoka
thag2.25:2.1	My body appeared hollow;	thag2.25	2	1	thag	2.25	Vītasoka
thag2.25:2.2	I once was blind, but the darkness disappeared.	thag2.25	2	2	thag	2.25	Vītasoka

thag2.26:1.2	for the sake of finding sanctuary from the yoke.	thag2.26	1	2	thag	2.26	Puṇṇamāsa (2nd)
thag2.26:1.3	I took Dhamma as a mirror	thag2.26	1	3	thag	2.26	Puṇṇamāsa (2nd)

thag2.27:1.2	it soon stands firm again.	thag2.27	1	2	thag	2.27	Nandaka (1st)
thag2.27:1.3	It gains even more urgency,	thag2.27	1	3	thag	2.27	Nandaka (1st)
thag2.27:1.4	and draws its load undeterred.	thag2.27	1	4	thag	2.27	Nandaka (1st)

thag2.28:1.4	before the best of Buddhas.	thag2.28	1	4	thag	2.28	Bharata
thag2.28:2.1	The sage gave us the going forth	thag2.28	2	1	thag	2.28	Bharata
thag2.28:2.2	out of compassion, so we could realize	thag2.28	2	2	thag	2.28	Bharata
thag2.28:2.3	the ending of all fetters—	thag2.28	2	3	thag	2.28	Bharata
thag2.28:2.4	now we have reached that goal.	thag2.28	2	4	thag	2.28	Bharata
thag2.29:1.1	This is how the wise roar:	thag2.29	1	1	thag	2.29	Bhāradvāja
thag2.29:1.2	like lions in mountain caves,	thag2.29	1	2	thag	2.29	Bhāradvāja

thag2.29:2.3	I’m happy and joyful,	thag2.29	2	3	thag	2.29	Bhāradvāja
thag2.29:2.4	because I’ve seen my son free of defilements.	thag2.29	2	4	thag	2.29	Bhāradvāja
thag2.30:1.1	I regularly sat close by good people	thag2.30	1	1	thag	2.30	Kaṇhadinna
thag2.30:1.2	and learnt the teaching.	thag2.30	1	2	thag	2.30	Kaṇhadinna

thag2.30:2.1	I’ve slain the desire to be reborn,	thag2.30	2	1	thag	2.30	Kaṇhadinna
thag2.30:2.2	it won’t be found in me again.	thag2.30	2	2	thag	2.30	Kaṇhadinna
thag2.30:2.3	It was not, and it won’t be in me,	thag2.30	2	3	thag	2.30	Kaṇhadinna
thag2.30:2.4	and it isn’t found in me now.	thag2.30	2	4	thag	2.30	Kaṇhadinna
thag2.31:1.1	When I had gone forth	thag2.31	1	1	thag	2.31	Migasira
thag2.31:1.2	in the teaching of the Buddha,	thag2.31	1	2	thag	2.31	Migasira
thag2.31:1.3	while letting go, I rose up;	thag2.31	1	3	thag	2.31	Migasira
thag2.31:1.4	escaping the sensual realm.	thag2.31	1	4	thag	2.31	Migasira
thag2.31:2.1	Then, as the supreme one looked on,	thag2.31	2	1	thag	2.31	Migasira
thag2.31:2.2	my mind was freed.	thag2.31	2	2	thag	2.31	Migasira
thag2.31:2.3	My freedom is unshakable	thag2.31	2	3	thag	2.31	Migasira

thag2.32:1.2	on and on, life after life.	thag2.32	1	2	thag	2.32	Sivaka
thag2.32:1.3	I’ve been searching for the house-builder—	thag2.32	1	3	thag	2.32	Sivaka
thag2.32:1.4	painful is birth again and again.	thag2.32	1	4	thag	2.32	Sivaka
thag2.32:2.1	I’ve seen you, house-builder!	thag2.32	2	1	thag	2.32	Sivaka
thag2.32:2.2	You won’t build a house again.	thag2.32	2	2	thag	2.32	Sivaka
thag2.32:2.3	Your rafters are all broken,	thag2.32	2	3	thag	2.32	Sivaka
thag2.32:2.4	your ridgepole is shattered.	thag2.32	2	4	thag	2.32	Sivaka
thag2.32:2.5	My mind is released from limits:	thag2.32	2	5	thag	2.32	Sivaka
thag2.32:2.6	in this very life it will dissipate.	thag2.32	2	6	thag	2.32	Sivaka
thag2.33:1.1	The perfected one, the Holy One in the world,	thag2.33	1	1	thag	2.33	Upavāna

thag2.33:2.3	honored by the honorable,	thag2.33	2	3	thag	2.33	Upavāna
thag2.33:2.4	and venerated by the venerable.	thag2.33	2	4	thag	2.33	Upavāna
thag2.34:1.1	I’ve seen lay disciples <j>who have memorized discourses,	thag2.34	1	1	thag	2.34	Isidinna
thag2.34:1.2	saying, “Sensual pleasures are impermanent”.	thag2.34	1	2	thag	2.34	Isidinna
thag2.34:1.3	But they’re obsessed with jeweled earrings,	thag2.34	1	3	thag	2.34	Isidinna
thag2.34:1.4	concerned for their partners and children.	thag2.34	1	4	thag	2.34	Isidinna
thag2.34:2.1	To be honest, they don’t know Dhamma,	thag2.34	2	1	thag	2.34	Isidinna
thag2.34:2.2	even though they say <j>“Sensual pleasures are impermanent”.	thag2.34	2	2	thag	2.34	Isidinna
thag2.34:2.3	They don’t have the power to cut their lust,	thag2.34	2	3	thag	2.34	Isidinna
thag2.34:2.4	so they cling to children, wives, and wealth.	thag2.34	2	4	thag	2.34	Isidinna

thag2.46:2.1	One practicing absorption is happy in mind, <j>and their appearance is uplifting;	thag2.46	2	1	thag	2.46	Cūḷaka
thag2.46:2.2	going forth in the teaching of the Buddha <j>is easy for a good person.	thag2.46	2	2	thag	2.46	Cūḷaka
thag2.46:2.3	You should realize that supreme, unchanging state,	thag2.46	2	3	thag	2.46	Cūḷaka
thag2.46:2.4	so very pure, subtle, and hard to see.	thag2.46	2	4	thag	2.46	Cūḷaka
thag2.47:1.1	The conceited mind, addicted to pleasure,	thag2.47	1	1	thag	2.47	Anūpama
thag2.47:1.2	impales itself on its own stake.	thag2.47	1	2	thag	2.47	Anūpama
thag2.47:1.3	It always goes where	thag2.47	1	3	thag	2.47	Anūpama
thag2.47:1.4	there’s a stake, a chopping block.	thag2.47	1	4	thag	2.47	Anūpama
thag2.47:2.1	I declare you the demon mind!	thag2.47	2	1	thag	2.47	Anūpama
thag2.47:2.2	I declare you the insidious mind!	thag2.47	2	2	thag	2.47	Anūpama

thag2.47:2.4	don’t lead me away from the goal.	thag2.47	2	4	thag	2.47	Anūpama
thag2.48:1.1	Transmigrating for such a long time,	thag2.48	1	1	thag	2.48	Vajjita
thag2.48:1.2	I’ve proceeded through various states of rebirth,	thag2.48	1	2	thag	2.48	Vajjita
thag2.48:1.3	not seeing the noble truths,	thag2.48	1	3	thag	2.48	Vajjita
thag2.48:1.4	a blind, unenlightened person.	thag2.48	1	4	thag	2.48	Vajjita
thag2.48:2.1	But when I became heedful,	thag2.48	2	1	thag	2.48	Vajjita
thag2.48:2.2	transmigrations were mown down.	thag2.48	2	2	thag	2.48	Vajjita

thag2.49:1.3	being mindful, my perception	thag2.49	1	3	thag	2.49	Sandhita
thag2.49:1.4	became one with the Buddha.	thag2.49	1	4	thag	2.49	Sandhita
thag2.49:2.1	It’s been thirty one eons	thag2.49	2	1	thag	2.49	Sandhita
thag2.49:2.2	since I gained that perception;	thag2.49	2	2	thag	2.49	Sandhita
thag2.49:2.3	and it’s due to that perception	thag2.49	2	3	thag	2.49	Sandhita
thag2.49:2.4	that I’ve attained the ending of defilements.	thag2.49	2	4	thag	2.49	Sandhita
thag3.1:1.1	Seeking purity the wrong way,	thag3.1	1	1	thag	3.1	Aṅgaṇikabhāradvāja
thag3.1:1.2	I served the sacred fire in a grove.	thag3.1	1	2	thag	3.1	Aṅgaṇikabhāradvāja
thag3.1:1.3	Not knowing the path to purity,	thag3.1	1	3	thag	3.1	Aṅgaṇikabhāradvāja
thag3.1:1.4	I mortified my flesh in search of immortality.	thag3.1	1	4	thag	3.1	Aṅgaṇikabhāradvāja
thag3.1:2.1	I’ve gained this happiness by means of happiness:	thag3.1	2	1	thag	3.1	Aṅgaṇikabhāradvāja
thag3.1:2.2	see the excellence of the teaching!	thag3.1	2	2	thag	3.1	Aṅgaṇikabhāradvāja
thag3.1:2.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges	thag3.1	2	3	thag	3.1	Aṅgaṇikabhāradvāja

thag3.1:3.1	In the past I was related to Brahmā,	thag3.1	3	1	thag	3.1	Aṅgaṇikabhāradvāja
thag3.1:3.2	but now I really am a brahmin!	thag3.1	3	2	thag	3.1	Aṅgaṇikabhāradvāja
thag3.1:3.3	I am master of the three knowledges, <j>I’m a bathed initiate,	thag3.1	3	3	thag	3.1	Aṅgaṇikabhāradvāja
thag3.1:3.4	I’m a scholar and a knowledge master.	thag3.1	3	4	thag	3.1	Aṅgaṇikabhāradvāja
thag3.2:1.1	I went forth five days ago,	thag3.2	1	1	thag	3.2	Paccaya

thag3.2:1.3	I entered my dwelling	thag3.2	1	3	thag	3.2	Paccaya

thag3.2:2.1	I won’t eat; I won’t drink;	thag3.2	2	1	thag	3.2	Paccaya
thag3.2:2.2	I won’t leave my dwelling;	thag3.2	2	2	thag	3.2	Paccaya
thag3.2:2.3	nor will I lie down on my side—	thag3.2	2	3	thag	3.2	Paccaya
thag3.2:2.4	not until the dart of craving is plucked.	thag3.2	2	4	thag	3.2	Paccaya
thag3.2:3.1	See my energy and vigor	thag3.2	3	1	thag	3.2	Paccaya
thag3.2:3.2	as I meditate like this!	thag3.2	3	2	thag	3.2	Paccaya
thag3.2:3.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges	thag3.2	3	3	thag	3.2	Paccaya

thag3.3:1.3	has lost the causes for happiness,	thag3.3	1	3	thag	3.3	Bākula
thag3.3:1.4	and afterwards they’re tormented by regrets.	thag3.3	1	4	thag	3.3	Bākula
thag3.3:2.1	You should only say what you would do;	thag3.3	2	1	thag	3.3	Bākula
thag3.3:2.2	you shouldn’t say what you wouldn’t do.	thag3.3	2	2	thag	3.3	Bākula
thag3.3:2.3	The wise will recognize	thag3.3	2	3	thag	3.3	Bākula

thag3.14:3.4	mindful, I found peace.	thag3.14	3	4	thag	3.14	Gotama (2nd)

thag3.15:1.2	what they should have done before	thag3.15	1	2	thag	3.15	Hārita (2nd)
thag3.15:1.3	has lost the causes for happiness,	thag3.15	1	3	thag	3.15	Hārita (2nd)
thag3.15:1.4	and afterwards they’re tormented by regrets.	thag3.15	1	4	thag	3.15	Hārita (2nd)
thag3.15:2.1	You should only say what you would do;	thag3.15	2	1	thag	3.15	Hārita (2nd)
thag3.15:2.2	you shouldn’t say what you wouldn’t do.	thag3.15	2	2	thag	3.15	Hārita (2nd)
thag3.15:2.3	The wise will recognize	thag3.15	2	3	thag	3.15	Hārita (2nd)
thag3.15:2.4	one who talks without doing.	thag3.15	2	4	thag	3.15	Hārita (2nd)
thag3.15:3.1	Oh! Extinguishment is so very blissful,	thag3.15	3	1	thag	3.15	Hārita (2nd)
thag3.15:3.2	as taught by the fully awakened Buddha:	thag3.15	3	2	thag	3.15	Hārita (2nd)
thag3.15:3.3	sorrowless, stainless, secure,	thag3.15	3	3	thag	3.15	Hārita (2nd)

thag3.16:1.3	Stick to the advice he gave you,	thag3.16	1	3	thag	3.16	Vimala (2nd)

thag3.16:2.1	If you’re lost in the middle of a great sea,	thag3.16	2	1	thag	3.16	Vimala (2nd)
thag3.16:2.2	and you clamber up on a little log, you’ll sink.	thag3.16	2	2	thag	3.16	Vimala (2nd)
thag3.16:2.3	So too, a person who lives well	thag3.16	2	3	thag	3.16	Vimala (2nd)
thag3.16:2.4	sinks by relying on a lazy person.	thag3.16	2	4	thag	3.16	Vimala (2nd)
thag3.16:2.5	Hence you should avoid such	thag3.16	2	5	thag	3.16	Vimala (2nd)
thag3.16:2.6	a lazy person who lacks energy.	thag3.16	2	6	thag	3.16	Vimala (2nd)
thag3.16:3.1	Dwell with the noble ones	thag3.16	3	1	thag	3.16	Vimala (2nd)
thag3.16:3.2	who are secluded and determined	thag3.16	3	2	thag	3.16	Vimala (2nd)
thag3.16:3.3	and always energetic;	thag3.16	3	3	thag	3.16	Vimala (2nd)
thag3.16:3.4	the astute who practice absorption.	thag3.16	3	4	thag	3.16	Vimala (2nd)
thag4.1:1.1	Adorned with jewelry and all dressed up,	thag4.1	1	1	thag	4.1	Nāgasamāla
thag4.1:1.2	with garlands, and sandalwood makeup piled on,	thag4.1	1	2	thag	4.1	Nāgasamāla
thag4.1:1.3	along the main street is a lady—	thag4.1	1	3	thag	4.1	Nāgasamāla
thag4.1:1.4	a dancer dancing as the music plays.	thag4.1	1	4	thag	4.1	Nāgasamāla
thag4.1:2.1	I entered for alms,	thag4.1	2	1	thag	4.1	Nāgasamāla
thag4.1:2.2	and while walking along I glanced at her,	thag4.1	2	2	thag	4.1	Nāgasamāla
thag4.1:2.3	adorned with jewelry and all dressed up,	thag4.1	2	3	thag	4.1	Nāgasamāla
thag4.1:2.4	like a snare of death laid down.	thag4.1	2	4	thag	4.1	Nāgasamāla
thag4.1:3.1	Then the realization	thag4.1	3	1	thag	4.1	Nāgasamāla
thag4.1:3.2	came upon me—	thag4.1	3	2	thag	4.1	Nāgasamāla
thag4.1:3.3	the danger became clear,	thag4.1	3	3	thag	4.1	Nāgasamāla
thag4.1:3.4	and I grew firmly disillusioned.	thag4.1	3	4	thag	4.1	Nāgasamāla
thag4.1:4.1	Then my mind was freed—	thag4.1	4	1	thag	4.1	Nāgasamāla
thag4.1:4.2	see the excellence of the teaching!	thag4.1	4	2	thag	4.1	Nāgasamāla
thag4.1:4.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges	thag4.1	4	3	thag	4.1	Nāgasamāla
thag4.1:4.4	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.	thag4.1	4	4	thag	4.1	Nāgasamāla
thag4.2:1.1	Overwhelmed by drowsiness,	thag4.2	1	1	thag	4.2	Bhagu
thag4.2:1.2	I left my dwelling.	thag4.2	1	2	thag	4.2	Bhagu
thag4.2:1.3	Stepping up to the path for walking meditation,	thag4.2	1	3	thag	4.2	Bhagu
thag4.2:1.4	I fell to the ground right there.	thag4.2	1	4	thag	4.2	Bhagu
thag4.2:2.1	I rubbed my limbs, and again	thag4.2	2	1	thag	4.2	Bhagu
thag4.2:2.2	I stepped up on the path for walking meditation.	thag4.2	2	2	thag	4.2	Bhagu
thag4.2:2.3	I walked meditation up and down the path,	thag4.2	2	3	thag	4.2	Bhagu
thag4.2:2.4	serene inside myself.	thag4.2	2	4	thag	4.2	Bhagu
thag4.2:3.1	Then the realization	thag4.2	3	1	thag	4.2	Bhagu
thag4.2:3.2	came upon me—	thag4.2	3	2	thag	4.2	Bhagu
thag4.2:3.3	the danger became clear,	thag4.2	3	3	thag	4.2	Bhagu
thag4.2:3.4	and I grew firmly disillusioned.	thag4.2	3	4	thag	4.2	Bhagu
thag4.2:4.1	Then my mind was freed—	thag4.2	4	1	thag	4.2	Bhagu
thag4.2:4.2	see the excellence of the teaching!	thag4.2	4	2	thag	4.2	Bhagu
thag4.2:4.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges,	thag4.2	4	3	thag	4.2	Bhagu

thag4.3:1.1	Others don’t understand	thag4.3	1	1	thag	4.3	Sabhiya
thag4.3:1.2	that we need restraint in this.	thag4.3	1	2	thag	4.3	Sabhiya
thag4.3:1.3	But those who do understand this,	thag4.3	1	3	thag	4.3	Sabhiya
thag4.3:1.4	being clever, settle their conflicts.	thag4.3	1	4	thag	4.3	Sabhiya
thag4.3:2.1	And when those who don’t understand	thag4.3	2	1	thag	4.3	Sabhiya
thag4.3:2.2	behave as though they were immortal,	thag4.3	2	2	thag	4.3	Sabhiya
thag4.3:2.3	those who understand the Dhamma	thag4.3	2	3	thag	4.3	Sabhiya
thag4.3:2.4	are like the healthy among the sick.	thag4.3	2	4	thag	4.3	Sabhiya
thag4.3:3.1	Any lax act,	thag4.3	3	1	thag	4.3	Sabhiya
thag4.3:3.2	any corrupt observance,	thag4.3	3	2	thag	4.3	Sabhiya
thag4.3:3.3	or suspicious spiritual life,	thag4.3	3	3	thag	4.3	Sabhiya
thag4.3:3.4	is not very fruitful.	thag4.3	3	4	thag	4.3	Sabhiya
thag4.3:4.1	Whoever has no respect	thag4.3	4	1	thag	4.3	Sabhiya
thag4.3:4.2	for their spiritual companions	thag4.3	4	2	thag	4.3	Sabhiya
thag4.3:4.3	is as far from true Dhamma	thag4.3	4	3	thag	4.3	Sabhiya

thag4.4:1.1	Damn you mortal frame, you stink!	thag4.4	1	1	thag	4.4	Nandaka (2nd)

thag4.4:1.3	O body, you have nine streams	thag4.4	1	3	thag	4.4	Nandaka (2nd)
thag4.4:1.4	that are flowing all the time.	thag4.4	1	4	thag	4.4	Nandaka (2nd)
thag4.4:2.1	Don’t think much of mortal frames;	thag4.4	2	1	thag	4.4	Nandaka (2nd)
thag4.4:2.2	don’t disparage the Realized Ones.	thag4.4	2	2	thag	4.4	Nandaka (2nd)
thag4.4:2.3	They’re not even aroused by heaven,	thag4.4	2	3	thag	4.4	Nandaka (2nd)
thag4.4:2.4	let alone by humans.	thag4.4	2	4	thag	4.4	Nandaka (2nd)
thag4.4:3.1	But those who are stupid fools,	thag4.4	3	1	thag	4.4	Nandaka (2nd)
thag4.4:3.2	with bad advisors, shrouded in delusion,	thag4.4	3	2	thag	4.4	Nandaka (2nd)
thag4.4:3.3	that kind of person is aroused by bodies,	thag4.4	3	3	thag	4.4	Nandaka (2nd)
thag4.4:3.4	when Māra has laid down the snare.	thag4.4	3	4	thag	4.4	Nandaka (2nd)
thag4.4:4.1	Those in whom greed, hate, and ignorance	thag4.4	4	1	thag	4.4	Nandaka (2nd)
thag4.4:4.2	have faded away;	thag4.4	4	2	thag	4.4	Nandaka (2nd)
thag4.4:4.3	such people are not aroused by bodies,	thag4.4	4	3	thag	4.4	Nandaka (2nd)
thag4.4:4.4	they’ve cut the strings, they’re no longer bound.	thag4.4	4	4	thag	4.4	Nandaka (2nd)
thag4.5:1.1	For fifty-five years	thag4.5	1	1	thag	4.5	Jambuka
thag4.5:1.2	I wore dust and dirt.	thag4.5	1	2	thag	4.5	Jambuka
thag4.5:1.3	Eating one meal a month,	thag4.5	1	3	thag	4.5	Jambuka
thag4.5:1.4	I tore out my hair and beard.	thag4.5	1	4	thag	4.5	Jambuka
thag4.5:2.1	I stood on one foot;	thag4.5	2	1	thag	4.5	Jambuka
thag4.5:2.2	I rejected seats;	thag4.5	2	2	thag	4.5	Jambuka
thag4.5:2.3	I ate dried-out dung;	thag4.5	2	3	thag	4.5	Jambuka
thag4.5:2.4	I didn’t accept food set aside for me.	thag4.5	2	4	thag	4.5	Jambuka
thag4.5:3.1	I did many deeds of this kind,	thag4.5	3	1	thag	4.5	Jambuka
thag4.5:3.2	which lead to a bad destination.	thag4.5	3	2	thag	4.5	Jambuka
thag4.5:3.3	Swept away by a great flood,	thag4.5	3	3	thag	4.5	Jambuka
thag4.5:3.4	I went to the Buddha for refuge.	thag4.5	3	4	thag	4.5	Jambuka

thag4.6:2.1	He was glorious, the teacher of a community,	thag4.6	2	1	thag	4.6	Senaka
thag4.6:2.2	a leader who had realized the highest.	thag4.6	2	2	thag	4.6	Senaka
thag4.6:2.3	In all the world with its gods,	thag4.6	2	3	thag	4.6	Senaka
thag4.6:2.4	he was the victor of unequaled vision.	thag4.6	2	4	thag	4.6	Senaka
thag4.6:3.1	A great giant, a great hero,	thag4.6	3	1	thag	4.6	Senaka

thag4.6:3.3	With the utter ending of all defilements,	thag4.6	3	3	thag	4.6	Senaka
thag4.6:3.4	the teacher fears nothing from any quarter.	thag4.6	3	4	thag	4.6	Senaka
thag4.6:4.1	For a long time, sadly, I was corrupted,	thag4.6	4	1	thag	4.6	Senaka
thag4.6:4.2	fettered by the bond of wrong view.	thag4.6	4	2	thag	4.6	Senaka
thag4.6:4.3	That Blessed One, Senaka,	thag4.6	4	3	thag	4.6	Senaka
thag4.6:4.4	released me from all ties.	thag4.6	4	4	thag	4.6	Senaka

thag4.7:1.3	being so disorganized	thag4.7	1	3	thag	4.7	Sambhūta
thag4.7:1.4	a fool falls into suffering.	thag4.7	1	4	thag	4.7	Sambhūta
thag4.7:2.1	Their good fortune wastes away	thag4.7	2	1	thag	4.7	Sambhūta
thag4.7:2.2	like the moon in the waning fortnight.	thag4.7	2	2	thag	4.7	Sambhūta
thag4.7:2.3	They become disgraced	thag4.7	2	3	thag	4.7	Sambhūta
thag4.7:2.4	and alienated from their friends.	thag4.7	2	4	thag	4.7	Sambhūta
thag4.7:3.1	Dawdling when it’s time to dawdle;	thag4.7	3	1	thag	4.7	Sambhūta

thag4.7:3.3	being so well organized,	thag4.7	3	3	thag	4.7	Sambhūta
thag4.7:3.4	an astute person comes into happiness.	thag4.7	3	4	thag	4.7	Sambhūta
thag4.7:4.1	Their good fortune flourishes	thag4.7	4	1	thag	4.7	Sambhūta
thag4.7:4.2	like the moon in the waxing fortnight.	thag4.7	4	2	thag	4.7	Sambhūta
thag4.7:4.3	They become famous and respected,	thag4.7	4	3	thag	4.7	Sambhūta
thag4.7:4.4	not alienated from their friends.	thag4.7	4	4	thag	4.7	Sambhūta
thag4.8:1.1	I am known as “Fortunate Rāhula”,	thag4.8	1	1	thag	4.8	Rāhula
thag4.8:1.2	because I’m accomplished in both ways:	thag4.8	1	2	thag	4.8	Rāhula
thag4.8:1.3	I am the son of the Buddha,	thag4.8	1	3	thag	4.8	Rāhula
thag4.8:1.4	whose eye sees clearly in all things.	thag4.8	1	4	thag	4.8	Rāhula
thag4.8:2.1	Since my defilements have ended,	thag4.8	2	1	thag	4.8	Rāhula
thag4.8:2.2	since there are no more future lives—	thag4.8	2	2	thag	4.8	Rāhula
thag4.8:2.3	I’m perfected, worthy of offerings,	thag4.8	2	3	thag	4.8	Rāhula
thag4.8:2.4	master of the three knowledges, seer of the deathless.	thag4.8	2	4	thag	4.8	Rāhula
thag4.8:3.1	Blinded by sensual pleasures, trapped in a net,	thag4.8	3	1	thag	4.8	Rāhula
thag4.8:3.2	they are smothered over by craving;	thag4.8	3	2	thag	4.8	Rāhula
thag4.8:3.3	bound by the kinsman of the negligent,	thag4.8	3	3	thag	4.8	Rāhula
thag4.8:3.4	like a fish caught in a funnel-net trap.	thag4.8	3	4	thag	4.8	Rāhula
thag4.8:4.1	Having thrown off those sensual pleasures,	thag4.8	4	1	thag	4.8	Rāhula
thag4.8:4.2	having cut Māra’s bond,	thag4.8	4	2	thag	4.8	Rāhula
thag4.8:4.3	and having plucked out craving, root and all:	thag4.8	4	3	thag	4.8	Rāhula
thag4.8:4.4	I’m cooled, extinguished.	thag4.8	4	4	thag	4.8	Rāhula
thag4.9:1.1	Covered over with gold,	thag4.9	1	1	thag	4.9	Candana

thag4.9:2.4	like a snare of death laid down.	thag4.9	2	4	thag	4.9	Candana
thag4.9:3.1	Then the realization	thag4.9	3	1	thag	4.9	Candana

thag4.9:3.3	the danger became clear,	thag4.9	3	3	thag	4.9	Candana
thag4.9:3.4	and I was firmly disillusioned.	thag4.9	3	4	thag	4.9	Candana
thag4.9:4.1	Then my mind was freed—	thag4.9	4	1	thag	4.9	Candana
thag4.9:4.2	see the excellence of the teaching!	thag4.9	4	2	thag	4.9	Candana
thag4.9:4.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges	thag4.9	4	3	thag	4.9	Candana

thag4.10:1.2	the teaching brings happiness when practiced well.	thag4.10	1	2	thag	4.10	Dhammika
thag4.10:1.3	This is the benefit of practicing Dhamma:	thag4.10	1	3	thag	4.10	Dhammika
thag4.10:1.4	one doesn’t go to a bad destination.	thag4.10	1	4	thag	4.10	Dhammika

thag4.10:3.1	So you should rouse up enthusiasm for the teachings;	thag4.10	3	1	thag	4.10	Dhammika
thag4.10:3.2	such rejoicing is owing to the Holy One, the poised.	thag4.10	3	2	thag	4.10	Dhammika

thag4.11:4.3	“Today isn’t the time to stray from mountain streams;	thag4.11	4	3	thag	4.11	Sappaka
thag4.11:4.4	Ajakaraṇī is safe, pleasant, and delightful.”	thag4.11	4	4	thag	4.11	Sappaka
thag4.12:1.1	I went forth to save my life.	thag4.12	1	1	thag	4.12	Mudita
thag4.12:1.2	But I embraced faith	thag4.12	1	2	thag	4.12	Mudita
thag4.12:1.3	after receiving full ordination.	thag4.12	1	3	thag	4.12	Mudita
thag4.12:1.4	I strove, strong in effort:	thag4.12	1	4	thag	4.12	Mudita
thag4.12:2.1	gladly, let this body be broken!	thag4.12	2	1	thag	4.12	Mudita
thag4.12:2.2	Let this lump of meat be dissolved!	thag4.12	2	2	thag	4.12	Mudita
thag4.12:2.3	Let both my legs fall off	thag4.12	2	3	thag	4.12	Mudita
thag4.12:2.4	at the knees!	thag4.12	2	4	thag	4.12	Mudita
thag4.12:3.1	I won’t eat, I won’t drink,	thag4.12	3	1	thag	4.12	Mudita
thag4.12:3.2	I won’t leave my dwelling,	thag4.12	3	2	thag	4.12	Mudita
thag4.12:3.3	nor will I lie down on my side,	thag4.12	3	3	thag	4.12	Mudita
thag4.12:3.4	until the dart of craving is plucked.	thag4.12	3	4	thag	4.12	Mudita
thag4.12:4.1	As I meditate like this,	thag4.12	4	1	thag	4.12	Mudita
thag4.12:4.2	see my energy and vigor!	thag4.12	4	2	thag	4.12	Mudita
thag4.12:4.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges	thag4.12	4	3	thag	4.12	Mudita
thag4.12:4.4	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.	thag4.12	4	4	thag	4.12	Mudita
thag5.1:1.1	I, a monk, went to a charnel ground	thag5.1	1	1	thag	5.1	Rājadatta
thag5.1:1.2	and saw a woman’s body abandoned there,	thag5.1	1	2	thag	5.1	Rājadatta
thag5.1:1.3	discarded in a cemetery,	thag5.1	1	3	thag	5.1	Rājadatta
thag5.1:1.4	full of worms that devoured.	thag5.1	1	4	thag	5.1	Rājadatta
thag5.1:2.1	Some men were disgusted,	thag5.1	2	1	thag	5.1	Rājadatta
thag5.1:2.2	seeing her dead and rotten;	thag5.1	2	2	thag	5.1	Rājadatta
thag5.1:2.3	but sexual desire arose in me,	thag5.1	2	3	thag	5.1	Rājadatta
thag5.1:2.4	I was as if blind to her oozing body.	thag5.1	2	4	thag	5.1	Rājadatta
thag5.1:3.1	Quicker than the cooking of rice	thag5.1	3	1	thag	5.1	Rājadatta
thag5.1:3.2	I left that place!	thag5.1	3	2	thag	5.1	Rājadatta
thag5.1:3.3	Mindful and aware,	thag5.1	3	3	thag	5.1	Rājadatta
thag5.1:3.4	I retired to a discreet place.	thag5.1	3	4	thag	5.1	Rājadatta
thag5.1:4.1	Then the realization	thag5.1	4	1	thag	5.1	Rājadatta
thag5.1:4.2	came upon me—	thag5.1	4	2	thag	5.1	Rājadatta
thag5.1:4.3	the danger became clear,	thag5.1	4	3	thag	5.1	Rājadatta
thag5.1:4.4	and I was firmly disillusioned.	thag5.1	4	4	thag	5.1	Rājadatta
thag5.1:5.1	Then my mind was freed—	thag5.1	5	1	thag	5.1	Rājadatta
thag5.1:5.2	see the excellence of the teaching!	thag5.1	5	2	thag	5.1	Rājadatta
thag5.1:5.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges	thag5.1	5	3	thag	5.1	Rājadatta
thag5.1:5.4	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.	thag5.1	5	4	thag	5.1	Rājadatta
thag5.2:1.1	When a person, wishing for a certain outcome,	thag5.2	1	1	thag	5.2	Subhūta
thag5.2:1.2	applies themselves where they ought not;	thag5.2	1	2	thag	5.2	Subhūta
thag5.2:1.3	not achieving what they worked for,	thag5.2	1	3	thag	5.2	Subhūta
thag5.2:1.4	they say: “That’s a sign of my bad luck.”	thag5.2	1	4	thag	5.2	Subhūta
thag5.2:2.1	When a misfortune is extracted and beaten,	thag5.2	2	1	thag	5.2	Subhūta
thag5.2:2.2	to surrender it in part would be like losing at dice;	thag5.2	2	2	thag	5.2	Subhūta
thag5.2:2.3	but to surrender it all you’d have to be blind,	thag5.2	2	3	thag	5.2	Subhūta
thag5.2:2.4	not seeing the even and the uneven.	thag5.2	2	4	thag	5.2	Subhūta
thag5.2:3.1	You should only say what you would do;	thag5.2	3	1	thag	5.2	Subhūta
thag5.2:3.2	you shouldn’t say what you wouldn’t do.	thag5.2	3	2	thag	5.2	Subhūta
thag5.2:3.3	The wise will recognize	thag5.2	3	3	thag	5.2	Subhūta
thag5.2:3.4	one who talks without doing.	thag5.2	3	4	thag	5.2	Subhūta
thag5.2:4.1	Just like a glorious flower	thag5.2	4	1	thag	5.2	Subhūta
thag5.2:4.2	that’s colorful but lacks fragrance;	thag5.2	4	2	thag	5.2	Subhūta
thag5.2:4.3	well-spoken speech is fruitless	thag5.2	4	3	thag	5.2	Subhūta
thag5.2:4.4	for one who does not act on it.	thag5.2	4	4	thag	5.2	Subhūta
thag5.2:5.1	Just like a glorious flower	thag5.2	5	1	thag	5.2	Subhūta
thag5.2:5.2	that's both colorful and fragrant,	thag5.2	5	2	thag	5.2	Subhūta
thag5.2:5.3	well-spoken speech is fruitful	thag5.2	5	3	thag	5.2	Subhūta
thag5.2:5.4	for one who acts on it.	thag5.2	5	4	thag	5.2	Subhūta

thag5.3:5.4	so rain, sky, if you wish.	thag5.3	5	4	thag	5.3	Girimānanda
thag5.4:1.1	My mentor helped me to learn,	thag5.4	1	1	thag	5.4	Sumana (1st)
thag5.4:1.2	hoping I would practice those teachings.	thag5.4	1	2	thag	5.4	Sumana (1st)
thag5.4:1.3	Aspiring to the deathless,	thag5.4	1	3	thag	5.4	Sumana (1st)
thag5.4:1.4	I’ve done what had to be done.	thag5.4	1	4	thag	5.4	Sumana (1st)
thag5.4:2.1	I’ve realized the Dhamma,	thag5.4	2	1	thag	5.4	Sumana (1st)
thag5.4:2.2	witnessing it for myself, not based on hearsay.	thag5.4	2	2	thag	5.4	Sumana (1st)
thag5.4:2.3	With purified knowledge, free of doubt,	thag5.4	2	3	thag	5.4	Sumana (1st)
thag5.4:2.4	I declare it in your presence.	thag5.4	2	4	thag	5.4	Sumana (1st)

thag5.4:3.2	my clairvoyance is purified,	thag5.4	3	2	thag	5.4	Sumana (1st)
thag5.4:3.3	I’ve realized my own true goal,	thag5.4	3	3	thag	5.4	Sumana (1st)
thag5.4:3.4	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.	thag5.4	3	4	thag	5.4	Sumana (1st)
thag5.4:4.1	Being diligent in the training,	thag5.4	4	1	thag	5.4	Sumana (1st)

thag5.5:1.1	Oh so well was the goad	thag5.5	1	1	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:1.2	shown to me by my mother,	thag5.5	1	2	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:1.3	on hearing whose words,	thag5.5	1	3	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:1.4	advised by my mother,	thag5.5	1	4	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:1.5	energetic and resolute,	thag5.5	1	5	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:1.6	I realized supreme awakening.	thag5.5	1	6	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:2.1	I’m perfected, worthy of offerings,	thag5.5	2	1	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:2.2	master of the three knowledges, seer of the deathless.	thag5.5	2	2	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:2.3	I’ve conquered the army of Namuci,	thag5.5	2	3	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:2.4	and live without defilements.	thag5.5	2	4	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:3.1	Those defilements that were found in me,	thag5.5	3	1	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:3.2	internally and externally,	thag5.5	3	2	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:3.3	are all cut off without remainder,	thag5.5	3	3	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:3.4	and will not arise again.	thag5.5	3	4	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:4.1	My self-assured sister	thag5.5	4	1	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:4.2	said this to me:	thag5.5	4	2	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:4.3	‘Now neither you nor I	thag5.5	4	3	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:4.4	have any entanglements.’	thag5.5	4	4	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:5.1	Suffering is at an end;	thag5.5	5	1	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:5.2	this bag of bones is my last	thag5.5	5	2	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:5.3	in the transmigration through births and deaths;	thag5.5	5	3	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.5:5.4	now there are no more future lives.”	thag5.5	5	4	thag	5.5	Vaḍḍha
thag5.6:1.1	It was truly for my benefit	thag5.6	1	1	thag	5.6	Nadīkassapa
thag5.6:1.2	that the Buddha went to the river Nerañjara.	thag5.6	1	2	thag	5.6	Nadīkassapa
thag5.6:1.3	When I heard his teaching,	thag5.6	1	3	thag	5.6	Nadīkassapa
thag5.6:1.4	I shunned wrong view.	thag5.6	1	4	thag	5.6	Nadīkassapa
thag5.6:2.1	I used to perform a diverse spectrum of sacrifices;	thag5.6	2	1	thag	5.6	Nadīkassapa
thag5.6:2.2	I served the sacred flame,	thag5.6	2	2	thag	5.6	Nadīkassapa
thag5.6:2.3	imagining, “This is purity.”	thag5.6	2	3	thag	5.6	Nadīkassapa
thag5.6:2.4	I was a blind, ordinary person.	thag5.6	2	4	thag	5.6	Nadīkassapa
thag5.6:3.1	Caught in the thicket of wrong view,	thag5.6	3	1	thag	5.6	Nadīkassapa
thag5.6:3.2	deluded by misapprehension.	thag5.6	3	2	thag	5.6	Nadīkassapa
thag5.6:3.3	Thinking impurity was purity,	thag5.6	3	3	thag	5.6	Nadīkassapa
thag5.6:3.4	I was blind and ignorant.	thag5.6	3	4	thag	5.6	Nadīkassapa
thag5.6:4.1	I’ve abandoned wrong view;	thag5.6	4	1	thag	5.6	Nadīkassapa
thag5.6:4.2	all rebirths are shattered.	thag5.6	4	2	thag	5.6	Nadīkassapa
thag5.6:4.3	I serve the truly worthy flame:	thag5.6	4	3	thag	5.6	Nadīkassapa
thag5.6:4.4	I bow to the Realized One.	thag5.6	4	4	thag	5.6	Nadīkassapa
thag5.6:5.1	I’ve given up all delusion;	thag5.6	5	1	thag	5.6	Nadīkassapa
thag5.6:5.2	craving for continued existence is shattered;	thag5.6	5	2	thag	5.6	Nadīkassapa
thag5.6:5.3	transmigration through births is finished;	thag5.6	5	3	thag	5.6	Nadīkassapa
thag5.6:5.4	now there are no more future lives.	thag5.6	5	4	thag	5.6	Nadīkassapa
thag5.7:1.1	Three times a day—	thag5.7	1	1	thag	5.7	Gayākassapa
thag5.7:1.2	morning, midday, and evening—	thag5.7	1	2	thag	5.7	Gayākassapa
thag5.7:1.3	I plunged into the water at Gayā	thag5.7	1	3	thag	5.7	Gayākassapa
thag5.7:1.4	for the Gayā spring festival.	thag5.7	1	4	thag	5.7	Gayākassapa

thag5.7:2.3	I’ll now wash away right here”—	thag5.7	2	3	thag	5.7	Gayākassapa
thag5.7:2.4	such was the view I used to hold.	thag5.7	2	4	thag	5.7	Gayākassapa
thag5.7:3.1	Having heard the fine words,	thag5.7	3	1	thag	5.7	Gayākassapa
thag5.7:3.2	a passage meaningful and principled,	thag5.7	3	2	thag	5.7	Gayākassapa
thag5.7:3.3	I rationally reflected	thag5.7	3	3	thag	5.7	Gayākassapa
thag5.7:3.4	on the true, essential goal.	thag5.7	3	4	thag	5.7	Gayākassapa
thag5.7:4.1	I’ve washed away all bad things;	thag5.7	4	1	thag	5.7	Gayākassapa
thag5.7:4.2	I’m stainless, clean, pristine;	thag5.7	4	2	thag	5.7	Gayākassapa
thag5.7:4.3	the pure heir of the pure one,	thag5.7	4	3	thag	5.7	Gayākassapa
thag5.7:4.4	a rightful child of the Buddha.	thag5.7	4	4	thag	5.7	Gayākassapa
thag5.7:5.1	When I plunged into the eightfold stream,	thag5.7	5	1	thag	5.7	Gayākassapa
thag5.7:5.2	all bad things were washed away.	thag5.7	5	2	thag	5.7	Gayākassapa
thag5.7:5.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges	thag5.7	5	3	thag	5.7	Gayākassapa

thag6.6:5.4	and I was firmly disillusioned.	thag6.6	5	4	thag	6.6	Sappadāsa
thag6.6:6.1	Then my mind was freed—	thag6.6	6	1	thag	6.6	Sappadāsa
thag6.6:6.2	see the excellence of the teaching!	thag6.6	6	2	thag	6.6	Sappadāsa
thag6.6:6.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges,	thag6.6	6	3	thag	6.6	Sappadāsa
thag6.6:6.4	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.	thag6.6	6	4	thag	6.6	Sappadāsa
thag6.7:1.1	Get up, Kātiyāna, and sit!	thag6.7	1	1	thag	6.7	Kātiyāna

thag6.7:2.1	Like a wave in the mighty ocean,	thag6.7	2	1	thag	6.7	Kātiyāna
thag6.7:2.2	rebirth and old age sweep you under.	thag6.7	2	2	thag	6.7	Kātiyāna
thag6.7:2.3	Make a safe island of yourself,	thag6.7	2	3	thag	6.7	Kātiyāna
thag6.7:2.4	for you have no other shelter.	thag6.7	2	4	thag	6.7	Kātiyāna
thag6.7:3.1	The teacher has mastered this path,	thag6.7	3	1	thag	6.7	Kātiyāna

thag6.7:5.4	you’ll be quenched, as a flame by water.	thag6.7	5	4	thag	6.7	Kātiyāna
thag6.7:6.1	A lamp of feeble flame	thag6.7	6	1	thag	6.7	Kātiyāna
thag6.7:6.2	is bent down by the wind, like a creeper;	thag6.7	6	2	thag	6.7	Kātiyāna
thag6.7:6.3	just so, kinsman of Indra,	thag6.7	6	3	thag	6.7	Kātiyāna

thag6.8:1.1	It was well-taught by the Clear-eyed One,	thag6.8	1	1	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:1.2	the Buddha, kinsman of the Sun,	thag6.8	1	2	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:1.3	who has transcended all fetters,	thag6.8	1	3	thag	6.8	Migajāla

thag6.8:2.1	Emancipating, it leads across,	thag6.8	2	1	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:2.2	drying up the root of craving,	thag6.8	2	2	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:2.3	and, having cut off the poisonous root, <j>the slaughterhouse,	thag6.8	2	3	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:2.4	it leads to quenching.	thag6.8	2	4	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:3.1	By breaking the root of unknowing,	thag6.8	3	1	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:3.2	it smashes the mechanism of deeds,	thag6.8	3	2	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:3.3	and drops the thunderbolt of knowledge	thag6.8	3	3	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:3.4	on the taking up of consciousnesses.	thag6.8	3	4	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:4.1	It informs us of our feelings,	thag6.8	4	1	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:4.2	releasing us from grasping,	thag6.8	4	2	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:4.3	contemplating with understanding	thag6.8	4	3	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:4.4	all states of existence as a pit of burning coals.	thag6.8	4	4	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:5.1	It’s very sweet and very deep,	thag6.8	5	1	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:5.2	holding birth and death at bay;	thag6.8	5	2	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:5.3	it is the noble eightfold path—	thag6.8	5	3	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:5.4	the stilling of suffering, bliss.	thag6.8	5	4	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:6.1	Knowing deed as deed	thag6.8	6	1	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:6.2	and result as result;	thag6.8	6	2	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:6.3	seeing dependently originated phenomena	thag6.8	6	3	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:6.4	as if they were in a clear light;	thag6.8	6	4	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:6.5	leading to the great sanctuary and peace,	thag6.8	6	5	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.8:6.6	it’s excellent at the end.	thag6.8	6	6	thag	6.8	Migajāla
thag6.9:1.1	I was drunk with the pride of birth	thag6.9	1	1	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:1.2	and wealth and authority.	thag6.9	1	2	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:1.3	I wandered about intoxicated	thag6.9	1	3	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:1.4	with my own gorgeous body.	thag6.9	1	4	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:2.1	No-one was my equal or my better—	thag6.9	2	1	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:2.2	or so I thought.	thag6.9	2	2	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:2.3	I was such an arrogant fool,	thag6.9	2	3	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:2.4	stuck up, waving my own flag.	thag6.9	2	4	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:3.1	I never paid homage to anyone:	thag6.9	3	1	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:3.2	not even my mother or father,	thag6.9	3	2	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:3.3	nor others esteemed as respectable.	thag6.9	3	3	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:3.4	I was stiff with pride, lacking regard for others.	thag6.9	3	4	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:4.1	When I saw the foremost leader,	thag6.9	4	1	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:4.2	the most excellent of charioteers,	thag6.9	4	2	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:4.3	shining like the sun,	thag6.9	4	3	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:4.4	at the fore of the mendicant Saṅgha,	thag6.9	4	4	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:5.1	I discarded conceit and vanity,	thag6.9	5	1	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:5.2	and, with a clear and confident heart,	thag6.9	5	2	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:5.3	I bowed down with my head	thag6.9	5	3	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son

thag6.9:6.1	The conceit of superiority <j>and the conceit of inferiority	thag6.9	6	1	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:6.2	have been given up and eradicated.	thag6.9	6	2	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:6.3	The conceit “I am” is cut off,	thag6.9	6	3	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son
thag6.9:6.4	and every kind of conceit is destroyed.	thag6.9	6	4	thag	6.9	Jenta, the High Priest’s Son

thag6.10:2.1	I brought water for my mentor	thag6.10	2	1	thag	6.10	Sumana (2nd)

thag6.10:2.3	When he saw me,	thag6.10	2	3	thag	6.10	Sumana (2nd)

thag6.14:4.4	piling up future lives.	thag6.14	4	4	thag	6.14	Sabbakāmi
thag6.14:5.1	One who, being mindful,	thag6.14	5	1	thag	6.14	Sabbakāmi
thag6.14:5.2	avoids them	thag6.14	5	2	thag	6.14	Sabbakāmi
thag6.14:5.3	like a snake’s head with their foot,	thag6.14	5	3	thag	6.14	Sabbakāmi
thag6.14:5.4	gets over clinging to the world.	thag6.14	5	4	thag	6.14	Sabbakāmi
thag6.14:6.1	Seeing the danger in sensual pleasures,	thag6.14	6	1	thag	6.14	Sabbakāmi
thag6.14:6.2	seeing renunciation as sanctuary,	thag6.14	6	2	thag	6.14	Sabbakāmi
thag6.14:6.3	I’ve escaped all sensual pleasures,	thag6.14	6	3	thag	6.14	Sabbakāmi
thag6.14:6.4	and attained the ending of defilements.	thag6.14	6	4	thag	6.14	Sabbakāmi
thag7.1:1.1	Adorned with jewelry and all dressed up,	thag7.1	1	1	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:1.2	with her garland and her makeup on,	thag7.1	1	2	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:1.3	and her feet so brightly rouged:	thag7.1	1	3	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:1.4	the courtesan was wearing sandals.	thag7.1	1	4	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:2.1	Stepping off her sandals in front of me,	thag7.1	2	1	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:2.2	her palms joined in greeting,	thag7.1	2	2	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:2.3	smiling, she spoke to me	thag7.1	2	3	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:2.4	so softly and so sweet:	thag7.1	2	4	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:3.1	“You’re too young to go forth—	thag7.1	3	1	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:3.2	come, stay in my teaching!	thag7.1	3	2	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:3.3	Enjoy human sensual pleasures,	thag7.1	3	3	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:3.4	I’ll give you riches.	thag7.1	3	4	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:3.5	I promise this is the truth—	thag7.1	3	5	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:3.6	I swear it by the Sacred Flame.	thag7.1	3	6	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:4.1	And when we’ve grown old together,	thag7.1	4	1	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:4.2	both of us leaning on staffs,	thag7.1	4	2	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:4.3	we shall both go forth,	thag7.1	4	3	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:4.4	and win on both counts.”	thag7.1	4	4	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:5.1	I saw the courtesan seducing me,	thag7.1	5	1	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:5.2	her palms joined in greeting,	thag7.1	5	2	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:5.3	adorned with jewelry and all dressed up,	thag7.1	5	3	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:5.4	like a snare of death laid down.	thag7.1	5	4	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:6.1	Then the realization	thag7.1	6	1	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:6.2	came upon me—	thag7.1	6	2	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:6.3	the danger became clear	thag7.1	6	3	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:6.4	and I grew firmly disillusioned.	thag7.1	6	4	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:7.1	Then my mind was freed—	thag7.1	7	1	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:7.2	see the excellence of the Dhamma!	thag7.1	7	2	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:7.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges,	thag7.1	7	3	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.1:7.4	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.	thag7.1	7	4	thag	7.1	Sundarasamudda
thag7.2:1.1	Bhaddiya has plucked out craving, root and all,	thag7.2	1	1	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:1.2	and in a jungle thicket	thag7.2	1	2	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:1.3	on the far side of the Wild Mango Monastery,	thag7.2	1	3	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:1.4	he practices absorption; he is truly well-favoured.	thag7.2	1	4	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:2.1	Some delight in clay drums,	thag7.2	2	1	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:2.2	in arched harps, and in cymbals.	thag7.2	2	2	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:2.3	But here, at the foot of a tree,	thag7.2	2	3	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:2.4	I delight in the Buddha’s teaching.	thag7.2	2	4	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:3.1	If the Buddha were to grant me one wish,	thag7.2	3	1	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:3.2	and I were to get what I wished for,	thag7.2	3	2	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:3.3	I’d choose for the whole world	thag7.2	3	3	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:3.4	constant mindfulness of the body.	thag7.2	3	4	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:4.1	Those who’ve judged me on appearance,	thag7.2	4	1	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:4.2	and those swayed by my voice,	thag7.2	4	2	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:4.3	are full of desire and greed;	thag7.2	4	3	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:4.4	they don’t know me.	thag7.2	4	4	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:5.1	Not knowing what’s inside,	thag7.2	5	1	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:5.2	nor seeing what’s outside,	thag7.2	5	2	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:5.3	the fool shut in on every side,	thag7.2	5	3	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:5.4	gets carried away by a voice.	thag7.2	5	4	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:6.1	Not knowing what’s inside,	thag7.2	6	1	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:6.2	but seeing what’s outside,	thag7.2	6	2	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:6.3	seeing the fruit outside,	thag7.2	6	3	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:6.4	they’re also carried away by a voice.	thag7.2	6	4	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:7.1	Understanding what’s inside,	thag7.2	7	1	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:7.2	and seeing what’s outside,	thag7.2	7	2	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:7.3	of unobstructed vision,	thag7.2	7	3	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.2:7.4	they don’t get carried away by a voice.	thag7.2	7	4	thag	7.2	Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya
thag7.3:1.1	I was an only child,	thag7.3	1	1	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:1.2	loved by my mother and father.	thag7.3	1	2	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:1.3	They had me by practicing	thag7.3	1	3	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:1.4	many prayers and observances.	thag7.3	1	4	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:2.1	Out of compassion for me	thag7.3	2	1	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:2.2	wishing me well and wanting the best for me,	thag7.3	2	2	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:2.3	my mother and father	thag7.3	2	3	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:2.4	took me to see the Buddha.	thag7.3	2	4	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:3.1	“We had this son with difficulty;	thag7.3	3	1	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:3.2	he is delicate and dainty.	thag7.3	3	2	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:3.3	We offer him to you, Lord,	thag7.3	3	3	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:3.4	to attend upon the victor.”	thag7.3	3	4	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:4.1	The teacher, having accepted me,	thag7.3	4	1	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:4.2	declared to Ānanda:	thag7.3	4	2	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:4.3	“Quickly give him the going-forth—	thag7.3	4	3	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:4.4	this one will be a thoroughbred!”	thag7.3	4	4	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:5.1	After he, the teacher, had sent me forth,	thag7.3	5	1	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:5.2	the victor entered his dwelling.	thag7.3	5	2	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:5.3	Before the sun set	thag7.3	5	3	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:5.4	my mind was freed.	thag7.3	5	4	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:6.1	The teacher didn’t neglect me;	thag7.3	6	1	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:6.2	when he came out from seclusion,	thag7.3	6	2	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:6.3	he said: “Come Bhadda!”	thag7.3	6	3	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:6.4	That was my ordination.	thag7.3	6	4	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:7.1	At seven years old	thag7.3	7	1	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:7.2	I received ordination.	thag7.3	7	2	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:7.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges;	thag7.3	7	3	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.3:7.4	oh, the excellence of the teaching!	thag7.3	7	4	thag	7.3	Bhadda
thag7.4:1.1	I saw the supreme person	thag7.4	1	1	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:1.2	walking mindfully in the shade of the terrace,	thag7.4	1	2	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:1.3	so I approached,	thag7.4	1	3	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:1.4	and bowed to the supreme among men.	thag7.4	1	4	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:2.1	Arranging my robe over one shoulder	thag7.4	2	1	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:2.2	and clasping my hands together,	thag7.4	2	2	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:2.3	I walked alongside that stainless one,	thag7.4	2	3	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:2.4	supreme among all beings.	thag7.4	2	4	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:3.1	The wise one, expert in questions,	thag7.4	3	1	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:3.2	questioned me.	thag7.4	3	2	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:3.3	Brave and fearless,	thag7.4	3	3	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:3.4	I answered the teacher.	thag7.4	3	4	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:4.1	When all his questions were answered,	thag7.4	4	1	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:4.2	the Realized One congratulated me.	thag7.4	4	2	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:4.3	Looking around the mendicant Saṅgha,	thag7.4	4	3	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:4.4	he said the following:	thag7.4	4	4	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:5.1	“It is a blessing for the people of Aṅga and Magadha	thag7.4	5	1	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:5.2	that this person enjoys their	thag7.4	5	2	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:5.3	robe and almsfood,	thag7.4	5	3	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:5.4	requisites and lodgings,	thag7.4	5	4	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:5.5	their respect and service—	thag7.4	5	5	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:5.6	it’s a blessing for them,” he declared.	thag7.4	5	6	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:6.1	“Sopāka, from this day on	thag7.4	6	1	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:6.2	you are invited to come and see me.	thag7.4	6	2	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:6.3	And Sopāka, let this	thag7.4	6	3	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:6.4	be your ordination.”	thag7.4	6	4	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:7.1	At seven years old	thag7.4	7	1	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:7.2	I received ordination.	thag7.4	7	2	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:7.3	I bear my final body—	thag7.4	7	3	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.4:7.4	oh, the excellence of the teaching!	thag7.4	7	4	thag	7.4	Sopāka (2nd)
thag7.5:1.1	I broke the reeds off with my hands,	thag7.5	1	1	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:1.2	made a hut, and stayed there.	thag7.5	1	2	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:1.3	That’s how I became known	thag7.5	1	3	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:1.4	as “Reed-breaker”.	thag7.5	1	4	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:2.1	But now it’s not appropriate	thag7.5	2	1	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:2.2	for me to break reeds with my hands.	thag7.5	2	2	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:2.3	The training rules have been laid down for us	thag7.5	2	3	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:2.4	by Gotama the renowned.	thag7.5	2	4	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:3.1	Previously, I, Sarabhaṅga,	thag7.5	3	1	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:3.2	didn’t see the disease in its entirety.	thag7.5	3	2	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:3.3	But now I have seen the disease,	thag7.5	3	3	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:3.4	as I’ve practiced what was taught <j>by he who is beyond the gods.	thag7.5	3	4	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:4.1	Gotama traveled by that straight road;	thag7.5	4	1	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:4.2	the same path traveled by Vipassī,	thag7.5	4	2	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:4.3	by Sikhī, Vessabhū,	thag7.5	4	3	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:4.4	Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa.	thag7.5	4	4	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:5.1	These seven Buddhas have plunged into the ending,	thag7.5	5	1	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:5.2	free of craving, without grasping,	thag7.5	5	2	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:5.3	having become Dhamma, poised.	thag7.5	5	3	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:5.4	They have taught this Dhamma	thag7.5	5	4	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:6.1	out of compassion for living creatures—	thag7.5	6	1	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:6.2	suffering, origin, path,	thag7.5	6	2	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:6.3	and cessation, the ending of suffering.	thag7.5	6	3	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:6.4	In these four noble truths,	thag7.5	6	4	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:7.1	the endless suffering of transmigration	thag7.5	7	1	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:7.2	finally comes to an end.	thag7.5	7	2	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:7.3	When the body breaks up,	thag7.5	7	3	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:7.4	and life comes to an end,	thag7.5	7	4	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:7.5	there are no future lives;	thag7.5	7	5	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag7.5:7.6	I’m everywhere well-freed.	thag7.5	7	6	thag	7.5	Sarabhaṅga
thag8.1:1.1	Don’t get involved in lots of work,	thag8.1	1	1	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:1.2	avoid people, and don’t try to acquire things.	thag8.1	1	2	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:1.3	If you’re eager and greedy for flavors,	thag8.1	1	3	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:1.4	you’ll miss the goal that brings such happiness.	thag8.1	1	4	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:2.1	They know it really is a bog,	thag8.1	2	1	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:2.2	this homage and veneration in respectable families.	thag8.1	2	2	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:2.3	Honor is a subtle dart, hard to extract,	thag8.1	2	3	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:2.4	and hard for a sinner to give up.	thag8.1	2	4	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:3.1	The deeds of a mortal aren’t bad	thag8.1	3	1	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:3.2	because of what others do.	thag8.1	3	2	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:3.3	You yourself should not do bad,	thag8.1	3	3	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:3.4	for mortals have deeds as their kin.	thag8.1	3	4	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:4.1	You’re not a bandit because of what someone says,	thag8.1	4	1	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:4.2	you’re not a sage because of what someone says;	thag8.1	4	2	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:4.3	but as you know yourself,	thag8.1	4	3	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:4.4	so the gods will know you.	thag8.1	4	4	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:5.1	Others don’t understand	thag8.1	5	1	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:5.2	that we need restraint in this.	thag8.1	5	2	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:5.3	But those who do understand this,	thag8.1	5	3	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:5.4	being clever, settle their conflicts.	thag8.1	5	4	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:6.1	A wise person lives on	thag8.1	6	1	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:6.2	even after loss of wealth;	thag8.1	6	2	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:6.3	but without gaining wisdom,	thag8.1	6	3	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:6.4	even a rich person doesn’t really live.	thag8.1	6	4	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:7.1	All is heard with the ear,	thag8.1	7	1	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:7.2	all is seen with the eye;	thag8.1	7	2	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:7.3	the wise ought not forsake	thag8.1	7	3	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:7.4	all that is seen and heard.	thag8.1	7	4	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:8.1	Though you have eyes, be as if blind;	thag8.1	8	1	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:8.2	though you have ears, be as if deaf;	thag8.1	8	2	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:8.3	though you have wisdom, be as if dumb;	thag8.1	8	3	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:8.4	though you have strength, be as if feeble.	thag8.1	8	4	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:8.5	And when issues come up	thag8.1	8	5	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.1:8.6	lie as still as a corpse.	thag8.1	8	6	thag	8.1	Mahākaccāyana
thag8.2:1.1	Free of anger and hostility,	thag8.2	1	1	thag	8.2	Sirimitta
thag8.2:1.2	free of deceit, and rid of slander;	thag8.2	1	2	thag	8.2	Sirimitta
thag8.2:1.3	that’s how such a mendicant	thag8.2	1	3	thag	8.2	Sirimitta
thag8.2:1.4	doesn’t grieve after passing away.	thag8.2	1	4	thag	8.2	Sirimitta
thag8.2:2.1	Free of anger and hostility,	thag8.2	2	1	thag	8.2	Sirimitta
thag8.2:2.2	free of deceit, and rid of slander;	thag8.2	2	2	thag	8.2	Sirimitta
thag8.2:2.3	that’s how a mendicant <j>with sense doors always guarded	thag8.2	2	3	thag	8.2	Sirimitta

thag10.3:4.4	even a rich person doesn’t really live.	thag10.3	4	4	thag	10.3	Mahākappina
thag10.3:5.1	Wisdom questions what is learned;	thag10.3	5	1	thag	10.3	Mahākappina

thag16.9:8.1	But someone who is mindful, few of wishes,	thag16.9	8	1	thag	16.9	Anuruddha

thag16.9:11.3	The Buddha who loves non-proliferation	thag16.9	11	3	thag	16.9	Anuruddha

ud1.3:1.4	When seven days had passed, the Buddha emerged from that state of immersion. In the last part of the night, he carefully applied the mind to dependent origination in forward and reverse order:	ud1.3	1	4	ud	1.3	Upon Awakening (3rd)

ud1.5:1.3	Now at that time a number of senior monks approached the Buddha—Venerables Sāriputta, Mahāmoggallāna, Mahākassapa, Mahākaccāna, Mahākoṭṭhita, Mahākappina, Mahācunda, Anuruddha, Revata, and Nanda.	ud1.5	1	3	ud	1.5	The Brahmin
ud1.5:2.1	The Buddha saw them coming off in the distance,	ud1.5	2	1	ud	1.5	The Brahmin

ud1.6:1.4	Then after some time he recovered from that illness.	ud1.6	1	4	ud	1.6	With Mahākassapa

ud1.6:1.6	“Why not enter Rājagaha for almsfood?”	ud1.6	1	6	ud	1.6	With Mahākassapa

ud1.6:2.2	But Mahākasspa refused those deities. In the morning, he robed up, took his bowl and robe, and entered Rājagaha for alms.	ud1.6	2	2	ud	1.6	With Mahākassapa
ud1.6:2.3	He went to the streets of the poor, the destitute, and the weavers.	ud1.6	2	3	ud	1.6	With Mahākassapa
ud1.6:2.4	The Buddha saw him wandering for alms in the streets of the poor, the destitute, and the weavers.	ud1.6	2	4	ud	1.6	With Mahākassapa

ud1.7:1.4	Then Ajakalāpaka, wanting to make the Buddha feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, approached him, and while not far away yelled three times, “Grr! Arrgh!” Then he added,	ud1.7	1	4	ud	1.7	At Ajakalāpaka
ud1.7:1.5	“Now that’s a goblin for you, ascetic!”	ud1.7	1	5	ud	1.7	At Ajakalāpaka

ud1.8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud1.8	1	2	ud	1.8	With Saṅgāmaji
ud1.8:1.3	Now at that time around Venerable Saṅgāmaji had arrived at Sāvatthī to see the Buddha.	ud1.8	1	3	ud	1.8	With Saṅgāmaji
ud1.8:1.4	His former wife heard	ud1.8	1	4	ud	1.8	With Saṅgāmaji
ud1.8:1.5	that he had arrived,	ud1.8	1	5	ud	1.8	With Saṅgāmaji

ud1.8:2.1	Now at that time Venerable Saṅgāmaji was sitting at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation.	ud1.8	2	1	ud	1.8	With Saṅgāmaji
ud1.8:2.2	Then his former wife went up to him and said,	ud1.8	2	2	ud	1.8	With Saṅgāmaji
ud1.8:2.3	“I have a little child, ascetic, so please provide for me.”	ud1.8	2	3	ud	1.8	With Saṅgāmaji
ud1.8:2.4	When she said this, Saṅgāmaji kept silent.	ud1.8	2	4	ud	1.8	With Saṅgāmaji

ud1.8:4.3	For a third time, Saṅgāmaji kept silent.	ud1.8	4	3	ud	1.8	With Saṅgāmaji

ud1.8:5.2	“This is your child, ascetic. Provide for him.”	ud1.8	5	2	ud	1.8	With Saṅgāmaji
ud1.8:6.1	But Saṅgāmaji neither looked at the boy nor spoke to him.	ud1.8	6	1	ud	1.8	With Saṅgāmaji
ud1.8:6.2	Then his former wife went a little distance away. Looking back, she saw Saṅgāmaji ignoring the boy, and thought,	ud1.8	6	2	ud	1.8	With Saṅgāmaji
ud1.8:6.3	“This ascetic doesn’t even want his child.”	ud1.8	6	3	ud	1.8	With Saṅgāmaji
ud1.8:6.4	She returned to pick up the boy, then left.	ud1.8	6	4	ud	1.8	With Saṅgāmaji
ud1.8:6.5	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha saw how Saṅgāmaji’s former wife went back for the child.	ud1.8	6	5	ud	1.8	With Saṅgāmaji
ud1.8:7.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud1.8	7	1	ud	1.8	With Saṅgāmaji
ud1.8:8.1	“When she came he was not glad,	ud1.8	8	1	ud	1.8	With Saṅgāmaji

ud1.9:2.1	The Buddha saw them plunging in and out.	ud1.9	2	1	ud	1.9	Dreadlocked Ascetics

ud1.10:1.3	Now at that time Bāhiya of the Bark Cloth was residing by Suppāraka on the ocean shore, where he was honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And he received robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	ud1.10	1	3	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:1.4	Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	ud1.10	1	4	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:1.5	“I am one of those in the world who are perfected or on the path to perfection.”	ud1.10	1	5	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:2.1	Then a deity who was a former relative of Bāhiya, having compassion and wanting what’s best for him, approached him and said:	ud1.10	2	1	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:2.2	“Bāhiya, you’re not a perfected one, nor on the path to perfection.	ud1.10	2	2	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya

ud1.10:4.7	“He has entered an inhabited area for almsfood, Bāhiya.”	ud1.10	4	7	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:5.1	Then Bāhiya rushed out of the Jeta Grove and entered Sāvatthī, where he saw the Buddha walking for alms. He was impressive and inspiring, with peaceful faculties and mind, attained to the highest self-control and serenity, like an elephant with tamed, guarded, and controlled faculties.	ud1.10	5	1	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:5.2	Bāhiya went up to the Buddha, bowed down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said,	ud1.10	5	2	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:5.3	“Sir, let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach me the Dhamma!	ud1.10	5	3	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya

ud1.10:9.1	Then, due to this brief Dhamma teaching of the Buddha, Bāhiya’s mind was right away freed from defilements by not grasping.	ud1.10	9	1	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:10.1	And when the Buddha had given Bāhiya this brief advice he left.	ud1.10	10	1	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:10.2	But soon after the Buddha had left, a cow with a baby calf charged at Bāhiya and took his life.	ud1.10	10	2	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:11.1	Then the Buddha wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he departed the city together with several mendicants and saw that Bāhiya had passed away.	ud1.10	11	1	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:11.2	He said to the monks,	ud1.10	11	2	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:11.3	“Mendicants, pick up Bāhiya’s corpse. Having lifted it onto a cot and carried it, cremate it and build a monument.	ud1.10	11	3	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:11.4	Mendicants, one of your spiritual companions has passed away.”	ud1.10	11	4	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:12.1	“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. They did as the Buddha asked, then returned to the Buddha	ud1.10	12	1	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:12.2	and said,	ud1.10	12	2	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:12.3	“Sir, Bāhiya’s corpse has been cremated and a monument built for him.	ud1.10	12	3	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:12.4	Where has he been reborn in his next life?”	ud1.10	12	4	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:12.5	“Mendicants, Bāhiya was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings.	ud1.10	12	5	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:12.6	Bāhiya of the Bark Cloth has become fully extinguished.”	ud1.10	12	6	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:13.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud1.10	13	1	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:14.1	“Where water and earth,	ud1.10	14	1	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:14.2	fire and air find no footing:	ud1.10	14	2	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:14.3	there no star does shine,	ud1.10	14	3	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:14.4	nor does the sun shed its light;	ud1.10	14	4	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:14.5	there the moon glows not,	ud1.10	14	5	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:14.6	yet no darkness is found.	ud1.10	14	6	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:15.1	And when a sage, a brahmin, finds understanding	ud1.10	15	1	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:15.2	through their own sagacity,	ud1.10	15	2	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:15.3	then from forms and formless,	ud1.10	15	3	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:15.4	from pleasure and pain they are released.”	ud1.10	15	4	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud1.10:16.1	This too is a heartfelt saying that was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.	ud1.10	16	1	ud	1.10	With Bāhiya
ud2.1:1.1	So I have heard.	ud2.1	1	1	ud	2.1	With Mucalinda
ud2.1:1.2	At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the Mucalinda tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.	ud2.1	1	2	ud	2.1	With Mucalinda
ud2.1:1.3	There the Buddha sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom.	ud2.1	1	3	ud	2.1	With Mucalinda
ud2.1:2.1	Just then a great storm blew up out of season, bringing seven days of rain, cold winds, and clouds.	ud2.1	2	1	ud	2.1	With Mucalinda
ud2.1:2.2	Mucalinda, the dragon king, came out from his abode, encircled the Buddha’s body with seven coils and spread his large hood over his head, thinking,	ud2.1	2	2	ud	2.1	With Mucalinda
ud2.1:2.3	“May the Buddha not be hot or cold, nor be bothered by flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, or reptiles.”	ud2.1	2	3	ud	2.1	With Mucalinda
ud2.1:3.1	When seven days had passed, the Buddha emerged from that state of immersion.	ud2.1	3	1	ud	2.1	With Mucalinda
ud2.1:3.2	When he knew the sky was clear, Mucalinda unwrapped his coils from the Buddha’s body. Hiding his own form, he manifested in the form of a brahmin youth. He stood in front of the Buddha, venerating him with joined palms.	ud2.1	3	2	ud	2.1	With Mucalinda
ud2.1:4.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud2.1	4	1	ud	2.1	With Mucalinda
ud2.1:5.1	“Seclusion is happiness for the contented	ud2.1	5	1	ud	2.1	With Mucalinda
ud2.1:5.2	who see the teaching they have learned.	ud2.1	5	2	ud	2.1	With Mucalinda
ud2.1:5.3	Kindness for the world is happiness	ud2.1	5	3	ud	2.1	With Mucalinda
ud2.1:5.4	for one who’d not harm a living creature.	ud2.1	5	4	ud	2.1	With Mucalinda
ud2.1:6.1	Dispassion for the world is happiness	ud2.1	6	1	ud	2.1	With Mucalinda
ud2.1:6.2	for one who has gone beyond sensual pleasures.	ud2.1	6	2	ud	2.1	With Mucalinda
ud2.1:6.3	But dispelling the conceit ‘I am’	ud2.1	6	3	ud	2.1	With Mucalinda
ud2.1:6.4	is truly the ultimate happiness.”	ud2.1	6	4	ud	2.1	With Mucalinda
ud2.2:1.1	So I have heard.	ud2.2	1	1	ud	2.2	Kings
ud2.2:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud2.2	1	2	ud	2.2	Kings
ud2.2:1.3	Now at that time, after the meal, on return from almsround, several mendicants sat together in the assembly hall and this discussion came up among them:	ud2.2	1	3	ud	2.2	Kings
ud2.2:1.4	“Which of these two kings has greater wealth, riches, treasury, dominion, vehicles, forces, might, and power: King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha or King Pasenadi of Kosala?”	ud2.2	1	4	ud	2.2	Kings
ud2.2:1.5	At that point the conversation among those mendicants was left unfinished.	ud2.2	1	5	ud	2.2	Kings
ud2.2:2.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat, went to the assembly hall, sat down on the seat spread out,	ud2.2	2	1	ud	2.2	Kings
ud2.2:2.2	and addressed the mendicants:	ud2.2	2	2	ud	2.2	Kings
ud2.2:2.3	“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	ud2.2	2	3	ud	2.2	Kings
ud2.2:3.1	So the mendicants told him what they had been talking about when the Buddha arrived. The Buddha said,	ud2.2	3	1	ud	2.2	Kings
ud2.2:4.1	“Mendicants, it is not appropriate for you gentlemen who have gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness to talk about such things.	ud2.2	4	1	ud	2.2	Kings
ud2.2:4.2	When you’re sitting together you should do one of two things:	ud2.2	4	2	ud	2.2	Kings
ud2.2:4.3	discuss the teachings or keep noble silence.”	ud2.2	4	3	ud	2.2	Kings
ud2.2:5.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud2.2	5	1	ud	2.2	Kings
ud2.2:6.1	“Neither the pleasures of the senses,	ud2.2	6	1	ud	2.2	Kings
ud2.2:6.2	nor even divine happiness,	ud2.2	6	2	ud	2.2	Kings
ud2.2:6.3	is worth even a sixteenth part	ud2.2	6	3	ud	2.2	Kings
ud2.2:6.4	of the happiness of craving’s end.”	ud2.2	6	4	ud	2.2	Kings
ud2.3:1.1	So I have heard.	ud2.3	1	1	ud	2.3	A Stick
ud2.3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud2.3	1	2	ud	2.3	A Stick
ud2.3:1.3	Now at that time, between Sāvatthī and the Jeta Grove, several boys were hitting a snake with a stick.	ud2.3	1	3	ud	2.3	A Stick
ud2.3:1.4	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	ud2.3	1	4	ud	2.3	A Stick
ud2.3:1.5	He saw the boys hitting the snake.	ud2.3	1	5	ud	2.3	A Stick
ud2.3:2.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud2.3	2	1	ud	2.3	A Stick
ud2.3:3.1	“Creatures love happiness,	ud2.3	3	1	ud	2.3	A Stick
ud2.3:3.2	so if you harm them with a stick	ud2.3	3	2	ud	2.3	A Stick

ud2.3:4.4	after death you will find happiness.”	ud2.3	4	4	ud	2.3	A Stick
ud2.4:1.1	So I have heard.	ud2.4	1	1	ud	2.4	Esteem
ud2.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud2.4	1	2	ud	2.4	Esteem
ud2.4:1.3	Now at that time the Buddha was honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And he received robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	ud2.4	1	3	ud	2.4	Esteem
ud2.4:1.4	And the mendicant Saṅgha was also honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And they received robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	ud2.4	1	4	ud	2.4	Esteem
ud2.4:1.5	But the wanderers who followed other religions were not honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And they didn’t receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	ud2.4	1	5	ud	2.4	Esteem
ud2.4:1.6	Then those wanderers who followed other religions, unable to bear the esteem of the mendicant Sangha, abused, attacked, harassed, and troubled the mendicants in the village and the wilderness.	ud2.4	1	6	ud	2.4	Esteem
ud2.4:2.1	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	ud2.4	2	1	ud	2.4	Esteem
ud2.4:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud2.4	3	1	ud	2.4	Esteem
ud2.4:4.1	“When struck by pleasure and pain <j>in the village or wilderness,	ud2.4	4	1	ud	2.4	Esteem

ud2.5:1.1	So I have heard.	ud2.5	1	1	ud	2.5	A Lay Follower
ud2.5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud2.5	1	2	ud	2.5	A Lay Follower
ud2.5:1.3	Now at that time a certain lay follower from Icchānaṅgalaka arrived at Sāvatthī on some business.	ud2.5	1	3	ud	2.5	A Lay Follower
ud2.5:1.4	Having concluded his business in Sāvatthī he went to see the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.	ud2.5	1	4	ud	2.5	A Lay Follower
ud2.5:1.5	The Buddha said this to him:	ud2.5	1	5	ud	2.5	A Lay Follower
ud2.5:1.6	“It’s been a long time, lay follower, since you took the opportunity to come here.”	ud2.5	1	6	ud	2.5	A Lay Follower

ud2.6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud2.6	1	2	ud	2.6	The Pregnant Woman
ud2.6:1.3	Now at that time a certain wanderer had a young brahmin wife who was pregnant and about to give birth.	ud2.6	1	3	ud	2.6	The Pregnant Woman
ud2.6:1.4	She said to him,	ud2.6	1	4	ud	2.6	The Pregnant Woman
ud2.6:1.5	“Go, brahmin, bring oil for my delivery.”	ud2.6	1	5	ud	2.6	The Pregnant Woman
ud2.6:2.1	The wanderer said,	ud2.6	2	1	ud	2.6	The Pregnant Woman
ud2.6:2.2	“But where, my dear, can I get oil?”	ud2.6	2	2	ud	2.6	The Pregnant Woman
ud2.6:2.3	For a second time, she said,	ud2.6	2	3	ud	2.6	The Pregnant Woman
ud2.6:2.4	“Go, brahmin, bring oil for my delivery.”	ud2.6	2	4	ud	2.6	The Pregnant Woman

ud2.6:2.8	“Go, brahmin, bring oil for my delivery.”	ud2.6	2	8	ud	2.6	The Pregnant Woman
ud2.6:3.1	Now at that time ghee and oil were being given away to any ascetic or brahmin at the storehouse of King Pasenadi of Kosala. But it was only to drink there, not to take away.	ud2.6	3	1	ud	2.6	The Pregnant Woman
ud2.6:4.1	Knowing this, the wanderer thought,	ud2.6	4	1	ud	2.6	The Pregnant Woman
ud2.6:4.3	“Why don’t I go to the king’s storehouse, drink as much oil as I can, then come home and throw it up so it can be used for the delivery?”	ud2.6	4	3	ud	2.6	The Pregnant Woman
ud2.6:5.1	Then he did just that. But when he got home he was unable to either bring it up or pass it out.	ud2.6	5	1	ud	2.6	The Pregnant Woman
ud2.6:5.2	He rolled to and fro, suffering painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings.	ud2.6	5	2	ud	2.6	The Pregnant Woman

ud2.6:6.2	He saw the wanderer in agony.	ud2.6	6	2	ud	2.6	The Pregnant Woman

ud2.8:1.4	While suffering painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings, three thoughts helped her endure:	ud2.8	1	4	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā

ud2.8:9.1	Now at that time a certain lay follower had already invited the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha for the meal on the following day.	ud2.8	9	1	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:9.2	That lay follower was Venerable Mahāmoggallāna’s supporter.	ud2.8	9	2	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:9.3	Then the Buddha addressed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna,	ud2.8	9	3	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:9.4	“Please, Moggallāna, go to the that lay follower and say to him,	ud2.8	9	4	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:9.5	‘Suppavāsā the Koliyan, who was pregnant for seven years, and in difficult labor for seven days,	ud2.8	9	5	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā

ud2.8:9.9	He is your supporter.”	ud2.8	9	9	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:10.1	“Yes, sir,” replied Mahāmoggallāna. He went to that lay follower and conveyed the Buddha’s request.	ud2.8	10	1	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:11.1	“If, sir, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna can guarantee me three things—	ud2.8	11	1	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:11.2	wealth, life, and faith—	ud2.8	11	2	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā

ud2.8:11.6	But as for faith, you alone are the guarantor.”	ud2.8	11	6	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:12.1	“If, sir Venerable Mahāmoggallāna can guarantee me two things—	ud2.8	12	1	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā

ud2.8:12.3	then let Suppavāsā make seven meals, afterwards I shall make mine.”	ud2.8	12	3	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:13.1	Having persuaded that lay follower, Mahāmoggallāna went to the Buddha and said,	ud2.8	13	1	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:13.2	“I’ve persuaded the lay follower.	ud2.8	13	2	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:13.3	Let Suppavāsā make seven meals, afterwards he shall make his.”	ud2.8	13	3	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:14.1	For seven days Suppavāsā served and satisfied the Buddha with her own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	ud2.8	14	1	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:14.2	And she made her little boy bow to the Buddha and the mendicant Sangha.	ud2.8	14	2	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:15.1	Then Sāriputta said to the boy,	ud2.8	15	1	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:15.2	“I hope you’re keeping well, little boy; I hope you’re alright. I hope that you are not in pain.”	ud2.8	15	2	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:15.3	“How could I be keeping well? How could I be alright?	ud2.8	15	3	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:15.4	For seven years I lived in a pot of blood.”	ud2.8	15	4	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:16.1	Then Suppavāsā, thinking,	ud2.8	16	1	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:16.2	“My child is conversing with the General of the Dhamma!” was uplifted and overjoyed, full of rapture and happiness.	ud2.8	16	2	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:16.3	Knowing this, the Buddha said to her,	ud2.8	16	3	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:16.4	“Would you like to have another child like this?”	ud2.8	16	4	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:16.5	“Sir, I would like to have seven more children like this!”	ud2.8	16	5	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:17.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud2.8	17	1	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā
ud2.8:18.1	“Pain in the guise of pleasure,	ud2.8	18	1	ud	2.8	Suppavāsā

ud2.9:1.1	So I have heard.	ud2.9	1	1	ud	2.9	With Visākhā
ud2.9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.	ud2.9	1	2	ud	2.9	With Visākhā
ud2.9:1.3	Now at that time Visākhā was caught up in some business with King Pasenadi.	ud2.9	1	3	ud	2.9	With Visākhā
ud2.9:1.4	But the king’s settlement did not meet her expectations.	ud2.9	1	4	ud	2.9	With Visākhā
ud2.9:2.1	Then, in the middle of the day, she went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.	ud2.9	2	1	ud	2.9	With Visākhā
ud2.9:2.2	The Buddha said to her:	ud2.9	2	2	ud	2.9	With Visākhā
ud2.9:2.3	“So, Visākhā, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”	ud2.9	2	3	ud	2.9	With Visākhā

ud2.9:2.5	But the king’s settlement did not meet my expectations.”	ud2.9	2	5	ud	2.9	With Visākhā
ud2.9:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud2.9	3	1	ud	2.9	With Visākhā
ud2.9:4.1	“All under another’s control is suffering,	ud2.9	4	1	ud	2.9	With Visākhā

ud2.10:1.1	So I have heard.	ud2.10	1	1	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Anupiya in a mango grove.	ud2.10	1	2	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:1.3	Now at that time, Venerable Bhaddiya son of Kāḷīgodhā, even in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, frequently expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud2.10	1	3	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:1.4	“Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!”	ud2.10	1	4	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:2.1	Several mendicants heard him	ud2.10	2	1	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:2.3	and thought,	ud2.10	2	3	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:2.4	“Without a doubt, Venerable Bhaddiya leads the spiritual life dissatisfied.	ud2.10	2	4	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:2.5	It’s when recalling the pleasures of royalty he formerly enjoyed as a lay person that, even in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, he frequently expresses this heartfelt sentiment:	ud2.10	2	5	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:2.6	‘Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!’”	ud2.10	2	6	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:3.1	Then those mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was happening.	ud2.10	3	1	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:4.1	So the Buddha addressed a certain monk,	ud2.10	4	1	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:4.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Bhaddiya that	ud2.10	4	2	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya

ud2.10:5.1	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Bhaddiya and said to him,	ud2.10	5	1	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:5.2	“Reverend Bhaddiya, the teacher summons you.”	ud2.10	5	2	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:5.3	“Yes, reverend,” Bhaddiya replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:	ud2.10	5	3	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:6.1	“Is it really true, Bhaddiya, that even in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, you frequently express this heartfelt sentiment:	ud2.10	6	1	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:6.2	‘Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!’?”	ud2.10	6	2	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:6.3	“Yes, sir.”	ud2.10	6	3	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:7.1	“But why do you say this?”	ud2.10	7	1	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:7.3	“Formerly, as a lay person ruling the land, my guard was well organized within and without the royal compound, within and without the city, and within and without the country.	ud2.10	7	3	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:7.4	But although I was guarded and defended in this way, I remained fearful, scared, suspicious, and nervous.	ud2.10	7	4	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:7.5	But these days, even when alone in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, I’m not fearful, scared, suspicious, or nervous. I live relaxed, unruffled, surviving on charity, my heart free as a wild deer.	ud2.10	7	5	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:7.6	It is for this reason that, even in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, I frequently expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud2.10	7	6	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:7.7	‘Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!’”	ud2.10	7	7	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:8.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud2.10	8	1	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya
ud2.10:9.1	“They who hide no anger within,	ud2.10	9	1	ud	2.10	With Bhaddiya

ud3.1:1.1	So I have heard.	ud3.1	1	1	ud	3.1	Born of the Fruits of deeds
ud3.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud3.1	1	2	ud	3.1	Born of the Fruits of deeds
ud3.1:1.3	Now, at that time a certain mendicant was sitting not far from the Buddha, cross-legged, with his body straight. As a result of past deeds, he suffered painful, sharp, severe, and acute feelings, which he endured unbothered, with mindfulness and awareness.	ud3.1	1	3	ud	3.1	Born of the Fruits of deeds
ud3.1:2.1	The Buddha saw him meditating and enduring that pain.	ud3.1	2	1	ud	3.1	Born of the Fruits of deeds
ud3.1:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud3.1	3	1	ud	3.1	Born of the Fruits of deeds

ud3.2:1.1	So I have heard.	ud3.2	1	1	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud3.2	1	2	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Nanda, the Buddha’s brother and maternal cousin, informed several mendicants:	ud3.2	1	3	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:1.4	“I lead the spiritual life dissatisfied.	ud3.2	1	4	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:1.5	I am unable to keep up the spiritual life. I shall resign the training and return to a lesser life.”	ud3.2	1	5	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:2.1	Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was happening.	ud3.2	2	1	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:3.1	So the Buddha addressed a certain monk,	ud3.2	3	1	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:3.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Nanda that	ud3.2	3	2	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:3.3	the teacher summons him.”	ud3.2	3	3	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:3.4	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Nanda and said to him,	ud3.2	3	4	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:3.5	“Reverend Nanda, the teacher summons you.”	ud3.2	3	5	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:4.1	“Yes, reverend,” Nanda replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:	ud3.2	4	1	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:5.1	“Is it really true, Nanda, that you informed several mendicants that	ud3.2	5	1	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:5.2	you are unable to keep up the spiritual life; that you shall resign the training and return to a lesser life?”	ud3.2	5	2	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:5.3	“Yes, sir,” he replied.	ud3.2	5	3	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:6.1	“But why are you so dissatisfied with the spiritual life?”	ud3.2	6	1	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:6.2	“As I left my house, sir, the finest lady of the Sakyan land, her hair half-combed, glanced at me and said,	ud3.2	6	2	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:6.3	‘Hurry back, master.’	ud3.2	6	3	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:6.4	Recalling that, I am dissatisfied and shall resign the training.”	ud3.2	6	4	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:7.1	Then the Buddha took Nanda by the arm and, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared among the gods of the Thirty-Three.	ud3.2	7	1	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:8.1	Now at that time five hundred dove-footed nymphs had come to attend to Sakka, the lord of gods.	ud3.2	8	1	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:8.2	Then the Buddha said to Nanda,	ud3.2	8	2	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:8.3	“Nanda, do you see these five hundred dove-footed nymphs?”	ud3.2	8	3	ud	3.2	With Nanda

ud3.2:9.1	“What do you think, Nanda? Who is more attractive, good-looking, and lovely—the finest lady of the Sakyan land, or these five hundred dove-footed nymphs?”	ud3.2	9	1	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:9.2	“Compared to these five hundred dove-footed nymphs, the finest lady of the Sakyan land is like a deformed monkey with its ears and nose cut off.	ud3.2	9	2	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:9.3	She doesn’t count, there’s no comparison, she’s not worth a fraction.	ud3.2	9	3	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:9.4	These five hundred dove-footed nymphs are far more attractive, good-looking, and lovely.”	ud3.2	9	4	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:10.1	“Rejoice, Nanda, rejoice!	ud3.2	10	1	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:10.2	I guarantee you five hundred dove-footed nymphs.”	ud3.2	10	2	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:10.3	“If, sir, you guarantee me five hundred dove-footed nymphs, I shall happily lead the spiritual life under the Buddha.”	ud3.2	10	3	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:11.1	Then the Buddha took Nanda by the arm and, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the gods of the Thirty-Three and reappeared at Jeta’s Grove.	ud3.2	11	1	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:12.1	The mendicants heard,	ud3.2	12	1	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:12.2	“It seems Venerable Nanda—who is both the Buddha’s half-brother and maternal cousin—leads the spiritual life for the sake of nymphs.	ud3.2	12	2	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:12.3	And it seems that the Buddha guaranteed him five hundred dove-footed nymphs.”	ud3.2	12	3	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:13.1	Monks who were his friends accused him of being a hireling and a lackey,	ud3.2	13	1	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:13.2	“It seems Nanda is a hireling, it seems he is a lackey: he leads the spiritual life for the sake of nymphs.	ud3.2	13	2	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:13.3	And it seems that the Buddha guaranteed him five hundred dove-footed nymphs.”	ud3.2	13	3	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:14.1	Then Nanda—embarrassed, ashamed, and disgusted at being called a hireling and a lackey—living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	ud3.2	14	1	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:14.2	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”	ud3.2	14	2	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:14.3	Venerable Nanda became one of the perfected.	ud3.2	14	3	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:15.1	Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:	ud3.2	15	1	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:15.2	“Sir, Venerable Nanda—who is both the Buddha’s half-brother and maternal cousin—has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. He lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.”	ud3.2	15	2	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:15.3	And the knowledge also came to the Buddha:	ud3.2	15	3	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:15.4	“Nanda has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. He lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.”	ud3.2	15	4	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:16.1	Then, when the night had passed, Nanda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	ud3.2	16	1	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:16.2	“Sir, you guaranteed me five hundred dove-footed nymphs. I release you from that promise.”	ud3.2	16	2	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:16.3	“Nanda, I comprehended your mind and knew that	ud3.2	16	3	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:16.4	you had realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom.	ud3.2	16	4	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:16.5	And deities also told me about this.	ud3.2	16	5	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:16.7	As soon as your mind was freed from defilements by not grasping, I was released from that promise.”	ud3.2	16	7	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:17.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud3.2	17	1	ud	3.2	With Nanda
ud3.2:18.1	“The mendicant who has crossed over the bog,	ud3.2	18	1	ud	3.2	With Nanda

ud3.3:1.1	So I have heard.	ud3.3	1	1	ud	3.3	With Yasoja

ud3.3:1.4	At that, those visiting mendicants, while exchanging pleasantries with the resident mendicants, preparing their lodgings, and putting away their bowls and robes, made a dreadful racket.	ud3.3	1	4	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:2.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	ud3.3	2	1	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:2.2	“Ānanda, who’s making that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”	ud3.3	2	2	ud	3.3	With Yasoja

ud3.3:4.4	It’s these visiting mendicants who, while exchanging pleasantries with the resident mendicants, preparing their lodgings, and putting away their bowls and robes, made a dreadful racket.”	ud3.3	4	4	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:4.5	“Go away, mendicants, I dismiss you. You are not to stay in my presence.”	ud3.3	4	5	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:5.1	“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. They got up from their seats, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. They set their lodgings in order and left, taking their bowls and robes.	ud3.3	5	1	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:5.2	Traveling stage by stage in the land of the Vajjis, they arrived at the Vaggumudā River. They built leaf huts near the riverbank and there they entered the rainy season.	ud3.3	5	2	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:6.1	Then Venerable Yasoja, having entered the rainy season, addressed the mendicants:	ud3.3	6	1	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:6.2	“Out of compassion, reverends, the Buddha dismissed us, wanting what’s best for us.	ud3.3	6	2	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:6.3	Come, let us live in such a way that the Buddha would be pleased with us.”	ud3.3	6	3	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:6.4	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.	ud3.3	6	4	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:6.5	Then those mendicants, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, all realized the three knowledges in that same rainy season.	ud3.3	6	5	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:7.1	When the Buddha had stayed in Sāvatthī as long as he pleased, he set out for Vesālī.	ud3.3	7	1	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:7.2	Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Vesālī,	ud3.3	7	2	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:7.3	where he stayed in the hall with the peaked roof.	ud3.3	7	3	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:8.1	Then, having applied his mind to comprehending the minds of the mendicants staying on the bank of the river Vaggumudā, the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	ud3.3	8	1	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:8.2	“A light, it appears to me, has arisen in this quarter, Ānanda; a brightness has arisen.	ud3.3	8	2	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:8.3	I’m not put off at the thought of going to where the mendicants are staying on the bank of the river Vaggumudā.	ud3.3	8	3	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:8.4	Send a message to those mendicants:	ud3.3	8	4	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:8.5	‘Venerables, the teacher summons you. He wants to see you.’”	ud3.3	8	5	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:9.1	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. He went to one of the mendicants and said,	ud3.3	9	1	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:9.2	“Please, Reverend, go to the mendicants staying on the bank of the river Vaggumudā and say to them,	ud3.3	9	2	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:9.3	‘Venerables, the teacher summons you. He wants to see you.’”	ud3.3	9	3	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:10.1	“Yes, reverend,” replied that mendicant.	ud3.3	10	1	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:10.2	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof, and reappeared in front of those mendicants on the bank of the river Vaggumudā.	ud3.3	10	2	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:10.3	Then he said to those mendicants,	ud3.3	10	3	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:10.4	“Venerables, the teacher summons you. He wants to see you.”	ud3.3	10	4	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:11.1	“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants. They set their lodgings in order and took their bowls and robes.	ud3.3	11	1	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:11.2	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from the bank of the river Vaggumudā, and reappeared in the presence of the Buddha in the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	ud3.3	11	2	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:11.3	But at that time the Buddha was sitting immersed in imperturbable meditation.	ud3.3	11	3	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:11.4	Then those mendicants thought,	ud3.3	11	4	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:11.5	“What kind of meditation is the Buddha practicing right now?”	ud3.3	11	5	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:11.6	They thought,	ud3.3	11	6	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:11.7	“He is practicing the imperturbable meditation.”	ud3.3	11	7	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:11.8	They all sat in imperturbable meditation.	ud3.3	11	8	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:12.1	And then, as the night was getting late, in the first watch of the night, Venerable Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said,	ud3.3	12	1	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:12.2	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the first watch of the night, and the visiting mendicants have been sitting long.	ud3.3	12	2	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:12.3	Sir, please greet the visiting mendicants.”	ud3.3	12	3	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:12.4	But the Buddha kept silent.	ud3.3	12	4	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:13.1	For a second time, as the night was getting late, in the middle watch of the night, Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said,	ud3.3	13	1	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:13.2	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the second watch of the night, and the visiting mendicants have been sitting long.	ud3.3	13	2	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:13.5	Sir, please greet the visiting mendicants.”	ud3.3	13	5	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:13.6	But for a second time the Buddha kept silent.	ud3.3	13	6	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:14.1	For a third time, as the night was getting late, in the last watch of the night, as dawn stirred, bringing joy to the night, Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said,	ud3.3	14	1	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:14.2	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the last watch of the night; dawn stirs, bringing joy to the night, and the visiting mendicants have been sitting long.	ud3.3	14	2	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:14.7	Sir, please greet the visiting mendicants.”	ud3.3	14	7	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:15.1	Then the Buddha emerged from that immersion and addressed Ānanda,	ud3.3	15	1	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:15.2	“If you’d known, Ānanda, you wouldn’t have said so much.	ud3.3	15	2	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:15.3	Both I and these five hundred mendicants have been sitting in imperturbable meditation.”	ud3.3	15	3	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:16.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud3.3	16	1	ud	3.3	With Yasoja
ud3.3:17.1	“A mendicant who has beaten <j>the thorn of sensuality—	ud3.3	17	1	ud	3.3	With Yasoja

ud3.4:1.1	So I have heard.	ud3.4	1	1	ud	3.4	With Sāriputta
ud3.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud3.4	1	2	ud	3.4	With Sāriputta
ud3.4:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far from the Buddha, cross-legged, his body set straight, and mindfulness established in front of him.	ud3.4	1	3	ud	3.4	With Sāriputta
ud3.4:1.4	The Buddha saw him meditating there.	ud3.4	1	4	ud	3.4	With Sāriputta
ud3.4:2.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud3.4	2	1	ud	3.4	With Sāriputta
ud3.4:3.1	“As a rocky mountain	ud3.4	3	1	ud	3.4	With Sāriputta

ud3.4:3.3	so when delusion ends,	ud3.4	3	3	ud	3.4	With Sāriputta
ud3.4:3.4	a monk, like a mountain, doesn’t tremble.”	ud3.4	3	4	ud	3.4	With Sāriputta
ud3.5:1.1	So I have heard.	ud3.5	1	1	ud	3.5	With Mahāmoggallāna
ud3.5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud3.5	1	2	ud	3.5	With Mahāmoggallāna
ud3.5:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was sitting not far from the Buddha, cross-legged, with his body straight and mindfulness of the body well-established in himself.	ud3.5	1	3	ud	3.5	With Mahāmoggallāna
ud3.5:1.4	The Buddha saw him meditating there.	ud3.5	1	4	ud	3.5	With Mahāmoggallāna
ud3.5:2.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud3.5	2	1	ud	3.5	With Mahāmoggallāna
ud3.5:3.1	“With mindfulness of the body established,	ud3.5	3	1	ud	3.5	With Mahāmoggallāna

ud3.5:3.4	would know quenching in themselves.”	ud3.5	3	4	ud	3.5	With Mahāmoggallāna
ud3.6:1.1	So I have heard.	ud3.6	1	1	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	ud3.6	1	2	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.6:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Pilindavaccha addressed the mendicants as “lowlifes”.	ud3.6	1	3	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.6:1.4	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	ud3.6	1	4	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.6:1.5	“Sir, Venerable Pilindavaccha addresses the mendicants as ‘lowlifes’.”	ud3.6	1	5	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.6:2.1	So the Buddha addressed a certain monk,	ud3.6	2	1	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.6:2.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Pilindavaccha that	ud3.6	2	2	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.6:2.3	the Teacher summons him.”	ud3.6	2	3	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.6:2.4	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Pilindavaccha and said to him,	ud3.6	2	4	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.6:2.5	“Reverend Pilindavaccha, the teacher summons you.”	ud3.6	2	5	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.6:3.1	“Yes, reverend,” Pilindavaccha replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:	ud3.6	3	1	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.6:3.2	“Is it really true, Vaccha, that you addressed the mendicants as ‘lowlifes’?”	ud3.6	3	2	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.6:3.3	“Yes, sir,” he replied.	ud3.6	3	3	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.6:4.1	Then, having applied his mind to Pilindavaccha’s past lives, the Buddha said to the mendicants,	ud3.6	4	1	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.6:4.2	“Mendicants, don’t complain about the mendicant Vaccha.	ud3.6	4	2	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.6:4.3	He doesn’t addresses the mendicants as ‘lowlifes’ out of hate.	ud3.6	4	3	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.6:4.4	For five hundred lives without interruption he was reborn in a brahmin family.	ud3.6	4	4	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.6:4.5	For a long time, he has addressed people as ‘lowlife’.	ud3.6	4	5	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.6:4.6	That’s why he addresses the mendicants as ‘lowlifes’.”	ud3.6	4	6	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.6:5.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud3.6	5	1	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.6:6.1	“In whom dwells no deceit or conceit,	ud3.6	6	1	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha

ud3.6:6.4	they are a brahmin, an ascetic, a mendicant.”	ud3.6	6	4	ud	3.6	With Pilindavaccha
ud3.7:1.1	So I have heard.	ud3.7	1	1	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	ud3.7	1	2	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Mahākassapa was staying in the Pipphali cave. Having entered a certain state of immersion, he sat cross-legged for seven days without moving.	ud3.7	1	3	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:1.4	When seven days had passed, Mahākassapa emerged from that state of immersion.	ud3.7	1	4	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:1.5	It occurred to him,	ud3.7	1	5	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:1.6	“Why not enter Rājagaha for almsfood?”	ud3.7	1	6	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:2.1	Now at that time five hundred deities were ready and eager for the chance to offer alms to Mahākassapa.	ud3.7	2	1	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:2.2	But Mahākasspa refused those deities. In the morning, he robed up, took his bowl and robe, and entered Rājagaha for alms.	ud3.7	2	2	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:2.3	Now at that time Sakka, lord of Gods, wished to give alms to Mahākassapa.	ud3.7	2	3	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:3.2	Having manifested in the appearance of a weaver, he worked the loom while the demon maiden Sujā fed the shuttle.	ud3.7	3	2	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:3.3	Then, as Mahākassapa wandered indiscriminately for almsfood in Rājagaha, he approached Sakka’s house.	ud3.7	3	3	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:3.4	Seeing Mahākassapa coming off in the distance,	ud3.7	3	4	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:3.5	Sakka came out of his house, greeted him, and took the bowl from his hand. He re-entered the house and filled the bowl with rice from the pot.	ud3.7	3	5	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:3.6	That almsfood had many tasty soups and sauces.	ud3.7	3	6	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:3.7	Then it occurred to Mahākassapa,	ud3.7	3	7	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:3.8	“Now, what being is this who has such psychic power?”	ud3.7	3	8	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:3.9	It occurred to him,	ud3.7	3	9	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:3.10	“This is Sakka, lord of Gods.”	ud3.7	3	10	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:3.11	Knowing this, he said to Sakka,	ud3.7	3	11	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:3.12	“This is your doing, Kosiya;	ud3.7	3	12	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:3.13	don’t do such a thing again.”	ud3.7	3	13	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:3.14	“But Honorable Kassapa, we too need merit!	ud3.7	3	14	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:3.15	We too ought make merit.”	ud3.7	3	15	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:4.1	Then Sakka bowed and respectfully circled Mahākassapa, keeping him on his right. Then he rose into the air and, sitting cross-legged in the sky, expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times:	ud3.7	4	1	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:4.2	“Oh the gift, the best gift is well established in Kassapa!	ud3.7	4	2	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:4.3	Oh the gift, the best gift is well established in Kassapa!	ud3.7	4	3	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:4.4	Oh the gift, the best gift is well established in Kassapa!”	ud3.7	4	4	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:4.5	With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard Sakka express this heartfelt sentiment while sitting in the sky.	ud3.7	4	5	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:5.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud3.7	5	1	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying
ud3.7:6.1	“A mendicant who relies on alms,	ud3.7	6	1	ud	3.7	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying

ud3.8:1.1	So I have heard.	ud3.8	1	1	ud	3.8	One Who Eats Only Almsfood
ud3.8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud3.8	1	2	ud	3.8	One Who Eats Only Almsfood
ud3.8:1.3	Now at that time, after the meal, on return from almsround, several mendicants sat together in the pavilion by the kareri tree and this discussion came up among them:	ud3.8	1	3	ud	3.8	One Who Eats Only Almsfood
ud3.8:2.1	“Reverends, when a mendicant who eats only almsfood is wandering for alms, from time to time they get to see pleasing sights, hear pleasing sounds, smell pleasing smells, taste pleasing tastes, and encounter pleasing touches.	ud3.8	2	1	ud	3.8	One Who Eats Only Almsfood
ud3.8:2.2	They wander for alms being honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed.	ud3.8	2	2	ud	3.8	One Who Eats Only Almsfood
ud3.8:2.3	Come, we too should eat only almsfood.	ud3.8	2	3	ud	3.8	One Who Eats Only Almsfood

ud3.8:2.5	We too shall wander for alms being honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed.”	ud3.8	2	5	ud	3.8	One Who Eats Only Almsfood
ud3.8:2.6	At that point the conversation among those mendicants was left unfinished.	ud3.8	2	6	ud	3.8	One Who Eats Only Almsfood
ud3.8:3.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the pavilion by the kareri tree, where he sat on the seat spread out	ud3.8	3	1	ud	3.8	One Who Eats Only Almsfood
ud3.8:3.2	and addressed the mendicants:	ud3.8	3	2	ud	3.8	One Who Eats Only Almsfood
ud3.8:3.3	“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	ud3.8	3	3	ud	3.8	One Who Eats Only Almsfood
ud3.8:4.1	So the mendicants told him what they had been talking about. The Buddha said,	ud3.8	4	1	ud	3.8	One Who Eats Only Almsfood
ud3.8:6.1	“Mendicants, it is not appropriate for you gentlemen who have gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness to talk about such things.	ud3.8	6	1	ud	3.8	One Who Eats Only Almsfood
ud3.8:6.2	When you’re sitting together you should do one of two things:	ud3.8	6	2	ud	3.8	One Who Eats Only Almsfood
ud3.8:6.3	discuss the teachings or keep noble silence.”	ud3.8	6	3	ud	3.8	One Who Eats Only Almsfood
ud3.8:7.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud3.8	7	1	ud	3.8	One Who Eats Only Almsfood

ud3.9:2.24	or geomancy.	ud3.9	2	24	ud	3.9	Professions
ud3.9:2.25	At that point the conversation among those mendicants was left unfinished.	ud3.9	2	25	ud	3.9	Professions
ud3.9:3.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall. He sat down on the seat spread out,	ud3.9	3	1	ud	3.9	Professions
ud3.9:3.2	and addressed the mendicants:	ud3.9	3	2	ud	3.9	Professions
ud3.9:3.3	“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	ud3.9	3	3	ud	3.9	Professions
ud3.9:4.1	So the mendicants told him what they had been talking about when the Buddha arrived. The Buddha said,	ud3.9	4	1	ud	3.9	Professions
ud3.9:6.1	“Mendicants, it is not appropriate for you gentlemen who have gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness to talk about such things.	ud3.9	6	1	ud	3.9	Professions
ud3.9:6.2	When you’re sitting together you should do one of two things:	ud3.9	6	2	ud	3.9	Professions
ud3.9:6.3	discuss the teachings or keep noble silence.”	ud3.9	6	3	ud	3.9	Professions
ud3.9:7.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud3.9	7	1	ud	3.9	Professions
ud3.9:8.1	“Living without a craft, light, desiring the good,	ud3.9	8	1	ud	3.9	Professions
ud3.9:8.2	with senses controlled, everywhere free;	ud3.9	8	2	ud	3.9	Professions
ud3.9:8.3	a migrant with no shelter, unselfish, <j>with no need for hope,	ud3.9	8	3	ud	3.9	Professions
ud3.9:8.4	having given up conceit, wandering alone: <j>that is a mendicant.”	ud3.9	8	4	ud	3.9	Professions
ud3.10:1.1	So I have heard.	ud3.10	1	1	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:1.2	At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the tree of awakening on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.	ud3.10	1	2	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:1.3	There the Buddha sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom.	ud3.10	1	3	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:2.1	When seven days had passed, the Buddha emerged from that state of immersion and surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha.	ud3.10	2	1	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:2.2	He saw sentient beings tormented with many torments, and burning with many fevers	ud3.10	2	2	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:2.3	born of greed, hate, and delusion.	ud3.10	2	3	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud3.10	3	1	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:4.1	“This world, born in torment,	ud3.10	4	1	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:4.2	overcome by contact, speaks of disease as the self.	ud3.10	4	2	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:4.3	For whatever it thinks it is,	ud3.10	4	3	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:4.4	it turns out to be something else.	ud3.10	4	4	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:5.1	The world is attached to continued existence, <j>overcome by continued existence,	ud3.10	5	1	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:5.2	taking pleasure only in continued existence, <j>yet it becomes something else.	ud3.10	5	2	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:5.3	What it enjoys, that is the fear;	ud3.10	5	3	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:5.4	what it fears, that is the suffering.	ud3.10	5	4	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:5.5	But this spiritual life is led	ud3.10	5	5	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:5.6	in order to give up continued existence.	ud3.10	5	6	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:6.1	Of the ascetics and brahmins who say that through continued existence one is freed from continued existence, none are themselves freed from continued existence, I say.	ud3.10	6	1	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:6.2	Of the ascetics and brahmins who say that through annihilation of existence one escapes from continued existence, none have themselves escaped from continued existence, I say.	ud3.10	6	2	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:7.1	For this suffering originates dependent on all attachment. With the ending of all grasping there is no origination of suffering.	ud3.10	7	1	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:7.2	Just look at this world!	ud3.10	7	2	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:7.3	Mired in all sorts of ignorance, beings in love with being are not released from continued existence.	ud3.10	7	3	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:7.4	Whatever states of continued existence there are—everywhere, all over—all are impermanent, suffering, and perishable.	ud3.10	7	4	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:8.1	One who sees truly like this,	ud3.10	8	1	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:8.2	with right wisdom,	ud3.10	8	2	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:8.3	gives up craving for continued existence,	ud3.10	8	3	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:8.4	while not looking forward to ending existence.	ud3.10	8	4	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:8.5	Extinguishment comes <j>from the ending of all cravings;	ud3.10	8	5	ud	3.10	The World

ud3.10:9.1	There is no further existence	ud3.10	9	1	ud	3.10	The World

ud3.10:9.3	Victorious in battle, such a one has defeated Māra;	ud3.10	9	3	ud	3.10	The World
ud3.10:9.4	they’ve gone beyond all states of existence.”	ud3.10	9	4	ud	3.10	The World
ud4.1:1.1	So I have heard.	ud4.1	1	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Cālikā, on the Cālikā mountain.	ud4.1	1	2	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:1.3	Now, at that time Venerable Meghiya was the Buddha’s attendant.	ud4.1	1	3	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:1.4	Then Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	ud4.1	1	4	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:1.5	“Sir, I’d like to enter Jantu village for alms.”	ud4.1	1	5	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:1.6	“Please, Meghiya, go at your convenience.”	ud4.1	1	6	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:2.1	Then Meghiya robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Jantu village for alms.	ud4.1	2	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:2.2	After the meal, on his return from almsround in Jantu village, he went to the shore of Kimikālā river.	ud4.1	2	2	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:2.3	As he was going for a walk along the shore of the river he saw a lovely and delightful mango grove.	ud4.1	2	3	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:2.4	When he saw this he thought,	ud4.1	2	4	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:2.5	“Oh, this mango grove is lovely and delightful! It’s truly good enough for meditation for a gentleman who wants to meditate.	ud4.1	2	5	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:2.6	If the Buddha allows me, I’ll come back to this mango grove to meditate.”	ud4.1	2	6	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:3.1	Then Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding,	ud4.1	3	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:4.8	“If the Buddha allows me, I’ll go back to that mango grove to meditate.”	ud4.1	4	8	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:5.1	When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,	ud4.1	5	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:5.2	“We’re alone, Meghiya. Wait until another mendicant comes.”	ud4.1	5	2	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:6.1	For a second time Meghiya said to the Buddha,	ud4.1	6	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:6.2	“Sir, the Buddha has nothing more to do, and nothing that needs improvement.	ud4.1	6	2	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:6.3	But I have.	ud4.1	6	3	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:6.4	If you allow me, I’ll go back to that mango grove to meditate.”	ud4.1	6	4	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:6.5	For a second time the Buddha said,	ud4.1	6	5	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:6.6	“We’re alone, Meghiya. Wait until another mendicant comes.”	ud4.1	6	6	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:7.1	For a third time Meghiya said to the Buddha,	ud4.1	7	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:7.2	“Sir, the Buddha has nothing more to do, and nothing that needs improvement.	ud4.1	7	2	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:7.3	But I have.	ud4.1	7	3	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:7.4	If you allow me, I’ll go back to that mango grove to meditate.”	ud4.1	7	4	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:7.5	“Meghiya, since you speak of meditation, what can I say?	ud4.1	7	5	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:7.6	Please, Meghiya, go at your convenience.”	ud4.1	7	6	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:8.1	Then Meghiya got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went to that mango grove, and, having plunged deep into it, sat at the root of a certain tree for the day’s meditation.	ud4.1	8	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:8.2	But while Meghiya was meditating in that mango grove he was beset mostly by three kinds of bad, unskillful thoughts, namely,	ud4.1	8	2	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:8.3	sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts.	ud4.1	8	3	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:9.1	Then he thought,	ud4.1	9	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:9.2	“Oh, how incredible, how amazing!	ud4.1	9	2	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:9.3	I’ve gone forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith,	ud4.1	9	3	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:9.4	but I’m still harassed by these three kinds of bad, unskillful thoughts:	ud4.1	9	4	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:9.5	sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts.”	ud4.1	9	5	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:10.1	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Meghiya came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told the Buddha what had happened.	ud4.1	10	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:11.1	“Meghiya, when the heart’s release is not ripe, five things help it ripen.	ud4.1	11	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:11.2	What five?	ud4.1	11	2	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:12.1	Firstly, a mendicant has good friends, companions, and associates.	ud4.1	12	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:12.2	This is the first thing …	ud4.1	12	2	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:13.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.	ud4.1	13	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:13.2	This is the second thing …	ud4.1	13	2	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:14.1	Furthermore, a mendicant gets to take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart and leads solely to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment when they want, without trouble or difficulty. That is, talk about fewness of wishes, contentment, seclusion, aloofness, arousing energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom.’	ud4.1	14	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:14.2	This is the third thing …	ud4.1	14	2	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:15.1	Furthermore, a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.	ud4.1	15	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:15.2	This is the fourth thing …	ud4.1	15	2	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:16.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.	ud4.1	16	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:16.2	This is the fifth thing that, when the heart’s release is not ripe, helps it ripen.	ud4.1	16	2	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:16.3	These are the five things that, when the heart’s release is not ripe, help it ripen.	ud4.1	16	3	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:17.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to be ethical …	ud4.1	17	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:18.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart …	ud4.1	18	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:19.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to be energetic …	ud4.1	19	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:20.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to be wise …	ud4.1	20	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:21.1	But then, a mendicant grounded on these five things should develop four further things.	ud4.1	21	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:21.2	They should develop the perception of ugliness to give up greed, love to give up hate, mindfulness of breathing to cut off thinking, and perception of impermanence to uproot the conceit ‘I am’.	ud4.1	21	2	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:21.3	When you perceive impermanence, the perception of not-self becomes stabilized.	ud4.1	21	3	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:21.4	Perceiving not-self, you uproot the conceit ‘I am’ and attain extinguishment in this very life.”	ud4.1	21	4	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:22.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud4.1	22	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:23.1	“With thoughts whether low or fine,	ud4.1	23	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:23.2	excitement in the mind arises.	ud4.1	23	2	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:23.3	Not understanding these thoughts in the mind,	ud4.1	23	3	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:23.4	one with mind astray runs all over the place.	ud4.1	23	4	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:24.1	Having understood these thoughts in the mind,	ud4.1	24	1	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:24.2	an awakened one—keen, restrained, and mindful—	ud4.1	24	2	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:24.3	has given up them all;	ud4.1	24	3	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.1:24.4	excitement in the mind no longer arises.”	ud4.1	24	4	ud	4.1	With Meghiya
ud4.2:1.1	So I have heard.	ud4.2	1	1	ud	4.2	Restless
ud4.2:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā.	ud4.2	1	2	ud	4.2	Restless
ud4.2:1.3	Now at that time several mendicants were staying not far from the Buddha in a wilderness hut. They were restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties.	ud4.2	1	3	ud	4.2	Restless
ud4.2:2.1	The Buddha saw those mendicants staying nearby.	ud4.2	2	1	ud	4.2	Restless
ud4.2:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud4.2	3	1	ud	4.2	Restless
ud4.2:4.1	“Unguarded in body,	ud4.2	4	1	ud	4.2	Restless
ud4.2:4.2	ruined by wrong view,	ud4.2	4	2	ud	4.2	Restless

ud4.2:4.4	you fall under Māra’s sway.	ud4.2	4	4	ud	4.2	Restless

ud4.2:5.3	and right view at the fore.	ud4.2	5	3	ud	4.2	Restless
ud4.2:5.4	Having understood rise and fall,	ud4.2	5	4	ud	4.2	Restless
ud4.2:5.5	a mendicant who has overcome <j>dullness and drowsiness	ud4.2	5	5	ud	4.2	Restless
ud4.2:5.6	would cast off all bad destinies.”	ud4.2	5	6	ud	4.2	Restless
ud4.3:1.1	So I have heard.	ud4.3	1	1	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	ud4.3	1	2	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:1.3	And then the Buddha left the road, went to the root of a certain tree, and sat down on the seat spread out.	ud4.3	1	3	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:2.1	Then a certain cowherd went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.	ud4.3	2	1	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:2.2	The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk.	ud4.3	2	2	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:3.1	Then the cowherd said to the Buddha,	ud4.3	3	1	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:3.2	“Sir, may the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me.”	ud4.3	3	2	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:3.3	The Buddha consented with silence.	ud4.3	3	3	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:3.4	The cowherd got up from his seat, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.	ud4.3	3	4	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:4.1	And when the night had passed the cowherd had plenty of thick milk-rice prepared in his own home, with fresh ghee. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	ud4.3	4	1	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:4.2	“Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.”	ud4.3	4	2	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:5.1	The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe and, together with the Sangha of monks, went to the house of that cowherd, where he sat down on the prepared seat in the dining hall.	ud4.3	5	1	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:5.2	Then the cowherd served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a thick milk-rice and fresh ghee.	ud4.3	5	2	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:5.3	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, the cowherd took a low seat and sat to one side.	ud4.3	5	3	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:5.4	The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which he got up and left.	ud4.3	5	4	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:5.5	But soon after the Buddha had left, the cowherd was killed by a certain man in the gap between village borders.	ud4.3	5	5	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:6.1	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	ud4.3	6	1	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:7.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud4.3	7	1	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:8.1	“A wrongly directed mind	ud4.3	8	1	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:8.2	would do you more harm	ud4.3	8	2	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:8.3	than a hater to the hated,	ud4.3	8	3	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.3:8.4	or an enemy to their foe.”	ud4.3	8	4	ud	4.3	The Cowherd
ud4.4:1.1	So I have heard.	ud4.4	1	1	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	ud4.4	1	2	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:1.3	At that time Venerables Sāriputta and Moggallāna were staying near the pigeons’ alcove.	ud4.4	1	3	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow

ud4.4:3.7	“I feel inspired, friend, to give this ascetic a blow on the head!”	ud4.4	3	7	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:3.8	For a third time, the other spirit replied,	ud4.4	3	8	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:3.9	“Enough, friend, don’t hit the ascetic!	ud4.4	3	9	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:3.10	That is an eminent ascetic, powerful and mighty!”	ud4.4	3	10	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:4.1	Ignoring his friend, the first spirit struck Sāriputta.	ud4.4	4	1	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:4.2	The blow was so strong it would have felled a bull elephant seven or seven and a half cubits tall, or split apart a great mountain peak.	ud4.4	4	2	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:4.3	But then the spirit, crying out, “I burn, I burn!” fell into the Great Hell right there.	ud4.4	4	3	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:5.1	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, Venerable Moggallāna saw that spirit striking Venerable Sāriputta.	ud4.4	5	1	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:5.2	He approached him and said,	ud4.4	5	2	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:5.3	“I hope you’re keeping well, reverend; I hope you’re alright. I hope that you are not in pain.”	ud4.4	5	3	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:5.4	“I am alright, Reverend Moggallāna;	ud4.4	5	4	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:5.5	but my head does hurt a little.”	ud4.4	5	5	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:6.1	“It’s incredible, Reverend Sāriputta, it’s amazing!	ud4.4	6	1	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:6.2	How mighty and powerful is Venerable Sāriputta!	ud4.4	6	2	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:6.3	Just now, a native spirit struck you on the head.	ud4.4	6	3	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:6.4	The blow was so strong it would have felled a bull elephant seven or seven and a half cubits tall, or split apart a great mountain peak.	ud4.4	6	4	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:6.5	Yet you say, ‘I am alright, Reverend Moggallāna;	ud4.4	6	5	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:6.6	but my head does hurt a little.’”	ud4.4	6	6	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:7.1	“It’s incredible, Reverend Moggallāna, it’s amazing!	ud4.4	7	1	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:7.2	How mighty and powerful is Venerable Moggallāna, in that he can even see a native spirit!	ud4.4	7	2	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:7.3	Whereas I can’t even see a mud-goblin right now.”	ud4.4	7	3	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:8.1	With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard that discussion between those two spiritual giants.	ud4.4	8	1	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:9.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud4.4	9	1	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:10.1	“One whose mind is like a rock,	ud4.4	10	1	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:10.2	steady, never trembling,	ud4.4	10	2	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:10.3	free of desire for desirable things,	ud4.4	10	3	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:10.4	not getting annoyed when things are annoying:	ud4.4	10	4	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:10.5	from where will suffering strike one	ud4.4	10	5	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.4:10.6	whose mind is developed like this?”	ud4.4	10	6	ud	4.4	The Spirit’s Blow
ud4.5:1.1	So I have heard.	ud4.5	1	1	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery.	ud4.5	1	2	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:1.3	Now at that time Buddha lived crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their ministers, and monastics of other religions and their disciples.	ud4.5	1	3	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:1.4	Crowded, he lived in suffering and discomfort.	ud4.5	1	4	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:1.5	Then he thought,	ud4.5	1	5	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:1.6	“These days I live crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their ministers, and monastics of other religions and their disciples.	ud4.5	1	6	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:1.7	Crowded, I live in suffering and discomfort.	ud4.5	1	7	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:1.8	Why don’t I live alone, withdrawn from the group?”	ud4.5	1	8	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kosambī for alms.	ud4.5	2	1	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:2.2	After the meal, on his return from almsround, he set his lodgings in order himself. Taking his bowl and robe, without informing his attendants or taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha, he set out to go wandering alone towards Pārileyya, with no companion.	ud4.5	2	2	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:2.3	When he eventually arrived,	ud4.5	2	3	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:2.4	he stayed in a protected forest grove, at the foot of a sacred sal tree.	ud4.5	2	4	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:3.1	A certain bull elephant was also living crowded by other males, females, younglings, and cubs. He ate the grass they’d trampled, and they ate the broken branches he dragged down. He drank muddy water, and after his bath the female elephants bumped into him.	ud4.5	3	1	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:3.2	Crowded, he lived in suffering and discomfort.	ud4.5	3	2	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:3.3	Then he thought,	ud4.5	3	3	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:3.4	“These days I live crowded by other males, females, younglings, and cubs. I eat the grass they’ve trampled, and they eat the broken branches I’ve dragged down. I drink muddy water, and after my bath the female elephants bump into me. Crowded, I live in suffering and discomfort.	ud4.5	3	4	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:3.5	Why don’t I live alone, withdrawn from the herd?”	ud4.5	3	5	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:4.1	So he left the herd and went to Pārileyya, where he approached the Buddha in the protected forest grove at the foot of a sacred sal tree.	ud4.5	4	1	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:4.2	There he attended on the Buddha, clearing the vegetation from the place where the Buddha stayed, and using his trunk to set out water for drinking and washing.	ud4.5	4	2	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:5.1	Then as the Buddha was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	ud4.5	5	1	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:5.2	“Formerly I lived crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their ministers, and monastics of other religions and their disciples. Crowded, I live in suffering and discomfort.	ud4.5	5	2	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:5.3	But now I live uncrowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their ministers, and monastics of other religions and their disciples. Being uncrowded, I live in happiness and comfort.”	ud4.5	5	3	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:6.1	And to the bull elephant also this thought came to mind,	ud4.5	6	1	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:6.2	“Formerly I lived crowded by other males, females, younglings, and cubs. I ate the grass they’d trampled, and they ate the broken branches I’d dragged down. I drank muddy water, and after my bath the female elephants bumped into me. Crowded, I lived in suffering and discomfort.	ud4.5	6	2	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:6.3	But now I live uncrowded by other males, females, younglings, and cubs. I eat untrampled grass, and other elephants don’t eat the broken branches I have dragged down. I don’t drink muddy water, and the female elephants don’t bump into me after my bath. Being uncrowded, I live in happiness and comfort.”	ud4.5	6	3	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:7.1	Then, understanding his own seclusion and knowing what that elephant was thinking, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud4.5	7	1	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:8.1	“The giant elephant,	ud4.5	8	1	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:8.2	with tusks like chariot-poles,	ud4.5	8	2	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:8.3	agrees heart to heart with the spiritual giant,	ud4.5	8	3	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.5:8.4	since each finds joy in the woods alone.”	ud4.5	8	4	ud	4.5	A Bull Elephant
ud4.6:1.1	So I have heard.	ud4.6	1	1	ud	4.6	The Alms-gatherer
ud4.6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud4.6	1	2	ud	4.6	The Alms-gatherer
ud4.6:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Bhāradvāja the Alms-gatherer was sitting not far from the Buddha, cross-legged, with his body straight. He was one who lived in the wilderness, ate only almsfood, wore rag robes, and owned just three robes. He was of few wishes, content, secluded, aloof, and energetic, an advocate of austerities, dedicated to the higher mind.	ud4.6	1	3	ud	4.6	The Alms-gatherer
ud4.6:2.1	The Buddha saw him meditating there.	ud4.6	2	1	ud	4.6	The Alms-gatherer
ud4.6:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud4.6	3	1	ud	4.6	The Alms-gatherer
ud4.6:4.1	“Not speaking ill nor doing harm;	ud4.6	4	1	ud	4.6	The Alms-gatherer
ud4.6:4.2	restraint in the monastic code;	ud4.6	4	2	ud	4.6	The Alms-gatherer
ud4.6:4.3	moderation in eating;	ud4.6	4	3	ud	4.6	The Alms-gatherer

ud4.6:4.5	commitment to the higher mind—	ud4.6	4	5	ud	4.6	The Alms-gatherer
ud4.6:4.6	this is the instruction of the Buddhas.”	ud4.6	4	6	ud	4.6	The Alms-gatherer
ud4.7:1.1	So I have heard.	ud4.7	1	1	ud	4.7	With Sāriputta
ud4.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud4.7	1	2	ud	4.7	With Sāriputta
ud4.7:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far from the Buddha, cross-legged, with his body straight. He was of few wishes, content, secluded, aloof, energetic, dedicated to the higher mind.	ud4.7	1	3	ud	4.7	With Sāriputta
ud4.7:2.1	The Buddha saw him meditating there.	ud4.7	2	1	ud	4.7	With Sāriputta
ud4.7:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud4.7	3	1	ud	4.7	With Sāriputta
ud4.7:4.1	“A sage of higher consciousness, diligent,	ud4.7	4	1	ud	4.7	With Sāriputta
ud4.7:4.2	training in the ways of sagacity:	ud4.7	4	2	ud	4.7	With Sāriputta
ud4.7:4.3	there are no sorrows for one thus poised,	ud4.7	4	3	ud	4.7	With Sāriputta
ud4.7:4.4	calm and ever mindful.”	ud4.7	4	4	ud	4.7	With Sāriputta
ud4.8:1.1	So I have heard.	ud4.8	1	1	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud4.8	1	2	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:1.3	Now at that time the Buddha was honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And he received robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	ud4.8	1	3	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:1.4	And the mendicant Saṅgha was also honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And they received robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	ud4.8	1	4	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:1.5	But the wanderers who followed other religions were not honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And they didn’t receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	ud4.8	1	5	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:2.1	Then those wanderers who followed other religions, unable to bear the esteem of the mendicant Sangha, approached the female wanderer Sundarī and said,	ud4.8	2	1	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:2.2	“Sister, are you able to do something for the welfare of your kin?”	ud4.8	2	2	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:2.3	“What can I do, venerables?	ud4.8	2	3	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:2.4	How can I help?	ud4.8	2	4	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:2.5	I’d even give my life for the welfare of my kin.”	ud4.8	2	5	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:3.1	“Well then, sister, frequently visit Jeta’s Grove.”	ud4.8	3	1	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:3.2	“Yes, venerables,” she replied, and did as they asked.	ud4.8	3	2	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:4.1	When those wanderers knew	ud4.8	4	1	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:4.2	that Sundarī had been clearly seen by many people frequently visiting Jeta’s Grove,	ud4.8	4	2	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:4.3	they killed her and dumped her in the ditch around Jeta’s Grove. Then they went to see King Pasenadi of Kosala and said to him,	ud4.8	4	3	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:4.4	“Great king, we cannot find the female wanderer Sundarī.”	ud4.8	4	4	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:4.5	“But where do you suspect she is?”	ud4.8	4	5	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:4.6	“At Jeta’s Grove, great king.”	ud4.8	4	6	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:4.7	“Well then, search Jeta’s Grove.”	ud4.8	4	7	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:5.1	So the wanderers searched Jeta’s Grove. They pulled her body up from the ditch where they had dumped it, and lifted it on a bier. Having entered Sāvatthī, they went from street to street and from square to square, complaining to people:	ud4.8	5	1	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:6.1	“See the deed of the Sakyan ascetics!	ud4.8	6	1	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:6.2	Shameless are these Sakyan ascetics, immoral and wicked. They are liars and fake celibates.	ud4.8	6	2	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:6.3	Sure, they claim to be of principled and moral conduct, to be celibate, truthful, ethical, and of good character.	ud4.8	6	3	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:6.4	But they have no asceticism, no spirituality.	ud4.8	6	4	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:6.5	Asceticism and spirituality are lost to them!	ud4.8	6	5	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:6.6	Where is their asceticism, where their spirituality?	ud4.8	6	6	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:6.7	They have abandoned asceticism and spirituality!	ud4.8	6	7	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:6.8	How on earth can a man, having done a man’s business, kill a woman!”	ud4.8	6	8	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:7.1	Then at that time when the people of Sāvatthī saw the mendicants they abused and insulted them with rude, harsh words:	ud4.8	7	1	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:8.1	“Shameless are these Sakyan ascetics, immoral, wicked, liars, and fake celibates.	ud4.8	8	1	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:8.2	Sure, they claim to be of principled and moral conduct, to be celibate, truthful, ethical, and of good character.	ud4.8	8	2	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:8.3	But they have no asceticism, no spirituality.	ud4.8	8	3	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:8.4	Asceticism and spirituality are lost to them!	ud4.8	8	4	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:8.5	Where is their asceticism, where their spirituality?	ud4.8	8	5	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:8.6	They have abandoned asceticism and spirituality!	ud4.8	8	6	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:8.7	How on earth can a man, having done a man’s business, kill a woman!”	ud4.8	8	7	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:9.1	Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	ud4.8	9	1	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:9.2	Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was happening.	ud4.8	9	2	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:11.1	“That rumor, mendicants, won’t last long. It will only be seven days, then it will vanish.	ud4.8	11	1	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:11.2	So you may respond to those critics with this verse:	ud4.8	11	2	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:12.1	A liar goes to hell,	ud4.8	12	1	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:12.2	as does one who denies what they did.	ud4.8	12	2	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:12.3	Both are equal in the hereafter,	ud4.8	12	3	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:12.4	those men of base deeds.”	ud4.8	12	4	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:13.1	The mendicants memorized that verse in the Buddha’s presence, then used it to respond to those critics.	ud4.8	13	1	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:15.1	People thought,	ud4.8	15	1	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:15.2	“These Sakyan ascetics didn’t do it, it was not done by them, they swear it.”	ud4.8	15	2	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:15.3	That rumor didn’t last long. It was seven days, then it vanished.	ud4.8	15	3	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:16.1	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	ud4.8	16	1	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:17.1	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	ud4.8	17	1	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:17.2	How well said this was by the Buddha:	ud4.8	17	2	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:17.3	‘That rumor, mendicants, won’t last long. It will only be seven days, then it will vanish.’	ud4.8	17	3	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:17.4	That rumor has vanished, sir.”	ud4.8	17	4	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:18.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud4.8	18	1	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:19.1	“People out of control stab with words,	ud4.8	19	1	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:19.2	like they stab a tusker in battle with darts.	ud4.8	19	2	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:19.3	When they hear a harsh word spoken,	ud4.8	19	3	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.8:19.4	a mendicant should endure with no anger in heart.”	ud4.8	19	4	ud	4.8	With Sundarī
ud4.9:1.1	So I have heard.	ud4.9	1	1	ud	4.9	With Upasena
ud4.9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	ud4.9	1	2	ud	4.9	With Upasena
ud4.9:1.3	Then as Venerable Upasena son of Vaṅgantā was in private retreat this thought came to his mind:	ud4.9	1	3	ud	4.9	With Upasena
ud4.9:1.4	“I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate!	ud4.9	1	4	ud	4.9	With Upasena
ud4.9:1.5	My Teacher is the Blessed One, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.	ud4.9	1	5	ud	4.9	With Upasena
ud4.9:1.6	Well explained is the teaching and training in which I have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness.	ud4.9	1	6	ud	4.9	With Upasena
ud4.9:1.7	My spiritual companions are ethical and of good character.	ud4.9	1	7	ud	4.9	With Upasena
ud4.9:1.8	I have fulfilled the precepts.	ud4.9	1	8	ud	4.9	With Upasena
ud4.9:1.9	My mind is unified and serene.	ud4.9	1	9	ud	4.9	With Upasena
ud4.9:1.10	I am a perfected one who has ended the defilements.	ud4.9	1	10	ud	4.9	With Upasena
ud4.9:1.11	I am of great might and power.	ud4.9	1	11	ud	4.9	With Upasena
ud4.9:1.12	My life has been good, and my death will be good.”	ud4.9	1	12	ud	4.9	With Upasena
ud4.9:2.1	Then, knowing what that Venerable Upasena was thinking, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud4.9	2	1	ud	4.9	With Upasena
ud4.9:3.1	“One who has no guilt in life,	ud4.9	3	1	ud	4.9	With Upasena

ud4.10:4.4	they’re freed from Māra’s bonds.”	ud4.10	4	4	ud	4.10	The Peacefulness of Sāriputta
ud5.1:1.1	So I have heard.	ud5.1	1	1	ud	5.1	Who Is More Dear?
ud5.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud5.1	1	2	ud	5.1	Who Is More Dear?
ud5.1:1.3	Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala was upstairs in the royal longhouse together with Queen Mallikā.	ud5.1	1	3	ud	5.1	Who Is More Dear?
ud5.1:1.4	Then King Pasenadi addressed Queen Mallikā,	ud5.1	1	4	ud	5.1	Who Is More Dear?
ud5.1:1.5	“Mallikā, is there anyone more dear to you than yourself?”	ud5.1	1	5	ud	5.1	Who Is More Dear?
ud5.1:2.1	“No, great king, there isn’t.	ud5.1	2	1	ud	5.1	Who Is More Dear?
ud5.1:2.2	But is there anyone more dear to you than yourself?”	ud5.1	2	2	ud	5.1	Who Is More Dear?
ud5.1:2.3	“For me also, Mallikā, there’s no-one.”	ud5.1	2	3	ud	5.1	Who Is More Dear?
ud5.1:3.1	Then King Pasenadi of Kosala came downstairs from the stilt longhouse, went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	ud5.1	3	1	ud	5.1	Who Is More Dear?
ud5.1:5.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud5.1	5	1	ud	5.1	Who Is More Dear?
ud5.1:6.1	“Having explored every quarter with the mind,	ud5.1	6	1	ud	5.1	Who Is More Dear?
ud5.1:6.3	Likewise for others, each holds themselves dear;	ud5.1	6	3	ud	5.1	Who Is More Dear?
ud5.1:6.4	so one who loves themselves would harm no other.”	ud5.1	6	4	ud	5.1	Who Is More Dear?
ud5.2:1.1	So I have heard.	ud5.2	1	1	ud	5.2	Short-lived
ud5.2:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud5.2	1	2	ud	5.2	Short-lived
ud5.2:1.3	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Ānanda came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	ud5.2	1	3	ud	5.2	Short-lived
ud5.2:1.4	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	ud5.2	1	4	ud	5.2	Short-lived
ud5.2:1.5	How short-lived was the Blessed One’s mother! For seven days after the Blessed One was born, his mother passed away and was reborn in the host of Joyful Gods.”	ud5.2	1	5	ud	5.2	Short-lived
ud5.2:2.1	“That’s so true, Ānanda! For the mothers of beings intent of awakening are short-lived.	ud5.2	2	1	ud	5.2	Short-lived
ud5.2:2.2	Seven days after the beings intent on awakening are born, their mothers pass away and are reborn in the host of Joyful Gods.”	ud5.2	2	2	ud	5.2	Short-lived
ud5.2:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud5.2	3	1	ud	5.2	Short-lived
ud5.2:4.1	“Whether born or to be born,	ud5.2	4	1	ud	5.2	Short-lived
ud5.2:4.2	all depart, leaving the body behind.	ud5.2	4	2	ud	5.2	Short-lived
ud5.2:4.3	The skillful, understanding that all is lost,	ud5.2	4	3	ud	5.2	Short-lived
ud5.2:4.4	would keenly practice the spiritual life.”	ud5.2	4	4	ud	5.2	Short-lived
ud5.3:1.1	So I have heard.	ud5.3	1	1	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	ud5.3	1	2	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:1.3	At that time in Rājagaha there was a leper called Suppabuddha.	ud5.3	1	3	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:1.4	He was poor, destitute, and pitiful.	ud5.3	1	4	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:1.5	Now, at that time the Buddha was teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly.	ud5.3	1	5	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:2.1	Suppabuddha saw the crowd seated off in the distance	ud5.3	2	1	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:2.2	and thought,	ud5.3	2	2	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:2.3	“Surely some fresh and cooked foods will be distributed there.	ud5.3	2	3	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:2.4	Why don’t I approach the crowd?	ud5.3	2	4	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:2.5	Hopefully I’ll get something to eat.”	ud5.3	2	5	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:3.1	So he approached the crowd	ud5.3	3	1	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:3.2	where he saw the Buddha teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly.	ud5.3	3	2	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:3.3	When he saw this he thought,	ud5.3	3	3	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:3.4	“There’s no food being distributed here.	ud5.3	3	4	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:3.5	The ascetic Gotama is teaching Dhamma in an assembly.	ud5.3	3	5	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:3.6	Why don’t I also listen to the teaching?”	ud5.3	3	6	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:3.7	Right there he sat down to one side, thinking,	ud5.3	3	7	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:3.8	“I also will listen to the teaching.”	ud5.3	3	8	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:4.1	Then the Buddha focused on comprehending the minds of everyone in the assembly, thinking,	ud5.3	4	1	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:4.2	“Who here is capable of understanding the teaching?”	ud5.3	4	2	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:4.3	He saw Suppabuddha sitting in the assembly,	ud5.3	4	3	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:4.4	and thought,	ud5.3	4	4	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:4.5	“He is capable of understanding the teaching.”	ud5.3	4	5	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:4.6	He gave a step by step talk especially for Suppabuddha	ud5.3	4	6	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:4.7	on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation.	ud5.3	4	7	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:4.8	When the Buddha knew that Suppabuddha’s mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, elated, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas:	ud5.3	4	8	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:4.9	suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.	ud5.3	4	9	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:4.10	Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye,	ud5.3	4	10	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:4.11	in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma in Suppabuddha:	ud5.3	4	11	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:4.12	“Everything that has a beginning has an end.”	ud5.3	4	12	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:5.1	Then Suppabuddha saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He rose from his seat and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said:	ud5.3	5	1	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:6.1	“Excellent, sir! Excellent!	ud5.3	6	1	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:6.2	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.	ud5.3	6	2	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:6.3	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	ud5.3	6	3	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:6.4	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	ud5.3	6	4	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:7.1	After Suppabuddha had been educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired with a Dhamma talk by the Buddha, he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving.	ud5.3	7	1	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:7.2	But soon after Suppabuddha had left, a cow with a baby calf charged at him and took his life.	ud5.3	7	2	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:8.1	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said,	ud5.3	8	1	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:8.3	“The leper called Suppabuddha, after being educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired with a Dhamma talk by the Buddha, has passed away.	ud5.3	8	3	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:8.4	Where has he been reborn in his next life?”	ud5.3	8	4	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:9.1	“Mendicants, Suppabuddha was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings.	ud5.3	9	1	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:9.2	With the ending of three fetters, Suppabuddha is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.”	ud5.3	9	2	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:10.1	When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha,	ud5.3	10	1	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:10.2	“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why Suppabuddha became a leper,	ud5.3	10	2	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:10.3	poor, destitute, and pitiful?”	ud5.3	10	3	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:11.1	“Once upon a time, mendicants, Suppabuddha used to be a financier’s son right here in Rājagaha.	ud5.3	11	1	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:11.2	On his way to visit a park, he saw Tagarasikhī, an independent Buddha, entering the city for alms.	ud5.3	11	2	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:11.3	When he saw this he thought,	ud5.3	11	3	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:11.4	“Who is this leper wandering about with his leper’s robe?”	ud5.3	11	4	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:11.5	Before leaving, he spat on the ground and turned his left side to Tagarasikhī.	ud5.3	11	5	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:11.6	As a result of that deed he burned in hell for many years, for many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of years.	ud5.3	11	6	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:11.7	And as a residual result of that same deed, he became a leper right here in Rājagaha, poor, destitute and pitiful.	ud5.3	11	7	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:11.8	But owing to faith in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One, he undertook ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.	ud5.3	11	8	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:11.9	After undertaking these things, when his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three.	ud5.3	11	9	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:11.10	There he outshines the other gods in beauty and glory.”	ud5.3	11	10	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:12.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud5.3	12	1	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:13.1	“As a clear-eyed man would avoid rough paths,	ud5.3	13	1	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:13.2	so long as strength is found;	ud5.3	13	2	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:13.3	an astute person in the living world,	ud5.3	13	3	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.3:13.4	would shun bad deeds.”	ud5.3	13	4	ud	5.3	With Suppabuddha the Leper
ud5.4:1.1	So I have heard.	ud5.4	1	1	ud	5.4	The Boys
ud5.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud5.4	1	2	ud	5.4	The Boys
ud5.4:1.3	Now at that time, between Sāvatthī and the Jeta Grove, several boys were tormenting some fish.	ud5.4	1	3	ud	5.4	The Boys
ud5.4:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	ud5.4	2	1	ud	5.4	The Boys
ud5.4:2.2	He saw the boys tormenting the fish.	ud5.4	2	2	ud	5.4	The Boys
ud5.4:2.3	He went to them and said,	ud5.4	2	3	ud	5.4	The Boys
ud5.4:2.4	“Boys, do you fear pain? Do you dislike pain?”	ud5.4	2	4	ud	5.4	The Boys
ud5.4:2.5	“Yes, sir,” they replied. “We dislike pain.”	ud5.4	2	5	ud	5.4	The Boys
ud5.4:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud5.4	3	1	ud	5.4	The Boys
ud5.4:4.1	“If you fear pain,	ud5.4	4	1	ud	5.4	The Boys
ud5.4:4.2	if you dislike pain,	ud5.4	4	2	ud	5.4	The Boys
ud5.4:4.3	don’t do bad deeds	ud5.4	4	3	ud	5.4	The Boys
ud5.4:4.4	either openly or in secret.	ud5.4	4	4	ud	5.4	The Boys
ud5.4:5.1	If you should do a bad deed,	ud5.4	5	1	ud	5.4	The Boys
ud5.4:5.2	now or in the future,	ud5.4	5	2	ud	5.4	The Boys
ud5.4:5.3	you won’t be freed from suffering,	ud5.4	5	3	ud	5.4	The Boys
ud5.4:5.4	though you fly away and flee.”	ud5.4	5	4	ud	5.4	The Boys
ud5.5:1.1	So I have heard.	ud5.5	1	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.	ud5.5	1	2	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:1.3	Now, at that time it was the sabbath, and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.	ud5.5	1	3	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:2.1	And then, as the night was getting late, in the first watch of the night, Venerable Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said,	ud5.5	2	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:2.2	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the first watch of the night, and the Saṅgha of monks has been sitting long.	ud5.5	2	2	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:2.3	Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the monks.”	ud5.5	2	3	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:2.4	But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent.	ud5.5	2	4	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:3.1	For a second time, as the night was getting late, in the middle watch of the night, Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said,	ud5.5	3	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:3.2	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the first watch of the night, and the Saṅgha of monks has been sitting long.	ud5.5	3	2	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:3.3	Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the monks.”	ud5.5	3	3	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:3.4	But for a second time the Buddha kept silent.	ud5.5	3	4	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:4.1	For a third time, as the night was getting late, in the last watch of the night, as dawn stirred, bringing joy to the night, Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said,	ud5.5	4	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:4.2	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the last watch of the night and dawn stirs, bringing joy to the night.	ud5.5	4	2	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:4.3	Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the monks.”	ud5.5	4	3	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:4.4	“Ānanda, the assembly is not pure.”	ud5.5	4	4	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:5.1	Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought,	ud5.5	5	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:5.2	“Who is the Buddha talking about?”	ud5.5	5	2	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:5.4	Then he focused on comprehending the minds of everyone in the Saṅgha.	ud5.5	5	4	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:5.5	He saw that unethical person, of bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual practitioner—though claiming to be one—rotten inside, corrupt, and depraved, sitting in the middle of the Saṅgha.	ud5.5	5	5	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:5.6	When he saw him he got up from his seat, went up to him and said,	ud5.5	5	6	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:5.7	“Get up, reverend. The Buddha has seen you.	ud5.5	5	7	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:5.8	You can’t live in communion with the monks.”	ud5.5	5	8	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:5.9	But when he said this, that person kept silent.	ud5.5	5	9	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:6.1	For a second time and a third time,	ud5.5	6	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:6.2	he asked that monk to leave.	ud5.5	6	2	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:6.5	But for a third time that person kept silent.	ud5.5	6	5	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:7.1	Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna took that person by the arm, ejected him out the gate, and bolted the door. Then he went up to the Buddha, and said to him,	ud5.5	7	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:7.2	“I have ejected that person.	ud5.5	7	2	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:7.3	The assembly is pure.	ud5.5	7	3	ud	5.5	Sabbath

ud5.5:7.6	how that silly man waited to be taken by the arm!”	ud5.5	7	6	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:8.1	Then the Buddha said to the monks,	ud5.5	8	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:8.2	“From this day forth, monks, I will not perform the sabbath or recite the monastic code.	ud5.5	8	2	ud	5.5	Sabbath

ud5.5:8.4	It’s impossible, monks, it can’t happen that a Realized One could recite the monastic code in an impure assembly.	ud5.5	8	4	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:9.1	Seeing these eight incredible and amazing things the demons love the ocean.	ud5.5	9	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:9.2	What eight?	ud5.5	9	2	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:10.1	The ocean gradually slants, slopes, and inclines, with no abrupt precipice.	ud5.5	10	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:10.3	This is the first thing the demons love about the ocean.	ud5.5	10	3	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:11.1	Furthermore, the ocean is consistent and doesn’t overflow its boundaries.	ud5.5	11	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:11.3	This is the second thing the demons love about the ocean.	ud5.5	11	3	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:12.1	Furthermore, the ocean doesn’t accommodate a carcass, but quickly carries it to the shore and strands it on the beach.	ud5.5	12	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:12.3	This is the third thing the demons love about the ocean.	ud5.5	12	3	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:13.1	Furthermore, when they reach the ocean, all the great rivers—that is, the Ganges, Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and Mahī—lose their names and clans and are simply considered ‘the ocean’.	ud5.5	13	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:13.3	This is the fourth thing the demons love about the ocean.	ud5.5	13	3	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:14.1	Furthermore, for all the world’s streams that reach it, and the rain that falls from the sky, the ocean never empties or fills up.	ud5.5	14	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:14.3	This is the fifth thing the demons love about the ocean.	ud5.5	14	3	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:15.1	Furthermore, the ocean has just one taste, the taste of salt.	ud5.5	15	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:15.3	This is the sixth thing the demons love about the ocean.	ud5.5	15	3	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:16.1	Furthermore, the ocean is full of many kinds of treasures, such as pearls, gems, beryl, conch, quartz, coral, silver, gold, rubies, and emeralds.	ud5.5	16	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:16.3	This is the seventh thing the demons love about the ocean.	ud5.5	16	3	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:17.1	Furthermore, many great beings live in the ocean, such as leviathans, leviathan-gulpers, leviathan-gulper-gulpers, demons, dragons, and centaurs. In the ocean there are life-forms a hundred leagues long, or even two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, or five hundred leagues long.	ud5.5	17	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:17.3	This is the eighth thing the demons love about the ocean.	ud5.5	17	3	ud	5.5	Sabbath

ud5.5:18.2	What eight?	ud5.5	18	2	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:19.1	The ocean gradually slants, slopes, and inclines, with no abrupt precipice.	ud5.5	19	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:19.2	In the same way in this teaching and training the penetration to enlightenment comes from gradual training, progress, and practice, not abruptly.	ud5.5	19	2	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:19.4	This is the first thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.	ud5.5	19	4	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:20.1	The ocean is consistent and doesn’t overflow its boundaries.	ud5.5	20	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:20.2	In the same way, when a training rule is laid down for my disciples they wouldn’t break it even for the sake of their own life.	ud5.5	20	2	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:20.4	This is the second thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.	ud5.5	20	4	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:21.1	The ocean doesn’t accommodate a carcass, but quickly carries it to the shore and strands it on the beach.	ud5.5	21	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:21.2	In the same way, the Saṅgha doesn’t accommodate a person who is unethical, of bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual practitioner—though claiming to be one—rotten inside, corrupt, and depraved. But they quickly gather and expel them. Even if such a person is sitting in the middle of the Saṅgha, they’re far from the Saṅgha, and the Saṅgha is far from them.	ud5.5	21	2	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:21.4	This is the third thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.	ud5.5	21	4	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:22.1	Furthermore, when they reach the ocean, all the great rivers—that is, the Ganges, Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and Mahī—lose their names and clans and are simply considered ‘the ocean’.	ud5.5	22	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:22.2	In the same way, when they go forth from the lay life to homelessness, all four castes—aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials—lose their former names and clans and are simply considered ‘Sakyan ascetics’.	ud5.5	22	2	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:22.4	This is the fourth thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.	ud5.5	22	4	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:23.1	For all the world’s streams that reach it, and the rain that falls from the sky, the ocean never empties or fills up.	ud5.5	23	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:23.2	In the same way, though several mendicants become fully extinguished in the element of extinguishment with nothing left over, the element of extinguishment never empties or fills up.	ud5.5	23	2	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:23.4	This is the fifth thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.	ud5.5	23	4	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:24.1	The ocean has just one taste, the taste of salt.	ud5.5	24	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:24.2	In the same way, this teaching and training has one taste, the taste of freedom.	ud5.5	24	2	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:24.4	This is the sixth thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.	ud5.5	24	4	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:25.1	The ocean is full of many kinds of treasures, such as pearls, gems, beryl, conch, quartz, coral, silver, gold, rubies, and emeralds.	ud5.5	25	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:25.2	In the same way, this teaching and training is full of many kinds of treasures, such as the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path.	ud5.5	25	2	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:25.4	This is the seventh thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.	ud5.5	25	4	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:26.1	Many great beings live in the ocean, such as leviathans, leviathan-gulpers, leviathan-gulper-gulpers, demons, dragons, and centaurs. In the ocean there are life-forms a hundred leagues long, or even two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, or five hundred leagues long.	ud5.5	26	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:26.2	In the same way, great beings live in this teaching and training, and these are those beings. The stream-enterer and the one practicing to realize the fruit of stream-entry. The once-returner and the one practicing to realize the fruit of once-return. The non-returner and the one practicing to realize the fruit of non-return. The perfected one, and the one practicing for perfection.	ud5.5	26	2	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:26.4	This is the eighth thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.	ud5.5	26	4	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:26.5	Seeing these eight incredible and amazing things, the mendicants love this teaching and training.”	ud5.5	26	5	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:27.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud5.5	27	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:28.1	“The rain saturates things that are covered up;	ud5.5	28	1	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:28.2	it doesn’t saturate things that are open.	ud5.5	28	2	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:28.3	Therefore you should open up a covered thing,	ud5.5	28	3	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.5:28.4	so the rain will not saturate it.”	ud5.5	28	4	ud	5.5	Sabbath
ud5.6:1.1	So I have heard.	ud5.6	1	1	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud5.6	1	2	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying in the land of the Avantis near Kuraraghara on Steep Mountain.	ud5.6	1	3	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:1.4	And the layman Soṇa of the Sharp Ears was Mahākaccāna’s attendant.	ud5.6	1	4	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:2.1	Then as Soṇa was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	ud5.6	2	1	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:2.2	“As I understand Venerable Mahākaccāna’s teachings, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	ud5.6	2	2	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:2.3	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from lay life to homelessness?”	ud5.6	2	3	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:3.1	Then Soṇa went up to Mahākaccāna, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what he was thinking. Then he said,	ud5.6	3	1	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:4.4	“May Venerable Mahākaccāna please give me the going forth!”	ud5.6	4	4	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:5.1	When this was said, Mahākaccāna said to him,	ud5.6	5	1	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:5.2	“It’s hard to lead the spiritual life as long as you live, eating in one part of the day and sleeping alone.	ud5.6	5	2	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:5.3	Come now, Soṇa, while remaining a layperson just as you are, devote yourself to the instructions of the Buddhas, leading the spiritual life at suitable times, eating in one part of the day and sleeping alone.”	ud5.6	5	3	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:5.4	Then Soṇa’s aspiration to go forth died down.	ud5.6	5	4	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:6.1	For a second time, while in private retreat the thought came to Soṇa that he should go forth, but the outcome was the same.	ud5.6	6	1	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:7.1	For a third time, as Soṇa was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	ud5.6	7	1	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:7.2	“As I understand Venerable Mahākaccāna’s teachings, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	ud5.6	7	2	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:7.3	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from lay life to homelessness?”	ud5.6	7	3	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:7.4	For a third time, Soṇa went up to Mahākaccāna, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what he was thinking. Then he said,	ud5.6	7	4	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:8.4	“May Venerable Mahākaccāna please give me the going forth!”	ud5.6	8	4	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:9.1	Then Mahākaccāna gave Soṇa the going forth.	ud5.6	9	1	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:9.2	Now at that time the southern region, including Avanti, was short of monks.	ud5.6	9	2	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:9.3	It took three years and much struggle and difficulty before Venerable Mahākaccāyana was able to assemble from here and there a Sangha consisting of ten monks and give Venerable Soṇa the full ordination.	ud5.6	9	3	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:10.1	Then as Venerable Soṇa was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	ud5.6	10	1	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:10.2	“I have not personally seen the Buddha. I have only heard reports that	ud5.6	10	2	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:10.3	that Blessed One is like this or like that.	ud5.6	10	3	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:10.4	If my mentor allows, I should go to see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.”	ud5.6	10	4	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:11.1	Then in the late afternoon, Soṇa came out of retreat, went up to Mahākaccāna, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what he was thinking. Then Mahākaccāna said,	ud5.6	11	1	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:13.1	“Good, good, Soṇa!	ud5.6	13	1	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:13.2	Go to see the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	ud5.6	13	2	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:13.3	You will see that Blessed One who is impressive and inspiring, with peaceful faculties and mind, attained to the highest self-control and serenity, like an elephant with tamed, guarded, and controlled faculties.	ud5.6	13	3	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:13.4	On seeing him, in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably, saying,	ud5.6	13	4	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:13.5	‘Sir, my mentor Venerable Mahākaccāna bows with his head to your feet. He asks if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.’”	ud5.6	13	5	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:14.1	Saying, “Yes, sir,” Soṇa welcomed and agreed with Mahākaccāna’s words. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Mahākaccāna, keeping him on his right. Then he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Sāvatthī.	ud5.6	14	1	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:14.2	Eventually he came to Sāvatthī and Jeta’s Grove. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.	ud5.6	14	2	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:14.3	Soṇa said to the Buddha,	ud5.6	14	3	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:14.4	“Sir, my mentor Venerable Mahākaccāna bows with his head to your feet. He asks if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”	ud5.6	14	4	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:15.1	“I hope you’re keeping well, mendicant; I hope you’re all right. And I hope you have arrived from your journey unwearied, having had no trouble getting almsfood.”	ud5.6	15	1	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:15.2	“I’m keeping well, sir; I’m all right. And I have arrived from my journey unwearied, having had no trouble getting almsfood.”	ud5.6	15	2	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:16.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	ud5.6	16	1	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:16.2	“Prepare lodgings for this visiting mendicant.”	ud5.6	16	2	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:16.3	Then Venerable Ānanda thought,	ud5.6	16	3	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:16.4	“When the Buddha orders me	ud5.6	16	4	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:16.5	to prepare lodgings for a specific mendicant, he wishes to stay in the same dwelling with that mendicant. The Buddha wishes to stay together with Venerable Soṇa.”	ud5.6	16	5	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:16.6	He prepared lodgings for Soṇa in the same dwelling where the Buddha was staying.	ud5.6	16	6	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:17.1	The Buddha spent much of the night sitting meditation in the open. Then he got up from his seat, washed his feet and entered the dwelling.	ud5.6	17	1	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:17.2	Venerable Soṇa did the same.	ud5.6	17	2	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:17.3	Then the Buddha rose at the crack of dawn and addressed Soṇa,	ud5.6	17	3	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:17.4	“Speak some Dhamma, mendicant, as you feel inspired.”	ud5.6	17	4	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:18.1	“Yes, sir,” replied Soṇa. He intoned all sixteen discourses in the Chapter of the Eights.	ud5.6	18	1	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:18.2	When Soṇa finished his intoning, the Buddha applauded, saying,	ud5.6	18	2	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:18.3	“Good, good, mendicant! You have learned the sixteen discourses of the Chapter of the Eights well, you have applied the mind and remembered it well. You are a good speaker, with a polished, clear, and articulate voice that expresses the meaning.	ud5.6	18	3	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:18.4	How many rains have you been ordained, mendicant?”	ud5.6	18	4	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:18.5	“I have one rains, Blessed One.”	ud5.6	18	5	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:18.6	“But why did it take you so long to make it?”	ud5.6	18	6	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:18.7	“Sir, I have long seen the drawbacks of sensual pleasures,	ud5.6	18	7	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:18.8	yet living in a house is cramped, with many duties and much to do.”	ud5.6	18	8	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:19.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud5.6	19	1	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:20.1	“Seeing the danger of the world,	ud5.6	20	1	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:20.2	I understood the reality without attachments.	ud5.6	20	2	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:20.3	The Noble One does not delight in evil,	ud5.6	20	3	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.6:20.4	the Pure One does not delight in evil.”	ud5.6	20	4	ud	5.6	With Soṇa
ud5.7:1.1	So I have heard.	ud5.7	1	1	ud	5.7	With Revata the Doubter
ud5.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud5.7	1	2	ud	5.7	With Revata the Doubter
ud5.7:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Revata the Doubter was sitting not far from the Buddha, cross-legged, with his body straight, reviewing his own purification through overcoming doubt.	ud5.7	1	3	ud	5.7	With Revata the Doubter
ud5.7:2.1	The Buddha saw him meditating there.	ud5.7	2	1	ud	5.7	With Revata the Doubter
ud5.7:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud5.7	3	1	ud	5.7	With Revata the Doubter
ud5.7:4.1	“Any doubts about this world or the world beyond,	ud5.7	4	1	ud	5.7	With Revata the Doubter
ud5.7:4.2	about one’s own experiences or those of another:	ud5.7	4	2	ud	5.7	With Revata the Doubter
ud5.7:4.3	those who meditate give them all up,	ud5.7	4	3	ud	5.7	With Revata the Doubter
ud5.7:4.4	keenly practicing the spiritual life.”	ud5.7	4	4	ud	5.7	With Revata the Doubter
ud5.8:1.1	So I have heard.	ud5.8	1	1	ud	5.8	Schism in the Saṅgha
ud5.8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	ud5.8	1	2	ud	5.8	Schism in the Saṅgha
ud5.8:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.	ud5.8	1	3	ud	5.8	Schism in the Saṅgha
ud5.8:2.1	Devadatta saw him wandering for alms,	ud5.8	2	1	ud	5.8	Schism in the Saṅgha
ud5.8:2.2	so he went up to him and said,	ud5.8	2	2	ud	5.8	Schism in the Saṅgha
ud5.8:2.3	“From this day forth, Reverend Ānanda, I shall perform the sabbath and legal proceedings of the Saṅgha apart from the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants.”	ud5.8	2	3	ud	5.8	Schism in the Saṅgha
ud5.8:3.1	Then Ānanda wandered for alms in Rājagaha. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,	ud5.8	3	1	ud	5.8	Schism in the Saṅgha
ud5.8:3.2	and told him what had just happened, adding:	ud5.8	3	2	ud	5.8	Schism in the Saṅgha
ud5.8:4.5	“Today, sir, Devadatta will split the Saṅgha. He will perform the sabbath and legal proceedings of the Saṅgha.”	ud5.8	4	5	ud	5.8	Schism in the Saṅgha
ud5.8:5.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud5.8	5	1	ud	5.8	Schism in the Saṅgha
ud5.8:6.1	“It’s easy for the good to do good,	ud5.8	6	1	ud	5.8	Schism in the Saṅgha
ud5.8:6.2	and hard for the good to do bad.	ud5.8	6	2	ud	5.8	Schism in the Saṅgha
ud5.8:6.3	It’s easy for the bad to do bad,	ud5.8	6	3	ud	5.8	Schism in the Saṅgha
ud5.8:6.4	but for the noble ones, bad is hard to do.”	ud5.8	6	4	ud	5.8	Schism in the Saṅgha
ud5.9:1.1	So I have heard.	ud5.9	1	1	ud	5.9	Teasing
ud5.9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	ud5.9	1	2	ud	5.9	Teasing
ud5.9:1.3	Now at that time several students were passing by not far from the Buddha in a teasing manner.	ud5.9	1	3	ud	5.9	Teasing
ud5.9:1.4	The Buddha saw them.	ud5.9	1	4	ud	5.9	Teasing
ud5.9:2.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud5.9	2	1	ud	5.9	Teasing
ud5.9:3.1	“Dolts pretending to be astute,	ud5.9	3	1	ud	5.9	Teasing
ud5.9:3.2	they talk, their words right out of bounds.	ud5.9	3	2	ud	5.9	Teasing
ud5.9:3.3	They blab at will, their mouths agape,	ud5.9	3	3	ud	5.9	Teasing
ud5.9:3.4	and no-one knows what leads them on.”	ud5.9	3	4	ud	5.9	Teasing
ud5.10:1.1	So I have heard.	ud5.10	1	1	ud	5.10	With Cūḷapanthaka
ud5.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud5.10	1	2	ud	5.10	With Cūḷapanthaka
ud5.10:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Cūḷapanthaka was sitting not far from the Buddha, cross-legged, his body set straight, and mindfulness established in front of him.	ud5.10	1	3	ud	5.10	With Cūḷapanthaka
ud5.10:2.1	The Buddha saw him meditating there.	ud5.10	2	1	ud	5.10	With Cūḷapanthaka
ud5.10:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud5.10	3	1	ud	5.10	With Cūḷapanthaka
ud5.10:4.1	“Steady in body, steady in mind,	ud5.10	4	1	ud	5.10	With Cūḷapanthaka
ud5.10:4.2	standing, sitting or lying down:	ud5.10	4	2	ud	5.10	With Cūḷapanthaka
ud5.10:4.3	a mendicant focusing on this mindfulness	ud5.10	4	3	ud	5.10	With Cūḷapanthaka
ud5.10:4.4	gains an ever higher distinction.	ud5.10	4	4	ud	5.10	With Cūḷapanthaka
ud5.10:4.5	And when they have done so,	ud5.10	4	5	ud	5.10	With Cūḷapanthaka
ud5.10:4.6	they vanish from the King of Death.”	ud5.10	4	6	ud	5.10	With Cūḷapanthaka
ud6.1:1.1	So I have heard.	ud6.1	1	1	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	ud6.1	1	2	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:1.3	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.	ud6.1	1	3	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:1.4	Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Ānanda:	ud6.1	1	4	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:1.5	“Ānanda, get your sitting cloth.	ud6.1	1	5	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:1.6	Let’s go to the Cāpāla shrine for the day’s meditation.”	ud6.1	1	6	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:2.1	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha.	ud6.1	2	1	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:2.2	Then the Buddha went up to the Cāpāla shrine, where he sat on the seat spread out.	ud6.1	2	2	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:2.3	When he was seated he said to Venerable Ānanda:	ud6.1	2	3	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:3.1	“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Seven Maidens, Many Sons, Sārandada, and Cāpāla Tree-shrines are all lovely.	ud6.1	3	1	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:3.2	Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.	ud6.1	3	2	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:3.3	The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.”	ud6.1	3	3	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:4.1	But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign.	ud6.1	4	1	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:4.2	He didn’t beg the Buddha,	ud6.1	4	2	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:4.3	“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra.	ud6.1	4	3	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:4.4	For a second time …	ud6.1	4	4	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:4.5	and for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda:	ud6.1	4	5	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:5.1	“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Seven Maidens, Many Sons, Sārandada, and Cāpāla Tree-shrines are all lovely.	ud6.1	5	1	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:5.2	Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.	ud6.1	5	2	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:5.3	The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.”	ud6.1	5	3	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:6.1	But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign.	ud6.1	6	1	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:6.2	He didn’t beg the Buddha,	ud6.1	6	2	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:6.3	“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra.	ud6.1	6	3	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:7.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	ud6.1	7	1	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:7.2	“Go now, Ānanda, at your convenience.”	ud6.1	7	2	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:7.3	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He rose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before sitting at the root of a tree close by.	ud6.1	7	3	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:8.1	And then, not long after Ānanda had left, Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha, stood to one side, and said to him:	ud6.1	8	1	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:9.1	“May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.	ud6.1	9	1	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:9.2	Sir, you once made this statement:	ud6.1	9	2	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:9.3	‘Wicked One, I shall not become fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and practice in line with the teachings. Not until they practice properly, living in line with the teaching. Not until they’ve learned their own tradition, and explain, teach, assert, establish, disclose, analyze, and make it clear. Not until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis.’	ud6.1	9	3	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:9.4	Today you do have such monk disciples.	ud6.1	9	4	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:9.5	May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.	ud6.1	9	5	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:10.1	Sir, you once made this statement:	ud6.1	10	1	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:10.2	‘Wicked One, I shall not become fully extinguished until I have nun disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ …	ud6.1	10	2	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:10.3	Today you do have such nun disciples.	ud6.1	10	3	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:11.2	‘Wicked One, I shall not become fully extinguished until I have layman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’	ud6.1	11	2	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:11.3	Today you do have such layman disciples.	ud6.1	11	3	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:12.2	‘Wicked One, I shall not become fully extinguished until I have laywoman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’	ud6.1	12	2	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:12.3	Today you do have such laywoman disciples.	ud6.1	12	3	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:12.4	May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.	ud6.1	12	4	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:13.1	Sir, you once made this statement:	ud6.1	13	1	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:13.2	‘I shall not become fully extinguished until my spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.’	ud6.1	13	2	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:13.3	Today your spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.	ud6.1	13	3	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:13.4	May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.	ud6.1	13	4	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:14.1	When this was said, the Buddha said to Māra,	ud6.1	14	1	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:14.2	“Relax, Wicked One. The final extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon.	ud6.1	14	2	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:14.3	Three months from now the Realized One will finally be extinguished.”	ud6.1	14	3	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:15.1	So at the Cāpāla Tree-shrine the Buddha, mindful and aware, surrendered the life force.	ud6.1	15	1	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:15.2	When he did so there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky.	ud6.1	15	2	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:16.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud6.1	16	1	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:17.1	“Comparing the incomparable <j>with the creation of prolonged life,	ud6.1	17	1	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:17.2	the sage surrendered the life force.	ud6.1	17	2	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:17.3	Happy inside, serene,	ud6.1	17	3	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.1:17.4	he shattered self-creation like a suit of armor.”	ud6.1	17	4	ud	6.1	Surrendering the Life Force
ud6.2:1.1	So I have heard.	ud6.2	1	1	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.	ud6.2	1	2	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:1.3	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and sat outside the gate.	ud6.2	1	3	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:1.4	Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.	ud6.2	1	4	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:2.1	Now at that time seven matted-hair ascetics, seven Jain ascetics, seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloth ascetics, and seven wanderers passed by not far from the Buddha. Their armpits and bodies were hairy, and their nails were long; and they carried their stuff with shoulder-poles.	ud6.2	2	1	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:3.1	King Pasenadi saw them passing by.	ud6.2	3	1	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:3.2	He got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward those various ascetics, and pronounced his name three times:	ud6.2	3	2	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:3.3	“Sirs, I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!	ud6.2	3	3	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:3.4	I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!	ud6.2	3	4	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:3.5	I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!”	ud6.2	3	5	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:4.1	Then, soon after those ascetics had left, King Pasenadi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	ud6.2	4	1	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:4.2	“Sir, are they among those in the world who are perfected ones or who are on the path to perfection?”	ud6.2	4	2	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:5.1	“Great king, as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures, living at home with your children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, perfumes, and makeup, and accepting gold and money, it’s hard for you to know who is perfected or on the path to perfection.	ud6.2	5	1	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:6.1	You can get to know a person’s ethics by living with them. But only after a long time, not casually; only when attentive, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless.	ud6.2	6	1	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:6.2	You can get to know a person’s purity by dealing with them. …	ud6.2	6	2	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:6.3	You can get to know a person’s resilience in times of trouble. …	ud6.2	6	3	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:6.4	You can get to know a person’s wisdom by discussion. But only after a long time, not casually; only when attentive, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless.”	ud6.2	6	4	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:7.1	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing,	ud6.2	7	1	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:7.2	how well said this was by the Buddha. …	ud6.2	7	2	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:8.1	Sir, these are my spies, my undercover agents returning after spying on the country.	ud6.2	8	1	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:8.2	First they go undercover, then I have them report to me.	ud6.2	8	2	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:8.3	And now—when they have washed off the dust and dirt, and are nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed, and dressed in white—they will amuse themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.”	ud6.2	8	3	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:9.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud6.2	9	1	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:10.1	“Don’t strive in every situation,	ud6.2	10	1	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:10.2	don’t become another’s man.	ud6.2	10	2	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:10.3	Don’t live depending on another,	ud6.2	10	3	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.2:10.4	and don’t use the teaching to make money.”	ud6.2	10	4	ud	6.2	Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
ud6.3:1.1	So I have heard.	ud6.3	1	1	ud	6.3	The Buddha’s Reviewing
ud6.3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud6.3	1	2	ud	6.3	The Buddha’s Reviewing
ud6.3:1.3	Now at that time the Buddha was sitting reviewing his own giving up of many bad, unskillful qualities, and the many skillful qualities he had fully developed.	ud6.3	1	3	ud	6.3	The Buddha’s Reviewing
ud6.3:2.1	Then, knowing the many bad, unskillful qualities that he had given up and the many skillful qualities he had fully developed, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud6.3	2	1	ud	6.3	The Buddha’s Reviewing
ud6.3:3.1	“What was before then was not;	ud6.3	3	1	ud	6.3	The Buddha’s Reviewing
ud6.3:3.2	what before was not then was.	ud6.3	3	2	ud	6.3	The Buddha’s Reviewing
ud6.3:3.3	It never was, nor will it be,	ud6.3	3	3	ud	6.3	The Buddha’s Reviewing
ud6.3:3.4	nor is it found today.”	ud6.3	3	4	ud	6.3	The Buddha’s Reviewing
ud6.4:1.1	So I have heard.	ud6.4	1	1	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	ud6.4	1	2	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:1.3	Now at that time several ascetics, brahmins, and wanderers who followed various other religions were residing in Sāvatthī, holding different views and opinions, relying on different views.	ud6.4	1	3	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:2.1	There were some ascetics and brahmins who had this doctrine and view:	ud6.4	2	1	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:2.2	“The cosmos is eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.”	ud6.4	2	2	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:3.1	Others held views such as the following, each regarding their own view as true and others as silly.	ud6.4	3	1	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:3.2	“The cosmos is not eternal.”	ud6.4	3	2	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:4.2	“The world is finite.”	ud6.4	4	2	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:5.2	“The world is infinite.”	ud6.4	5	2	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:6.2	“The soul and the body are the same thing.”	ud6.4	6	2	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:7.2	“The soul and the body are different things.”	ud6.4	7	2	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:8.2	“A Realized One still exists after death.”	ud6.4	8	2	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:9.2	“A Realized One no longer exists after death.”	ud6.4	9	2	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:10.2	“A Realized One both still exists and no longer exists after death.”	ud6.4	10	2	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:11.2	“A Realized One neither still exists nor no longer exists after death.”	ud6.4	11	2	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:12.1	They were arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words:	ud6.4	12	1	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:12.2	“Such is Truth, such is not Truth!	ud6.4	12	2	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:12.3	Such is not Truth, such is Truth!”	ud6.4	12	3	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:13.1	Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	ud6.4	13	1	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:13.2	Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was happening. The Buddha said:	ud6.4	13	2	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:16.1	“The wanderers of other religions are blind and sightless.	ud6.4	16	1	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:16.2	They don't understand what is beneficial or what is not beneficial, nor what is the truth and what is not the truth.	ud6.4	16	2	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:16.3	That’s why they are arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words.	ud6.4	16	3	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:17.1	Once upon a time, mendicants, right here in Sāvatthī there was a certain king.	ud6.4	17	1	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:17.2	Then the king addressed a man,	ud6.4	17	2	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:17.3	‘Please, mister, gather all those blind from birth throughout Sāvatthī and bring them together in one place.’	ud6.4	17	3	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)
ud6.4:17.4	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ that man replied. He did as the king asked, then said to him,	ud6.4	17	4	ud	6.4	Followers of Various Other Religions (1st)

ud7.9:1.6	“Don’t let these shavelings, these fake ascetics drink the water.”	ud7.9	1	6	ud	7.9	The Well

ud8.5:5.3	I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could properly digest it except for the Realized One.”	ud8.5	5	3	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:5.4	“Yes, sir,” replied Cunda. He did as he was asked, then came back to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.	ud8.5	5	4	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:5.5	Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.	ud8.5	5	5	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:6.1	After the Buddha had eaten Cunda’s meal, he fell severely ill with bloody dysentery, struck by dreadful pains, close to death.	ud8.5	6	1	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:6.2	But he endured unbothered, with mindfulness and situational awareness.	ud8.5	6	2	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:7.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	ud8.5	7	1	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:7.2	“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Kusinārā.”	ud8.5	7	2	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:7.3	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	ud8.5	7	3	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:8.1	I’ve heard that after eating	ud8.5	8	1	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:8.2	the meal of Cunda the smith,	ud8.5	8	2	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:8.3	the wise one fell severely ill,	ud8.5	8	3	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:8.4	with pains, close to death.	ud8.5	8	4	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:9.1	A severe sickness struck the Teacher	ud8.5	9	1	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:9.2	who had eaten the pork on the turn.	ud8.5	9	2	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:9.3	While still purging the Buddha said:	ud8.5	9	3	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:9.4	“I’ll go to the citadel of Kusinārā.”	ud8.5	9	4	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:10.1	Then the Buddha left the road and went to the root of a certain tree, where he addressed Ānanda,	ud8.5	10	1	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:10.2	“Please, Ānanda, fold my outer robe in four and spread it out for me. I am tired and will sit down.”	ud8.5	10	2	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:10.3	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda, and did as he was asked.	ud8.5	10	3	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:10.4	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,	ud8.5	10	4	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:10.5	and said to Venerable Ānanda,	ud8.5	10	5	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:10.6	“Please, Ānanda, fetch me some water. I am thirsty and will drink.”	ud8.5	10	6	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:11.1	When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,	ud8.5	11	1	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:11.2	“Sir, just now around five hundred carts have passed by. The shallow water has been churned up by their wheels, and it flows cloudy and murky.	ud8.5	11	2	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:11.3	The Kakutthā river is not far away, with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful.	ud8.5	11	3	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:11.4	There the Buddha can drink and cool his limbs.”	ud8.5	11	4	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:12.1	For a second time,	ud8.5	12	1	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:12.2	and a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda,	ud8.5	12	2	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:12.3	“Please, Ānanda, fetch me some water. I am thirsty and will drink.”	ud8.5	12	3	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:12.4	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his bowl he went to the river.	ud8.5	12	4	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:12.5	Now, though the shallow water in that river had been churned up by wheels, and flowed cloudy and murky, when Ānanda approached it flowed transparent, clear, and unclouded.	ud8.5	12	5	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:13.1	Then Venerable Ānanda thought,	ud8.5	13	1	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:13.2	“Oh, how incredible, how amazing! The Realized One has such psychic power and might!	ud8.5	13	2	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:13.3	For though the shallow water in that river had been churned up by wheels, and flowed cloudy and murky, when I approached it flowed transparent, clear, and unclouded.”	ud8.5	13	3	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:13.4	Gathering a bowl of drinking water he went back to the Buddha, and said to him,	ud8.5	13	4	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:13.5	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! The Realized One has such psychic power and might!	ud8.5	13	5	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:13.6	For though the shallow water in that river had been churned up by wheels, and flowed cloudy and murky, when I approached it flowed transparent, clear, and unclouded.	ud8.5	13	6	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:13.7	Drink the water, Blessed One! Drink the water, Holy One!”	ud8.5	13	7	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:14.1	So the Buddha drank the water.	ud8.5	14	1	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:14.2	Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants went to the Kakutthā River. He plunged into the river and bathed and drank.	ud8.5	14	2	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:14.3	And when he had emerged, he went to the mango grove, where he addressed Venerable Cundaka,	ud8.5	14	3	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:14.4	“Please, Cundaka, fold my outer robe in four and spread it out for me. I am tired and will lie down.”	ud8.5	14	4	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:15.1	“Yes, sir,” replied Cundaka, and did as he was asked.	ud8.5	15	1	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:15.2	And then the Buddha laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.	ud8.5	15	2	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:15.3	But Cundaka sat down right there in front of the Buddha.	ud8.5	15	3	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:16.1	Having gone to Kakutthā Creek,	ud8.5	16	1	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:16.2	whose water was transparent, sweet, and clear,	ud8.5	16	2	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:16.3	the Teacher, being tired, plunged in,	ud8.5	16	3	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:16.4	the Realized One, without compare in the world.	ud8.5	16	4	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:17.1	And after bathing and drinking the Teacher emerged.	ud8.5	17	1	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:17.2	Before the group of mendicants, in the middle, <j>the Buddha,	ud8.5	17	2	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:17.3	the Teacher who rolled forth <j>the present dispensation,	ud8.5	17	3	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:17.4	the great seer went to the mango grove.	ud8.5	17	4	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:17.5	He addressed the mendicant named Cundaka:	ud8.5	17	5	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:17.6	“Spread out my folded robe so I can lie down.”	ud8.5	17	6	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:18.1	The evolved one urged Cunda,	ud8.5	18	1	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:18.2	who quickly spread the folded robe.	ud8.5	18	2	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:18.3	The Teacher lay down so tired,	ud8.5	18	3	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:18.4	while Cunda sat there before him.	ud8.5	18	4	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:19.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	ud8.5	19	1	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:19.2	“Now it may happen, Ānanda, that others may give rise to some regret for Cunda the smith:	ud8.5	19	2	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:19.3	‘It’s your loss, friend Cunda, it’s your misfortune, in that the Realized One became fully extinguished after eating his last almsmeal from you.’	ud8.5	19	3	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:19.4	You should get rid of remorse in Cunda the smith like this:	ud8.5	19	4	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:20.1	‘You’re fortunate, friend Cunda, you’re so very fortunate,	ud8.5	20	1	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:20.2	in that the Realized One became fully extinguished after eating his last almsmeal from you.	ud8.5	20	2	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:20.3	I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha.	ud8.5	20	3	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:20.4	There are two almsmeal offerings that have identical fruit and result, and are more fruitful and beneficial than other almsmeal offerings.	ud8.5	20	4	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:20.5	What two?	ud8.5	20	5	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:20.6	The almsmeal after eating which a Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening; and the almsmeal after eating which he becomes fully extinguished in the element of extinguishment with nothing left over.	ud8.5	20	6	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:20.7	These two almsmeal offerings have identical fruit and result, and are more fruitful and beneficial than other almsmeal offerings.	ud8.5	20	7	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:21.1	You’ve accumulated a deed that leads to long life, beauty, happiness, fame, heaven, and sovereignty.’	ud8.5	21	1	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:21.2	You should dispel remorse in Cunda the smith like this.”	ud8.5	21	2	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:22.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud8.5	22	1	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:23.1	“A giver’s merit grows;	ud8.5	23	1	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:23.2	enmity doesn’t build up when you have self-control.	ud8.5	23	2	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:23.3	A skillful person gives up bad things—	ud8.5	23	3	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.5:23.4	with the end of greed, hate, and delusion, <j>they’re extinguished.”	ud8.5	23	4	ud	8.5	With Cunda
ud8.6:1.1	So I have heard.	ud8.6	1	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Magadhans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at the village of Pāṭali.	ud8.6	1	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:1.3	The lay followers of Pāṭali Village heard that he had arrived.	ud8.6	1	3	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:1.5	So they went to see him, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	ud8.6	1	5	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:1.7	“Sir, please consent to come to our guest house.”	ud8.6	1	7	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:1.8	The Buddha consented with silence.	ud8.6	1	8	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:2.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, the lay followers of Pāṭali Village got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the guest house, where they spread carpets all over, prepared seats, set up a water jar, and placed a lamp. Then they went back to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and told him of their preparations, saying:	ud8.6	2	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:2.3	“Please, sir, come at your convenience.”	ud8.6	2	3	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:3.1	In the morning, the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the guest house together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Having washed his feet he entered the guest house and sat against the central column facing east.	ud8.6	3	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:3.2	The Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet, entered the guest house, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them.	ud8.6	3	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:3.3	The lay followers of Pāṭali Village also washed their feet, entered the guest house, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Buddha right in front of them.	ud8.6	3	3	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:3.4	Then the Buddha addressed them:	ud8.6	3	4	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:4.1	“Householders, there are these five drawbacks for an unethical person because of their failure in ethics.	ud8.6	4	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:4.2	What five?	ud8.6	4	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:4.3	Firstly, an unethical person loses substantial wealth on account of negligence.	ud8.6	4	3	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:4.4	This is the first drawback.	ud8.6	4	4	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:5.1	Furthermore, an unethical person gets a bad reputation.	ud8.6	5	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:5.2	This is the second drawback.	ud8.6	5	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:6.1	Furthermore, an unethical person enters any kind of assembly timid and embarrassed, whether it’s an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics.	ud8.6	6	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:6.2	This is the third drawback.	ud8.6	6	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:7.1	Furthermore, an unethical person feels lost when they die.	ud8.6	7	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:7.2	This is the fourth drawback.	ud8.6	7	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:8.1	Furthermore, an unethical person, when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	ud8.6	8	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:8.2	This is the fifth drawback.	ud8.6	8	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:8.3	These are the five drawbacks for an unethical person because of their failure in ethics.	ud8.6	8	3	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:9.1	There are these five benefits for an ethical person because of their accomplishment in ethics.	ud8.6	9	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:9.2	What five?	ud8.6	9	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:9.3	Firstly, an ethical person gains substantial wealth on account of diligence.	ud8.6	9	3	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:9.4	This is the first benefit.	ud8.6	9	4	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:10.1	Furthermore, an ethical person gets a good reputation.	ud8.6	10	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:10.2	This is the second benefit.	ud8.6	10	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:11.1	Furthermore, an ethical person enters any kind of assembly bold and self-assured, whether it’s an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics.	ud8.6	11	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:11.2	This is the third benefit.	ud8.6	11	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:12.1	Furthermore, an ethical person dies not feeling lost.	ud8.6	12	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:12.2	This is the fourth benefit.	ud8.6	12	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:13.1	Furthermore, when an ethical person’s body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	ud8.6	13	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:13.2	This is the fifth benefit.	ud8.6	13	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:13.3	These are the five benefits for an ethical person because of their accomplishment in ethics.”	ud8.6	13	3	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:14.1	The Buddha spent much of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the lay followers of Pāṭali Village with a Dhamma talk. Then he dismissed them,	ud8.6	14	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:14.2	“The night is getting late, householders. Please go at your convenience.”	ud8.6	14	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:14.3	And then the lay followers of Pāṭali Village approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving.	ud8.6	14	3	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:14.4	Soon after they left the Buddha entered a private cubicle.	ud8.6	14	4	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:15.1	Now at that time the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra were building a citadel at Pāṭali Village to keep the Vajjis out.	ud8.6	15	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:15.2	At that time thousands of deities were taking possession of building sites in Pāṭali Village.	ud8.6	15	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:15.3	Illustrious rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by illustrious deities.	ud8.6	15	3	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:15.4	Middling rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by middling deities.	ud8.6	15	4	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:15.5	Lesser rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by lesser deities.	ud8.6	15	5	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:16.1	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha saw those deities taking possession of building sites in Pāṭali Village,	ud8.6	16	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:16.2	and the people building houses in accord with the station of the deities.	ud8.6	16	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:16.5	The Buddha rose at the crack of dawn and addressed Ānanda,	ud8.6	16	5	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:17.1	“Ānanda, who is building a citadel at Pāṭali Village?”	ud8.6	17	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:17.2	“Sir, the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra are building a citadel to keep the Vajjis out.”	ud8.6	17	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:17.3	“It’s as if they were building the citadel in consultation with the gods of the Thirty-Three.	ud8.6	17	3	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:17.5	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw those deities taking possession of building sites.	ud8.6	17	5	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:17.6	Illustrious rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by illustrious deities.	ud8.6	17	6	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:17.7	Middling rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by middling deities.	ud8.6	17	7	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:17.8	Lesser rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by lesser deities.	ud8.6	17	8	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:17.9	As far as the civilized region extends, as far as the trading zone extends, this will be the chief city: the Pāṭaliputta trade center.	ud8.6	17	9	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:17.10	But Pāṭaliputta will face three threats:	ud8.6	17	10	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:17.11	from fire, flood, and dissension.”	ud8.6	17	11	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:18.1	Then the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra approached the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	ud8.6	18	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:18.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they stood to one side and said,	ud8.6	18	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:18.4	“Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept today’s meal from me?”	ud8.6	18	4	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:19.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, they went to their own guest house, where they had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared. Then they had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	ud8.6	19	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:19.2	“It’s time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.”	ud8.6	19	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:20.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to their guest house together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out.	ud8.6	20	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:20.2	Then Sunidha and Vassakāra served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with their own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	ud8.6	20	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:21.1	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Sunidha and Vassakāra took a low seat and sat to one side.	ud8.6	21	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:21.2	The Buddha expressed his appreciation with these verses:	ud8.6	21	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:22.1	“In the place he makes his dwelling,	ud8.6	22	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village

ud8.6:24.1	After that they have compassion for him,	ud8.6	24	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:24.2	like a mother for the child at her breast.	ud8.6	24	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:24.3	A man beloved of the deities	ud8.6	24	3	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:24.4	always sees nice things.”	ud8.6	24	4	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:25.1	When the Buddha had expressed his appreciation to Sunidha and Vassakāra with these verses, he got up from his seat and left.	ud8.6	25	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:26.1	Sunidha and Vassakāra followed behind the Buddha, thinking,	ud8.6	26	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:26.2	“The gate through which the ascetic Gotama departs today shall be named the Gotama Gate.	ud8.6	26	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:26.3	The ford at which he crosses the Ganges River shall be named the Gotama Ford.”	ud8.6	26	3	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:27.1	Then the gate through which the Buddha departed was named the Gotama Gate.	ud8.6	27	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:27.2	Then the Buddha came to the Ganges River.	ud8.6	27	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:27.3	Now at that time the Ganges was full to the brim so a crow could drink from it.	ud8.6	27	3	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:27.4	Wanting to cross from the near to the far shore, some people were seeking a boat, some a dinghy, while some were tying up a raft.	ud8.6	27	4	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:27.5	But, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, the Buddha, together with the mendicant Saṅgha, vanished from the near shore and landed on the far shore.	ud8.6	27	5	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:28.1	He saw all those people wanting to cross over.	ud8.6	28	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:29.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud8.6	29	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:30.1	“Those who cross a deluge or stream	ud8.6	30	1	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:30.2	have built a bridge and left the marshes behind.	ud8.6	30	2	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:30.3	While some people are still tying a raft,	ud8.6	30	3	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.6:30.4	intelligent people have crossed over.”	ud8.6	30	4	ud	8.6	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village
ud8.7:1.1	So I have heard.	ud8.7	1	1	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was traveling along a road in the Kosalan lands with Venerable Nāgasamāla as his second monk.	ud8.7	1	2	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:1.3	Nāgasamāla saw a fork in the road	ud8.7	1	3	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:1.4	and said to the Buddha,	ud8.7	1	4	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:1.5	“Sir, this is the road,	ud8.7	1	5	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:1.6	let us go this way.”	ud8.7	1	6	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:1.7	But when he said this the Buddha responded,	ud8.7	1	7	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:1.8	“Nāgasamāla, this is the road,	ud8.7	1	8	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:1.9	let us go this way.”	ud8.7	1	9	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:2.1	For a second time,	ud8.7	2	1	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:2.2	and a  third time Nāgasamāla said to the Buddha,	ud8.7	2	2	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:2.3	“Sir, this is the road,	ud8.7	2	3	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:2.4	let us go this way.”	ud8.7	2	4	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:2.5	And for a third time the Buddha responded,	ud8.7	2	5	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:2.6	“Nāgasamāla, this is the road,	ud8.7	2	6	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:2.7	let us go this way.”	ud8.7	2	7	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:2.8	Then Nāgasamāla put the Buddha’s bowl and robes down on the ground right there and left, saying,	ud8.7	2	8	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:2.9	“Sir, here are your bowl and robes.”	ud8.7	2	9	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:3.1	Then as Nāgasamāla was going down that road, he was set upon by bandits who struck him with fists and feet, broke his bowl, and tore up his outer robe.	ud8.7	3	1	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:3.2	Then Nāgasamāla—with his bowl broken and his outer robe torn—went to the Buddha and told him what had happened.	ud8.7	3	2	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:4.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud8.7	4	1	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:5.1	“Walking together, dwelling as one,	ud8.7	5	1	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:5.2	the knowledge master mixes with foolish folk.	ud8.7	5	2	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:5.3	Knowing this, they give up wickedness,	ud8.7	5	3	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.7:5.4	like a milk-drinking heron the water.”	ud8.7	5	4	ud	8.7	A Fork in the Road
ud8.8:1.1	So I have heard.	ud8.8	1	1	ud	8.8	With Visākhā
ud8.8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.	ud8.8	1	2	ud	8.8	With Visākhā
ud8.8:1.3	Now at that time the dear and beloved granddaughter of Visākhā Migāra’s Mother had just passed away.	ud8.8	1	3	ud	8.8	With Visākhā
ud8.8:1.4	Then, in the middle of the day, Visākhā with wet clothes and hair went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.	ud8.8	1	4	ud	8.8	With Visākhā
ud8.8:1.5	The Buddha said to her,	ud8.8	1	5	ud	8.8	With Visākhā
ud8.8:2.1	“So, Visākhā, where are you coming from in the middle of the day with wet clothes and hair?”	ud8.8	2	1	ud	8.8	With Visākhā
ud8.8:2.2	“Sir, my beloved granddaughter has just passed away.	ud8.8	2	2	ud	8.8	With Visākhā
ud8.8:2.3	That’s why I came here in the middle of the day with wet clothes and hair.”	ud8.8	2	3	ud	8.8	With Visākhā
ud8.8:2.4	“Visākhā, would you like as many children and grandchildren as there are people in the whole of Sāvatthī?”	ud8.8	2	4	ud	8.8	With Visākhā
ud8.8:2.5	“I would, sir.”	ud8.8	2	5	ud	8.8	With Visākhā
ud8.8:3.1	“But Visākhā, how many people pass away each day in Sāvatthī?”	ud8.8	3	1	ud	8.8	With Visākhā
ud8.8:3.2	“Every day, sir, there are ten people passing away in Sāvatthī.	ud8.8	3	2	ud	8.8	With Visākhā

ud8.8:3.12	Sāvatthī is never without someone passing away.”	ud8.8	3	12	ud	8.8	With Visākhā
ud8.8:4.1	“What do you think, Visākhā? Would there ever be a time when your clothes and hair were not wet?”	ud8.8	4	1	ud	8.8	With Visākhā
ud8.8:4.2	“No, sir.	ud8.8	4	2	ud	8.8	With Visākhā

ud8.8:6.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud8.8	6	1	ud	8.8	With Visākhā
ud8.8:7.1	“All the sorrows and lamentations	ud8.8	7	1	ud	8.8	With Visākhā

ud8.9:1.1	So I have heard.	ud8.9	1	1	ud	8.9	With Dabba (1st)
ud8.9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	ud8.9	1	2	ud	8.9	With Dabba (1st)
ud8.9:1.3	Then Venerable Dabba the Mallian went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	ud8.9	1	3	ud	8.9	With Dabba (1st)
ud8.9:1.5	“Holy One, it is the time for my full extinguishment.”	ud8.9	1	5	ud	8.9	With Dabba (1st)
ud8.9:1.6	“Please, Dabba, do as you see fit.”	ud8.9	1	6	ud	8.9	With Dabba (1st)
ud8.9:2.1	Then Dabba rose from his seat, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he rose into the air and, sitting cross-legged in the sky, entered and withdrew from the fire element before becoming fully extinguished.	ud8.9	2	1	ud	8.9	With Dabba (1st)
ud8.9:3.1	Then when he became fully extinguished while sitting in the sky, his body burning and combusting left neither ashes nor soot to be found.	ud8.9	3	1	ud	8.9	With Dabba (1st)
ud8.9:3.2	It’s like when ghee or oil blaze and burn, and neither ashes nor soot are found.	ud8.9	3	2	ud	8.9	With Dabba (1st)
ud8.9:4.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	ud8.9	4	1	ud	8.9	With Dabba (1st)
